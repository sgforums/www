            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Trip organisers tell of parents who want hotel stays and easier tasks for their children<br></strong><br>By Serene Luo<br><br>MY CHILD is going overseas on a community service trip. Can he stay in a hotel? Is it going to be tough? What if he falls ill?<br><br>When Junior says he wants to go on a humanitarian trip overseas, the parents start worrying.<br><strong><br>Some call up the organisers of these trips to find out if their children can get creature comforts when they go to less developed countries to build schools, provide medical supplies or take part in public education efforts.<br></strong><br>Mr Zulkifli Baharudin, 44, the chairman of Mercy Relief, a humanitarian aid organisation, said <strong>parents had asked him whether he could find their children a trip that was comparatively 'more easy-going' or if they could pay more for their kids to stay in a hotel, instead of roughing it out.<br></strong><strong><br>In some cases, parents even asked to tag along with their children, </strong>said Mr Jackie Goh, 31, the chairman of Buona Vista Community Centre's Youth Group. He has organised many such trips to Cambodia, Nepal and the Maldives.<br><br>Added Mr Zulkifli: 'Sometimes, out of love, <strong>they are blinded to the fact that the point of these trips is to expose their children to these situations.'</strong><br><br>Indeed, schools and youth groups usually organise these trips to toughen up their students and to expose them to life in poverty-stricken countries, to teach them compassion.<br><br>So, did Acting Education Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam hit the nail on the head when he said recently that Singapore's young were becoming increasingly 'soft' and were not as 'hungry' as previous generations?<br><strong><br>'Actually, the kids are quite tough,' said Mr Zulkifli. 'It's their parents who make them into softies.'<br></strong><br>But some students who have gone on these humanitarian trips begged to differ.<br><strong><br>They told Gen Y that even without parental interference, the trips had their fair share of softies.<br></strong><br>Junior college student Bekky Lim, 17, went to a United Nations-protected island in the Maldives in March on a school-organised trip to help build a community hall.<br><br>She said her group had two distinct camps: the ones who worked very hard and the ones who were there 'more for fun'.<br><strong><br>'We only managed to finish building the hall because those willing to work hard had to work to the max, to make up for those who weren't doing their fair share,' she said.<br></strong><br>'I felt so bad, because the locals were contributing their own food to make up our dinner, yet some of us weren't working hard.'<br><br>While the hardworking students would drag a bag of cement powder each from the store to the site, some laggards would do it in pairs, and 'take their own sweet time and play while doing it', she added.<br><br>She said she did not want to leave at the end of her stay because she liked the simple lifestyle, but many of the participants <strong>could not wait to get back to their 'comfortable beds and good food in Singapore'.</strong><br><br>Mr Goh, who was on the same trip, described the reaction of a group of students when it became apparent that they would be eating fish curry for breakfast, lunch and dinner for the next 10 days.<br><strong><br>He said one teenage boy would grimly eat his curry at meal-times, while fat tears rolled down his cheeks because 'he felt he was suffering'.</strong><br><br>The group leaders try to bring along some chocolates or instant noodles for times like these, to comfort their charges.<br><br>But those who had put effort into the trips said they emerged tougher and they also came to appreciate Singapore more than before.<br><br>Vellachi Alarmelu Ganesan, 19, who has just finished her A levels, said her parents were glad she went to Vietnam two years ago to help build a kindergarten and toilets there. The trip was organised by her school - Temasek Junior College - and the Singapore International Foundation.<br><br>There was no electricity or running water in the 'primitive environment', she said, and she was quite shocked when she first arrived.<br><br>The group built a toilet for the village, but had to use a makeshift one in the beginning. She said: 'At first, I was a bit squeamish and uncomfortable, but you eventually overcome your fears mentally and physically.<br><br>'Had it not been for this trip, I think I might have been Mr Tharman's stereotype!'<br><br>--ST<br><br>[/quote]<br><br>parents....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> if i ever have kids i will kill myself if i become like one of them.<br><br>so glad there is ns for boys - at least they have to rough it out then. else i cannot imagine what will become of these kids. singapore will become a country of softies ruled by gu niangs.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div>
