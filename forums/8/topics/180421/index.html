            <div class='col-md body'>I actually worked in swensen's for a few days only. See, even the workers there are very bad towards me.<br><br>I cannot explain why the food are served late.<br><br>The fact that no one wants to refill maybe because the workers don't dare to. I've been in that situation before when I just don't dare to fill up other's empty cup. I feel so stupid to do that! Haha..<br><br>But guys, don't worry - just do the survey form that is attached to the triangular thing on your table and just state what's not good. Make sure u write exclaimation marks - alot and big! haha..<br><br>U can also complain to the managers - they usually wear white or black shirts.</div>

Me just stood up and brought my fiancee out of the restaurant without paying. The restaurant manager went after me and insisting me to pay even me didn't consume my food. Me told him on the horror views and what happened to my food in the preparation process in a rather loud manner that other customers in the restaurant overheard and dropped their utensils, looking at their food with doubts. The manager in embarrassment went to check on our claims and when he returned after checking, he was very apologetic and waived off our bill.</div></blockquote>ok bro for ur first scenario, why the malay couples were served before you is becuz they made their reservations via phone call. you might see the empty tables but they are actually reserved by those who booked thru phone. one thing not good is that swensens dun implement by putting a reserved sign at the tables. this is their fault. as for the reason given that they didnt see you. its lame i admit but maybe cuz it was peak period and everyone was busy so tend to make mistakes but maybe the manager really didnt see you. i do too. if you were in their shoe you will know. no need get so upset over this.<br><br>as for ur second scenario.. i nothing to say. you shld write and complain.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>after reading this post, i have to admit, i'd have to keep my eyes open when visiting swensen's again. I always thought the service there is okay. there was a time i went out with a few friends, one of whom had a celebrity girlfriend, we were seated promptly and the manager served us personally, which i thought was a nice gesture. forgot which branch it was, somewhere near chinatown. so all along i thought the restaurant was quite respectable.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok there's only one staff working at 'the fountain' the place where all the ice creams order are made. imagine one person having to make all the table orders. one thing i dun understand about swensens is why they hire so little staff inside one outlet. and when people on leave they will short of staff and problems eventually occurs. i've seen this many times.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>at the rate this is going. i think swensens reputation is going down. whic i dun wana see  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
