            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br>usually the reservation book is located at the entrance. depends if the outlet is packed cashier see customers at entrance will tell the person on duty. normally at swensens the outlet is divided into station A and station B, those in charge of station A cannot interfere in station B unless the outlet has very little customers. so sometimes u might see some CSR that notice you at the entrance but can't do anything becuz they belong to the other station. i find this quite lame though. so normally its either the manager on duty, assistant manager or higher rank staffs "those with walkie-talkie" that do the serving and ushering of customers into the outlet.<br></blockquote>I've been working Swensens for almost coming to 2yrs++.

CSR themselves also must know how to handle their work area well at the same time looking after their customers.<br><br>Each outlet have their own kind of management and service team.

Common perception is the answer.<br><br>If Swensens can't uphold a minimum level of standard, it's really pathetic and needless to say, it's going to bring and court its own doom.<br><br>Every business requires the very fundamental of rule, revenue. If revenue drops and dips within a measure of 18-months, and yet no improvement, it's heading to a very bad state known as business recession. Inevitably, restructuring and reorganiztion of business will be needed to shape things up and make the book looks nice.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's no point singling out Swensens's for poor service.<br><br>Sometimes, i feel the F and B industry should remove the 10% service charge as there is almost zero service in most restuarants and western food joints which charge this to the consumer's bill.<br><br>It's ridiculous when you pay for a service that is non-existent. The system should revert back to the tipping model where tips go directly into the waiter's pocket, as reward for a job well done. That inspires people to serve BETTER.<br><br>Having a compulsory 10% service charge leads to blatant complacency. It just like the ridiculous compulsory tipping law in Hong Kong.</div>
