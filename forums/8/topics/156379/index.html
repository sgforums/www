            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore markets education services in India<br>By Channel NewsAsia's India Correspondent Vaibhav Varma<br><br>SINGAPORE : Singapore is marketing its education services in India in a big way, eyeing the large number of Indian students eager to study abroad.<br><br>Singapore as an education hub that caters to students from all over the world -- that is the message behind the two-week Singapore Education Fair in India.<br><br>With growing numbers of Indian students eager to study overseas, it is a big market to be tapped.<br><br>Said Siew-Kheng Kang, director (international relations) at the Singapore Tourism Board, "We see that the numbers for instance for '06 and '07 -- there's something like 160,000 Indian students looking to go overseas. We think we can offer something that they would find very attractive in Singapore."<br><br>STB held the event together with 18 institutions, among them the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University.<br><br>Besides the capital New Delhi, the roadshow also travelled to Chennai, Bangalore, Mumbai and Ahmedabad.<br><br>Said Bridget Goh, area director (South India) at STB, "When we promote 'World Class Education is Closer Than You Think' in the Indian market, we are actually telling the students that they could actually receive a brand name university education, say for example INSIA, where they don't have to fly all the way to Europe, they could just have it in Singapore."<br><br>Career counselling was a popular feature of the fair, which attracted more than 20,000 people at each venue.<br><br>Joint promotion of education is part of the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement signed between the two governments.<br><br>Said Ravi S Sharma, director (India strategy) at NTU, "Whereas for over 10 years we have been interested in India, I think the critical mass has taken time to build. Today for sure that critical mass is there and is substantial. So I suppose from both sides we were waiting for this time, and that time has come."<br><br>Apart from tertiary courses, the fair also introduced Singapore as an ideal choice for primary and secondary education.<br><br>In just the last two years, the number of Singaporean educational institutions calling on India has doubled and that is set to rise further.<br><br>There have been a number of new initiatives between India and Singapore in the political and business arenas, and strengthening of the educational bridge is a happy outcome. - CNA /ct</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the government has done a great job over the years with improvement in our education system. They have tried many bold things some have gone well (eg compulsory education, use of english as a common language etc), while others have not (compulsory SATs, over emphasis on school ranking).<br><br>I do hope that their scheme of encourging more foriegn nationals to come here to study will eventually, in the long run, turn out to be positive. It has already been a very long project (10years) and we do see an evident influx of foriegn national students. Lets just hope they are right and this will turn out to become, more jobs for us singaporeans, a high standard of living, more pay in our pockets, and a more diverse and more interesting culture here in singapore.<br><br>Though in the short term we might have to put up with some problems and complains, lets hope that the final outcome will be sweet.<br><br>But if they are wrong,.... oh well,.... we did elect our gorment didn't we.<br><br></div>

They, with those same grades, can get into a UK university or Australian university, if their parents are rich enough to afford it. If there were no FTs in singaporean universities, I'm sure they will have a higher chance to get into a uni here with their grades.<br><br>Recently a newspaper article also mentioned that some courses here in singapore are more than 50% made up of FT. Just make a trip down to the Science Canteen at NUS, you can see so many FTs here. Thats a living fact. The Science Computer science and Engineering departments are loaded with FTs.

We think we can offer something that they would find very attractive in Singapore."<br><br>STB held the event together with 18 institutions, among them the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University.<br><br>Besides the capital New Delhi, the roadshow also travelled to Chennai, Bangalore, Mumbai and Ahmedabad.<br><br>Said Bridget Goh, area director (South India) at STB, "When we promote 'World Class Education is Closer Than You Think' in the Indian market, we are actually telling the students that they could actually receive a brand name university education, say for example INSIA, where they don't have to fly all the way to Europe, they could just have it in Singapore."<br><br>Career counselling was a popular feature of the fair, which attracted more than 20,000 people at each venue.<br><br>Joint promotion of education is part of the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement signed between the two governments.<br><br>Said Ravi S Sharma, director (India strategy) at NTU, "Whereas for over 10 years we have been interested in India, I think the critical mass has taken time to build. Today for sure that critical mass is there and is substantial. So I suppose from both sides we were waiting for this time, and that time has come."<br><br>Apart from tertiary courses, the fair also introduced Singapore as an ideal choice for primary and secondary education.<br><br>In just the last two years, the number of Singaporean educational institutions calling on India has doubled and that is set to rise further.<br><br>There have been a number of new initiatives between India and Singapore in the political and business arenas, and strengthening of the educational bridge is a happy outcome. - CNA /ct</div></blockquote>its the return of the munnabhai aka sexieststudintheworld aka rahmania <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
