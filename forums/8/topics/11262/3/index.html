            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by moose:<br><strong> Why not?It's better to pay someone highly to prevent corruption than just pay a normal salary when that person holds a lot of power.I find your phrase about bribing ministers so they will not be bribed amusing.Kinda reminds me how the SAF is bribing me so i will work for them,ahaha   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></strong></blockquote><br><br>SAF bribing you? I find your statement even amusing. Comparing SAF pay with ministers pay? Please use a proper comparison next time. SAF bribe you so that you will work for them? LOL! My statement stands because there are only 92 of them in the parliament and how many SAF regulars are there? Those 92 represent each and every citizen of Singapore. The damage could possibly be done by a minister and a single SAF personnel is a huge difference. If one wants to be a minister, it should be a truely serving the people's ideal and not treat that as a job. You treat your life in SAF as a work, not serving the country. Tell me how should you compare that?<br><br>Secondly, you never pay attention to my words. LKY himself stated that high payment for the minister is that so they won't be bribed and also lured to private sectors. Did SAF said they pay you more so that you won't be bribed? Private sectors maybe but bribed? Hmmmm, senses? Damn, you're irritating me with nonsensical comparison.<br><br>Is a minister's job not to serve his/her people? Compare it with SAF which is more of a job to most people than serving the people? Come on, you can do better I suppose.<br><br>If you cannot understand that greed is unlimited then I see no point in going on this issue. Furthermore, with someone who serve just for the pay and not with the true heart to serve, why should he/she serve the nation then? Given the situation where the salary is more than enough for him to live in a private estate, own his own car and have enough to spend like 20K SGD a month rather than 83K USD a month.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>But if corruption is present in the government?How come the citizens are not suffering hardships or our economy is suffering?The effects of corruption are all too ready to be seen in places like Taiwan,China.How come we don't see the effects in Singapore?Can a corrupt government and a booming economy exist together or are they mutually exclusive?<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>Ever hear of corruption at the higher level and not at the middle and lower level? if you wish to compare corruption with Taiwan and China. It is different. Get to know some rich influential people and if you are close to them, you will know about the loopholes within Singapore.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>The media is muted to a certain extent,but not until it totally listens and follows what the government says 100%.The other alternative is a media that reports fearlessly and carelessly on issues just to make a profit and maybe stire up some racial or social issues.After all,the media is ultimately a business and profits are the bottom line.</strong></blockquote><br><br>For the last 33 years, is media not tightly controlled by the Government? David Marshall returned in 1995 and commented that the media now is so tightly controlled now that it is worse than during the imperial British era, merely a propangada of the PAP. If need be, I will find the exact quote if you do think I am BSing.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>No one know whether the ministers are corrupt or not.Only time will tell.With a credible opposition like UK,US.You will have politicians doing petty politicking for htier respective parties instead of doing things for the people.Take a look at US and UK politics,ehehe   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></strong></blockquote><br><br>I know not much of U.K politics but dare you say U.S politicians are not at all doing anything for their citizens? Care to show some examples of petty  "politicking" in U.S?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Regarding the HPL case,could it be possible GreenNet has a vested interest in talking about LKY and his family?Also,some comments could be based on just rumors.Example is the 1 regarding Ong Beng Seng being forced by LKY to call a press conference.Also,further proof in the form of witnesses and concrete evidence is needed,not just the words of a few people,heehe   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></strong></blockquote><br><br>Answer these questions then. Why were they given the discounts? Why did his brother quit HPL quietly? This issue was mentioned and known, not just rumour. Why was this quietly settled down? Why did the media not focus and check into it? These are facts.<br>The breach of the ruling was known. So go figure.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I do agree with you about people in their 40s or 50s who are retrenched and have a family to support.They could do with more help,but what of those in their 20s or 30s?Shouldn't they help themselves as they are not in as dire straits as those in the 40 to 50 age group?<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>Consider the amount of 40s-50s retrench compared to the number retrenched for those aged 20s-30s? Most of the industries retrench their oldest workers mostly. Anyway I don't get your point. My statement shows that those in the 45-55 age group would need the help as I have stated their situation. It is obvious those in the 20s-30s could help themselves as compare to those of the older age group.<br><br><blockquote><br>So now they should strive to be the best,but not strive to be perfect as you mentioned earlier.So i take it you changed your POV of what the governemnt should strive to be,best,but not perfect?<br>In the Webster's Revised Unabridged dictionary,best is defined as "Having good qualities in the highest degree; most good, kind, desirable, suitable, etc.; most excellent; as, the best man; the best road; the best cloth; the best abilities."<br>while perfect is defined as ". Brought to consummation or completeness; completed; not defective nor redundant; having all the properties or qualities requisite to its nature and kind; without flaw, fault, or blemish; without error; mature; whole; pure; sound; right; correct.<br>".So i guess best does not equate to perfect,ehehe   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>[/B]</blockquote>I guess I used  wrong word then. To me perfect is the best. My point of view still stand. For me, my usage of the word best and perfect makes no difference in this case. That ends this issue on English words as this is not a English lesson. However, don't assume, thank you.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok lah,maybe a comparison between a minister and a doctor is more apt.Both are supposed to serve the people and both get paid.So should doctors get high pay or should they draw a normal pay of the working class which could be between 2k to 3k.<br><br>Greed is unlimited,that is true.But in a situtation where a minister get ,example 50k per month.And someone offers him $5000 for favors.Will he do it?If the minister takes the offer and is caught,he get to lose his 50k and get dishonoured.While if a minister draw about 10k and someone offers him $5000,half of his monthly salary,will he take the risk as he only stands to lose 10k and get dishonoured.Besides the pay is pegged to the pay scale of a top few in the private sector to avoid losing people to the pte sector.Sadly,money is an important factor in attracting people to a job,including politics.I don't think the sudden increase in trainee teachers who teach our next generation is becos of ideals and aspirations.But more of the pay increase.It's a fact of life,ehehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote><br>Ever hear of corruption at the higher level and not at the middle and lower level? if you wish to compare corruption with Taiwan and China.
