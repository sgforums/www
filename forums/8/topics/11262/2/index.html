No. Why would it become a deterrent for terrorist should there be any in Singapore?<br></blockquote>Back then,they had the backing of communist China of which our still largely chinese majority had some feelings for,so they could count on this feeling of the masses to not fear the ISA.Not to mention that China was riding high that time on her propaganda and that communist Indonesia and the MCP(Malayan Communist Party) is still active,with such backers around,they have no need to be scared.Now times have changed,the backers of terrorists group are not in some far off country and if the ISA is used on them,even the response of the terrorist group is useless as they are known to be a terrorist group condemned by many nations.Last time,the communist controlled the 2 largest nations of China and Russia,but not now<br><br><blockquote><br>You said, it prevents people from spewing nonsense. How does it prevents? If a person wants to spew racial affairs publicly, can the ISA know ahead of time? If they do spew racial affair, that person is still subjected to laws, and henceforth can be arrested, is there a need for ISA in your current notion?<br></blockquote>The ISA cannot know ahead of time,but they can act promptly through their intelligence network to control people from doing further harm.But the act can be used to deter people from attempting such feats as it's widely known what the ISA can do to you,so it's more of a deterrent factor<br><br><blockquote><br>The bigger picture as you had talked about, the ISA can go further.<br><br>With the ISA, many people dare not join opposition, neither do they dare to speak against the PAP publicly for fear of this law. It is a fear already created in many potential opposition members. This is choking the opposition of lesser members.<br></blockquote>Wen you speak publicly against someone or a party,you must have the hard evidence to back you up,not some hearsay you heard from colleagues or taxi drivers.Many people dare not join opposition?I think that many people don't even wanna join politics,be it opposition or PAP,so it's a problem not only faced by the opposition.If opposition members are scared of the ISA,they will not join.Only those who have the guts will join,so it is good in a way that it prevents people of lesser capability from joining the opposition,no?<br><br><blockquote><br>With lesser opposition in the parliament to check on PAP power, does it means PAP is able to do whatever they want? Without check and balance, does it ensure a better fairer government?<br></blockquote>Then maybe we will have a system with 2 ruling parties like UK,USA etc etc where a bill can take a long time to pass due to the vested interests of the 2 ruling parties.I would rather have a dominant party where bills get passed quickly rather than it ping pong back and forth for years.Everyone makes mistakes,politicians are humans,not gods<br><br><blockquote><br>Further more on going on the bigger picture,<br>many GLOBAL human rights association have called for Singapore and Malaysia Government to abolish the ISA.<br></blockquote>GLOBAL human rights association from which country?UK?USA?They have a long history and their values systems are different from ours.They have fought wars over humans rights in their own countries and therefore,their version of human rights does not necessarily automatically translate in our version as our values systems are different.So they do not really understand our values system and universally think that theirs is right when in actual fact,different values system breed different version of human rights<br><br></strong><blockquote><strong><br>Without the ISA as I have said before, it does not makes it that the police is unable to arrest potential trouble makers but at least fairness is ensured within the process as a [b]fair</strong> trial is granted.<br></blockquote>As i have implied,the ISA is a deterrent factor which is needed in Singapore just like a nuclear bomb is need to deter would be attackers<br><br><blockquote><br>Lastly, you said you think the abuses commited in the ISD is very little, that is an assumption.

No news of ministers being corrupted does not means there are no corruption neither does that means there are no cover ups.<br><br>Retrench workers. Yes upgrade them. That's good and at the expense of the workers themselves. When they are not working, not receiving a salary, have a family to support and the upgrading will be at the expense on themselves. How is that justified?<br><br>Secondly, you have to understand that most of the retrench workers are at age 45 to 55. At the age of 45, if they do not have an appropriate amount of saving, where do you expect them to find the money to upgrade, to support their family and for the least amount of period that is 6 months? Most of them cannot draw from the CPF so should the Government not offer assistance?<br><br>Furthermore, even with new skills does not exactly mean you will get a job, ESPECIALLY for the age group of 45-55 when they just got retrench.<br><br>I am sorry to tell you I don't have the time to type another essay nor research on for a better Government at the moment for there will be so many issues to go upon. Example? I already told you there a Government cannot be perfect so do you not understand? So why ask me example of a perfect Government? But it should strive to be as best it could for her citizens, making policies that will be truely good for each and every citizens etc etc.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>In another word, we bribe our ministers so they will not be bribe, is this not justified?<br></blockquote>Why not?It's better to pay someone highly to prevent corruption than just pay a normal salary when that person holds a lot of power.I find your phrase about bribing ministers so they will not be bribed amusing.Kinda reminds me how the SAF is bribing me so i will work for them,ahaha  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>But if corruption is present in the government?How come the citizens are not suffering hardships or our economy is suffering?The effects of corruption are all too ready to be seen in places like Taiwan,China.How come we don't see the effects in Singapore?Can a corrupt government and a booming economy exist together or are they mutually exclusive?<br><br><blockquote><br>Is the media not controlled by the Government? Dare to say no?<br></blockquote>The media is muted to a certain extent,but not until it totally listens and follows what the government says 100%.The other alternative is a media that reports fearlessly and carelessly on issues just to make a profit and maybe stire up some racial or social issues.After all,the media is ultimately a business and profits are the bottom line.<br><br><blockquote><br>Lastly, answer me that if a single ruling party Government with little opposition, can transparency be justified? With a obviously controlled media, how far can transparency go? These are my doubts but I have never said the ministers are corrupted. I put a question mark to it.<br></blockquote>No one know whether the ministers are corrupt or not.Only time will tell.With a credible opposition like UK,US.You will have politicians doing petty politicking for htier respective parties instead of doing things for the people.Take a look at US and UK politics,ehehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Regarding the HPL case,could it be possible GreenNet has a vested interest in talking about LKY and his family?Also,some comments could be based on just rumors.Example is the 1 regarding Ong Beng Seng being forced by LKY to call a press conference.Also,further proof in the form of witnesses and concrete evidence is needed,not just the words of a few people,heehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I do agree with you about people in their 40s or 50s who are retrenched and have a family to support.They could do with more help,but what of those in their 20s or 30s?Shouldn't they help themselves as they are not in as dire straits as those in the 40 to 50 age group?<br><br><blockquote><br>Criticizing my Government does not make me less of a Singaporean. A Government cannot be perfect but it should strive to, as a citizen, I see a need in pointing out the issues that has not been handled properly by our Government.<br></blockquote>So now they should strive to be the best,but not strive to be perfect as you mentioned earlier.So i take it you changed your POV of what the governemnt should strive to be,best,but not perfect?<br>In the Webster's Revised Unabridged dictionary,best is defined as "Having good qualities in the highest degree; most good, kind, desirable, suitable, etc.; most excellent; as, the best man; the best road; the best cloth; the best abilities."<br>while perfect is defined as ". Brought to consummation or completeness; completed; not defective nor redundant; having all the properties or qualities requisite to its nature and kind; without flaw, fault, or blemish; without error; mature; whole; pure; sound; right; correct.<br>".So i guess best does not equate to perfect,ehehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Theory Of Relativity<br>Eating a lot of good food will make 1 hour seem like 5 minutes while eating lotsa horrigible cooked veggies will make 5 minutes seem like 1 hour <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">~~~<br>Waiting for Diablo 2 Add-on <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is a realistic world where you must pay someone to do a job.Would you do a job for free?I won't do it.So what's the difference between a job as a minister and a normal everyday job?hehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Theory Of Relativity<br>Eating a lot of good food will make 1 hour seem like 5 minutes while eating lotsa horrigible cooked veggies will make 5 minutes seem like 1 hour <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">~~~<br>Waiting for Diablo 2 Add-on <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
