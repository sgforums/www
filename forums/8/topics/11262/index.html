Justice? Even the QC from London saw the injustice. Why was the privy council, used to be Singapore's highest court of appeal based in London, disbanded? A court which at all is not under the control of any party, must it be disbanded?<br><br>Secondly, Communist deserve to be jailed, sure but who told you Chia Thye Poh is a communist? National education? History books written by Pro-PAPs? Or LKY's book? Please see <a href="http://www.gn.apc.org/sfd/" rel="nofollow">www.gn.apc.org/sfd/</a>  to at least have a different source of information. Most of the books on politics in Singapore you can ever find are all biased towards PAP. Just because PAP says something, it does not mean it is true.<br><br>David Marshall when he came back in 1995 if my memory serves me well enough, he commented that the presses here now is even pro-government and controlled tightly by the PAP that it is just the propaganda machine for them. I'll find the exact quote =)<br><br>Thirdly, even foreigners who work in Singapore could feel the 'justice' within Singapore's political stage but they couldn't care less afterall they're only here for the money. This is not hear say but infact I asked many of the foreign friends whom I know is working here. Infact, many have been around for more than 2 years and some to the extend of 10.<br><br>Studying Law alone does not makes you have more common sense than any others. If 10 sane person in Singapore is not even equal to a judge who study law for 30 years, it is still shown, everyone is equal, just some are more equal.<br><br>Again to ISA, whether communist or not, there is still need for a trial. Yes, indeed the ISA might not have been used against anyone you know, but if used, it will be used on Singaporeans, and look, we're all Singaporeans, whether or not, can you accept the fact that your fellow countrymen is being send to jail for no reason? No trial to prove whether guilty or not. Fair? Justice? It makes sense to have something unfair to stay on? Maybe in those days where communist are abound, but look, today. Communist? Oppositions maybe, but not communist. The ISA is still there for a reason, yes indeed it is, to keep opposition low and down.<br></div>

Have I stated civilised country does at all not covertly arrest any potential criminals? Learn not to force your own assumption on what others have not said. Don't sterotype by assuming what you think is what other think. Think before you type. Don't teach me about not to forcing my views on others, I have not. I just stated my points to support my stance. Show me how I have force my views on others. Please SHOW ME! If not, you are just assuming and accusing me.<br><br>Secondly, this is a discussion, not a personal matter. Why drag myself into this case? I can choose to believe what I like and I have the freedom to express my thought.<br><br>Again, show some manner. It is not something gracious to put your own thoughts into what others have not said.<br><br>Lastly, I know who I should vote, thank you for reminding though.<br><br>Infact, I am rather angry that I am being pictured for being naive for things I have not said, and this is getting personal Mr bear, do you not think so?
