There is a limit to how much each individual of us can earn a month if we are drawing a salary from a job (which most of us are). Therefore, it make sense for us to protect ourselves as the single unit of production of income against death, or worse disability through insurance. Savings account interest rate is pathetic now at the rate of 0.25% P.A in my bank and thus we be losing out to inflation every year if we do not at least invest to beat inflation rate which stands around 2%-2.5% a year. Therefore, I feel that we should invest wisely and take calculated risk to enhance our wealth. As a rule of thumb, younger people should consider taking more risk than older people as time is on their side and they probably have less committment weighing on them. There are a lot of ways to do this but the worse thing is to sit around and let ourselves be consumed by rising taxes, GST and such without doing anything at all.<br><br>Do talk to your advisers or bankers. They will be able to help you plan your needs carefully. Many people have little money for retirement because they did not plan well enough when they were young and at the peak of their earning power.<br><br></div>

The $240,000 coverage is guaranteed. I did not include the non-guaranteed part. I am supurised that you actually mentioned that you would not talk to "tied" agent or bankers. That would effectively mean everyone in the financial industry. While it is definitely true that there are some unethical agents or even bankers in the market, many in fact give true and sincere advice. This will go a long way in helping individual in their personal financal planning. I myself am a "tied" banker as defined by you. However, i pride myself for giving only needs-based<br>analysis and advice to individual customer that comes into my bank. I do promote struture deposit as well as mentioned above but all these products do actually help to enhance risk-adverse people's wealth. Maybe you had some bad experience with such "tied"agents but it is not fair to brand us all the same. This is my personal opinion.</div>

For a guy 30 years old, smoker, the mortality charge is coming to 40 bucks a month for a coverage of $100000. U can get a term plan, which provide huge coverage with low premiums. Downside is there will be no returns from this policy.</div>

Some of the ILP, 100% of the premiums will go into investments from year 1.<br><br>As for life polices, no harm getting more if you well afford it. It is in way a long term saving too. Most whole life polices, the break even year is around 20th. If you keep a policy longer, the more cash value it will accumlate.If you keep a whole life policy for 30 years and by that time u are ard 60 of age, you can surrender the policy and take the cash.</div>
