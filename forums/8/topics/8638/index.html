            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I write this letter because I wish to WARN all of you about shopping for furnitures at NOVENA Furnishings. I have a very terrible experience... On 23 April 2000, I have ordered a dining set for a total<br>of S$914.64 from NOVENA Furnishings, a delivery of the items were supposed to be made on Saturday, 24 June 2000. However, on Friday, 23 June 2000, one of their staffs, from the Logistic Department called to inform me that no stock was available for the chairs and that I have to wait for another month. On Friday, 21 July 2000, NOVENA called again to inform me that the stocks had arrived and we arranged for the delivery to be sent to my new flat on Saturday, 29 July 2000. NOVENA<br>had also informed me that they would call me again on Friday, 28 July 2000, a day before delivery, to confirm the actual time of delivery. However, on Friday, 28 July 2000, I failed to receive any                    confirmation call from NOVENA and therefore, I decided to take the initiative to call NOVENA at 763-3233 at 4.30pm where I was transferred to a lady (again I guess from the Logistic Department) who received my call. She told me that the delivery schedule was still not ready and that they would call me<br>again as soon as it was done. I had waited until Saturday morning, 29 July 2000 at about 10am and there was still no confirmation call from NOVENA about the delivery. I telephoned NOVENA on Saturday, 29 July 2000 at about 10.30am and was informed that there was actually no stock! Should not somebody from NOVENA at least have the courtesy to inform me about it? And why was it that they had told me earlier on Friday, 21 July 2000 that the stocks had arrived and that they are going to deliver it to me? As I could not wait any longer for the dining set and was not entirely happy with the services I get from NOVENA, I had wanted to cancel my order. I had also asked for a full refund of my<br>S$414.64 deposit that I had already paid earlier upon making the order on 23 April 2000. NOVENA had told me that it could be done but I insisted on speaking to a staff at managerial level. This is where I was referred to the Showroom Manager since it was a Saturday and that he was the most senior<br>person. After he had listened to my explanation, the Showroom Manager had also agreed that it could be done and that I would be able to get back the full refund of my deposit. He said that he would get it        done the following Monday, 31 July 2000 and that he would call me back again on Monday as soon as it is done. However, I waited until Friday, 4 August 2000 at about 3pm and again I did not receive any call from the Showroom Manager. I called him at around 3.30pm and to my frustration, I realised that nothing was done at all. He gave the excuse that he was on course that week! This was where I told<br>him that at least he could have delegated the task to somebody else to do. This was when he lost his patience and became very rude to me. After going through a lot of effort, I finally got to speak to the General Manager. After listening to my explanation, the GM accepted my request and again gave me<br>the assurance that he would personally get the Admin/Finance Department to have the cheque prepared and sent to my home address. However, on Friday, 12 August 2000 at around 4.30pm, I was exasperated to receive another telephone call from NOVENA telling me that they are going to deliver the dining set to me although I thought I have already cancelled the order and that the GM has agreed! Upon calling NOVENA head office, I was shocked to learn that the GM has actually left the company and that no instruction was passed down to any of his staffs regarding my full refund. I was referred to their Operation Manager this time round. He had told me that he needs to investigate the matter and that he needs to check with the Showroom Manager first on the following Monday, 14 August 2000!!! I wish to inform all of you know that I am extremely unhappy over the entire matter and that I have been<br>made to wait again and again despite the fact that I have told the Operation Manager that his ex-GM had already accepted the return of my deposit. Till now, I have not received my refund and I am thinking of seeking legal action against NOVENA Furnishings. So if you do not wish to shop at NOVENA Furnishings, please THINK TWICE... Yours sincerely, Dr. K C Tan (PS: According to a member of my<br>family, someone had actually telephoned for me and made a very vulgar verbal threat and abuse in Hokkien on the night of Friday, 4 August 2000. I have no proof as to who had actually made that obscene phone call but it was certainly such a co-incidence. This has never happened to me before in my entire life.)</div>
