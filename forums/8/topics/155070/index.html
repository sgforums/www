            <div class='col-md body'>A complain letter from me to sony ericsson. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br><blockquote>Is k750i a 5-second phone?<br><br>Someone named Kevin Poh, who claimed to be the manager of Wisma Sony Ericsson service center told me this valueable piece of information during my visit on Tuesday, 27th of September 2005's afternoon.<br><br>I was there on my friend's behalf to find a solution for his k750i's insensitive joystick and asked to spoke to the manager of the service center directly to resolve the problem immediately.<br><br>The counter lady left and went into the room for about 5 minutes and return to say that the phone was functioning okay and if I want, I can sent the phone in for "monitoring". I told her that what she had said was not acceptable as the phone was less than 1 month old and it had been send previously into the service center for 2 times. I also questioned her which part of my request to speak to the manager was too difficult to understand.<br><br>She then left the counter and asked for help. Instead of a lady, as I heard that the manager of the service center is Rebecca, a guy came to me and claimed to be the manager of the service center.<br><br>He demostrated what a dummy I was through demostrating how to use the faulty joystick and told me about the 5 second rule which I never heard of. I was clearly humiliated by him demostrating the use of the faulty joystick and damaging the the joystick furthermore by applying unnecessary force on it.<br><br>Who in the world will apply force on the joystick and hold it there for 5 second before the function activate? Who would actually buy such a phone with today's technology?<br><br>Instead of calming an already fuming man with a faulty phone in the service center, Kevin insisted to make me felt like a fool and add fuel to my already burning anger.<br><br>I asked for the HQ contact and address and left with Kevin's guarantee that the phone was not faulty at all.<br><br>The problem was later resolved by the HQ and Wisma Sony Ericsson real Manager Rebecca on that day. Kevin Poh was the one who verify the problem and sent the phone in for replacement that day. It seems to me that Kevin is having problem on verifying problems on handset, let along resolving unhappiness in your service center.<br><br>That morning, he said that the handset was not faulty at all but that night, he verify the faulty joystick and sent it in for replacement.<br><br>My question is; do your customers always have to kick up a fuss to get things done in your service center?<br><br>The first time, when my friendÂ’s phone was sent in on 13th of September, he was promised collection on 17th afternoon just in case it was not a software problem but the circuit board failure. On the 16th, someone called and inform that there will be an unconfirmed collection delay as it was a circuit board failure and they need time to order.<br><br>After pondering about the matter, we called your call center several times and requested wisma to call us back to verify the matter. We waited for their reply throughout the day and no one answer the numerous alerts that the call center had sent.<br><br>We find it weird as they promised collection whether it was due to software problem or the board failure and yet they called to say it was delay since they need to order the board.<br><br>In the end, we had to go down to the service center to make a scene to resolve the problem. Then, they fixed the phone in half an hour timeÂ…<br><br>After a few days, the phone was sent in again for faulty joystick problem and was collected on the same day.<br><br>My question is why Sony Ericsson service center delivered empty promises, insisted that the phone was okay when it was faulty, humiliate customers by demonstrating what phone idiots they are, creating bigger problems instead of resolving them when they are small, deceive customers and welcome the customers to challenge them?<br><br>What I learnt from these experiences is that one should never buy a Sony Ericsson product without first having the intention to throw it away and get a new one when it turns faulty; Sony Ericsson created the first 5-second joystick phone in the recent years which beats every mobile phone companies even dated 10 years ago when you do not need to hold 5 second on the buttons to make a call; anyone in the service center can address themselves as manager to chase people away; the managers are always engaged, in meetings, not around or off whenever you call the call center no matter what time you call in and the alerts sent by the call center are like letters thrown into the trash, no one bothers to reply them.<br><br>Lucky for me, I am not a Sony Ericsson mobile phone user. God Bless those who still are.</blockquote></div>

He asked whether they receive that fax...<br><br>The counter lady just smile and knot her head and told him that he could collect the phone the next day... and she is telling my friend but not his colleague who own the phone...<br><br>Think that good service will be rendered during this short period...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Still await SE to officially reply me on this matter.</blockquote>ahahahha SE tio pawned.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Diff phone for diff ppl lah... If u want real big, get the public phone</strong><br><br>I do not mean that big. What I meant is reasonable keypad size for normal hands mah. I own a Samsung E700A and Nokia 6610 before and their keypad size are much bigger but not to the extent of making the phone as big as a public phone.<br><br>I do comparison based on the phones I have used before and make such a conclusion. Your fingers skill maybe better than mine I guess  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
