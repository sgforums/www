            <div class='col-md body'>inema technology crosses into the digital threshold with P.C. Sreeram's 'Vaanam Vasappadum'. It has the distinction of being the first full-length digital film to be made in India.<br><br>Produced by Arun Veerap-pan and Paul Pandian, it will be made under the R.K. Film and Digital Movie Makers banner.<br><br>This path-breaking high-definition digital film is the first of its kind in India and will be filmed, processed and projected digitally. Speaking of digital cinema, P.C. Sreeram, director and ace cinematographer, said, "It is a very effective medium. It is a tool that helps a cinematographer's artistry. Like all other technological advancements in cinema its effectiveness depends on how well it is used."<br><br>Mani Ratnam, one of the most respected directors in India today, saw footage shot with the digital camera and said, "It's there. It's close to the effect we can achieve on film."<br><br>Briefly, digital cinema is a film-less, digital distribution and exhibition system for feature films. Using high quality digital projectors, feature films can be projected in small to medium sized theatres from disc-based playback equipment.<br><br>Eliminating flutter, weave, dirt and scratches, digital cinema brings stunning premier quality feature film display to the theater, every time, just as the director intended.<br><br>Digital cinema has been experimentally shown for several features in select theatres in the United States starting with Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace and followed by such films as Bicentennial Man, Mission to Mars, Dinosaur and Toy Story 2. The latest in the Star Wars series, George Lucas's Attack of the Clones was recently released in the digital cinema format.<br><br>Digital cinema is being promoted and developed in India by Real Image. Real Image is currently developing Qube Cinema, a digital processor especially for digital cinema.<br><br>Vaanam Vasappadum will be processed in a completely digital environment. Avid Non-linear editing solutions will be used to edit the film.Piracy can also be controlled as the system allows only authorised players to decode content. The start date and time, the end date and time, and the number of plays allowed can be set and monitored. The system can also watermark content to indicate the serial number and the play dates and time of the player. This information can be decoded from a video copy of the film, and this information can be used to track the culprit -- the theatre.<br><br>For recording, mixing and mastering Digidesign Pro Tools will be used extensively. Closer home, the music of A.R. Rahman, Sandeep Chowta and Harris Jeyaraj among others, passes through Digidesign Pro Tools during some part of its production.</div>
