            <div class='col-md body'>It's a pretty long dream.<br><br>At first, i was walking aimlessly around mohd sultan, trying to find an ATM until i came to a river where i can take a boat.<br>I hopped onto the boat, admiring the nice scenery when i saw a volcano eruption on the island right in front of us.<br>Everybody on the boat was shocked and we were immediately sent to a building (very WTC look-alike).<br><br>There, everybody was running down the escalators, trying their best to get out of the building. I somehow met my friend there and we head towards the basement. We heard that there's a boat there waiting to fetch people out of the building.<br><br>When we finally board the boat (we were the last few pple left in the building), We saw an aeroplane falling down from the sky, hitting the building next to us. All of us screamed and stepped out of the boat running to the main road (strange structure).<br>Then, we saw another aeroplane flying towards our direction. Shit! All of us just kept running and running.................................. and the next thing i know, i'm home.<br><br>Sigh. What a strange dream.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>duno leh.............. according to dreams analysis<br><br>Volcano<br>Volcanic eruptions in dreams usually represent our erupting emotions. Feelings that you may be harboring during the day might take the form of a volcanic eruption in a dream state. The unconscious psyche might be releasing positive or negative feelings in a safety of a dream. (E.g. Strong sexual feelings, passion, anger, rage, and fear.) Superstition-based dream interpretations say that pouring lava is a warning about poor health.<br><br>Basement<br>The house generally represents your psychological and emotional self. Each part of the house may deal with a different part of you. The basement is built first. It is often below ground (or at least some parts of it), and is essentially the foundation of the house. Dreaming about a basement and understanding the dream, may provide you with valuable information which may lead to greater self-awareness. A recurring dream about basements (i.e. being in a basement, cleaning a basement, furnishing a basement, etc.) should not be ignored. These dreams may be symbolic of your unconscious, instincts and intuition, and degree of awareness of a current situation or a problem. The look of the basement may provide you with clues about your current feelings and state of contentment. If the basement is a mess, and you see great disorder and clutter, it suggests that you may be experiencing confusion and that it is a very good time to "sort" things out emotionally and psychologically. At times, the activities which are going on in the basement of your dream may be based on past experiences or childhood memories. As with all dreams, their main purpose seems to be to bring the dreamer to higher consciousness so that he may deal with his current issues more effectively, rather than to dwell on the past.<br><br>Airplane<br>We received an interesting amount of mail about dreams containing planes and plane crashes. It appears that people often dream about being in a plane crash, witnessing a crash, or being bombed or shot at from planes. Airplanes, like all other vehicles, symbolize a portion of your life's journey. The part of your life which is represented is usually a memory, material from your unconscious mind, or something that is physically far away from you. Since we use planes to travel to places that are far away, the logical progression of this interpretation is that the airplane is symbolic of an event, individuals, or emotions that are either in the past, physically apart from you, or deep in the unconscious and far from conscious thought. Disturbing dreams in which you are being bombed or where you see a bloody crash scene may be trying to bring up issues and feelings that have been buried in the unconscious mind (from the past or the present) but are still powerful and disturbing to the dreamer. The more powerful, vivid, and disturbing this dream is, the greater the necessity to interpret and obtain a satisfactory meaning.<br></div>
