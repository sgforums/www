            <div class='col-md body'>Haven't been following the board over the past few days, and hence have not read the threads for this topic.<br>But after reading ataraxia's astonishing posts, I guess I would like to make some comments.<br><br>ataraxia:<br>Seems that you're encouraging girls to "scheme" their way through their relationship. I know what you're doing is to protect yourselves as female tend to be more sensitive in feelings, but what you're doing might destroy love. Your method is in short manipulation. That is not going to bring about true love, 'cos you're not sincere enough from the start.<br>I guess when you really love someone, you'll not be so concerned about getting hurt yourself than the other party getting hurt. If you find that you're protecting yourself more than the other party, I guess you've not found the right one yet, or you're just not ready. If you're not ready, you shouldn't be doing the wooing part. If you've not found the right one, please don't hurt the other party.(Guys have feelings too)<br>When you really love someone, the word "upperhand" should never occur in your mind. If it does, you better start figuring.<br><br>On your point of "in a relationship, the girl always has the most to lose", I seriously think that it's a sweeping statement. Guys will also get hurt in a relationship, but when they're hurt, they just don't show it. They hide their pain deep inside them, and it hurts even more as they are unable to release the intense pain that they're feeling inside. Girls however have the "right" to wail, throw tantrums, etc. The "right" I meant is that is more socially acceptable for girls to sob, cry, especially in public.<br>If you can make a guy cry, I guess you really hurt him very very deeply.<br><br>Anyway, I find that people these days rush too much into relationships. They start one when they barely know each other. Hence, there would be unecessary hurt.(perhaps that's why ataraxia feels there's a need to protect oneself?)<br>I would advise that people start off as friends first, and if you're meant for each other, you'll be able to detect the chemistry as the friendship blossoms.<br><br>Guys approach girls or girls approach guys, does it really matters?<br><br>pacman and tictac. Hmmm, interesting combination.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok. i hate being misunderstood, and most of all, i hate being blasted for something i didn't do.<br><br>firstly, my methods are manipulation? *shrug* it's basically something guys also usually do right? but they call it wooing. when you guys ask girls out, you give them flowers, you leave short sweet voicemails, etc., it's all for chasing and eventually "getting" her isn't it? is that manipulation too? i guess if you don't like him either and this is all a game (which isn't uncommon if you're around my age..) then yeah, it's manipulation 'cos you're playing with him. but if you really like him, and you want him, isn't that "chasing" him?<br><br>i know i'm being hypocritical here, but what i'm trying to point out, is that this kind of 'manipulation' goes both ways.  i'm unsure how you're certain this wouldn't bring true love.. is love something you get after performing a certain task? accomplishing a certain mission? i think not. no matter how you "scheme" and "manipulate" him, if he doesn't love you, he doesn't. i left my options open when i said<br>"the girl would twist and turn and manipulate the situation until it seems like the guy is chasing her."<br>what's wrong with getting a guy to become interested in you? haven't all of us done it at some time or another? we wrote an excellent piece of poetry, we acted in a school play, we hanged out at all his fave spots....  i don't see how sincerity figures in this: because i actually came up with a plan to meet him i'm insincere?<br><br>"I guess when you really love someone, you'll not be so concerned about getting hurt yourself than the other party getting hurt."<br>firstly, how would that person know if she really 'loves' her OOD if she doesn't know him well? you may think he's great from the conversations you have in class, vms you send each other, chatting on the net, etc, but how do you know that's the "real" him? how would the other person get hurt in this? i'm just chasing him... it's up to him if he wants to reciprocate. that's all. i start the chasing, and the ball is in his court, up to him whether he wants to return the serve or not. maybe i'm too young, maybe i'm just plain childish, but i think you shouldnt be so quick to give all of yourself to a guy based on an attraction. in fact, i would advise against that for every and any relationship. don't tell me you pour your heart out to the first girl/guy you're interested in? that when you see a girl you like, you go straight up and profess your love? how you've been thinking of her day and night? how you've even come up with names of your children? i certainly hope not.<br><br>"When you really love someone, the word "upperhand" should never occur in your mind. If it does, you better start figuring."<br>throughout your post, the word 'love' appears alot. perhaps i think differently from you, but at this point of time (when one of us is doing the chasing) i think i'll only call it 'attraction'. all my "methods" apply in situations when you're not THAT close to the guy until you can talk of this freely, or you're absolutely certain you love him. if you're sure you love him, then you wouldn't have to worry about chasing him would you? 'cos if you guys are close enough for you to be sure it's love, you should be close enough to at least have a vague indication of how he feels in return. when you're in this kind of situation, where everything's unclear and you don't know where you're standing, it can backfire if you tell him you love him when he's not even interested. the term 'upperhand' was used semi-jokingly.<br><br>regarding my statement about girls having the most to lose, i still stand by it. firstly, if the girl gets into the relationship with all her heart, and the guy knew that she 'loved' him and was just playing with her, it's already a very big blow when others find out. worse still if they've gotten physical. holding hands, hugging, even kissing.. they all seem very natural when you're in a relationship, but what if he's just playing? what if he's just taking advantage of you? furthermore, there are jerks out there who go around spreading the word immediately if a girl tells them she 'loves' them. how do you think that would feel? in today's society, it's ok for a guy to chase a girl, but it doesn't swing both ways. if a guy chases a girl and gets her, then he's a hero; if he chases her and 'loses' then it's "tough luck". if a girl chases a guy and gets him, it's "expected"; if she chases a guy and is rejected, she'll be laughed out of town. this is what i mean by 'having the most to lose'. do you honestly think that relationships are all about emotions? and only involve the two of you? it's all very idealistic and sweet, but it doesn't happen. there are alot of other factors involved when you're 'going', even though the first two are the most important.<br><br>i don't understand your point about guys having to 'hide their pain'. does that mean you guys are actually the ones with the most to lose? simply because you can't "express" or "release the intense pain that they're [you're] feeling inside"? is it truly more 'socially acceptable' for girls to be bitchy in public? it's not about expressing emotions, it's more about crying. regardless of what you're crying about, be it grades, your dog's death, or a breakup, it always isn't "right" for guys to cry. people think it's 'wimpy' that he isnt a 'man'... but how often do you see girls wailing/crying/throwing a tantrum in public? to date, i have never seen any of my girlfriends do that, especially if it's for a guy. most of us have enough dignity and self-possession not to disgrace ourselves openly in public. and is wailing/sulking/crying/throwing a tantrum the only way to 'release' your 'intense pain'? do you honestly think that's all us girls do? we talk to our friends, and perhaps we whine, we bitch, but this is no public display of our feelings. if you don't have friends to confide in, if you don't have people to turn to in such a time, i think the problem isn't in how you're able to 'express' your emotions. furthermore, i can assure you that guys nowadays (at least my age) have become a lot more openminded. i have seen guyfriends cry, in private, and some, even in public.<br><br>all in all? my comments were half tongue-in-cheek, and i assumed a worse case senario since anna never stated the situation. she just asked if it was acceptable. and i replied that although it technically was, SOME guys would take it for granted and not cherish the girl. which is true. i'll stand by that fact no matter what. some guys would always go through the relationship harping on the fact that it was she who 'chased' him, and he'll always play that 'ace' in every quarrel and fight. and some girls do that too. it's a double-edged sword, just that since guys 'usually' chase girls, girls using that against them seldom happens since it's a 'norm'.<br><br>i hope i've explained myself fully so that you understand EXACTLY what i've been trying to say.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>REFORMASI dudes!!!!<br><br>Ataraxia: Take it easy...<br><br>About what you said though, I have to disagree about whether girls or guys have more to lose. Generally I think both guys and girls have a lot to lose if they are the ones being committed or into it deeper. I have to say though, I see male friends taking it a lot worse than girls.<br><br>On the point about guy chasing a girl and if couldn't get it being tough luck, that doesn't seem to happen because you see lots posters here lamenting how sad they are and all that. If guys take it so easily I don't think you would see so many of those topics being discussed by so many people. Still, I could be wrong of course. I'm just saying that from what I have seen, which is not exactly heaps.<br><br>Also, guys seem to have less of a venue to express grief. I take your point about girls don't make a scene in public, but there are close friends to talk about it, and no matter what method they use, like I said, I see more girls than guys doing better than guys after a breakup, and perhaps losing in a sincere chase. Guys tend to bottle everything up. Its more of a pat in a back and keep the chin up or something.<br><br>I'm talking about those pursuits that are more intense, such as you know the other person for longer as a friend then start pursuing them as a partner sort of thing, not the run of the mill pick-up-adventure on a weekend in a pub.<br><br>Once again, any girls want to start chasing us guys, I'm another one all for it man. As the other 2 recent posters have said, REFORMASI woohooo!<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 16-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, my pt about how guys and girls would fare is based not on how THEY feel, but rather the way society would see them. throughout my argument about girls having the most to lose, the main aspect is their 'face', ie what others would think/say. but personally, i can't stand the losers who just mope and whine all day about girls who rejected them, don't they know they're just making matters worse? "girls have the most to lose" applies in the senario i painted above. when the girl is doing the chasing.. at a point of time when she doesnt know her OOD well enough.<br><br>regarding venues to vent your fustration, and express your emotions, although us girls have our close friends, dont you guys too? don't tell me you're still stuck in the dark ages where guys have to be MAN and not show their pain? how one reacts to a breakup or rejection very much depends on the individual's character and personality. be it a guy or girl, if that person's whiny, mopey, and loves to indulge in self-pity, she/he'll never get over it. furthermore, it would also affect the friends you have. most of my guy friends are open about their 'pain', not that they cry their hearts out and sob to every person they meet, but rather, they confide in their close friends. perhaps we run in different circles, but for us, be it guy or girl, when faced with such letdowns or 'emotional crisis', we always turn to our close friends (who can be male or female).<br><br>my "methods" don't apply to 'pickups' frm bars or on the street, but rather for someone you're acquainted with but you're not sure you really 'know'. once again i would like to emphasise this point. these 'methods' apply in a situation where you know enough about the guy to be interested, but not to the extent where you can say you're in love. i believe that you can never exactly gauge how well you 'know' a person, and that you can't love someone until you know him.  and if you LOVE that guy, you should be close enough to him that my 'methods' would be irrelevant. if you're that close to the guy until you're sure you love him, don't you even have the slightest inkling if he feels the same?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ataraxia, dun worry about people saying you're wrong... I mean things that we feel is right may be wrong in other people's opinion...<br><br>and as for whether Guys get hurt more or gals get hurt more, I think nowadays, more and more girls are breaking the guy's heart rather than vice versa.<br><br>a sad story to share... many years ago, one of my fren's gf broke off with him. He couldn't take it and committed suicide....   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">   I'm not very close to him, but I'm a little angry with him, cos he was the only son in the family... it will pain anyone who look at his mum's face during the funeral... his gf also suffered very badly becos of this, and his mum hated his gf(ex-gf rather) from then on...<br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming? Like asif I care.....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Of course it's not a bad thing!<br>in fact I've made it a part of my life to go out and do daring things when life gets all mundane...and going after guys is one of them. I mean i've made it a pt to make a guy feel special when i chase<br>but after we get serious and into a relationship<br>darn it...the tables change!<br>In pt, it's not a bad thing, love is unconditional, you dun have to love someone just becoz he loves you back..just go out and express the wonders of your love.</div>
