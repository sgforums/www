            <div class='col-md body'>sad as it is, i would say yes. if you're seriously planning to get into a relationship with this guy, you better start scheming a little, and come up with some plot to let him fall madly in love with you. 'cos if you guys really start "going" seriously, he'll always gain the upper hand cos it was YOU who chased HIM. see? it's that whole ego thing.. trust me on this.<br><br>of course, there are dif degrees of chasing. there is:<br><br>1. outright wooing. ie generally like how any guy would chase a girl, very open abt it.<br>2. subtle wooing. in which the girl just keeps getting closer to the guy and hinting... but never comes right out and says it. (works in the sense that if he doesnt feel the same and turns out to be a jerk, you can just say, "huh? where got? wahkao.. he so ego. who would like him? i got say anything meh?... chey, just being friendly. he so oversensitive..")<br>3. scheming. in which, the girl would twist and turn and manipulate the situation until it seems like the guy is chasing her. my favourite move.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>it's personally up to you i guess, what kinda footing you want your 'relationship' to begin on. but if you just wanna KNOW the guy, ie who cares abt dating?!?!, then hell.. any method's fine. even the old, "excuse me, do you have the time?" right down to "bumping" into him in the middle of the road. it all depends on your guts...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>heh heh heh.. well, i posted a similiar topic a few wks(??)/mths back... and those who took note of that should know, that im someone who believes in going all out to get what i want.. not that i've really wanted a guy THAT much but actually.. dont you think all i've said is just common sense dears?<br><br>i know this sounds oldfashioned and "duh" but in a relationship, the girl always has the most to lose. so, you can't let him gain the upper hand even more! guys may say they find such girls attractive, and very "forward" but... it's because such girls are a definite egobooster. and guys' egos and their jerkiness are directly proportionate, one gets bigger the other one will too.. ahem.<br><br>but, if he chases you, he'll have to go through sooo much trouble for you! which confirms that you're worth it. and he'll likely treasure you more for it for all the work he has to go through.. also, he'll be the one in the doubt while you just sit back, relax, and watch him sweat! *evil laughter*<br><br>actually, im pretty much talking crap here. if you really like a guy, go for it. take the 2nd option 'cos it has the most escape routes, 1st option if you're really frank, and 3rd if you reallyreally want him. as for approaching guys on the street.. i havent done that before. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> haha. yesh. confession. never approached a guy on the street before... why? 'cos i havent found a guy cute enough for me to risk my ego.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>well.. i hope this helps you anna... if you need to build up your courage, start practising flirting. haha... really an egobooster when you see the guy react.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>---------------<br>hmm, rereading the whole thing, and wanted to emphasise a pt. note that all my "approaches" are generally.. subtle. except the 1st, which ive never attempted before. and most ppl ive seen doing it, generally fail. why? hmm... perhaps it's cos the feeling isnt mutual.. but the most likely factor, is that she comes on too strong! yeah.. the guys will be extremely flattered to have a girl chasing them, but sometimes, while immersed within the excitment of the chase, you lose that sense of objectivity (which hopefully you possessed in the first place) and miss subtle naunces that convey how he really feels about being chased. which is a major problem. thus, i stress the importance of subtlety!!!! never let him find out your true intentions, make him sweat. he can NEVER be sure of your feelings towards him, cos if he does, he'll gain the upper hand again. and.. always have an escape route planned! basically, think of it as a game.. or say, robbing a bank! (my analogies are getting wierder and wierder..) you cant let the teller know immediately what's going to happen 'cos that'll just spoil everything won't it? you'll wait till you get up to her before setting the plan in motion. but, if you can discovered, or your plan is foiled, you definitely have to have a backup plan right? to make a quick getaway?<br><br>basically, im just talking crap. hey, it's early morning, i just woke up, can you blame me?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>[This message has been edited by ataraxia (edited 07-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Citing from my experience, I wld advise a agst going after a guy. I tried confessing my feelings to a guy frens once, and he was real impressed.. for a while. A few weeks later, he told me that he dun think its possible b/w us, know wat's the reason? He thinks that this is too easy! Meaning: he miss the chase of getting a gal! *groan*<br><br>So the best bet is still to take atar's advise, "manipulate" him to make him think that he's the one doing the chase. The key thing here is not to seem so enthusiastic that he get scared off and yet not so aloof that he loses interest. Keep him guessing.<br><br>"MyStEry" is the word, my gal!</div>
