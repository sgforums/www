I mean i've made it a pt to make a guy feel special when i chase<br>but after we get serious and into a relationship<br>darn it...the tables change!<br>In pt, it's not a bad thing, love is unconditional, you dun have to love someone just becoz he loves you back..just go out and express the wonders of your love.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ataraxia:<br>I think you're generalising on a few points.<br>Some guys woo girls by giving flowers, leaving short sweet voicemails, others do so by doing their best to help when they can, but fall short of making seemingly unachievable promises, and giving expensive gifts. To some, promises are meant to please the girl, to some, promises are meant to be kept for life.<br><br>pacman:<br>Thanks for helping me to explain a few points, especially the one on how guys usually bottled up their feelings.<br><br>ataraxia:<br>Perhaps I define love differently from you. You do not have to be really close to that person before you realised you're in love with him/her.<br>And yes, as pacman mentioned, guys don't approach their friends that often when they're hurt. And some guys are very sentimental; they do also find it hard to get over broken relationships.<br><br>I do understand what you're trying to say; I'm just trying to portray another side of the story.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>*gives ataraxia a standing ovation*<br>i'm with u all the way ataraxia! personally i normally use the 2nd and 3rd methods u haf listed, mostly 'coz i got no guts. =P of course, there are those guys who wouldn't know a subtle hint if it hit them in the face (but they r sooooooo cute when they look so blur) - wonder how other gals deal with that?<br><br>as to the guys - what ataraxia says makes excellent sense, and i'm not saying that just 'coz i'm a girl. check out her logic - itz completely rational, and eminently practical for girls who care even the tiniest modicum about their reputations - which is, of course, almost everyone.<br><br>as to how we girls deal with our pain - well, different people have different ways of dealing with different situations is all i can say. a year ago i would have said that i would never cry (as in really really cry my heart out) over a guy in public, but when han wei broke up with me i cried all the way home. in the train. literally non-stop. after which i cried all over my mum's shoulder at home (another one of those things i could've sworn i'd never do), and subsequently attempted to commit suicide (yet another thing i'd never have thought i'd do).<br><br>at the end of the day, i think it all depends on the person's personality, but also on their "support system", the friends and people around them. my "gor" is one of those guys who is normally very "macho", egoistic types - but when his longtime gf (he'd actually gone ring shopping) ran off with her ex, he called me and a few other friends and totally broke down and cried. i guess if the guy knows that he has friends who support him no matter what, and don't judge him, he'll be more willing to turn to them.<br><br>then again, being a girl, i find guys in general mostly incomprehensible, so feel free to correct my views, guys.<br><br>amelia a.k.a. kat<br><br>p.s. check out my homepage at <a href="http://ameliaalexis.cjb.net" rel="nofollow">http://ameliaalexis.cjb.net</a><br><br>p.p.s. if any basketball players want to get an sggirls game together, mail me, k? i'll talk to chief about it if the response is good.    =)<br><br>[This message has been edited by Amelia Alexis (edited 22-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry ppl, having read all the respond to the question of "girl approaching a guy"...it seems to me that the word "manipultion" keep poping up. I seriously  think its not right, if its the guy that manipulated the situation, and finally he finds out the truth&lt;THE WHOLE TRUTH&gt; abt the whole manipulation thing...how do u think he would feel???
