            <div class='col-md body'>actually the way i differentiate bollywood and south india is...<br><br>*Cough*<br><br>bollywood movies have actors and actresses that are very good looking, fair skin, exotic looking<br><br>south indian movies... the "hero" or lead actor is NOT necessarily good looking at all! in fact sometimes quite big belly and bushy beard - well its the culture (like tang dynasty people like fat women)<br><br>and sometimes you can see clearly that bollywood movies have bigger budget than south indian movies.<br><br>hey im chinese and i watch bollywood movies. especially sunday 1pm on channel 12 and then immediately after the bollywood one, you can tell the next one confirm is south indian. ekkekeke<br><br>oh right and of course we all knwo that north indians are fair skin, south indians are dark skin.<br><br>but i do wonder why a lot of times the bollywood lead actors are so old and the girl so young!</div>
