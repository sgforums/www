            <div class='col-md body'>Actually I'm also facing a similar situation. One of my good fren is also in such kind of dilemma with her bf. The thing is she will not want to initiate the break-up bcos ahe feel tt she's responsible towards this gut, although we know tt the guy still loves her very much.<br><br>But what I think is: better stand in a more neutral stand, then throw her some questions to make her really think of the answer. I tried to persuade this fren of mine to break up with her bf. Initially they did broke up (ok, but NOT due to my words) and I told her it's the right thing to do. But guess what? They patched up the next day and in the end I was viewed as a kaypoh villian who goes around breaking people up. This fren of mine even said that she should not have listened to me cos I was not the actual person involved. And she said something about: since MY emotions were not involved, how can I actually feel for their situation?<br><br>Uggghhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!! Very difficult to be the good guy...<br><br>Go and die lar! None of my biznezz anymore...</div>
