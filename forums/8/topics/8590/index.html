            <div class='col-md body'>This article is published in The Times UK edition on the 7th August 2000.<br><br>Agree or Disagree?<br><br>They have no ideas, passion or politics, eschew colour and clutter, consume but don't commit. Celia Brayfield just can't stand the Bland Young Things<br><br>The King and Queen of Bland: Stars of Friends David Schwimmer and Jennifer Aniston<br><br>Generation bland<br><br>What planet are they from? You know the life-forms I mean, you can see them everywhere if you look hard enough. They are young adult humanoids with shiny faces, unblinking eyes, monotone garments and uniform behaviours.<br>You could call them the Generation Bland. They don't do colour in dress, interior decoration or character, they do Gap khakis and whatever non-hue is designated the new black.<br><br>They understand that clothes make a statement, of course. They're very slick with the semiology of the Zeitgeist. If you decoded the statement their clothes are making, however, it would be something like, "Er . . ."<br><br>Generation Bland, as a species, appears to be inert. There is no sign of independent thought among them. They wear the same drab clothes, live in the same chilly lofts and drone the same jargon expressing the same pseudo-ideas. They seem to do this in the belief that they are being kick-ass, cutting-edge and achingly trendy, unaware that the essence of kick-ass and cutting-edge is original thinking. They buy into style and fashion, hang out in "trendy" places, with no idea what style really means.<br><br>Generation Bland does minimalism - coats without buttons, rooms without clutter, homes without families, work without loyalty. They don't do saturated fat or refined sugar or meat, they do sushi and pre-bagged salad leaves that have never seen the light of day or felt the touch of mud. And they do them because that's what "trendy" people are supposed to do.<br><br>They don't do belief, they just do spiritual, which seldom goes farther than a Feng Shui phase. They don't do love, or friendship, or sentimentality. They always have reasons not to do commitment at this point in time and mostly they don't do people at all.<br><br>Mentally, this species appears to be inert. They don't do passion, or interest, or curiosity, or caring, or politics, or philosophy or making the world a better place; they do irony. They call it irony, anyway. Real irony has a sparkle of devilment in its eye. This stuff is a sullen detachment that's somewhere past passive-aggression on the way to existential cafard.<br><br>They also do denial. In fact, they seem to do something more extreme than denial, a kind of negation bred in the bone. They pose as if they feel those missing qualities - interest or curiosity or sensitivity, say - but they can't act as if they are inspired by them.<br><br>This means they will travel with the aim of experiencing other cultures and understanding humanity but are unable to receive the stimuli that add up to experience. Like the characters in The Beach, they will AirMile off to Thailand, then do so many drugs that they don't know where they are anyway.<br><br>Have you heard the one about the two twentysomethings who Eurailed to St Petersburg, didn't like the atmosphere and left without going inside any of the buildings? Or the young American who boasted he'd "done" Florence in a day? I wish these were jokes; in fact, they're claims proudly made by Bland Young Things which I overheard this very summer.<br><br>The Bland Young Things have Bland Young Jobs, which is why we need to worry about them. They're in marketing, public relations, advertising, information management, talent development, think-tanking, policy wonking, personal actualisation, consultancy and, I have to admit, in journalism. They are the people who give focus to focus groups and put the buzz in buzzwords.<br><br>Perhaps because so much of their energy is directed not to understanding information but to managing it, they have a strange way with words. Their transmissions are not clear. When you listen to them, you get the feeling that your babelfish is hibernating or your interpreter 'droid needs to be reprogrammed.<br><br>Recently, a reporter on Radio 4 described the effect of civil war on two to three million Kurds in Turkey as "disruption". Not "tragedy" or "outrage" or "persecution", and certainly not "genocide". Just disruption, what happens when trains are late.<br><br>A few days later a witness to a gang killing in Hackney, in which a young man was shot at point-blank range on a garage forecourt by an assassination squad of six others, complained, "What they did was rude". Not "outrage" or "murder". Just rude, what happens when children stick their tongues out.<br><br>BYTs say "appropriate" when they mean "right", "management" when they mean "manipulation" and "reframe" when they mean "ignore". Perhaps it is this fumbling grip on language which allows them to live by a new ironic morality.<br><br>They're eager to applaud anyone who goes on TV to talk about being a cokehead and almost as quick to protect the rights of paedophiles. They're relieved that a European court has recently ruled that gay men have a right to enjoy orgies in private but concerned that a London motorist has discovered a loophole in Euro-law making it illegal for councils to double-up unpaid parking fines.<br><br>They are also ambitious. They want to rule the world. Now. Since they have no plans to reproduce, their goal is instant global domination and they have plenty of energy to devote to achieving it. Perhaps the only thing they truly believe is that their striking lack of humanity makes them uniquely entitled to tell the rest of us how to live. Their certainty about this is of an order not seen since Hitler wrote Mein Kampf.<br><br>So, although it's tempting to laugh at their bizarre strain of naivety, we need to be afraid of them.<br><br>What planet are they from? First choice would be Planet Thatcher, because the BYTs grew up in the Eighties when greed was good, political correctness still seemed like a good idea and "care in the community" meant renaming the mentally ill as "people with special needs" and throwing them out of hospitals to starve on the streets. That would explain their blinding selfishness, inbred moral chaos and the conviction that rebranding is the solution to every social problem.<br><br>They could also be aliens from Planet Alanis. Most of them hate Alanis Morrissette but they all know the words to her song Isn't It Ironic? Most of them see no irony at all in the fact that the lyrics describe things which aren't ironic. Most of them, therefore, have espoused irony without knowing what it is. At the risk of sounding like an old Monty Python sketch, this isn't irony, it's negation.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>'They want to rule the world and to tell us how to live'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>They use their new irony as a mechanism to protect themselves from feelings and absolve themselves from responsibilities. It becomes a necessity for a bearable life, a cocoon which reality cannot penetrate.<br><br>In the intellectual periodical Prospect, Robert McCrum argued recently that British political life was dying from a surfeit of irony. He observed that irony and ignorance had formed an unholy alliance, leading to the spooky tendency to deny issues which characterises many of the people whom we have entrusted with addressing them.<br><br>McCrum suggested that the curse of irony followed the relative ease of modern life. No war, no epidemics, no mass unemployment, no big problems but "a host of micro-problems; it takes intellectual effort to follow politics. How much easier to give an ironic shrug."<br><br>We can also look to Planet Media. Bland Young Things have seen everything on television and find real life much less interesting and much too difficult. The world is far more complex than Neighbours and their attention span is too short to make sense of it. They give up and tune out.<br><br>Their emotions are constantly aroused but there is seldom anything they can do to resolve their feelings. They have also absorbed a value system which teaches that emotion is only appropriate for the laughable losers on The Jerry Springer Show. Thus they invalidate their own guilt and frustration.<br><br>Television has brought their young minds terrible images of famine, brutality, death and disaster, about which they could do nothing except, when they were old enough, make a credit-card donation to an aid agency - if they had the patience to hold on in the telephone queueing system. It needed only a few such experiences before a whole generation began to close down their feelings in self-protection.<br><br>The other course is to express their concern and compassion in the only way they really know - as consumers. They buy fair-trade tea and a coffee table made of wood from sustainably managed forests and feel better about Third World debt and disappearing jungles. Which brings us to the last possible source of these invaders, Planet Choice.<br><br>In a society in which options are proliferating like rogue viruses, people are defining themselves by what they like and what they buy. Making choices is replacing bringing up children as the most important activity any human being can undertake.<br><br>Nationality, ethnicity and gender are no longer secure foundations for an identity. Liking Aerosmith or Arsenal, hating Jar Jar Binks or Alanis Morrissette are a much safer and more effective way of telling people who you want them to think you are. And choice is manageable. You can fake it, which makes it an excellent substitute for character.<br><br>As John Cusack's hero says in the film High Fidelity, "It's not what you like that is important, it's what you are like." Bland Young Things like this film, so perhaps there is hope that they will start to wake from their strange cultural narcosis and start living.
