            <div class='col-md body'>Adam&amp;Eve is partially correct. The first thing and easiest thing to do is to attempt to dissuade the caller(s) from continuing the prank calls. As you mentioned, due to your current attachment, you have given out your contact number. This, i presume would be the primary cause of the prank calls. Someone, who did not have to like or hate you could just have then posted your number in IRC, as u mentioned that some of the callers did say that they got your number through irc. To remedy the situation if the first suggestion that i mentioned did not work, or for some reason you do not want to try it out or whatever, the next few could be just what the doctor ordered. A police report has to be made in order for the appropriate service provider to take up any official action against the caller or to even check the person up for you. The fact is that service providers <strong>can</strong> retrieve the authentic numbers of users who use "private numbers". But this can only be done with the relevant authorities authorising it and proper procedures be observed. Then, co- operate with the police and your service provider fully and to the best of your ability. Other than that, you could hire a legal lawyer or consultant to explain and review all teh legal options that you could use, one of which is to lodge a magistrate's report and get the magistrate to call an investigation to this whole matter. This will be the most costly option as you would then have to pay the lawyer as well as all legal fees required to process a magistrate's report. Then there will be a long wait for the investigations to complete. Another option is to just answer all the calls that you receive and ignore it if it's another prank caller. If not, the best option would be to change your handphone number, then buy a prepaid card that does not tie you down with monthly plans to use for situations where you would give your number to the public. As for your current number, i am sure that you can negociate with your handphone company. I am sure this "speech" has given you more than enough information that you would need to know already. So get off your computer and start doing something about it!! I do wish you good luck that you will be able to resolve this case.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
