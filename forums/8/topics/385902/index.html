              <p>She was told that she was supposed to start training in october this year and by december her training will be over and she will be able to start work. She even resigned from her job to get ready for the training in october.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But the training has been postponed and until now the training haven't even start yet. She has been jobless for months already.</p>

              <p><br>Well, I don't want to criticize anybody but people should understand that even when one was promised work, when one actually starts work depends on the prevailing situation.</p>
              <p>In this case, there may be a lot of a reason why there may be delays in the scheduling of training (nothing of value to point the specific reasons). But I can say this is not a scam, unless the person was notified of her selection by the employment agency but not the employer itself.</p>
              <p>If its though employment agency, perhaps they just want to have a ready pool of capable candidates in order to cater for their clients timecontext-specific manpower needs (if you do not know what I mean, a good word would be "tentative manpower needs").</p>

              <p>If this thread turns out to be true I will be laughing at those people who quit their jobs to work at the casino and for waiting for many motnhs to start the training</p>

              <p>Shameful for you to laugh at them.</p>
              <p>They quitted their jobs because it is their choice. I perceive that many people had it bad in their previous jobs and they want to see this as a genuine opportunity of change... perhaps its just wishful thinking but it beats being called an 'non-professional (non-PMET)' staying stagnant in a 9 to 5 job and kowtowing to your boss and his whims... and perhaps die an office death at the age of 65.</p>
