His intention was CLEAR.<br>2) The woman was dragged into a bathroom (?) for a full thirty minutes.<br>3) During the 30 minutes, the woman was SCREAMING.<br>4) The man wasn't there to threaten them anymore.<br><br>All the above four points just blow your post all apart. The cellphone reason is quite ridiculous btw.<br><br>You are wrong on the judgement part too. You are basically comparing a BEFORE and AFTER scenario in this case. Let me explain.<br><br>A hypothesis scenario such as this case was put to me, and I replied: No, I won't help.<br><br>To judge me at that point, is a true pre-judgement.<br><br>However, if I really did nothing when something like that happens, then it is not a pre-judgement at all. Because what I did, or rather, what I did not do, was really really, really bad. Take note that no matter what reasonings you have, to do nothing in such cases, is BAD. There is no excuse.<br><br>Fine if you are intimidated by the man's glare and threat. But there's point number 2 to 4! The guy can't see you, can't threaten you... what's there to be scared of anymore? If you are the only one who dared to call the cops while the others are keeping quiet, most likely those others will not give your identity away to the rapist. They did not stop him or go forward as witnesses afterall, so why would they stop you or tell the rapist you are the one who reported him?<br><br>Your post sounds very much like you are sticking up to those people who ignored what happened and that is very hard for me to accept.</div>

There is no excuse.<br><br>Fine if you are intimidated by the man's glare and threat. But there's point number 2 to 4! The guy can't see you, can't threaten you... what's there to be scared of anymore? If you are the only one who dared to call the cops while the others are keeping quiet, most likely those others will not give your identity away to the rapist.

Because that was the pain they inflicted on the woman, and on THEMSELVES. They did not harm the woman directly, but they harmed her indirectly. And by doing so, they harmed themselves.<br><br>Remember that it became like that only because they ALLOWED it. And when they do, the criticism and condemnation is SURE and WELL-DESERVED.
