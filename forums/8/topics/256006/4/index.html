            <div class='col-md body'>"You are the one who doesn't get my point. I know how you see those stares, which was why I explained to you those stares aren't necessarily so. You are simply thinking too negatively. You feel as if they are looking at you as if you are a fool. Has it ever occured to you that that might actually not be the case, but simply because personally, YOU FEEL LIKE A FOOL?<br><br>You sounds like you have a self-esteem problem. But you are fourteen, and I must say that is normal for teenagers your age.<br><br>You are also too pessimistic about Singaporeans. If you've read the papers, you should have noticed news of Singaporeans who went to the rescue of others every now and then.<br><br>I wonder if you will still be so forgiving, had the victim been your mother or sister or maybe when it's you yourself.  "<br><br>we're looking at the event from different POVs, and neither of us feel like turning around and looking from another perspective. so never mind.<br>yes, perhaps, I DO feel like a fool. and I'm not going to be so naive as to say that I dont blame myself. yes, teenagers commonly have self-esteem problems. I'm not going to deny the fact that I also occassionally have such issues...<br>at the same time, I still do not believe that you understand what I'm talking about... but I shall not further elaborate, seeing as I dont think I could possibly make you understand if you havent personally experienced it before.<br>yes, I have a pretty bleak impression of singaporeans, though I love them. but, at the same time, dont you guys have a pretty bleak impression of rafflesians? if you guys choose to hate me for what I am, it's hard for me to just love you guys all back. yeah, despite all the smiles. it isnt fun to be singled out for belonging to something..<br>okay, nevermind, I shall not tie the whole rafflesian thing into this ...<br>never mind. you keep your views, I keep mine. deal? =)</div>
