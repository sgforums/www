Because that was the pain they inflicted on the woman, and on THEMSELVES. They did not harm the woman directly, but they harmed her indirectly. And by doing so, they harmed themselves.<br><br>Remember that it became like that only because they ALLOWED it. And when they do, the criticism and condemnation is SURE and WELL-DESERVED. I mean, how on earth can they know something horrible is going on, and yet IGNORE it?<br><br>You are a nice person, but this time you are nice for the wrong purpose. </div></blockquote>yes, they DO deserve it. but (please pardon me if I'm letting it go too easily) it's OVER. will scolding them NOW, at THIS TIME, change the situation?<br>this is a quote that I once heard: "Even GOD cannot change the past."<br>do you really believe by telling these people that they DESERVE to be criticized, that is it THEIR fault that the situation turned out to be this way, the whole event will be erased from history?<br>I know that those people probably deserve criticism. however, I also know that if such a situation happened, it would take someone with a VERY LARGE AMOUNT of courage to know what to do. they were shocked. I dont know about you, but when I'M in shock, I usually don't know how to react, and even if I do, my body isn't always able to carry out my brain's command...<br>I know that most people, when viewing the situation (from hind sight, must I note), will instantly point out the passenger's faults. at first, I believed that it was the passengers' faults as well ...<br>however, I'm starting to see how eager we generally are to point out people's faults ... oftentime, people point out other's faults in hope of preventing such a thing from happening again, and I respect that ..<br>at the same time, I wonder, if such a thing happened in Singapore, would anyone have done anything? they say that we can see other's faithfulness and integrity through the little things ...<br>if that is the case, why doesn't anyone ever say anything about those who refuse to stand up for the pregnant or the elderly on trains? why doesn't anyone, when seeing someone totally worn out, ever ask if they're okay? why doesn't anyone ever smile at each other. aren't THESE signs that show whether or not people are concerned for each other?<br>have you ever seen those people who turn around, pretend to be asleep or start examining their cellphone the INSTANT someone who is pregnant or elderly enters a MRT cabin?<br>these people, perhaps, may, at the next instant, scold those passengers in Japan for not doing anything about the situation.<br>if people aren't even willing to stand up and endure a bumpy ride for the sake of someone in need, will they ever dare to intervene when someone is being assaulted? after all, inconvenience doesn't seem like too big a deal compared to POSSIBLY being beaten up.<br>for some reason, I think that, no, they wouldnt. they'd just do what they do every day when they see the pregnant or the elderly: they'd pretend to be oblivious to the situation.<br>PERHAPS, that's what the passengers did.<br>perhaps, that wasnt the case.<br>I dont know what happened. I don't know what was going on in those passenger's minds...<br>However, I still hold firm to my original belief: we are in no condition to condemn those passengers.<br><br></div>

What about the stares? The way you say it makes it sound so negative. People are staring because you are doing something NICE, not because you are being a meddlesome fool. In modern society where kindness and general helpfulness are not in abundance, it is considered something as a 'wow' if someone helps in public.<br><br>If I sees a guy/girl helping someone else in need, I would look. But what am I thinking? I'd be thinking: 'Wow. That's one nice guy'.<br><br>That's very different from what the rapist did, so I don't know what you are trying to say here.<br><br>If you are doing something nice, why should you even be bothered by those stares? I wouldn't, because I would be proud of myself. Your post doesn't make sense.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

The way you say it makes it sound so negative. People are staring because you are doing something NICE, but because you are being a meddlesome fool. In modern society where kindness and general helpfulness are not in abundance, it is considered something as a 'wow' if someone helps in public.<br><br>If I sees a guy/girl helping someone else in need, I would look. But what am I thinking? I'd be thinking: 'Wow. That's one nice guy'.<br><br>That's very different from what the rapist did, so I don't know what you are trying to say here.<br><br>If you are doing something nice, why should you even be bothered by those stares? I wouldn't, because I would be proud of myself. Your post doesn't make sense.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>you dont seem to get my point.<br>the thing is, those stares are more of the "what a fool" type of stares.<br>perhaps it's just the way I view things (and if it is, yeah, I'll swallow my words), but I have this "smile" policy (a.k.a. I try to smile at everyone I see on the streets), and when I smile at people over there, they generally glare back at me.<br>maybe I've just been meeting the wrong people or something.<br>there was this other time, there was this guy that was carrying a whole bunch of cardboard and he was walking around in the sengkang mrt station.. he seemed to be struggling with it, and I was going to go ask him if he needed help, but he was giving me these wary looks.<br>I don't get glares over here in Beijing. I get (sometimes toothy) smiles back. at the worse, people ignore me. but I dont care. It's better than glares.<br>It makes me feel like I have to be stone-faced and that I have to stop trying to make people's lives better ...<br>okay, basically, i've just posted a bunch of crap and it isnt exactly relevant to the topic. however, that's how a lot of singaporeans have been making me feel ... and it's not that I have anything against singaporeans... I love Singapore.<br>I shouldnt generalize. Yes, I know. Perhaps, you'll lecture me for going off topic. Perhaps, you'll tell me that I'm totally missing the point.<br>However, like I said before, I dont believe that ANYONE has the right to say that those passengers were horrible people. yes, they were WRONG and I understand your point too.<br>It's just that we're living in a (what I deem to be) unfriendly society. And I'm not just talking about Singapore. I'm talking about every single country on this globe.<br>This is whom society has moulded us to become. And yes, I dislike what people are doing, but it's a dog eat dog world, and no1 seems to care about anyone else anymore. And when everyone around us doesn't care anymore, it's hard for those who DO care to break free.<br>That's why I dont think we should say anything about those passengers ... Maybe they DID care ... maybe they just didn't know what to do ... maybe they just COULDNT do what they knew they had to do. they were scared ... I know, that doesn't seem like much of a reason, does it? but I'm sure you've experienced how our emotions can often get the better of us ...<br><br>*feel free to tell me that I'm some stubborn 14-year-old brat. darn, I'll even accept it. nevermind, I dont think I'll ever be able to make you agree with me, nor do I think you'll ever be able to make me see from that point of view again.</div>

I know how you see those stares, which was why I explained to you those stares aren't necessarily so. You are simply thinking too negatively. You feel as if they are looking at you as if you are a fool. Has it ever occured to you that that might actually not be the case, but simply because personally, YOU FEEL LIKE A FOOL?<br><br>You sounds like you have a self-esteem problem. But you are fourteen, and I must say that is normal for teenagers your age.<br><br>You are also too pessimistic about Singaporeans. If you've read the papers, you should have noticed news of Singaporeans who went to the rescue of others every now and then.<br><br>I wonder if you will still be so forgiving, had the victim been your mother or sister or maybe when it's you yourself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><blockquote>People are staring because you are doing something NICE, but because you are being a meddlesome fool. </blockquote>I did not notice my typo there.
