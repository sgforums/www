            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway all this hoo-ha about racism and being hypersensitive in how asians should potray themselves is reflection of the insecurity and victim mentality that is what really aggrivates racism, we see ang mos doing far stupider things for the sake of it and getting laughed at but it dosen't seem to have any racial bearings, do we use Jackass to discrimiate against the sterotype of the white as a degenerate, stupid people? No, and those who do so deserve that very title.<br><br>But here we have an honest person who is side splittingly funny and we think that the hoo-ha, much of it is racist. I am bashedly unashamed of my own heritage and don't see a need to always project a cool image for our race. The innane need to always demolish or disown anything that my make white people laugh at us... it's stupid, and that if anything will be the ones renforcing the image of the asian as a insecure, victim mentality weak person.<br><br>If anybody is laughing at William for racist reasons, they are morons and the onus of proving their maturity and rationality lies on them, not us. Why carry their burdern? If they want to be idiots so be it. The thing is, I am pretty sure most people are honest in their support of William, as his very appeal is that of honest, unashamed appeal.</div>
