            <div class='col-md body'>hey all.... do you realise that the william hung sensationalisation is a display of racism by the americans? it's like telling people that asians have small eyes, high foreheads, black hair cannot sing cannot dance and yet they wanna do it and pretend they can do it.<br><br>it's stereotyping!<br><br>[note: you don't see the same effect when other americans or westerners cant dance and cant sing too on american idol.]<br><br>have u ever wondered how come william hung can make it onto tv for his 'she bangs' act? izit that his words and sincerity touched the americans' hearts and they wanna tell it to the world? certainly not. in actual fact they are just MAKING FUN of him and making him look like an IDIOT. he's being exploited for commercial value and to earn publicity for the producers.<br><br>and yet we asians are playing right into this game by all the hoo-ha over him and setting up of fan clubs, websites and such. even william hung's father is caught up in this game, saying that any contacts to william hung should be made through him and even started charging money for interviews.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>and over the west there is actually LAUGHING at us....  pls look at the politics of this issue instead of jumping onto the bandwagon. look beyond the act and you will see racism and stereotyping of the asians by the americans.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I honestly really liked his act, it was 2 minutes of pure, unpretencious fun, which is a lot more then I can say for the rest of the acts.<br><br>The problem starts when we start piling on so much baggage onto what the whole issue really is. By a natural extension of your logic, it can be argued that Jackie Chan promotes asian sterotypes in his funny hollywood films and hence should be shot down as well.<br><br>Unfortunately, a cynical attitude towards this William Hung thing will be the one that will help drive in the racial divides, not William Hung himself. Why must our heros always be some chope suay super cool dude? That is not real. The thing about William Hung is that he's real, down to his lack of talent. That is his appeal.<br><br>Being mean and attack him personally, shows a lack on your own part to understand that not all humans measure up to the star yardstick, but all have their own unique value as well. That is the underlying ethos behind this bandwagon.<br><br>The truth is, why William is so popular is not because he presents asian sterotypes but simply because he's just that. There's nothing else to it. How often do you come across that in pop trash?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>he's not popular becos he's just that, he's popular because people here like to follow trends.. so whoever, whatever popular they follow what. They hear pple talking about william hung how innocent, sincere bla bla blah, so they go take a look and say 'wow' without even using their own minds to think whether he's worth such a big hooha. so they just go along worshipping him and becoming fans..<br><br>cmon pple get a life, there's more in life than william hung, drop the obsession and get along with ur life, this trend will probably die down soon, and next time pple will go 'william who?' and after that they will say he was not big deal. get the idea?<br><br>and now everyone wants him to be american idol?? cmon he has the qualities of a humble respectable person, but he definitely lacks the talent of the american idol.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> though being fans of respectable, sincere people is much better than chasing after good looking/pretty band members whose band cant get a high  note in tune and whose songs dont make a teeny bit sense <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

By a natural extension of your logic, it can be argued that Jackie Chan promotes asian sterotypes in his funny hollywood films and hence should be shot down as well.<br><br>Unfortunately, a cynical attitude towards this William Hung thing will be the one that will help drive in the racial divides, not William Hung himself. Why must our heros always be some chope suay super cool dude? That is not real. The thing about William Hung is that he's real, down to his lack of talent. That is his appeal.<br><br>Being mean and attack him personally, shows a lack on your own part to understand that not all humans measure up to the star yardstick, but all have their own unique value as well. That is the underlying ethos behind this bandwagon.<br><br>The truth is, why William is so popular is not because he presents asian sterotypes but simply because he's just that. There's nothing else to it. How often do you come across that in pop trash?</div></blockquote>With u on that... 100% agree.</div>
