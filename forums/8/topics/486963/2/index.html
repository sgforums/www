              <p>I'm not Singaporean and have never been to Singapore, but I am the son of a Malaysian mail-order bride in the UK. For these guys (ie, the scumbags), they view women as nothing more than objects for their own pleasure. Why? Usually because they are selfish, insecure and want to have complete control over their 'wife'. For them, they LOVE the idea that their 'wife' is financially trapped with them - it's more than just the security aspect, it's more of a kind of perverted sense of dominance, where the woman should be completely submissive, almost slave-like, all because it boosts these men's own ego.</p>
              <p>That's why, even though like I said I'm not Singaporean/have never been to Singapore, the SG government should kick out ALL foreigners (men particularly), because these men are exactly as I've described - in other words, no white, western woman would put up with these assholes, yet some self-hating (or more likely, mail-order bride from eg Thailand) who has no self-respect will. When you then add in the MASSIVE sense of racial superioty which ALL these guys have (trust me, they may seem like a nice guy on the surface, but deep-down...), then you get an absolutely lethal mix!</p>

              <p>Mail order brides are results of generations of gender inequality.</p>
              <p>Men and WOMEN perpetuates the problem.</p>
              <p>Women are prone to insecurities, and their over possessive nature are the root cause of female oppressions.</p>
              <p>Do you know why in the older generations, the China brides are Judged by their 3 inch feet ? Becuase mother in laws wants submissive daughters in laws. A bride with 3 inch feet cannot run away. They have to do their mother-in laws bidding.</p>
              <p>Mothers raised their own sons to disrespect women. Because mothers do not want their sons to love another woman more. </p>
              <p>Mother in Laws in Korea abuse their own daughter in laws, because they were previously abused by their own mother in laws. The vicious cycle continues.</p>
              <p>In these kind of society, nobody wants a daughter. So daughters are worthless. </p>
              <p>When a society do not value women, girls will be mistreated,and exploited. Boys grow up to disrespect and therefore feels entitled to oppress females.</p>
              <p>You do not see mail order brides from Singapore, Japan, better part of Europe or the Scandi. Only countries from the poorest region, women become mail order brides. </p>
              <p>I watched a documentary about a Post Soviet Union girl, who signed up to become a mail order bride. She wants a ticket out of her country, where females are treated badly, not only by the men, but also by the women. </p>
              <p>However, during the course of her search, she was strung along by foreign men, and her hopes were dashed. At the end of the documentary, she was shown still waiting, hoping for  the right "foreign" man to lift her out of her misery.</p>

              <p>You definitely make some good points, but are they all true? I mean, I don't know how women are treated in China generally, but aren't something like 40% of Chinese CEOs women? Compare that to the UK which is like 1%...obviously these countries have different cultures, so I can't really compare them that well, but just because a country is financially developed is just an illusion that it is socially developed...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I guess since you're from the area, you probably know a lot more about mail-order brides than me, but the impression I always got was that these women weren't leaving due to mistreatment/gender-inequality, but more because of the fact they've grown up seeing Hollywood movies, naively thinking they'll move abroad and live like a princess. Unfortunately for them, countries like the UK are pretty crappy and the kind of men they end up with are, well, bottom of the barrel...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh, and a point about Russia, for some reason they have a crazy gender imbalance. After WW2, I'm pretty sure it was something crazy like 30% more women than men. I'm not sure why, but even today amongst the younger generations, I think there's still a lot more women than men. Who knows, maybe they could cross the border into China and help with their gender imbalance lol</p>

              <p>I guess since you're from the area, you probably know a lot more
                              about mail-order brides than me, but the impression I always got
                              was that these women weren't leaving due to
                              mistreatment/gender-inequality, but more because of the fact
                              they've grown up seeing Hollywood movies, naively thinking they'll
                              move abroad and live like a princess. Unfortunately for them,
                              countries like the UK are pretty crappy and the kind of men they
                              end up with are, well, bottom of the barrel...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh, and a point about Russia, for some reason they have a crazy
                              gender imbalance. After WW2, I'm pretty sure it was something crazy
                              like 30% more women than men. I'm not sure why, but even today
                              amongst the younger generations, I think there's still a lot more
                              women than men. Who knows, maybe they could cross the border into
                              China and help with their gender imbalance lol</p>

              <p>Girls in these countries are becoming endangered. Men will have to share a woman. Children will be both cousins and brothers. These countries who discarded their girls will implode.</p>
              <p>If you are a woman and living in these countries, you'd want to flee too. It is cruel for mothers to have to abort their own child just because they are girls. </p>
              <p>So women flock to countries where there are strong women protection laws. </p>
              <p>Men are just a means for them to end up in a place where females are given freedom to live the life they want. Not having to kill their own child, or worry their daughters will be ill treated.</p>
              <p>They really don't quite care what kind of guy , they just need a man willing and able to help them leave their country.</p>

              <p>The men in their countries are already treating these women bad, what's worst is their own government has no laws to protect them.<span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;"> Even their own culture is against them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">They are not hoping for prince charming, they want to live in a place where women are protected. If the men will not protect them, at least the LAWS will. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I used to volunteer at a women's shelter in the USA when I was younger. I've seen plenty of foreign brides abused by their husband, trapped by their lack of legal knowledge for many years. Their husbands use the conditions of immigration laws to scare them into silence and submission. The husbands often threaten to deport them, or refused to complete the immigration process, that's how they keep their foreign brides on a short leash. Many of them have young children. <strong>Almost all of them have no regrets leaving their own country. </strong></span></p>
              <p>Not all their husbands are bottom of the barrel, some are actually upper middle income and even professionals. In USA, you need to provide an affidavit of support to bring in a foreign wife. You must prove that you can support them, you submit tax documents to prove you are above the poverty line.</p>
              <p>When a woman have nothing, there's only hope.</p>
              <p>Here's the link to Russian mail order bride documentary. <a href="http://youtu.be/2dYOw_Rd2VM">http://youtu.be/2dYOw_Rd2VM</a></p>

              <p>Then Russian men will have no wifes. Where will they find their brides ? At some point somethings gotta give.</p>
              <p>If the developed countries with strong women protection laws are willing to give free pass to these third world women, they will not need to marry crappy foreign men just to cross the borders.</p>

              The supply will always be there as long as the women need to flee their country.
              
              So what do you think is the reason for the demand ?
              The demand don't go away through legislation.
