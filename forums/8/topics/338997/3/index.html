              <p>i dated both. generally i think chinese man lose out to white guys. White generally bigger size as in taller and broader, more sense of security.</p>
              <p><br>They speak better and is more well learned. More romantic and open. They are also more forward, which is nice. If they find you attractive and like you, they will make sure you know it.</p>
              <p>Most important, they treat ladies as they should be treated.</p>
              <p>Therefore, i find it more interesting to go out with an angmo than chinese. Local chinese men simply are too shallow and narrow minded. Also no balls. Hardly dare to declare to the girl they like. Only when the girl seem to have someone else then they will do something. Yawnzzzz</p>
              <p>and they know how to romance a girl! lol</p>
              <p>talk abt romancing a girl to any local men....i think you will get a blank look..</p>

              <p>i also like white guys better.</p>
              <p>when they like you, they'll let you know it. take for instance the white 'bum' who sits on the street outside the supermarket i go to most often. he will often call me 'beautiful'. wahhh....lift my self-esteem for the day.</p>
              <p>very good at talking also. instead of just asking for money to spare, he'll say 'how about your number and a quarter so that i can call you'. heehee. so sweet hor... *gigglez*</p>

              <p>Some like thier women to be submissive la. I know of those white guys that go for asian girls cause they are MORE submissive then thier white counterparts. So to be honest , its preference.</p>
              <p>Submissive is alrite. I dun mind my girl being submissve, i treat her with love n care. Thats why its different , it depends on the guy n the girl. Sometimes aggressive guys like submissiev girls. N submissiev girls like aggresive guys that take control of things. its like + - . If u got  a + + it wont ngam. So it depends again. I just dun like nowadays they trying to instill as if women MUST NOT be submissive etc.. its just.. u know.. we need diversity.  There are reasons why we seek relationship with other people because sometimes 1 culture is just so predominantly.. SAME... n its no longer appealing to those of the same ethnicity or u guys call.. race.</p>

              thier white counterparts. So to be honest , its preference.</p>
              <p>Submissive is alrite. I dun mind my girl being submissve, i
              treat her with love n care. Thats why its different , it depends on
              the guy n the girl. Sometimes aggressive guys like submissiev
              girls. N submissiev girls like aggresive guys that take control of
              things. its like + - . If u got  a + + it wont ngam. So it
              depends again. I just dun like nowadays they trying to instill as
              if women MUST NOT be submissive etc.. its just.. u know.. we need
              diversity.  There are reasons why we seek relationship with
              other people because sometimes 1 culture is just so predominantly..
              SAME... n its no longer appealing to those of the same ethnicity or
              u guys call.. race.</p>

              <p>a bf once asked me when we were in the early stage of dating.
              "Shouldn't you be afraid of me?"</p>
              <p>i am like wtf!!?? y shld i be afraid of you? lol</p>
              <p>Then it occurred to me that he expects his women to cower and
              literally be afraid of him and not disobey him in everything -_-".
              submissive i guess is what he is looking for. i wondered at that

              <p>i tink white guys better at flattering girls ba. so leave a better first impression. chinese guys tend to hide their feelings, or express them in the opposite way of what they feel... (e.g. care for a girl but pretend tt he dun care...)</p>
              <p>maybe white guys have higher EQ? but for long term commitment, it's not the skin colour tt matters la. it's the upbringing and the character of the guy.</p>

              <p>White guys are more mature and worldly because :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Singaporeans only know how to study. They live at home, so know nothing about truly being independent or making their own decisions. Spending all the holidays being tutored, and doing homework after school, takes away some of your personality. You become much milder.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singaporeans are also more timid because of the censorship. That reduces the openness of people, and the range of topics you can passionately discus and debate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>White guys study very little in comparison, so they use their spare time moving out of home, socialising more. They also come from places which are much larger, so do more things and expereince things that Singaporeans literally have no chance of doing, be it mountain climbing, skiing, or even mowing the grass of your home's lawn.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. The white guys who come to Singapore arent the normal white guys. When you move to , say, the US, you will find white guys do all sorts of jobs, from garbage cleaners to plumbers, to president. Singaporean girls dont see the uneducated, lower class white people. They assume all white people are worldly and educated and so look up to them more than they should be looked up to.</p>
