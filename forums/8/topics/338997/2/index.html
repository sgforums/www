              <p>"Huge numbers"? I'm sorry, but they're a minority. I go to the establishments where they purportedly hang out, have seen the type before  and know when I do. Has it ever crossed your mind that the two you saw could have been call girls?</p>
              <p>Outside of this minority, girls are not as indiscriminate about age as that. I have no problems with interracial dating. I've dabbled in it myself. It makes them happy and you wouldn't consider each other in the first place, so why bellyache like your ego has been bruised?</p>
              <p>And by the way, I'm a lad.</p>

              <p>Duh ... let's put it this way easier for you lah...</p>
              <p>Yes.. there will always be some guys.. irregardless of what color.. will ill treat their woman. Asian guys included.</p>
              <p>The problem is.... Asian guys ... IN ASIA.. tends to be less desirable ... because of their culture and upbringing.</p>
              <p>I live in USA... your neighbour.. JUST comparing ASIAN guys who grew up in USA, are already better than the Asian guys who grew up IN ASIA.</p>
              <p>It has got nothing to do with color... it's the culture they carry that makes the difference.</p>

              <p>Be more specific on the culture n upbringing bit. Cause to me my friend is as chinese as i am. To name 1 friend then to compare. Lets see.. He has black hair. Like me.

He has that ABC look , born n bred there ,ate the food, listened to the music. While i got more sun then him , slightly more tan. mmm... lets see. His Primary n secondary school years is definately different from mine. But i was only educated outside on the last years of thier high school.  hmmm...  Uni outside. I agree socially it was different. I am half west half east.While he is 100% western educated.</p>
              <p>Lets see.. about culture. He knows what Chinese new year but doesnt know the date until he sees the decorations begin at china town. .. the comparison can go on n on.</p>

              <p>Well yet again, some of my girlfriends (friends only) are after white guys or fiji guys, because they reckon they are "good" in bed. A couple of them find them more romantic, I am Australian myself, I don't really see anything wrong for an asian girl dating an aussie guy or vice versa. Sometimes aussie guys have the worst taste in asian chicks, a mate when clubbing with me recently in Australia. His a whitey and he reckoned this chick was hot, when i looked at her I almost puked in my drink <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>About 4 years ago, I used to go out with an Aussie chick and it was pretty normal. I got a mate (from indonesia) who dated an pure aussie but she was obviously after his money, since he was loaded with cash and all.
