              <p>i dated both. generally i think chinese man lose out to white guys. White generally bigger size as in taller and broader, more sense of security.</p>
              <p><br>They speak better and is more well learned. More romantic and open. They are also more forward, which is nice. If they find you attractive and like you, they will make sure you know it.</p>
              <p>Most important, they treat ladies as they should be treated.</p>
              <p>Therefore, i find it more interesting to go out with an angmo than chinese. Local chinese men simply are too shallow and narrow minded. Also no balls. Hardly dare to declare to the girl they like. Only when the girl seem to have someone else then they will do something. Yawnzzzz</p>
              <p>and they know how to romance a girl! lol</p>
              <p>talk abt romancing a girl to any local men....i think you will get a blank look..  </p>

              <p>when they like you, they'll let you know it. take for instance the white 'bum' who sits on the street outside the supermarket i go to most often. he will often call me 'beautiful'. wahhh....lift my self-esteem for the day.</p>
              <p>very good at talking also. instead of just asking for money to spare, he'll say 'how about your number and a quarter so that i can call you'. heehee. so sweet hor... *gigglez*</p>

              <p>By the same token, given the need for someone to endorse their self-worth and the frequent need for "romancing", would it therefore not be fair to assume Asian women too are more insecure and suffer from a higher degree of low self-esteem than their White counterparts? Having dated both Asians and Whites, I could go on with an endless list on how else Asian women would fall short compared to Whites, in terms of their dire level of indepence, maturity, being street-smart, etc. In short, my point here isn't about which ethnicity is better; rather, it shows how naive and shallow some individuals can be in their judgment.</p>
              <p>That said, the bigger issue here stems from the culture more than any other factor like ethnicity, nationality or gender. Ultimately, rather than ethnicity, it's often the upbringing and environment that determines the character and personality of an individual.</p>
              <p>Jojobeach is actually right about something in terms of the culture - and this has nothing to do with gender - that affects the mindless stereotypes best examplified by the posts above. Having worked and lived extensively in Asia and Europe/US, it's laughable how some "acts" become "romantic" and "sweet" without first taking the cultural background of the society into consideration.</p>
              <p>In case people are shallow enough and have not actually realized, being "open" is actually a double-edged sword. Just as westerners - that would be the better word here as such traits are exhibited by many (regardless of ethnicity) with a "westernised" upbringing - are more likely to convey their fondness for you, they too are equally likely to express their displeasure at the slightest whim.</p>
              <p>Now, for those inferiority-complex ridden individuals who regard Whites (or any other baseless ethnic group) on a different pedestal, are you magnanimous enough to accept the downside of such "openness" graciously where Asians, in general, are still far more reserved and less outspoken?</p>
              <p>Ultimately, folks with low self-esteem will always suffer from a brand of inferiority complex that blinds them from judging the cold, hard truth of reality objectively. Maybe, travelling the world more extensively might jolt some out of their slumber.</p>

              <p>Not to mention, in terms of our subsequent character and attitude even though raised in east or west does not mean we become less desirable. One can be open but yet still be reserved, know when to be patient and when to express himself. I myself only recently dated western girls and they thought i was totally western educated but over time realised that i am not what they thought, and seem to suprise them with my culture that is from the east but yet i am able to still be 'open' and not falling into the usual stereotypes of asian men. I admit during the process alot of things were going in my head, one cant be totally urself as you need to take in consideration of thier 'culture'. Thats why observation , experience and action .</p>
              <p>But yeah.. ur points are well said. I wanted to explain in terms of culture n upbringing of what i thought ,  but couldnt bring write it out as well. lol.</p>

              i dun tink wanting to be romanced is the same as affirming self-worth leh. it's always nice to hear compliments right? no matter how confident a person is, he or she also needs to feel appreciated... to me, that's smth tt's very universal... 
              
              i believe the guys in this forum would like their women to compliment them too. 
              
              not to generalise... but i tink there are things both men and women can learn fr the ang mohs who come here... in terms of how we express ourselves... btw, i mean, specifically, the expats who work here k? so dun go n bring mormons or low-income ang mohs in the States and all that... :/
              
              however... in fairness hor... being open, like walesa pointed out... is really a double edged sword... i've seen locals happily married to ang moh guys... but i've also seen a fren who married a romantic ang moh guy who is so open tt he can be seen openly groping other asian women at parties...
              
              so ya. bottom line for the women is, dun settle for what's self-gratifying in the short term... must see whether the romance can continue into the future... asian guys not bad also la. :)

              <p>The real issue here has got nothing to do with money. rather how well the men from different culture do their mating dance.</p>

              <p>lol..  Those that stereotype and believs in white men more romantic. or white chicks more open. Yes.. sure... but they themselves refuse to believe that there are out there those that are as good.. or perhaps given different culture n upbringing, even better. They are also as attractive in another culutre.  There are ang moh girls that like the asian culture too... ;p</p>
              <p>its just that now we just tend to see more of those n many girls worship the western culture like gods because its not ur norm in ur culture n upbringings. I cant blame em. MTV power. LoL! The advertisings , the magazines..etc.. are not exactly helping either. lol</p>

              <p>Not to mention, in terms of our subsequent character and attitude even though raised in east or west does not mean we become less desirable. One can be open but yet still be reserved, know when to be patient and when to express himself. I myself only recently dated western girls and they thought i was totally western educated but over time realised that i am not what they thought, and seem to suprise them with my culture that is from the east but yet i am able to still be 'open' and not falling into the usual stereotypes of asian men. I admit during the process alot of things were going in my head, one cant be totally urself as you need to take in consideration of thier 'culture'. Thats why observation , experience and action .</p>
              <p>But yeah.. ur points are well said. I wanted to explain in terms of culture n upbringing of what i thought ,  but couldnt bring write it out as well. lol.</p>

              <p>For the sake of objectivity, I shall exclude myself from this assessment, but clearly, you're living proof that confident individuals who are sure of their own self-worth and identity will have no problems hooking up with supposedly "ethnically-superior" partners.</p>

              natives in USA. Although now America is considered as a western
              nation, but you should know that the White men in Western countries
              like America and the White men in Asian countries like Singapore
              are different. And the Asian men in Western countries like America
              and the Asian men in Asian countries like Singapore are
              different.</p>
