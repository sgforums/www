            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">by Phoenix Klaw and Kok Kok Kway</span><br><br>Senegal football star Papa Bouba Diop and his family have migrated here to help Singapore achieve its Goal 2010. As part of its search for foreign talent, the Gahmen has awarded citizenship to Papa Bouba Diop, his wife Mama Bouba Diop, his brother Adik Bouba Diop, his sister Ahuay Bouba Diop and his father Grandpa Bouba Diop. Grandpa Bouba Diop, Coach of the new Singapore team, just completed his Singlish course with the Coxford School of Singlish.<br><br><strong>TalkingCock</strong>: Welcome to Singapore, Grandpa. Can you tell us more about your strategy for the new Singapore team?<br><br><strong>Grandpa</strong>: My strategy is simple. The new team will just have 3 persons. Papa will play attack, Adik will be defence and Mama will be goalkeeper.<br><br><strong>TalkingCock</strong>: ErÂ…don't football teams usually have 11 players?<br><br><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Hiya, in Singapore, we do things differently. We can achieve greater efficiency and better coordination if we let a few persons control everything. And to compensate for the greater efforts put in by the players, I propose that their pay be pegged to a composite basket comprising Zidane, Vieri and Beckham's salaries. Want to get world class players, must pay world class salaries what. Of course, given Singapore's high cost of living, their salaries will be based on a "CPI + X" formula. Otherwise, the players sure lugi since your Gahmen frequently increase ERP, bus fares etc.<br><br><strong>TalkingCock</strong>: What will Ahuay do?<br><br><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Ahuay will contribute her genes to the Singapore. Your footballers all descended from riff-raff, so they donÂ’t have good genes. Mix genes with foreign talent, your next generation will have better potential. In fact, in the interest of the future, I am overturning the no-sex rule.<br><br><strong>TalkingCock</strong>: You are already 99 years old. Some people are worried everything will fall apart when you're "not around", if you know what I mean.<br><br><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Dun worry. I have a succession plan. If I die before 2010, I will pass on my place to someone, with strict instructions on how to run things. If he dun follow my guidelines, I will rise from my grave to see that Singapore qualifies for World Cup!! Don't underestimate our voodoo, okay!<br><br><strong>TalkingCock</strong>: There are concerns about potential nepotism in your teamÂ…<br><br><strong>Grandpa</strong>: What nepotism? We strictly believe in meritocracy one. Anyone who's not performing will be kicked out of the team. We have a strict and fair assessment process Â– Mama Bouba Diop made the decision, not me. I admit there's some conflict of interest lah, but this is for the greater good of SenegalÂ…I mean Singapore.<br><br><strong>TalkingCock</strong>: Wasn't Adik recently voted as the "Greatest Destroyer of Football Value in Africa"? Why is he still on the team?<br><br><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Aiyah, give him some more time to learn the ropes lahÂ… he has high Current Estimated Potential, and good genes. Of course, if you ask me, is he the best defender in the world? I donÂ’t think so. Is he the most cunning samba player? I donÂ’t think so. Can he bring in the fans, even if he colour his hair yellow, gel it into a fin or wear a mask? I donÂ’t think so. But there is no one better for the job. There is not enough talent in Singapore, which means we cannot sack anyone, even if their performance .. erÂ… has not been exactly stellar.<br><br><strong>TalkingCock</strong>: But he has been playing his present position for the past 15 years alreadyÂ…isn't that enough time for him to prove himself?<br><br><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Hey, you ask so many questions, why don't you play football for Singapore? You want to throw your hat into the ring? Then put on a pair of football boots and come shoot some penalty kicks, lah. I'll be goalie myself. Boh tua boh suay! Want to teach me how to run my team, is it? Smart aleck - got read my memoirs or not? I pit all my experience in coaching football against you. This is how football is run, OK?Everyone in FIFA gimme face. You young punks should just grow up Â….<br><br><strong>TalkingCock</strong>: Ok, ok, sorry if I've offended you, Grandpa. I think we'll end our interview hereÂ…<br><br><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Wait, I have a right to reply!! If you donÂ’t give me a right to reply, I will shut you downÂ…</div>
