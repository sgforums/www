Before you enter your room, press the doorbell or knock on the door regardless whether it is empty or not. It means to tell those 'friends' "sorry to disturb" or "sorry I/we need to stay for the night". It helps if you can say it vocally using the language of the country.<br>2. When you first enter, enter by your side. It means that if the room is indeed 'dirty, it will allow those 'friends' to exit before allowing the actual occupants enter.<br>3. Prepare a pair of slippers, one face up, one face down, place them at the door. It is to allow those 'dirty' things from outside to wear the slippers and leave.<br>4. At the front of the bed, put a glass of salt water. This is to ward off evil spirits.<br>5. Before using the toilet, flush it first. This is to get rid of whatever 'dirty' things left behind.<br>6. Do not move the Bible provided in the hotel room. Especially when it is open. Do not close it.<br>7. Try not to wear black or read clothes as much as possible. Wear more yellow. It can ward off evil spirits.<br>8. When you sleep, do close the toilet door. But do not switch off the toilet light.<br>9. Do not face the mirror when you sleep. This can summon evil spirits.<br>10. When you sleep at night, do not arrange your footwear neatly. The best is to place them one face up and one face down. At the same time, do not place footwear facing the bed. It is best to throw them around.</div></blockquote>may i ask why flip the slippers?<br><br>how long do i have to put the glass of water on the bed?<br><br>why need to have the slippers flip upside down?<br>and why need to throw them around?<br><br>why need to close the toilet door?<br><br><strong>Note: If you see any bible/buddhist books inside the cupboard, immediately request change of room, before you walk off, say sorry for disturbing, and you must mean it. </strong><br><br>to effectively ward off, you need to go to the temple to ask for some tailsman, those which has being bless for 7*7=49days.<br>wear it on our neck to ward off such brothers and sisters, treat them with respect too.<br><br><strong>Gentle Reminder:</strong><br>Ladies and Gentlemen, if you want to prevent yourself from having any chance of getting in contact with them, have more sunshine, don't stay under the moom light for too long. Long as in you often hide from the sun for months, than your Yin Qi will overwhelm your Yang Qi</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>They say that if you sleep facing the mirror, your soul will get lost in the other side when you dream. It may take many nights, with the mirror draining your soul bit by bit until you die, or worse, you get trapped entirely in the other world with "friends". <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

Before you enter your room, press the doorbell or knock on the door regardless whether it is empty or not. It means to tell those 'friends' "sorry to disturb" or "sorry I/we need to stay for the night". It helps if you can say it vocally using the language of the country.<br>2. When you first enter, enter by your side. It means that if the room is indeed 'dirty, it will allow those 'friends' to exit before allowing the actual occupants enter.<br>3. Prepare a pair of slippers, one face up, one face down, place them at the door. It is to allow those 'dirty' things from outside to wear the slippers and leave.<br>4. At the front of the bed, put a glass of salt water. This is to ward off evil spirits.<br>5. Before using the toilet, flush it first. This is to get rid of whatever 'dirty' things left behind.<br>6. Do not move the Bible provided in the hotel room. Especially when it is open. Do not close it.<br>7. Try not to wear black or read clothes as much as possible. Wear more yellow. It can ward off evil spirits.<br>8. When you sleep, do close the toilet door. But do not switch off the toilet light.<br>9. Do not face the mirror when you sleep. This can summon evil spirits.<br>10. When you sleep at night, do not arrange your footwear neatly. The best is to place them one face up and one face down. At the same time, do not place footwear facing the bed. It is best to throw them around.</div></blockquote>Mad, don't "avoid" them... "embrace" them... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Most people will leave the toilet light on, but did anyone think of this, what if something happen or some strange sound happened in the dead of the night, would you be feeling better with some light or without any? With light means there will be a high percentage of seeing "something" standing in a corner or floating around the room. No light means you will more likely to hide under the blanket and keep that position till morning.<br><br>Also, i've once seen my mum and grandmother going into the room, saying those whatever whatever, then take, if i'm not wrong, 5 cent coins and put into the four corners of the room. Anyone have that thing done before too?</div>
