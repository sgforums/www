              <p>common lah. This is how alot of bank agents get people to do investments. How do you think cases of aunties going market buy vege, ended up going home with $50K invested in some non money making Structure Deposits?</p>
              <p>With your NRIC they can access every account you have with the
                                      bank (be it UOB, DBS, OCBC, Abn Amro, Citibank, SCB, ICICI, HL,
                                      ANZ, etc) , the balances, if u had bought any investments, 
                                      FDs, insurance with the bank. They'll then decide if you have
                                      sufficient money to do investment, if yes, they'll ask you to have
                                      a seat. =)</p>
              <p>I've heard of a small handful of cases (meaning reported, not reported ones I dunno) where a male agent, used the address, dob, etc info from a female bank customer to try to date her.</p>
              <p>However being fair, there are alot of cases (and I really mean ALOT) where male customers tried to get fresh/date female bank agents. The male customers acted interested in investments, but they are trying to just chit chat with the female agents, stalk them, see if there are any potential of getting free "tofus".</p>
              <p>So conclusion, everywhere got good nuts, bad nuts. Understand TS got flanked by the investment agent, so just be more careful in future, and ask in depth why anyone needs your details.</p>

              <p>It is not as if you have no power. Why you so <em>quai</em>. You actually angry with yourself, so you hit out at the bank</p>
              <p>I went into OCBC at Bedok, looking for a saving account, with not lock-in and high interest.</p>
              <p>The "usher" there directed to an investment officer. I talked with the officer, telling her what I want, she told me of the products that the bank has. I told her specifically what I want. Then she told me that is closest to my requirements is a two year contributary savings account with insurance that has no lock-in and above average interest rate for the two years.  I told her  "No, thank you" and left.</p>
              <p>Nothing, no issue.</p>

              <p>I'm not impressed with UOB at all.</p>
              <p>I had 3 unpleasant experiences with them in 3 different branches - Jurong, Toa Payoh &amp; Geylang, all within a 6 month period. One was over the counter and 2 with their customer relation officers. I suspect they didn't have the proper training and therefore not professional enough to perform their job. I had to call their branch manager out to make a complain on 2 occasions.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/angry.png" alt="angry.png"></p>

              <p>actually, not just those relationship managers.......the bank tellers and counter staff are also another thing.</p>
              <p>sometimes, depending on your age and type of savings you've etc., after you've finished your transaction at the counter or waiting document processing, they will ask you whether you want to invest in any product and show you brochure......kinda all confusing to me.</p>
