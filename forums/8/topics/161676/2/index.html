            <div class='col-md body'>Wow, 'The Return' you must be Jesus?<br><br>Oo, great Jesus. Please do allow me to refresh your memory on the great and eternal words you preached.<br><br>1)The Bible Advocating Pillage, Rape and Murder.<br><br>Deuteronomy 20:10-14<br><br>As you approach a town to attack it, first offer its people terms for peace.  If they accept your terms and open the gates to you, then all the people inside will serve you in forced labor.  But if they refuse to make peace and prepare to fight, you must attack the town.  When the LORD your God hands it over to you, kill every man in the town.  But you may keep for yourselves all the women, children, livestock, and other plunder.  You may enjoy the spoils of your enemies that the LORD your God has given you.<br><br>2)The Bible Advocating the horror to enslave other races of people (Perhaps the strongest motivation amongst the New World Explorers, who went on to exploit the Indians, and then the Africans.)<br><br>Exodus 21:2-6 NLT<br><br>If you buy a Hebrew slave, he is to serve for only six years.  Set him free in the seventh year, and he will owe you nothing for his freedom.  If he was single when he became your slave and then married afterward, only he will go free in the seventh year.  But if he was married before he became a slave, then his wife will be freed with him.  If his master gave him a wife while he was a slave, and they had sons or daughters, then the man will be free in the seventh year, but his wife and children will still belong to his master.  But the slave may plainly declare, 'I love my master, my wife, and my children.  I would rather not go free.'  If he does this, his master must present him before God.  Then his master must take him to the door and publicly pierce his ear with an awl.  After that, the slave will belong to his master forever.<br><br>Dearest Jesus, its our time to get back and reign this world.<br><br>Truly, Judas.<br><br></div>

The Western world is seeing a minus 3 % decrease in Catholic followings; S.America is seeing -5%.

Please do allow me to refresh your memory on the great and eternal words you preached.<br><br>1)The Bible Advocating Pillage, Rape and Murder.<br><br>Deuteronomy 20:10-14<br><br>As you approach a town to attack it, first offer its people terms for peace.  If they accept your terms and open the gates to you, then all the people inside will serve you in forced labor.  But if they refuse to make peace and prepare to fight, you must attack the town.  When the LORD your God hands it over to you, kill every man in the town.  But you may keep for yourselves all the women, children, livestock, and other plunder.  You may enjoy the spoils of your enemies that the LORD your God has given you.<br><br>2)The Bible Advocating the horror to enslave other races of people (Perhaps the strongest motivation amongst the New World Explorers, who went on to exploit the Indians, and then the Africans.)<br><br>Exodus 21:2-6 NLT<br><br>If you buy a Hebrew slave, he is to serve for only six years.  Set him free in the seventh year, and he will owe you nothing for his freedom.  If he was single when he became your slave and then married afterward, only he will go free in the seventh year.  But if he was married before he became a slave, then his wife will be freed with him.  If his master gave him a wife while he was a slave, and they had sons or daughters, then the man will be free in the seventh year, but his wife and children will still belong to his master.  But the slave may plainly declare, 'I love my master, my wife, and my children.  I would rather not go free.'  If he does this, his master must present him before God.  Then his master must take him to the door and publicly pierce his ear with an awl.  After that, the slave will belong to his master forever.<br><br>Dearest Jesus, its our time to get back and reign this world.<br><br>Truly, Judas.<br><br></div></blockquote>From what I can see, you are completely ignorance.
