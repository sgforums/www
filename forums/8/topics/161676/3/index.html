But if he was married before he became a slave, then his wife will be freed with him.  If his master gave him a wife while he was a slave, and they had sons or daughters, then the man will be free in the seventh year, but his wife and children will still belong to his master.  But the slave may plainly declare, 'I love my master, my wife, and my children.  I would rather not go free.'  If he does this, his master must present him before God.

Careful study can help you understand why, but those directions have not been given to you.<br><br>Now take a look:<br><br>Q: In Dt 20:1-15, why did God permit offensive war?<br>A: This does not specify Canaanites or non-Canaanites. The Israelites needed to fight to overthrow the oppression of the Midianites, Ammonites, Syrians and others. This demonstrates that God was not a pacifist in the Old Testament, and likewise, He is not against all killing, such as executions for valid reasons, in the New Testament in Romans 13:4.<br><br>Q: Why do Ex 21:2-21 and Ex 32:1-6 condone slavery?<br>A: Most of the slavery in the Bible was not like slavery in the U.S. south, but similar to indentured servants. All Hebrew slaves were to be freed every seven years in Exodus 21:2-5. When the slave we freed, the ex-master was to furnish him or her liberally out of what the master had, according to Deuteronomy 15:13-15. The only exception to freeing a Hebrew slave was if the slave loved the master enough to choose to be a slave for life in Exodus 21:5-6. However, the Hebrews did not always free their slaves, as Jeremiah 34:8-22 shows; God rebuked them for that. The following became slaves:<br>Thieves who could not pay people back (Exodus 22:3)<br>Women sold by parents as concubines (Exodus 21:7-11)<br>People sold themselves as slaves if they were starving<br>See Hard Sayings of the Bible p.149-150 for more info.<br><br></div>

They tend to believe that if God is of love, then it isn't possible for God to destroy. It's actually an insecurity issue with the non-believer to believe that God severely punishes sin in the world.<br>I don't see Deuteronomy 20:10-14 as The Bible Advocating Pillage, Rape and Murder.<br><br>It's a perspective issue that changes between those who accept God's dominion over them, and those who don't. I see this passage as a methodical, strategic course of action to give an enemy of God the opportunity to give up it's evil ways first; and then saving all those who do, from themselves, by subjecting them to the ordinances and cultures of a tribe of people, whom are clear on God's demands for mankind, for a determined amount of years. The determined amount of years certainly indicates that the state of slavery here is like a forced "reform school" for the good of the person, rather than a permanent bondage to completely and unfairly defile the free will of the person for ever. Remember, man is not writing this Bible......God is....and his ways are not our ways. God sees things through a perspective based on long view; whereas, we see in a perspective based on short view. Also, important to note, is that slavery in ancient times was NOTHING like the slavery we think of today. It was often a second chance for life. For what would normally invoke a death sentence in ancient times was mercifully reduced by God in the passages you're speaking of. Non-believers are very one-sided, in that they cannot articulate the verse to mean anything else but "horror". It's because they see man writing the Bible himself and making it up as he goes along, instead of God mercifully thinking and planning behind the scenes within the Bible, while having to use rebellious, "horrible" man to do so. The Bible is brutally honest and it doesn't do a rush job on the edification of man's nature. It just provides the path, and if you look far enough, towards the long view of God, you can always find the ulterior motives of his guidance.<br><br></div>

The Israelites needed to fight to overthrow the oppression of the Midianites, Ammonites, Syrians and others. This demonstrates that God was not a pacifist in the Old Testament, and likewise, He is not against all killing, such as executions for valid reasons, in the New Testament in Romans 13:4.<br></div></blockquote>1) "Fight to overthrow oppression" is not the same as  supporting the wiping out of all humanity of the city one is attacking.<br>2) "Fight to overthrow oppression" is not the same as supporting the taking of children and wives.<br>3) "Fight to overthrow oppression" is not the same as attacking a city - they should already be in the city - "oppressing" them.<br>4) "God was not a pacifist in the Old Testament".<br>Was he in the New Testament?<br>Is he today?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Q: Why do Ex 21:2-21 and Ex 32:1-6 condone slavery?<br>A: Most of the slavery in the Bible was not like slavery in the U.S. south, but similar to indentured servants. All Hebrew slaves were to be freed every seven years in Exodus 21:2-5. When the slave we freed, the ex-master was to furnish him or her liberally out of what the master had, according to Deuteronomy 15:13-15. The only exception to freeing a Hebrew slave was if the slave loved the master enough to choose to be a slave for life in Exodus 21:5-6. However, the Hebrews did not always free their slaves, as Jeremiah 34:8-22 shows; God rebuked them for that. The following became slaves:<br>Thieves who could not pay people back (Exodus 22:3)<br>Women sold by parents as concubines (Exodus 21:7-11)<br>People sold themselves as slaves if they were starving<br>See Hard Sayings of the Bible p.149-150 for more info.<br></strong></blockquote>"Slavery in the U.S. south?" How about like the slavery of African tribes to other tribes, or of Spanish to South American natives?<br>And being from the "U.S. south," I can tell you that we also had a wonderful slavery condition - masters must free slaves all the time, however, a slave could choose to be a slave forever if he loved the master enough. Of course don't show "love" in the common way - it's something more deep, isn't it? But funny how history works - seems like most of the slaves loved the masters a lot, because they chose to stay.<br><br>History is just full of wonderful stories of such profound love.....<br><br>Blech.<br><br>All this crap about the "Sedition Act" can stop.
