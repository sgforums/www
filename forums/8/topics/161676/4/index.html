They tend to believe that if God is of love, then it isn't possible for God to destroy. It's actually an insecurity issue with the non-believer to believe that God severely punishes sin in the world.<br>I don't see Deuteronomy 20:10-14 as The Bible Advocating Pillage, Rape and Murder.<br><br>It's a perspective issue that changes between those who accept God's dominion over them, and those who don't. I see this passage as a methodical, strategic course of action to give an enemy of God the opportunity to give up it's evil ways first; and then saving all those who do, from themselves, by subjecting them to the ordinances and cultures of a tribe of people, whom are clear on God's demands for mankind, for a determined amount of years. The determined amount of years certainly indicates that the state of slavery here is like a forced "reform school" for the good of the person, rather than a permanent bondage to completely and unfairly defile the free will of the person for ever. Remember, man is not writing this Bible......God is....and his ways are not our ways. God sees things through a perspective based on long view; whereas, we see in a perspective based on short view. Also, important to note, is that slavery in ancient times was NOTHING like the slavery we think of today. It was often a second chance for life. For what would normally invoke a death sentence in ancient times was mercifully reduced by God in the passages you're speaking of. Non-believers are very one-sided, in that they cannot articulate the verse to mean anything else but "horror". It's because they see man writing the Bible himself and making it up as he goes along, instead of God mercifully thinking and planning behind the scenes within the Bible, while having to use rebellious, "horrible" man to do so. The Bible is brutally honest and it doesn't do a rush job on the edification of man's nature. It just provides the path, and if you look far enough, towards the long view of God, you can always find the ulterior motives of his guidance.<br><br></div></blockquote>Calling non christians deluded and biased is gentleness and respect?<br><br>geee<br><br>i learnt a new thing today<br><br></div>

They tend to believe that if God is of love, then it isn't possible for God to destroy. It's actually an insecurity issue with the non-believer to believe that God severely punishes sin in the world.<br>I don't see Deuteronomy 20:10-14 as The Bible Advocating Pillage, Rape and Murder.<br><br>It's a perspective issue that changes between those who accept God's dominion over them, and those who don't. I see this passage as a methodical, strategic course of action to give an enemy of God the opportunity to give up it's evil ways first; and then saving all those who do, from themselves, by subjecting them to the ordinances and cultures of a tribe of people, whom are clear on God's demands for mankind, for a determined amount of years. The determined amount of years certainly indicates that the state of slavery here is like a forced "reform school" for the good of the person, rather than a permanent bondage to completely and unfairly defile the free will of the person for ever. Remember, man is not writing this Bible......God is....and his ways are not our ways. God sees things through a perspective based on long view; whereas, we see in a perspective based on short view. Also, important to note, is that slavery in ancient times was NOTHING like the slavery we think of today. It was often a second chance for life. For what would normally invoke a death sentence in ancient times was mercifully reduced by God in the passages you're speaking of. Non-believers are very one-sided, in that they cannot articulate the verse to mean anything else but "horror". It's because they see man writing the Bible himself and making it up as he goes along, instead of God mercifully thinking and planning behind the scenes within the Bible, while having to use rebellious, "horrible" man to do so. The Bible is brutally honest and it doesn't do a rush job on the edification of man's nature. It just provides the path, and if you look far enough, towards the long view of God, you can always find the ulterior motives of his guidance.<br><br></div></blockquote>You so lor-saw abt god love and u called that not evangelising?<br><br>ok, another thing learnt today<br><br></div>
