            <div class='col-md body'>As an avid supporter of performing arts, I have attended numerous concerts and watched countless performers unveil their forte. Today, I am glad to be able to grace a splendid performance put up by Â“China Disabled PeopleÂ’s Performance Art TroupeÂ”. The bravura of talents despite being physically handicapped amazed me greatly. The moral which the troupe is trying to bring to all of us it that, Â“life itself is a blessingÂ”.<br><br>The performers consist of teenagers and young adults who are deaf and mute, lost a limb or both, the blind and the half-paralysed. However, in spite of their disadvantage, perseverance and determination, coupled with their enthusiasm and optimism, they proved that although they are handicapped, they still live life to the fullest and can even contribute to performing arts.<br><br>The first item is a dance number, performed by a group of deaf-and-mute girls. They cannot hear the music, but with guides helping to signal them the beats, they put up a really impressive routine, in unison and synchronization. As a former dancer and having watched other professional dancers, I must applaud them for their top-grade performance.<br>Those dainty steps, sharp yet graceful moves captured my attention entirely. These girls execute other dance numbers in equally high standard.<br><br>Beethoven was deaf but he still composed great music. This spirit live in this 17-year-old boy too, just that he was not deaf, but blind. Without music scores, unable to see the keys, but he presented a difficult piece (in my opinion as a pianist) in absolute accuracy, complete with the confidence and poise of a musician. Needless to say, this item gained loud applause from the audience.<br><br>Another blind man, he has never seen the world, yet able to portray the colours of life in his song so vividly. He sings about the blue sky, the green meadow, and the galloping horses with superb stance. His voice is rich with feelings and full of vibe. Another huge round of applause.<br><br>The item which stir the most hype tonight is the dance item performed by 5 men who each lost a leg. Armed with their crutches, they move their body to the music. They even managed some acrobatic stunts. Although they have difficulty in walking, they are nimble on stage and have a good sense of balance. This showed that they have undergone tough training and their strong will powered their determination to overcome their weakness and bring zest onto the stage. This group bagged an award in an international dance competition alongside physically-healthy competitors and strict judging.<br><br>Towards the end of the show, a short speech made by ex-world-gymnast Sang Lan, made me rethink about life. Her dream of conquering the gymnastics world is shattered when she injured her spine during a competition when she fell awkwardly from the vault. It rendered her paralysed from the waist down since. I watched her fell (on a footage of the 1998 Goodwill Games) and as a former gymnast, I can very much understand the impact it has on her. Yet, she is able to overcome her dejection and carried on with life with optimism and brightness. I bet all other performers in this troupe have gone through, or are going through this rough patch of the lives.<br>On this note, kudos to Â“China Disabled PeopleÂ’s Performing Art TroupeÂ” for tonightÂ’s brilliant performance, which is very enriching and inspiring. The best performance by an Art Troupe I have ever watched. Physically-handicapped does not mean your life and hopes ends there. With an iron will and the resolution to overcome all difficulties, one is able to lead a normal and happy life. Tonight I truly see and experience for myself this powerful spirit for life. Indeed, life itself is a blessing.<br></div>
