            <div class='col-md body'>DAmn shitty man....<br>i recently ordered 2 vcd's through the net...<br>the movies blade &amp; the mummy.<br>To my suprise i received a letter from the post office stating that the discs i ordered had been seized by the censors board &amp; that i had to collect it in a week. When i went down....they refused to pass me the Blade disc as they said it was to violent!!<br>I dunno why they see the need to control what i'm viewing personally. It's not like i brought in a whole shipment ....i just brought in a copy for myself!!!<br>Another thing is that guys under 21 yrs old are not allowed to go for R(A) show,but not all R(A) shows are that bad or about sex only!!!For example,"The English Patient" and "Fight Club".The government thinks that guys under 21 yrs old are old enough to protect the country by going to NS but not old enough for R(A) movies and make their decisions about what they wanna watch???The government seems to think that Singaporeans can't think for themselves and deceide what is right &amp; wrong and try to restrict peoples actions by passing absolutely ridiculous laws, such as the ban on chewing gum.<br>So I will appreciate it if U all send me your opinions!<br><br>U can visit me at Changi Prision because of this topic!!!</div>

If the economic recession had started several years eariler, I would have betrayed myself by signing on in the civil service.<br><br>That's the problem huh? Government is controlling everything (including the net. Who knows? This website may also be supervised by govt secretly...). Sigh... I've not made even my 1st million. Once I've made my 3rd million, probably I'll migrate over to NZ with my wife.<br><br>Don't u guys find the life here very tensed up? Guys MUST serve NS at 18, everybody MUST go for GCE Exams, NO SPEEDING, No This, No That. Understandable that is for the good of the people, but at least give us some freedom (aka Breathing Space?) to do at least something of our own?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When you order video cassettes, VCDs, etc from abroad, try to get the senders to package the stuff in an envelope that doesn't indicate it's from a video company and doesn't declare its contents as "video"... you know, say "printed matter" or something. That should escape the scrutiny of the bastards and psychos at the post office and censorship board.<br><br>I had a similar experience back in 1996. They seized a video cassette I ordered from Italy, sent me a green notice, asking me to collect the stuff after two weeks 'cos damn Singapore Post passed the video to the censorship board. And at the end of it all I had to fork out an additional $15 to get the video back... $15 supposedly for the Video Certificate (licence to own the video) -- censorship service charges, whatever... And how did they censor? Those cut scenes are simply replaced by the noisy white thing you get when you press record without a source... WTF... THEY BRUTALISED MY TAPE and actually saw it as some sorta chargeable service for me?! Why, THANK YOU! Amazing, isn't it? Only the Singapore govt can do that and get away scot-free.<br><br>So to avoid all that trouble, you can and should tell your video senders to not state explicitly the contents of the merchandise -- say it's a book/printed matter or something. Never ever indicate it's video/cassette/dvd/vcd/cd or any other form of multimedia.<br><br>From what I know they aren't usually that strict if it's a book 'cos I've had a friend who received Playboy via normal mail... =)<br></div>

Can't understand, the main aim is to let the gals in free and guys will follow suit rite ? But seems that the mgt lifted the age limit to cater for more working class.
