If the authorities know how to manage the foreign workers and keep them occupied when they are not working it won't be such a bother and nuisance.<br><br>Don't anyone built or designate a makeshift shelter for construction workers to rest during their meal breaks? Don't they allow the workers to go for breaks in shifts or taking turns? On the worker's part don't they know they are setting a bad impression of the conutry where they are from?<br><br>Worse now as long as you see any construction sites you will see them hogging like its their own country. They might have built them but they don't own them.

Who do u more often see lying on pavement , vomiting everywhere and a % of them getting aggresive and picking fight ???  and they give trouble to who??? To their own ppl (we singaporeans)<br><br>And you also mention about we ns boys , who spend 2yrs of our life in bunks , and we can pull thru it ....<br><br>My question to u is , Do we have the option of going home and sleep????<br><br></div>
