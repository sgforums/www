Let me take example A. His parents were divorcee and his parents does not even give a damn to him.<br><br>Friend B, his dad who likes to gamble beats him up now and then whenever he loses some money.<br><br>Friend C, his dad has 2 wives, 1 locally and one overseas, his dad rarely returns to Singapore. At home, his mom dotes on the daugther more than him and always find fault with him.(That was even before he become a ah beng.)<br><br>Yes, I agree to a certain extend that some people join gangs because they are afraid of being bullied. Most "bengs" do not think beating someone is heroic, it's just their mentality that violent is the way to solve everything. They are used to violence.<br><br>By the way, the police live on tax-payer money. It is us, the tax payer who pays the police their monthly salary. The Godlike gang is the rich people, not the police.<br><br>Don't speak like a loser.<br><br></div></blockquote>Wah lau eh tango<br>not  tat i want to argue with u<br>but i didnt say ALL ah bengs wat<br>i said MOST of them join cos no backup blah blah blah<br>aiyoh<br>and the godlike thing?<br>its jus a phrase i use...not serious<br>and pls<br>dont call me a loser<br>i also got joined gangs b4 mah..<br>so i kinda know wats it like<br>like u<br>i also regretted it<br>TO everyone out there dont join gangs<br>even if the HEAD of the gang give u a high post<br>only give u more damn troubles!<br><br>------------------<br>Life is full of irony, somethings in like u can never get no matter how hard you try...</div>
