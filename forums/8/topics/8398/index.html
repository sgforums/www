That is a very disappointing show. Lots of "powder" fights..so yucks.Even when 2 swords clashed also got 'smoke'...<br><br>ok, back to the dinos. Kind of diappointed too.

Its so realistic and breathtaking. The graphics were simple spectacular - just looking at the  scaliasus (Uh - how do you spell it again?) drinking water in the river with all the foam, its so realistic and the way the plants swaved in the wind, it looks so real. I loved the whole episode - pity that it seemed so abrupt (most documentaries are 1 hour anyway) and the whole storyline is so obviously scripted. But overall I most say that I'm now a devotee to this show and wont miss it every week :-)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Selena, same idea with you, I love this documentary, though it was a bit short and too abrupt towards the end. Too bad, it's only half an hour and it focuses on some prehistoric creatures of triassic period only.<br><br>For the dinosaurs, the main focus was on Coelophysis (SEE-low-FY-sis)<br><img src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dinosaurs/games/postcards/images/g_ep_s1_pic1.gif"><br>only and it was only towards the end of the show that Plateosaurus (PLAT-ee-oh-SAW-rus)<br><img src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dinosaurs/games/postcards/images/g_ep_s1_pic5.gif">  appeared, and nothing much was talk about it?! What a shame!<br><br>Throughout the show, it least we know that dinosaurs are not the only competitor, there are other mammals-like reptile that survived during that time, like Placerias(plah-SEE-ree-ass) <img src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dinosaurs/games/postcards/images/g_ep_s1_pic4.gif"> , Cynodont (Si-NO-dont)  <img src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dinosaurs/games/postcards/images/g_ep_s1_pic2.gif">  and the largest predator of that time,Postosuchus (POEST-oh-SOOK-uss).<br><br>Selena, Postosuchus  <img src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dinosaurs/games/postcards/images/g_ep_s1_pic6.gif">  is what you are talking about. Very realistic, as the producer of this program try to portray the Postosuchus drinking at a nearby river with foam in his mouth.<br><br>Anyway, I hope that all will learn something from this program. There ought to be some awareness and not just to be engross in your own social life.<br><br>Science is out ultimate future!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For such advanced 3D graphics,i find that 1/2 hour for a program per episode is quite enough as such things are not easy to create and also time consuming to boot.Therefore,they can make it 1/2 hour per episode,i very happy liaoz as the dinosaurs really looked realistic,ehehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>When you were born, you were hungry and everyone around you was full.
