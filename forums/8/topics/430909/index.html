              <p>Recently, went  for their Master of Sc in info sys preview. Many foreigners and expensive fees. But must say very pro student facilities - even provide dinner and weekend classes. </p>
              <p>You want first hand views of their course, nothing beats going down to the campus and talk/interview the students there. But don't just talk to few but sizeable number so that you get unbias feedback. </p>

              <p>Hi there..</p>
              <p>If you are joining SMU, be prepared for lotsa mugging and fluffing. There will be shitloads of projects. Interesting and fun sometimes, depending on your groupmates.</p>
              <p>You won't be bored in classes. Laptop is right in front of your face all the time. For most modules that is. Haha.</p>
              <p>Campus life is pretty not too bad. The activities, events, fellow undergrads, location.</p>
              <p>Personally, I enjoyed my 4 years there. The emphasis on being vocal definitely helped me and I'm thankful for that. Haha. I like the learning atmosphere as everything is quite techie. Plus air-conditioned everywhere! And I'm one who can't study if I feel stuffy and uncomfortable. My only complaint was probably food. Blardie expensive everywhere.</p>
              <p>No problems with finding job after graduate. Well at least for me and the SMU people I know. =)</p>
              <p>Good luck and all the best! Don't mug too hard. Enjoy uni life more. No point chasing grades too much. Haha.</p>

              <p>Yea can squeeze into 3 years if you want.. There were people doing that but what's the point? Enjoy uni life lah haha.. But i did mine in 3.5 years though haha. Played with the system a bit.. =D SMU was suppose to have a system with small class size so that there would be more interactions between the professor and the students. That was what enticed me in the first place. No more lectures style. Had enough of that stuff in JCs. Hated it thats why I preferred SMU. However, they took in so many students that typical modules started to have like 30+ students which took that interaction element away. Fortunately, I had some classes whereby there were only 10 students and it was more enjoyable and sincere. Lesser wayang-ing competitive students.</p>
              <p><br>Gd Luck!! Enjoy your stay haha!</p>

              <p>Audit is really hell. Haha. But it's like the survival of the fittest. You survive you reap the rewards. But most people chose audit to suffer at most 2-3 years then they will run away. They go for the experience and credibility. But not everyone in big4 suffers lah. Those who are not in audit are pretty much comfortable relatively.</p>
