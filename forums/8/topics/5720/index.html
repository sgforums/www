            <div class='col-md body'>well... i think i'm a passive, shy guy hehehe... first of all, calling her everyday or asking her out every weekend is bad... u look too desperate, too psycho, and too free. sure, u'd be giving her the impression dat u like her but its too strong... u should take ur time. trying to get a girl is all about patience and timing like fishing... u must know when to pull da fish but u must also know when to loosen the line... pull to hard, the line will break and ur fish will be gone. .. r u frens with this person? if not, then make frens with her first... it always starts out better if u and her are frens (not close frens ok? dun want u to tell her everything abt u... must be mysterious as well) once the frenship thing is going, ask her out for dinner or a movie... i never straight out tell a girl dat i'm interested in her... give subtle hints if u want to(girls are smart at catching hints and analyzing guy behaviours) if the first outing is a success and she truly enjoys ur company, then there's hope and u can ask her if she wants to do something together again sometime later... if she says yes, good sign... u on rite track... but before u arrange anyting with her on da spot, tell her u'll call her back coz u got to check ur schedule and see if u'll be free whenever... and then call her up few days later and blah blah.. u know da rest... da main point i'm getting here is take ur time and dun be too eager into a relationship. girls can be easily scared off by a desperate suitor... this style suits me coz i dun like to get rejected and i'm shy so it allows me to test the waters and gives me time... plus it lets u be more or less in control of the situation and urself so u dun lose ur mind and do something stupid in front of her... i hope wat i said helps... i dunno really know da whole situation so improvise if u can hehehe.. all da best =)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ummm I hv a feeling that all you guys thought I am a guy, so FYI I am a 20yr old gal. I asked that question coz I am not sure of someone's feelings.<br>When I first got to know him about 3 months ago, his fren told my fren that he wants to get to know me better and asked if I am attached. I was still attached then.<br>Last month he asked me out on a date and I agreed. I had broke up wz my bf then.<br>He does not call me often. I was always the one who call him to make arrangements (we go clubbing as a group and I am the 'middlewoman', so I call everyone to fix the time). But everytime I call him we would tok for very long and I always had to hang up coz my mum always nag that I use the phone too long.<br>Also recently I hv asked him out three times of which we went out only once. The first time it was a casual movie date. The second, I asked him out to help me with something, and the last time I helped my fren to ask him out wz us (needed his help again). He went on the first date, but on 2nd date, he could not make it coz of work. the last one, he was sick.<br>So guys wat do you all think? I admit I am rather an outgoing person while he is as I hv described a passive person.<br><br>------------------<br>Who says the best LOVE will always last?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think maybe you shouldn't try to figure out whether he is interested in you or not. trying to find the answer would only fustrate yourelf and make yourself miserable. call him when you want to talk him, ask him out if you want to see him. as long as you two enjoy the company each of you are providing then let the friendship develop.<br>the seed of friendship will have will eventually bloom. whether it bears "fruits", what kind of "fruits", let time tell.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
