            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I am familiar with Jeet Kune Do (JKD, aka Bruce Lee's art). I actually won't take 3 steps back if I am sure there will be trouble.. Taking 3 steps back is giving the robber more strategic space to move. Sounds complicated, but it's not if you think carefully.<br><br>If you know that trouble is unavoidable I suggest attacking first. Lunge at the fella and wack him. Even if he has a knife, he will be startled enough for you to do some damage. You will get hurt. He will probalby stab and slash at you.<br><br>But if you take 3 steps back, you have given him a longer reach. A man with a knife has a longer reach than a man without a knife. The knife is like an extension of his hand. If you lunge at him, at least some of the advatages of the knife such as longer reach will be neutralized.<br><br>Just my 2 cents worth. As they say in JKD, every man has his way, and use the way that fits you best.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by vivasg:</div><div class="quote_body">hi chanjyj,<br><br>I agree wat you saying, if is with knife is dangerous.<br>but think about this. you do not know wat ur life will end up to, been kill in brutal way, rape etc...<br><br>definitely if with knife we have to be very calm. to play safe we can give the robber our money but not life. try to give him but not letting him come near you because u cannot protect urself already once he within the range that he can hurt u. Best of all maintain a distance.. he step in 3 steps u back off 3 steps. Look at his whole body.<br><br>At this circumstances is hard to advice wat one should do. but main thing is is to stay calm, if u are panick, nervous, ur body is stiff and cannot response well to protect urself.<br><br>Remember one thing, u do not need to be a exponent in martial art or wat so ever. just focus hitting the attacker most vulnerable part with all ur strength such as the throat, nose, eye. u must be brutal in ur response to enable the attacker feel the pain.<br><br>And best of all, put a stick in ur car, to have u self protected.<br><br>And also please stand out to help anyone that in danger. Do not just stand aside and watch. This way we can together to curb the crime.<br>All the best <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Chanjyj,<br><br>Ya I agree with you, different ppl have different style.<br>for me if you let the attacker too near you ,is too hard to response unless as u said u attack him first, but if he really just a person who asking direction, then u maybe beating a wrong guy.<br><br>my style was i would keep distance because we can know wat to response as we have a whole view of his body movement, if he taking strike we can then strike immediately. Anyway tat was my style <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> appreciated your sharing as well.<br><br>MisterMoon<br>First of all thanks for your comments.<br>I agree your point. but sometimes is a bit unfair to compare singapore and malaysia.

            <div class='col-md body'>Read the folllowing article. This is akin to the "politically-correct" but insulting denial of racism against blacks in the US many years ago. Think about it for yourself (see the evidence and use common sense) - the truth is obvious.<br><br><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/194975.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.todayonline.com/articles/194975.asp</a><br>JOHOR Â— Johor police have come under fire for acting too slowly to clamp down on crime, following a brutal gang rape in Tampoi last week. Since April (only 2 months ago), at least four rape cases have been reported*, including one that involved the rape of a pregnant woman who was abducted in a car-jacking at a petrol station. It is understood that all the rape victims in recent cases were Chinese. Yesterday, politicians urged the community not to turn the incidents into a racial issue. State Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) chief Chua Soi Lek urged the public to remain calm. "Do not let racial sentiment go to your head and turn the crime issue into an emotional topic," he urged. "The criminals picked their victims randomly and the public should not think that a particular race is being targeted."<br><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/194975.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.todayonline.com/articles/194975.asp</a><br><br>* common knowledge : for every rape that is reported, many others go unreported.</div>
