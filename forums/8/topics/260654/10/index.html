            <div class='col-md body'>i think cannot say tat, everywhere also have crime. in singapore ppl cut ppl to pieces... etc...<br><br>Personally i stay in jb as well and drive a sg SUV.<br>I think main thing is... must be street wise and alert no matter where you are.<br><br>Got one time when my car broke down in the middle of the night, one guy stop and try to ask for direction.. he walk near me 3 steps and i would back off 3 steps so he can be in my full view where i can know every action of his body. Maybe he meant no harm but for safety we give no chance for any bad thing to happen.<br><br>Just like if u putting a wallet/hp on a table in hawker centre either in sg or m'sia it does happen ppl grab and run. But if u don't put ur wallet/hp there, it would have prevent these kind of things happen.<br><br>Sometimes u must be brave/calm when encounter any bad things. don't be scared till u have no strength to move.<br>When calm u can think proper solution<br>And be brave, and be more agressive than the attacker and u can protect urself. u afraid of pain, ur attacker also afraid of pain.<br><br>Think of death is nothing at the point ur life is at stake, u will then able to be  safe. if u scare of death, u be afraid and lose calm and do not know wat to react. Definitely if u know martial art can play one role to protect ur own self as well. But main thing is 'BE CALM'<br><br>Also one time when i was at my friend house in broad day light, a thief was stealing the gas. the neighbour saw and keep quiet. So i go and scream to the thief, but thief was not even panick and even slowly throw the gas outside the compound of the house. So tat time i took a wooden staff and try open the door and give a chase only then he immediate ride motor bike off.<br><br>because nowsday ppl outside look strong and muscle but inside are timid and weak that cz more and more crime to take place.<br>Lets be brave and be more helpful to each other then we can create a peaceful world no matter where we are.<br><br>If today we don't help ppl in need, future when we in need we will meet the same kind of ppl who don't help us.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Almost everything he said is right. It is extremely hard to DISARM someone, even for me. (Well, IMHO I consider myself pretty skilled)<br><br>You can either ATTACK him, or RUN. RUN is the best. If you attack him, don't every try to disarm him unless you are Bruce Lee... And be prepared to see blood. there is always blood. Don't faint at the sight of blood.<br><br>Most people here talk so much about "self defence", but they don't realise how difficul it is to actually put a knife into someone.<br><br>quote]Originally posted by SingaporeTyrannosaur:<br><strong><br><br>The first thing you learn in self defence is how to avoid getting into trouble in the first place.<br><br>The second thing you need to learn is how to win without fighting, and that is either by defusing the situtation or simply running away, especially if the robber does not have a ranged weapon or leaves you with an escape route (not surrounded).<br><br>Despite what we learn, things like weapon (gun/knife) disarms are to be used only as a last resort (like the guy really trying to kill you) and to give you the knowledge of what to do if you really have no choice.<br><br>I have a bowie knife and know that a good cut by it is usually to the bone, and most people don't stab or slash at you like in your drills and there is just too little margin for error. Factor in the possibility of multiple opponents and you see just how dangerous it can be. Run if you can, and fight only as a last resort.<br><br>If faced with a knife, the best thing to do is simply to run or get a ranged weapon or shield (like a chair) to defend yourself. Carrying a knife yourself might get you in trouble with the law and chances are the robber would have deployed his piece long before you do and you need at least 12-20 feet of space to draw your own safely assuming he lunges at you the moment you try to get your own piece. Never fight a knife unarmed unless you have no choice, the knife defence skills you learn are good, but they are not to be abused in their application that might get you killed.<br><br>Running works if the person does not have a firearm to do his robbery. Never go into a space you are not sure you can't escape in quick order. And yes, travel in groups if you can.<br><br>In the couple's case, they simply should have kept running after they reached the dead end where a car cannot go... it is unlikely the robbers would follow them on foot if they have gotten a good headstart. But of course the girl might not be up to the run.<br><br>Alternatively, the best way to react to a dude trying to ram you off the road or chasing your car is to engage him directly and aggressively (assuming his car is not an overmatch for yours).<br><br>And yes, don't drive into roads you have no idea off... as long as your car is moving, even if it's very slowly you are quite safe and the robbers can't get you (even if they keep ramming you).<br></strong>[/quote]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi chanjyj,<br><br>I agree wat you saying, if is with knife is dangerous.<br>but think about this. you do not know wat ur life will end up to, been kill in brutal way, rape etc...<br><br>definitely if with knife we have to be very calm. to play safe we can give the robber our money but not life. try to give him but not letting him come near you because u cannot protect urself already once he within the range that he can hurt u. Best of all maintain a distance.. he step in 3 steps u back off 3 steps. Look at his whole body.<br><br>At this circumstances is hard to advice wat one should do. but main thing is is to stay calm, if u are panick, nervous, ur body is stiff and cannot response well to protect urself.<br><br>Remember one thing, u do not need to be a exponent in martial art or wat so ever. just focus hitting the attacker most vulnerable part with all ur strength such as the throat, nose, eye. u must be brutal in ur response to enable the attacker feel the pain.<br><br>And best of all, put a stick in ur car, to have u self protected.<br><br>And also please stand out to help anyone that in danger. Do not just stand aside and watch. This way we can together to curb the crime.<br>All the best <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
