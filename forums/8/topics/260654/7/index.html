            <div class='col-md body'>I symphatize with the couple especially with the girl.. It is a really sad sad situation there in malaysia.. its getting from bad to worst.. their police is really a big question mark.. its hardly safe.. but then again, we are talking from our point of view whereby our country is a huge contrast. But thats easy for us because SG is a small country. Easily monitored and controlled. It takes time to really clean up the rubbish in countries as big as malaysia, indonesia and so on. That is if the government is willing to do so. You see what advancement in technology and globalization is doing to our country. In a big country like malaysia, the negative impacts are accelerated. It's really a sad case.. but i hope we all dont over generalise. thats really a sad issue too. race has nothing to do with it..</div>

The couple was taking a leisurely drive in a Proton Iswara towards Johor Baru, when a Toyota Altis rammed into their car from behind on a lonely road in Gelang Patah.<br><br>The 22-year-old boyfriend, who was at the wheel, was worried about his 19-year-old girlfriend and felt uneasy about stopping as there were four burly men in the car which had rammed their car.<br><br>He drove on and tried to get to a crowded area while his girlfriend frantically called her elder brother on her cell phone and told him that they were being pursued by a group of men.<br><br>However, after a few kilometres, the coupleÂ’s car broke down and they were forced to stop.<br><br>The four men confronted the couple. One of them slashed the boyfriend on his legs with a parang.<br><br>They were also robbed of their wallets, jewellery and cell phones.<br><br>The robbers then bundled the couple into their car and took them to a hut in Taman Tampoi Indah about 40km away.<br><br>There, the robbers took turns raping the girl while her boyfriend was forced to watch.<br><br>Meanwhile, the girlÂ’s brother who was driving around Taman Perling searching for his sister, chanced upon a police patrol car.<br><br>[b]According to MCA Youth Public Service and Complaints Department deputy chief Rodney Soon, the policemen in the car listened to the girlÂ’s brother before driving off. </strong><br>The couple was released about 1.30am.

            <div class='col-md body'>I really feel sorry for the couple esp the girl.i guess they are unlucky to encounter this.<br><br>Let this be a lesson to everyone,esp singaporeans who enter jb.They must be more alert when travelling to other countries.The fact is,crime is EVERYWHERE.Do u know that an average of 5 car hijacks occur every few minutes in South Africa.It is so rampant that they even have a radio station set up for this purpose.Hijacked car owners can call to the station and the dj announce on radio to look out for the hijacked car.<br><br>I guess cos singaporeans have been too well protected by the system such that we tend to lose the survival instinct in us.Our system has let us to let our guard down and thats the greatest error one can make when travelling.Survival instinct is very important when it comes to preventing crime and being prepared for it.The thing is that when we travel to other pple's territory,we are always at a disadvantage.Doesn't matter is jb,KL,china or where.Hence we need to be even more vigilant and not take things for granted.<br><br>To those who drive into jb,maybe u cud buy one or even two baseball bats and put in your car.clear customs sure no prob oso <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

But thats easy for us because SG is a small country. Easily monitored and controlled. It takes time to really clean up the rubbish in countries as big as malaysia, indonesia and so on. That is if the government is willing to do so. You see what advancement in technology and globalization is doing to our country. In a big country like malaysia, the negative impacts are accelerated. It's really a sad case.. but i hope we all dont over generalise. thats really a sad issue too. race has nothing to do with it..</div></blockquote>valid point..

Factor in the possibility of multiple opponents and you see just how dangerous it can be. Run if you can, and fight only as a last resort.<br><br>If faced with a knife, the best thing to do is simply to run or get a ranged weapon or shield (like a chair) to defend yourself. Carrying a knife yourself might get you in trouble with the law and chances are the robber would have deployed his piece long before you do and you need at least 12-20 feet of space to draw your own safely assuming he lunges at you the moment you try to get your own piece. Never fight a knife unarmed unless you have no choice, the knife defence skills you learn are good, but they are not to be abused in their application that might get you killed.<br><br>Running works if the person does not have a firearm to do his robbery. Never go into a space you are not sure you can't escape in quick order. And yes, travel in groups if you can.<br><br>In the couple's case, they simply should have kept running after they reached the dead end where a car cannot go... it is unlikely the robbers would follow them on foot if they have gotten a good headstart. But of course the girl might not be up to the run.<br><br>Alternatively, the best way to react to a dude trying to ram you off the road or chasing your car is to engage him directly and aggressively (assuming his car is not an overmatch for yours).<br><br>And yes, don't drive into roads you have no idea off... as long as your car is moving, even if it's very slowly you are quite safe and the robbers can't get you (even if they keep ramming you).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>heh... go in with SUVs. apply aggressive take down maneuver if you're being rammed. change lanes , jam brake get behind their car ... take them off the road. dont need to ram. maintain speed at their side and edge their rear wheel and increase speed.<br><br>I d rather just fill a handbag with explosives ( semtex ? ) with remote det charge like handphone... let them take the bag.. watch them leave the killzone and kaboom.

            <div class='col-md body'>Alternatively a weapon that is legal to carry around in your car would be the humble stick, which can come in many forms like the japanese bo staff or chinese gun, or even kali sticks.<br><br>A bat or crowbar is nice as a club, but it is inflexible and cannot be effectively used to parry or block. While it can be used by newbies, it's not really the ultimate in legal self-defence stick weapons. While you are on more even odds carrying a bat or crowbar with a robber with a knife, your chance of getting wounded seriously or even killed is still quite high if you are not trained.<br><br>Takes a bit of skill the learn, but in the hands of a skilled user a staff fighter can easily hold off or even defeat multiple people using shorter knifes or parangs. Generally the range advantage can be used to disarm or discourage your opponents with shorter ranged weapons by hitting their weapon hands or trapping their weapons and the strikes carried by the staff can approach over 2000 lbs of force at the end. This is nearly twice the power required to knock somebody out cold.<br><br>And of course, attach a legal-to-carry pocketknife to the end of the staff with duct tape if you got time and you got an improvised spear, use with trusting attacks and the person at the recieving end of it will be discouraged very fast.<br><br>If staffs are too long for you then you could try dual stick fighting aka. kali sticks style. Against an untrained opponent with a knife it can be extremely useful if you keep your distance and aim for his knife hand with punishing strikes or alternatively using one stick to tie up and parry his knife and the other to land punishing strikes. Kali sticks can land blows with forces of up to 1000 lbs and the strikes can be chained up more rapidly then with a staff combo. Note that in history kail stick users were quite sucessful in fending off bayonets when they were used in wars. Not to mention they are easy to carry concealed.<br><br>Though all this takes time to learn and be good at, but well worth it when push comes to shove.</div>
