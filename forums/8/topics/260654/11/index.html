Maybe he meant no harm but for safety we give no chance for any bad thing to happen.<br><br>Just like if u putting a wallet/hp on a table in hawker centre either in sg or m'sia it does happen ppl grab and run. But if u don't put ur wallet/hp there, it would have prevent these kind of things happen.<br><br>Sometimes u must be brave/calm when encounter any bad things. don't be scared till u have no strength to move.<br>When calm u can think proper solution<br>And be brave, and be more agressive than the attacker and u can protect urself. u afraid of pain, ur attacker also afraid of pain.<br><br>Think of death is nothing at the point ur life is at stake, u will then able to be  safe. if u scare of death, u be afraid and lose calm and do not know wat to react. Definitely if u know martial art can play one role to protect ur own self as well. But main thing is 'BE CALM'<br><br>Also one time when i was at my friend house in broad day light, a thief was stealing the gas. the neighbour saw and keep quiet. So i go and scream to the thief, but thief was not even panick and even slowly throw the gas outside the compound of the house. So tat time i took a wooden staff and try open the door and give a chase only then he immediate ride motor bike off.<br><br>because nowsday ppl outside look strong and muscle but inside are timid and weak that cz more and more crime to take place.<br>Lets be brave and be more helpful to each other then we can create a peaceful world no matter where we are.<br><br>If today we don't help ppl in need, future when we in need we will meet the same kind of ppl who don't help us.</div></blockquote>yes i agree, crime happens everywhere. but dun u think crime rate in JB is exceptionally higher den anywhere else in msia? getting robbed is one thing but how abt rape? it is a very serious crime and yet wad msia police are doing? only brushing down the stories of crime rate and nth much else.<br><br>not everyone noes how to protect themselves. not everybody is the same size. like the case where by 4 pple robbed the 2 couple, do u think dey can really do anything? one on one still okay, but 4 VS 2 will definitely lose out, unless u are bruce lee or jackie chan.<br><br>hopefully something is done~</div>

Smaller weaker people can pwn larger people if they know what they are doing.<br><br>Yes you may be outnumbered, but the vital advantage is that you must be willing to die to protect yourself, while the average robber isn't usually willing to die to rob or get injured robbing somebody. If you communicate quite clearly that despite being outnumbered, you can take out or even kill a few of them before you finally go down it is a very big discouragement. Many just want a simple meal.<br><br>But if it really comes down to it.<br><br>And if it really comes to the fight and you have no choice, go straight for the leader if you can. Taking out the leader usually takes a lot of the fight out of the group.<br><br>Also, if you can, try to grab one of your opponents in a lock and use him as a shield, keep redirecting your opponents into each other to tie them up and use positioning so that you never have to face more then one at a time (not to mention they have to get through their friends to get to you). Poisitioning is key to surviving.<br><br>It is usually beyond your skill level to fight all of them using hard martial arts, and grappling arts like BJJ (though very effective 1 v 1) are not very useful. So one has to apply a lot of soft martial arts to survive in a multiple opponent battle. The idea is not to floor them all, floor those you have to floor and redirect the rest away, make an opening and make a run for it.<br><br>Also, it is important not to let them get a grip on you, so learning grip breaking is important.<br><br>It is not impossible, just very difficult and dangerous. But there are people who have sucessfully defended themselves against multiple opponents before, but they are an exception.<br><br>It's always better to run.</div>

However she eventually told her parents and they made a police report, but nothing much came of it.<br><br>The thugs however, did not leave them alone, they started brazenly harassing the family and tried to threaten them into dropping the case, for some reason the police yet again failed to take any solid action into protecting the family and eventually the father tried to settle things by meeting the thugs, and he was beaten to death by them!<br><br>A very sad case that happened some time back, here are criminals who took something from the family when they raped the girl, but did not stop there and carried on to take away the father.<br><br>I donÂ’t really know what became of that case.<br></div>
