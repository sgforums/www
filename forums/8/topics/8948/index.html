            <div class='col-md body'>* After getting married the bride and groom jump into a horse driven carriage and bid their families farewell. Ten minutes later the horse suddenly stops causing the newly weds to be thrown forward. The groom calmly jumps out the carriage, walks in front of the horse and shouts:<br>"THATÂ’S ONE!!". Then jumps back into the carriage and resumes his journey. Another ten minutes passes and the horse does the same again. The groom jumps out and calmly walks in front of the horse, and shouts:<br>"THATÂ’S TWO!!" then hits the horse over the head with a baseball bat. He then jumps back into the carriage and carries on the journey. Another ten minutes later, the horse still not taking the hint suddenly stops, thrusting the unsuspecting newly weds forward once more. Calmly the groom walks in front of the horse and shouts:<br>"THATÂ’S THREE!!!" and blows the horses head off with a handgun. Just as heÂ’s about to sit down next to his new wife, she says "That was a bit harsh wasnÂ’t it !!!".

Much similar to your PMS thing, we men suffer from testosterone poisoning. Why do you think the average life span of a male is typically 10 years shorter (and it's not just from all the bitching and nagging we have to endure)? Hormone modifies behavior.

Do you honestly think that all the testosterone just fell out of our bodies the moment we met you? Besides, women do it as well. Women are just much better at not getting caught. I'm fairly certain it's some sort of photographic memory deal. Women take one quick look and memorize it for later reference. Since men lack this ability, we try to burn it into our memory by staring as much as we can.<br><br>WHY DO MEN ALWAYS TOUCH THEMSELVES, ESPECIALLY IN PUBLIC?<br>We occasionally need to adjust "junior" and make him happy. It's much like adjusting your bra. Being in public is just an added bonus.<br><br>WHY DO MEN ALWAYS SAY SUCH STUPID THINGS?<br>We like to. It's actually a whole lot of fun to see our partner frustrated by a few simple (and well chosen) words.<br><br>WHY ARE MEN SO UNCOMMUNICATIVE?<br>You'd learn to keep your big mouth shut too if every time you open it you get into trouble with your partner.<br><br>WHY DO MEN HAVE TO ACT LIKE SUCH RETARDS?<br>Well, we don't actually have to; we do it because we enjoy it. It's the old fashioned pride in a job well done that's missing in so much of the world nowadays.<br><br>WHY CAN'T MEN JUST SHARE THEIR FEELINGS?<br>Do we look like women to you? Why is it so hard to understand that men and women are different? How are we supposed to share how we feel when we have no idea how we feel? Unless we're experiencing some extreme emotion like rage, hatred, disgust, or a brick on our foot, we have no idea how we feel. Personally, I get a headache whenever I try to figure out how I feel.<br><br>WHY CAN'T MEN CUDDLE MORE (I.E. LIE DOWN AND HUG)?<br>Please... How many hours do you think there is in a day? We oblige you as much as we can, but who the hell (besides women) can stand lying around for hours on end? We men... Men hunters... Need go roam... Starve in cave... Must go find wildebeest...Now sitting on our asses for hours on end on the other hand is a whole other story.<br><br>HOW CAN MEN SIT ON THEIR ASSES ALL DAY WITHOUT MOVING?<br>Men have very powerful sets of sitting muscles developed by evolution that enable us to sit for extended periods of time without getting tired. In prehistoric times, it was often necessary to sit in one spot for extended periods of time while hunting for prey. The more successful hunters were able to sit very still for very extended periods of time thereby passing on this ability to their sons. The fidgety types were all gobbled up by saber toothed tigers etc. The end result is that almost all modern men are born with this innate ability.<br><br>WHY CAN'T MEN JUST SAY "I LOVE YOU?"<br>Men are taught from a tender young age to be self-sufficient. To say that we love you is equivalent to saying that we need you. Most men consider that a character fault. It's not easy to admit to one's own character faults.<br><br>WHY DO MEN SAY "I LOVE YOU" WHEN THEY HARDLY KNOW ME?<br>Ho, Ho, Ho... Aren't you special? Well, some men think it's a sure fire way to get into your pants. Surprisingly, it actually still works quite well.<br><br>WHY DOESN'T MY PARTNER EVER ANSWER ME?<br>We just simply don't have the energy to answer every single one of your questions. If we think we do not have the answer, or that you will not like the answer, we simply remain quiet and save the energy for other things.<br><br>WHY WON'T MEN EVER PICK UP AFTER THEMSELVES?<br>Why should we? It doesn't really bother us that much. Besides, we know darn well you'll pick it up.<br><br>WHAT'S WITH ALL THE BELCHING AND FARTING?<br>This usually only occurs after months of courting. It's our way to let you know that we're comfortable with you. Believe it or not, its actually a sign of affection. Besides, holding it for extended periods of time gives us stomach cramps.<br><br>WHY DO MEN HATE SHOPPING?<br>It's an evolutionary thing. Men hunt. Women gather. We just want to go out, kill it, and bring it back. Who wants to spend hours and hours to look at things we have no intention of killing?
