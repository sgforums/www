            <div class='col-md body'>firstly, i know this is a very tired topic.. but somehow, thking abt it sometimes makes my blood boil, esp the "pts" made by those against it. a major pt tt gets on my nerves is tt singlish wld not be understood by foreigners (by this i thk they generally mean westerners).<br><br>my grouse? why the *^*&amp; must we always give way to the foreigners? why must we condition our whole lifestyle, our whole COUNTRY to suit the "stnds" and "qualities" of "foreigners"? sg wants its own "culture", but does it truly want a singaporean culture, or a copy of western countries? singlish is a dialect, our "native lang", smethg EVERY trueblue sgrean understands and relates to. if we cant even keep this simple slang, how are we going to have a "culture"? throughout the world, countries have their OWN langs. thailand has its thai, india has its tamil and a dozen of other dialects, china has chinese; why cant we keep our "singlish"? USA has its own "versions" of eng, but do you see anyone trying to erase them? nooooo. instead our teenagers thk it's "cool" and try to imitate them. is this what our govt wants? a country tt's an asian carboncopy of the "average" western country? a country with no culture of its own - we just pick up whatever the "angmohs" want.<br><br>it's alrite to copy their economical system, their industries, their technology. yet, at the same time while we LEARN frm them, we cannot copy wholesale. everyone complains how our students simply regurgitate info, but can you really blame the students alone when it seems our whole country is guilty of this problem? we have to learn to draw the line. we can absorb, we can be informed, but we have to choose what we wanna keep, what we wanna change, what we have to throw. contrary to popular belief, ppl do not blindly accept and believe everythg they see and watch on tv, much less a whole nation. for the past 3 decades or so, we've conc.ed on building up a nation, a nation tt can survive. and it did. this was an essential and shrewd move. but now tt we've established ourselves in tt aspect, isnt it time to move on? to create our own UNIQUE identity?<br><br>i'm not saying tt singlish must be used throughout. just like our MT, we speak singlish, but yet, at the same time, we shld learn to speak proper eng. not to accomodate the foreigners, but for us to survive economically (it's kinda hard to communicate if A doesnt understand B). i wld understand if the govt starts encouraging the use of proper eng, but not the abolishment of singlish. it's an vital part of what little "culture" we has, and really, can sg stand to lose much more? isnt it time for the foreigners to accomodate US? to learn to speak our "lang"? it adds a whole new face to sg, instead of simply being the "clean and green city tt's very strict". in fact, most of my frens who are foreigners finds singlish interesting, and they wanna learn how to speak it. of course, there are always the snobs who thk it's a class beneath them. to such ppl, all i can say is: fuck off. i know i'm getting very emotional and perhaps a little illogical but i'm getting very pissed off by such attitudes.<br><br>well, i thk i've rambled on and on.. you guys ready to flame me?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok. forget abt the politics.... in my opinion, singlish is not bad at all, i mean, how many pple here actually speak queen's english? no one. all the lors and lahs just fit into our speech, but that doesn't mean that we can't adapt our speech when we need to.<br>talking abt foreginers, you are quite right. they have their own set of english.you don't see singaporeans go "howya dodin mate" do u?<br>if they accept it, why can't we do the same. i mean, when we go to meetings with pple from other countries, we do not speak singlish do we?<br>so yeah, we should keep this singlish. afterall, the word kiasu is in the oxford dictionary if i am not wrong<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think we are talking abt the standard of english here, not the accent. yes, i have heard the yorkshire, nearly incomprehensible(sp??)<br><br>but what really pisses me off are the pple who try to replicate the "posh" american and british accents. these accents are for them and them alone, we should not be part of it.<br><br>if you ask me. as i said, i think pple are just afraid that singlish play such a big part in our lives, that they think that foreigners can't understand what we would be talking.<br><br>frankly, i think that foreginers find singlish exotic  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Those who fervently support Singlish are idiots too.<br><br>Pure Singlish, in effect, should befine. Afterall, it's just a mixture of english and thevariouslocal languages, all packaged to give it a uniquely Singaporean identity.<br><br>What's really bad, and is perhaps the core of the issue, is how the words are pronounced, and GRAMMAR. Singlish is often accompanied by poor pronunciation and grammar, and as such, sounds really bad. Hence, it comes across as being unpolished and hard to swallow.<br><br>Throw in your "lahs" and "siahs" and "lors". That's fine. But make sure your grammar is correct or Singlish becomes really hard to comprehend and an insult to the english language it's based upon.<br><br>It's not about who we're trying to copy, but it's about presentation and respect for a language we base Singlish upon.<br><br>While accents vary and perhaps pronunciation too, get the grammar in order. Leaving out an "s" when u want to speak in plural or adding one when you want to speak in singular is ridiculous. Sounds ridiculous too.<br><br>As unfortunate as it may be, Singlish is often synonymous with bad english.<br><br>With the older generation growing old and the younger generation taking over, the government aims to replace dialects with the 4 standard languages, probably with English as  the de facto leader. Now while it's excusable for the older generation to make mistakes in speaking english which is in effect a 2nd language to them, english is taught as a first language in schools now so to actually promote Singlish  would be totally contrary  to what the education system here champions, ie. good english.<br><br>Once you master standard english, Singlish adds life and flavour in the local context. But singlish should never, and can never, replace good standard english.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm very busy...like hell, but I need to respond to this post because I am also against this campaign by the Gov to stamp out Singlish....<br><br>AS a foreigner, i love Singlish...It's disarming, it's cute, it's funny, it's local, it's casual, and it's so singapore.  I find that people with the little Singlish accent very cute and easy to talk to...the accent and style of talking singlish is very relaxed and non-threatening...altho if u know the language enough, u can understand the threat behind it sometimes...:-)<br><br>When I heard the BIG GOV. go national with this stammping out idea...i was so furious...how far do they want to kill singapore...It already is the most Western of all asian countries...Why must they go and stamp it out some more...I feel inclined to say something bad about the gov here, but i'm afraid I will dissappear...really...u should hear what happens to foreigners who say things and the gov finds out...uggg!!!!:-8<br><br>Anyway, people of Singapore, the gov doesn't have the answer for everything...even tho they think they do...Their only goalis to commercialise Singapore...Everything else is secondary...Sad but true.<br><br>So think for urselves and don't lose that language that I ave grown to be so fond of...Can u imagine an ahlian speaking perfect Queens English...:-8 yeeeesh!!!!no way man...turn off...now if she spoke Singlish like no tomorrow...ahhh, turn on for sure.:-)<br><br>and many foreigners think the same way as I do...contrary to what the gov or anyone else may say...This campaign is only meant to make bigger investors come here and nothing else...they fear that we will scare off westerners with the Singlish....BullS**t...in fact, One of the main drawing factors for foreigners to go to another country besides making money is for the experience of the locals way of life...including how they talk...and anyone can take that to the bank...REst assured, once u lose ur language, few people will even bother anymore...<br><br>If u rea dmy posting somewhere in one of Rinoa Heartilly's posts, i was talking about the way Singapore is losing itself in large chunks by even larger chunks...very sad...Then I, as well as every foreigner who lives here, might as well and go live in any other internstional country....<br><br>*sigh*...but what can u do...the only thing is to keep speaking itwhether people tell u to stop or not...Long live Singlish!!!!<br><br>from a foreigner who really cares.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well it can be either actually. Technologies and technology. But then we shouldn't nitpick, and my grammar isn't flawless either. Ever since they did away teaching grammar by the book and started teaching english based on the principal "if it sounds correct, it's correct" I can never be sure...<br><br>But the main point is we could infer a meaning from the rest of a sentence. Now casually I guess that's fine, but if you want to speak a language, you might as well put in some effort and speak it properly. And if you do that over time, speaking it properly will become second nature. Same applies if you don't correct  your grammatical mistakes. They add up and soon you get used making the mistakes. Not good. Just like IRC lingo which has found its way into eveyday life because some use them over and over again online. Words like "hihi" "oso" or "birthdae"<br><br>Fixing the grammar in Singlish would do a lot  of good. That's about the best compromise you can reach.<br><br>Singlish should branch off standard english, and not be an independent "language" by itself.</div>

(Other than the fact that PCK had to change...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">)<br><br>I think the government juz wants to make sure that everyone gets to know standard english as well so that thye can use it when it needs to be. They have nothing against Singlish per se. So don't blast the government anyhow. (re: firewire, swiftwing)<br><br>And Zippo is right--too much use of IRC lingo  or Singlish makes one get used to it and then makes it harder to switch back to standard English.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello<br><br>Just like to add that Singlish is something I'm rather, well, proud to be associated with.<br><br>I'm an overseas student, and you'll be amazed how easy it it to tell who's a Singaporean just by listening to them speak (amongst themselves, that is)!<br><br>But ultimately it boils down to knowing how to speak/act at the right place and right time. I speak Mandarin when I'm with my Taiwanese friends; I attempt Cantonese with my HK friends, I switch to a Aussie twang when I speak with the locals; I use a more "neutral" form of English when I give presentations; but with fellow locals, I still speak (yup, you guessed it) Singlish. You may not notice it whilst at home in Singapore but when you're in a foreign land, the sound of ppl speaking Singlish is like a sound from home  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I guess this is the Governmen't primary concern (they have friends overseas too you know). But most Singaporeans I know are able to "switch" easily. However to do so, one has to start learning the "proper" thing from young. Perhaps that is why Singlish references have to be removed from various parts of the media, where young minds can easily be influenced.<br><br>Think you'll agree with me that unlearning what one has learnt is far more difficult than learning something new from scratch.<br><br>Old habits die hard; its best to start the correct way.<br><br>------------------<br>I do not embrace my dark side, but I do acknowledge it;<br>else I can never be whole<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with Bravehart when he said it really depends who u are with. Right here I speak Canadian English and with my SG friends Mandarin and Singlish and with my Jap friends Nihongo and Singlish which they find so much easier to understand. i think we are the only country that know so many dialects and language,(gee so proud!)But no matter what, just use appropriately and dun try to use Singlish in a presentation unless u are PCK..hehe!<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cluon:<br><br>Hi, just like to clarify that I do not feel homesick when I do hear singlish (I'm having the time of my life here as a matter of fact  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ). But its just that an instant rapport can be formed easily with this common identity.<br><br>And as you probably know, in a foreign country with the absence of family members, the only people you can turn to are yourself and your friends  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Sometimes its nice to know that you are not alone...<br><br>------------------<br>I do not embrace my dark side, but I do acknowledge it;<br>else I can never be whole<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's amusing really. Are we arguing just for the sake of arguing? Just like us always having to go against the government because there are no credibly opposition parties to do that?<br><br>Let's face reality: the government will ultimately make your decisions and regardless  what supporters of democracy say, the people  will have minimal impact. Unless they become  violent.<br><br>Why? Either it's because though they grumble and object, they really can't be bothered because what the government does will ultimately have minimal effect on the day to day running of their lives? Ban Singlish, sure. Actively try to eradicate it from the media, sure. But despite all these government measures, we will still speak Singlish if we feel like it.<br><br>No government can ever cater to the needs of everyone. It can never be in sync with everyone. What it can do is to make decisions for the country as a whole, weighing everything out. And the Sing Govt's track record is pretty good, you have to admit.<br><br>So while they may attempt to control every bit of my life, ultimately they don't. I don't quite miss chewing gum, I get gum from malaysia. Flushing the toilet should be 2nd nature to everyone, so whyshould I be afraid of a fine. Freedom of Speech, aren't we alljust criticising  the government here but I'm sure we aren't the tad bit afraid of armed ISD policeman breaking down your door as we speak.<br><br>Pure democracy and freedom of speech, in my opinion, is excessive. Plus I sure wouldn't mind trading some of that for safety, stability, security and economic growth. I don't have rocks hurled at my house.<br><br>ANy J2s here?<br>Remember the GP qn "a benevolent dictatorship is the best form of government. Discuss." I think it is. It's easier, simpler, and someone will always  be in charge.<br><br>While people complain about Singapore and its  government, I think it's equally silly to be using the phasing out of Singlish to support the idea that  the governments clamping down on our freedom. Maybe it's because they aren't any serious problems for us todiscuss, becausethey've been taken care of, or are being taken care of.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly, i think this is a tired topic too, but i agree with the government and suppourt its attempts to "clean up" our standard of english (communist as we may  be).<br><br>Ataraxia: Its not about giving way to foreigners, its about being able to communicate. Ok, if u want to keep singlish, that's fine, just make sure you know WHEN to use it and when NOT to use it. Please, please be reminded that Singapore is JUST A TINY LITTLE ISLAND set in the sea, we are sooooo small, we can't even be seen on the world map. Sure, we're damn lucky to have such a strong economy etc etc, but the fact is, we RELY on other BIGGER, more POWERFUL countries, e.g. USA, UK etc, and you know, basically be in their good books. One of the main reasons why soo many MNCs set their regional offices here is because English is the main business language (or at least we think it is). So, OK, fine, if you say that Singlish is something uniquely S'porean, good, but please be reminded that in the end, we all have to be fluent in standard english (Queens or otherwise). You don't expect to woo potential investors if you speak in your own lingo, they have to actually understand what the hell you're saying in the first place. You say that Singlish is vital for our economic survival, good observation, however, many people (maybe not you guys here) DON'T KNOW THE BLOODY DIFFERENCE! I know people who proclaim that their english is good, yet not know the difference between a verb and a noun. Its really scary!<br><br>The USA has its own version of English, yes, and the reason why its not been wiped out shows the extent of the US's influence. Movies, clothes, fashion, songs, its all the work of the mass media. It helps to be a "big player" in the world today, it gives you the right to call the shots,and basically, wraps the rest of the world around your lil' finger. Ok, imagine if Singapore was as powerful as the US, Singlish will be the in thing in no time, so please, before you go ard banging everyone else, please be aware of our position here, we have no natural resources, we are totally reliant on others, and definately have a long way to go to self-sufficiency.<br><br>Look around you, how many of us actually speak so-called "American English"?? Take a walk down Orchard Rd, no one here actually speaks with a twang/slang if anything, (sadly, perhaps) Singlish is spoken widely. Its just that Singlish is so vast, even people who have grown up listening to it, don't understand it sometimes. Like Zippo said, its not grammatically correct, has no proper sentance structure, and the verbs, adverbs, conjunctions etc etc are all jumbled up! There is a basic criteria which makes a "language" a language, and according to some experts, Singlish does not really qualify.<br><br>Singlish with its flavour and nuances, is a very colourful way of speaking, however, i do not think we shld advocate or propogate its use, for very obvious reasons. To restrict Singlish by fixing grammar rules etc will be in effect as bad as erradicating (hey i like that word! Do you guys play Starcraft, where the totally cool archons go round growling "Erradicate..." ---Oppss sorry i do digress..So... where was i? Oh yeah) Singlish in its entirety.<br><br>So yeah, foreigners may find it cute or whatever,(how do we actually know this? they might be laughing at not with us) but i think the government is looking out for the welfare of its people (since as clarified in economics, IS the ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT ---&gt; Hey Zippo, you take econs??), in trying to limit the use of Sinligh, replacing it with standard english.<br><br>Geee whiz, I sound like I'm actually pro-PAP...<br><br>Anyway speaking of governments, as much as I'm not to thrilled with living in China, eh... I mean, Singapore, i think we have a good thing going on here... you can actually go to school knowing that you won't be gunned down at recess, and walk the streets at midnight without the fear of being mugged. "Freedom of speech is a basic right as long as the speaker does not abuse it" (haha another GP topic). OK, so maybe we are not the epitome of a democratic system, but we have the most basic human right, which is the right to live in peace &amp; to have peace of mind (i think its in the UN charter), plus we have our dignity, we are not slaves of some feudal system, and not living in fear of some communist government ( at least i don't think so!), why complain? Granted no country is perfect, maybe the grass is greener here after all...<br><br>ok i think i have strayed and i'm sick of typing... *bleah*<br><br></div>
