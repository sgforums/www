            <div class='col-md body'>Anyone saw the program on discovery just now about India?<br><br>They taklked about a 100% true prediction in something called Nadi astrology.<br>People all over the world go  to India to have their future predicted.<br><br>From  a blog:<br><br><a href="http://memorylanes.blogspot.com/2005/02/mystic-indias-secrets-nadi-joshiyam.html" rel="nofollow">http://memorylanes.blogspot.com/2005/02/mystic-indias-secrets-nadi-joshiyam.html</a><br><br><blockquote> was in Seerkazhi, Tamil Nadu taking a much-needed break. Dad and I had planned to visit the famous temples in and around that town. Top on the list was the alpha-famous Vaideeshwaran Temple of Lord Shiva. This place is very famous for Nadi Joshiyam - a form of astrology that can read into the past, present and future of a person.<br>Nadi Joshiyam is a form of astrology based on the information written on ancient sacred palmyra (or palm) leaves purportedly authored by great ancient sages - such as Brighu, Shuka, Shukra, Agasthya, Kousika, Koumara, Kakbhusandi, Bhoga, Pullipani, Vashista, Vishwamitra, etc. It is said that the sages have jotted down information (on these palm leaves) for every human in this world. 'Nadi' in Tamil means 'to come in search of'. The information<br>that one gets from these sessions would be exactly applicable to the person ONLY at the point of time that he/she has this Nadi session. For eaxmple, a person's Nadi could reveal that one's dad/mom/sibling has already died. This information would be wrong if the person had visited (Theoretically) the Nadi astrolger when his/her dad/mom/sibling was alive. But it is said that the sages who wrote this knew what point in time a person would check out his Nadi and so this information would be exact when one checks out his/her Nadi.<br>I was curious to explore this intriguing form of Astrology. I cajoled my dad and we chose Sivasamy Nadi Astrologers. (They specialize in Agasthiya Nadi - Nadi written by Sage Agasthiya) - one of the most famous guys in this regard.<br><br>Once we had settled down, the Nadi reader asked for my dad's right thumb impression. This is the only thing the Nadi reader needs to dig out the correct set of palm leaves. Once he had dad's thumb impression, it took him just 10 minutes to find the Nadi that corresponds to that fingerprint pattern. He told us that there were 4 (I dont remember the exact number) types of fingerprints and that each of these patterns had a corresponding Nadi. He brought a set of bound palm leaves. Every person with the same thumbprint pattern would have his details in this set of bound palm leaves. He started asking dad some questions. The only answers that dad was allowed to give were 'Yes' and 'No'. He started eliminating leaves in the colection based on the responses provided by dad. The most significant item in each leaf was sounded out as a question to dad. If he replied in the negative, that leaf would be filtered out. Examples of the questions that the reader put forward were :<br>1. You have n living brother(s), n living sister(s)<br>2. You were born in the month of xxx<br>3. You have x kids<br>4. You don't have a daughter<br><br>After many such questions, he got to one leaf where all the questions were answered in the affirmative by Dad. He then told us Dad's name, Grandpa's name, Grandma's name, Mom's name, Dad's DoB with the exact time, etc. Every piece of information that he gave us was perfectly correct. I was astounded. He then showed us the palm leaf with the inscribed information. It was written in ancient Tamil. He showed us the pertinent words (he pointed out the names that he had sounded out correctly). I could make out the words easily since it was similar to the modern-day Tamil script. It was authenticy of the first order.He then asked us if we wanted to get more details.<br><br>There are 9 Kandams. Each Kandam talks about one particular part of the concerned person's life. For example, one Kaandam talks about one's past life. One talks about one's life in his/her next birth(janmam), etc. We decided to check this out. After an hour, the reader ushered us in and started reading from a journal that he had written for Dad. The journal had all the information in a poetic form. He read from the journal and gave us the name, place of birth, date of birth, profession, caste that dad would have in his next birth. He gave us a lot of information. All this information is taped in a cassette in addition to being written (in a poetic form) in a journal. We get to keep the journal and the cassette.<br><br>After the wonder faded, I started to think about the implications of this. If this were true, it means that every move that we make is a part of a pre-fabricated plan by GOd's hand. Everything in our life has already been planned.<br>As Shakespeare said ...<br>All the world's a stage,<br>And all the men and women merely players ..</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In India, a secret occult tradition has kept records detailing the past, present and future for many people. This is called Nadi Astrology. These records were written by gods or various enlightened masters who are collectively called the Siddhas.  These gods or enlightened Siddhas may have known you in a past lifetime when you lived in India.  If so, at that time they agreed to help you during a crisis in a future lifetime, and they always keep their word. For many people, that “future” lifetime is actually this current one they are in now. The promised help they will receive will come from Nadi Astrology.<br><br>The Siddhas<br><br>The Siddhas are an esoteric group of enlightened saints from the distant past of India.  Many of them are not yet well known in the West, although one of them, Babaji, has been written about in Yogananda’s book, Autobiography of a Yogi. Another book describing the yogic abilities of these masters is Babaji and the 18 Siddha Kriya Yoga Tradition by M. Govindan. In this Millennium, the wisdom and secrets of the Siddhas are being brought into the West more openly for the first time. Many people in the West will benefit enormously from this.<br><br>Nadi Astrology<br><br>The enlightened Siddha masters founded Nadi astrology.  Lord Shiva, pleased with their devotion, bestowed upon them some exclusive powers.  He gave them the incredible clairvoyance to know the past, present and future.  The Siddhas have etched their priceless knowledge on ancient palm leaves called Nadis.  Lord Shiva Himself, out of His Infinite Grace, also gave predictions on palm leaves.  Associated with you in your ‘Poorva Janma’ (previous birth), they promised to help you in a future life, i.e. now.  <strong>By the Nadi law, you will be involuntarily attracted to the leaves by destiny only.  The very fact you are reading this far into the description of the Nadis is an interesting omen as not everyone even hears about them, let alone is curious about them.</strong><br><br>Nadi Leaves<br><br>The Nadi leaves are inscribed in Sanskrit, the mother tongue for all ancient Indian arts and sciences.  Various people have held the Nadis in secret once the gods and Siddhas wrote them. One ruler, the Maharajah Serfoji II of Tanjore in southern India, was a true patron of art and sciences. He stored these palm leaves safely in his palace library, knowing their importance. He had them translated into Tamil (a language used in southern India).  The British acquired possession of these leaves during their rule and later sold them to some families, which still own them and respectfully keep them. The Nadi leaves have been held quietly for centuries, waiting their time of rendezvous with their intended recipients, the individuals whose destinies they describe.<br><br>If you are drawn to investigate Nadi Astrology in this lifetime, there is a strong chance you have connection to these gods and Siddhas and there are records waiting for you from the Divine, giving explanation and direction for this lifetime. Many traditions have predicted this new Millennium will be the setting for tremendous material and spiritual evolution for many people. The Nadi astrology is a key tool for positive, rapid transformation as it explains past errors which have resulted in the current state of affairs in one’s life and the particular remedies to perform to alleviate difficulties and open up a new, more positive karmic track in this very lifetime.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>The Nadi readers say that natives whose leaves are there will somehow or<br>other comes to them at the appropriate age specified on the leaves from any<br>corner of the world. Leaves are there not only for Indian but for foreigners<br>also belonging to other religions. Who ever are desired to look into the leaves<br>will go to them on his own accord. They very word Nadi in Tamil mean (destined) to come own accord. Those who are not destined may not even know such a type of astrology exists. Even the very age when the native is destined to go to them is marked on the leaves. So they say they do not adventure for their profession. Whoever is destined to come will come faith is the root of their system. It is also stated that about 40% of the people in the world only are likely to get these results as available.</blockquote><a href="http://bhavapuri.com/rayudu/NadiAstrology.html#Claims%20Of%20Nadi%20%20Readers" rel="nofollow">http://bhavapuri.com/rayudu/NadiAstrology.html#Claims%20Of%20Nadi%20%20Readers</a></div>
