            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... According to rumours, Delta Swimming Pool is frequented by "people with special sexual orientations"... Just be careful when you go there next time. Who knows, the uncle may be hiding a camera or video recorder behind the book!<br><br>If you're worried, you can always switch to the another swimming pool.

            <div class='col-md body'>to start of i am totally not against gays, but seriously they should practice their pervertness behind close doors to avoid traumatising innocent individuals around.<br><br>i have heard of similar experiences in YCK pool (heavily infested by gays) who strut around the toilet with naked with an erect penis.<br><br>it totally spoils the image!<br><br>and turns normal users who are there for a swim or tan away.<br><br>thats my opinion of this matter.<br><br>i think this issue has to be brought up to higher authorities because it isnt just an innocent gesture of the processes invovled in changing (like what normally happens in NS) but it is a deliberate attempt by these ppl to incite or provoke some sort of attention.</div>
