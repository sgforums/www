And I found out about Joan through forum, not the newspaper. Yea acceptance is the key, praying to God doesn't mean you wouldn't want to face the fact and accept the reality. It's something we least could do to express our concern and love for the unfortunate ones.. I prayed for others too, not only for Joan..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PAIN as being a constant factor in human life, cannot be absent.<br><br>Even in good health, PAIN, is there. By this, I meant the 'pain' in stresses of making a living, caring for and looking after a family, generaly anxieties and whatever that concerns you significantly. These are by all means emotional pains.<br><br>When we come down with the Godfather of all human deseases, CANCER, dying involves another whole set of PAIN - physical pain, mental pain, and emotional pain. It is this combination of pain, that often breaks a person or sometimes, drive them to suicidal options.<br><br>All of us, are living each day closer to our eventual demise. While it's totally true that we cannot choose the manner in which we die, we also cannot predict WHEN we may die.<br><br>But I believe, that prayer does help to some extent when one is going to expire, LETTING GO plays a larger part in this commonly dreaded transition in life.<br><br>LETTING GO, is the hardest part of dying - you need COMPLETE FAITH in whatever you believe in, religion or otherwise.<br><br></div>
