              <p>wow. most of the comments i see are very negative towards immigrants. I really don't understand, being served by a foreign waitress has affected you how? Don't forget that foreign labour are cheaper and some industries are shunned by locals, hence they reduce the costs of production and the costs of goods and services. Also, you should know how difficult it is to learn a whole new language in a matter of months, and it really isn't their fault that the have a certain accent when they speak-- it is something very hard to change for them. If you are complaining about being served jap food by a pinoy waitress, well this is globalisation. in an alternate universe without it, you may also be complaining about lack of cultural diversity.</p>
              <p>Lastly, I feel that towards immigration we need to be more open and tolerant, not be discriminatory. they are fellow human beings and many of us at one point in our lives become immigrants in another country, be it for a period of study or work.</p>

              <p>And i don't give a shit to what globalisation fuck or what theory. A society has to have its own core of citizens and that's that. Imagine Singaporeans flooding China (that is if we have the bloody population) and we speak so much English and Singlish there. You think the locals would entertain us? I wouldn't want that to happen as much as any true blue mainland Chinese because they have 5000 years of history and the core of that beautiful and ancient society should be born and bred mainland Chinese.</p>
              <p>So called "jobs shunned by locals" is a myth perpetrated by the state controlled media. That part is absolutely evitable.</p>

              <p>I think it is right for people to vent their displeasure on foreigner, after all, many would not want a stranger in their house. Even as a taiwanese, sometime I am not welcome here, cos my hokkien sound like Xiamen type, ending up misinterpret as PRC gal, couple with my white complex, not much left to hide.</p>
              <p>But singaporeans, as an educated lots, should be much expose to a global conception than merely a narrow view on races. For once, I also heard of singaporean getting racial remarks in Oz and USA, some people there look down on Singaporean, and make it difficult of singapore immigrant to work there.</p>
              <p>Let us take a recourse into future, by 50 years time, I have a feeling that singaporean may end up having to migrate to china or part of china to find job. And let say, you end up having to serve the then well to do chinese at a resturant with chinese foods, and you speak broken mandarin to them, what will happens, mind me, there are billions of them there</p>

              <p>I think it is right for people to vent their displeasure on foreigner, after all, many would not want a stranger in their house. Even as a taiwanese, sometime I am not welcome here, cos my hokkien sound like Xiamen type, ending up misinterpret as PRC gal, couple with my white complex, not much left to hide.</p>
              <p>But singaporeans, as an educated lots, should be much expose to a global conception than merely a narrow view on races. For once, I also heard of singaporean getting racial remarks in Oz and USA, some people there look down on Singaporean, and make it difficult of singapore immigrant to work there.</p>
              <p>Let us take a recourse into future, by 50 years time, I have a feeling that singaporean may end up having to migrate to china or part of china to find job. And let say, you end up having to serve the then well to do chinese at a resturant with chinese foods, and you speak broken mandarin to them, what will happens, mind me, there are billions of them there</p>

              <p>Its natural for people to vent their displeasure on what ever they are displeased about. Somebody surely will have something to complain about, here or anywhere in the world. <br>I think in 50 years time, Singapore citizens will be 6 million.  Four million on this island (plus 2million FT and FW, maximum six million people here), two million citizens overseas all over the place. Like the Chinese and Indian race, everywhere also have.</p>
              <p>At that time, can have people don't know speak what language, but can sing Majula Singapura in Malay, or something sound like Malay.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Yes I am very affected. The contrast is especially greater when one has not been in sg for some time. I just hope that this place is still recognisable if I ever come back here to retire. I do agree with you that Chinese should speak Chinese but I'd have no qualms speaking English to another China Chinese if he or she is comfortable.</p>
