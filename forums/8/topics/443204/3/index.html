              <p>if a chinese and a malay were to converse of course they'll speak english because thats the only common language both knows.  unless you have a malay speaking chinese or a chinese speaking malay involved.  the same logic applies for indians.  or do i have to type it all out so your tiny brain can understand?</p>
              <p>speaking chinese means the world revolves around PRCs?  are you saying your world revolves around the angmos since you speak english?</p>
              <p>the fact you are so biased show just how shallow your mindset is.  yet you have the cheek to say that to me.</p>
              <p>use your fucking brains before you start insulting people.</p>

              <p>I have a few times have a straight talk to a few PRCs on their refusal to communicate and learn English.  </p>
              <p>One of them told me her job did not require her to speak English.  This was not true, there were bangalas and foreigners patronizing the store she was working.  Others responded that they were not interested and were so adamant that English is not what they will learn.</p>
              <p>Every now and then I see PRC and the sales assistants or fast food chain crew communicating in "alien" ......................        I heard grievances on this problem from our local Malay and Indian singaporeans.    tsk tsk tsk, what a shame!</p>

              <p>It is a matter of attitude.   Those PRC who refuse to learn English to work in Singapore have attitude problem.   Who do they think they are we have to give in to them to speak Mandarin?  They are in our land, do as we do here, we don't owe them a living.</p>

              <p><br>Well, I am pragmatic in my approach where dialects and languages are concerned.    It is always good to speak more than one's own dialect and language though it is not as though they cannot survive if they do not.</p>
