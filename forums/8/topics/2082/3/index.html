            <div class='col-md body'>"""""can someone tell me!!!!<br>why is there a flap of skin in the front of male's penis???? what is the purpose??<br>why do some religions have to cut them????<br>why is there a mushroom head in every male's penis???? whats the purpose????<br>(someone told me the purpose of eyebrows, someone tell me the reason for all this, that means u are very knowledgeable too!!!)<br>p.s.: i am still finding the purpose of why do humans have pubic hair...<br>"""<br><br>Pubic hair, when Adam &amp; Eve ate food in heaven, they soon shitted afterwards &amp; got really nervous &amp; did not know where to hide the shit, so they hid some under their armp pits &amp; some between their legs, so God won't see their shit &amp; won't punish them. But both armpit &amp; pubic hair should be cut, so for hygiene purpose &amp; the scent thing is actually in genes, not in pubic hair, we all got this smell, both men &amp; women, that's why we are attracted to some specific girls eventhough we don't know them<br><br>penis extra skin: all boys come with a dick when they come out of their mom's belly, while passing through mom's vagina, their dick also goes through the vagine, so in order for our dicks not to touch our mom's vagine, it comes in a package,which prevents it from touching his mom's vagina, otherwise all our idiot ancestors from long time will be &amp; actually used to think that it's ok to have sex with our moms. That's why ours penis never actually gets to touch our mom's vagina. Wonderful thinking of God huh?<br><br>Erm.... now mushroom head. tell me if our dicks were square headed, would it be easy for you girls to easily take it, cos of it's special shape, it's easy to break a girl's virginity? have u never seen a dril? if a dril was square headed, will it make a hole in the wall? same reason for the mushroom head.<br><br>Now circumcision: most religion ask for it to cut the extra skin from top of penis, cos they have been told to do so, but the main reason is still hygiene. circumcision got many health benefits, one of the recent one I saw on yahoo news few weeks ago is actually a benefit to women. The summary of the news is that women who has a sex partner who is circumcised are less likely to develop cervical or some sort of similar cancer, u can track it urself on yahoo news.<br><br>hope all this info does answer ur questions.<br></div>
