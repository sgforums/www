            <div class='col-md body'>Matrix is about LIFE. This article, I shall explore what Matrix tells us about life.<br><br>I believe the W brothers used the story to illustrate how they feel about life. He used two contrasting characters to tell the story-- Neo and Agent Smith. Contrasting, yet similar in many ways.<br><br>Neo and Smith, as the Oracle keeps stressing, are direct opposites. In what ways? The Matrix has an unbalanced equation <span style="font-style: italic;">***(This Â‘freewillÂ’ concept was stressed on a couple of occasions. That was why they had to come up with so many versions of the Matrix to keep letting the plugged-in humans think that they are alive and roaming in the 'real, free' world.) ***</span>as we all know it from the mouth of the Architect. Neo and Smith are the opposite ends of the unbalanced equation(Think this was revealed in Matrix 2). If Neo exists, Smith exists. One is the negative and the other is the positive. You canÂ’t say you want one of them without the other.<br><br>What was in Neo and Smith that made them similar? Both Neo and Smith wanted out of the Matrix. They wanted to be "free". Both exercised their human ability to make a choice-- freewill. It is this freewill which made humans feel alive.<br><br>So what was so different about Neo and Smith?<br><br>We recall that Smith was STILL trying to kill NEO even in ZION. He believed that by killing Neo he then will be truly freed. Wasn't ZION already the "REAL" world? If Smith was already freed from Matrix, shouldnt he be happy? He wasn't. He wanted to get out of ZION. To where? That I dunno. But I believe that ZION was still not the REAL world. Otherwise NEO wouldnt be able to possess such supernatural powers to overcome the Sentinels in the ZION world.<br><br>Here is what I regard to be of most importance in the movie: Neo understood what love is. Smith didn't. Without an understand for love and feelings, he had nothing to hold on to, no matter where he was. Neo was different. HE loved Trinity. He had made a choiceÂ—LOVE over other things, choosing the other door which the Architect din expect. He had something to cherish in the ZION world.<br>Does it matter whether ZION was Â‘realÂ’? Neo had something to hold on, isnÂ’t that enough?<br><strong>Does it matter whether Matrix was real if the humans living in it had something to cherish and hold on to?</strong><br><br>This point was brought across again by the Indian family. Â“Every program had a purpose. Without one, it will cease to existÂ…. Love is just a wordÂ….Â” The Indian man/program lived in the Matrix. Â“Why do you want to go back(to the Matrix)Â” Neo asked. Why? Because of love! He had something to cherish. Does it matter even if he knows that he lives in a Â‘unrealÂ’ world? The Indian program survives, because of a sole  purposeÂ—his daughter.<br><br>We all choose to live because we have some purpose in this life we are living. Even though what we are experiencing in life now might just be Â”sensations occuring to our mindsÂ”, as Agent Smith puts it-- does it matter? We chose to live and hold on to certain things we cherish in this life. And that is whatÂ’s most important.<br><br><strong>What is real? To answer this question, perhaps you should ask another question. What are the things in life that makes you feel real and alive?</strong><br><br>nky@singapore.com<br><br>Added:<br>Think TRUMAN SHOW. JIM CARREY was kinda happy before he found out his origins and purpose in life. But one day he found out his real purpose, his real world, and the truth about his life. He reached his end of his world-- the walls of the studio. How tragic.<br>Life.... we are always curious to find out more. But so what if we know the truth?<br></div>

Neo is DESIGNED to be linked to the machines... Given a certain amount of control over the machines' running and given SUPERB POWER in the Matrix by the Architect. It's all PART of the 'game'.

            <div class='col-md body'>i <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  never watch matrix 2 n 3 ........ but this's wat my friend send mi ..<br><br>Matrix Theory Explained<br><br>Zion is a program, just like the Matrix. How is<br>Neo able to figure out thathe is able to stop<br>the sentinels in Zion near the end of the film?<br>The spoon given to him earlier. It had obviously<br>been bent loads, but how outside the Matrix??<br>This gave Neo the inspiration and the<br>understanding that Zion is still a matrix.<br><br>"The One" is a program, but has to be "attached"<br>to someone in the Matrix.So Mr. Anderson got it<br>in the 6th version of the Matrix. Then "The<br>One"program's purpose is to allow Zion to be<br>destroyed then to rebuild it. The reason for<br>this is because of anomalies - the 1% of humans<br>that don't accept the Matrix. These are all<br>brought out of the Matrix program and into the<br>Zion program by the "Morpheus" program and other<br>similar "ship captain"programs. Then once all<br>the anomalies are out of the Matrix (and in<br>Zion),that is the time for Zion to be destroyed,<br>thus killing all the anomalies off. The Matrix<br>is then upgraded, thus creating the next version<br>of theMatrix, but Zion must be rebuilt so that<br>the next lot of anomalies can be brought out<br>again so that they can be destroyed.This is the<br>feedback-loop, and is the reason to retain a<br>handful of people so that Zion can be rebuilt.<br>So this is why Neo said the prophecy was a lie -<br>the One's purpose was not to end the war as the<br>prophecy stated.<br><br>Unfortunately, "The One" program must be re-used<br>each time, or copied, so itcan be "attached" to<br>a new anomaly inside the Matrix. So what happens<br>to the old "The One" program? It faces deletion,<br>and as the Oracle explained, it goes into exile<br>instead, just like the French bloke(the<br>Merovingian) did. He was the first One (probably<br>from the second version of the Matrix), and once<br>he fulfilled his duty, he became an exile<br>program and "abdicated" his "Oneness" by<br>choosing Persephone and power. This is evident<br>in the bogs when Persephone asks Neo to kiss<br>her. She says she wants him to kiss her so she<br>can feel what it is like again to be kissed<br>bysomething close to human, just like the<br>Merovingian used to be. Then she says to Trinity<br>that she envies her, but that these things are<br>not meant tolast. So the Merovingian used to be<br>just like Neo - a One - thus proving further the<br>feedback-loop explained earlier.<br><br>The correct door in the Architect's room<br>Now there are two possibilities here:<br><br>1. All the previous One's chose the right door<br>allowing a "temporary dissemination" of their<br>code into the Matrix (i.e., the code<br>they "carry" thus indicating Neo is indeed<br>human), then he must select (unplug) 23 people<br>from the Matrix to rebuild Zion. This takes away<br>the possibility that stories from previous<br>rebuilds of Zion will be carried through. But<br>Morpheus indicated in the first Matrix that this<br>is the case anyway. He said, "therewas a man<br>born inside, able to change things, it was he<br>who freed the first of us," - basically the One<br>previous to Neo. And this proves that the<br>previous One chose the right door also. Neo's<br>purpose is also to choose the right door, but he<br>does not because he faces deletion afterwards<br>and has the choice of going into exile -<br>programs choosing to go into exile is the one<br>thing that can't be accounted for in program<br>parameters. Thus, he chooses the left door<br>instead this time. How was Neo able to choose<br>the other door? Because of his extreme<br>willpower? - Even the Architect indicated that<br>he'd noticed this - "Interesting. That was<br>quicker than the others." Or more likely,<br>because the Oracle upgraded his coding with the<br>candy on the park bench. The candy/cookie was a<br>method to change the One's program. She said he<br>has made a believer out of her - this is quite<br>human-like and perhaps the previous One's didn't<br>accept the upgrade candy, now she has hope...<br>hope that Neo will finally choose the other door.<br><br>2. All the previous One's chose the left door,<br>saving Trinity and letting Zion fall. So this<br>time is no different. But the Architect does<br>say, "You are here because Zion is about to be<br>destroyed. Its every living<br>inhabitantterminated, its entire existence<br>eradicated," and also, "this will be the sixth<br>time we have destroyed it, and we have become<br>exceedingly efficient at it," - assuming the<br>Architect isn't lying, then they have already<br>destroyed Zion (i.e., Zion has fallen) five<br>times - i.e., the result of going through the<br>left door.<br><br>Morpheus and Trinity are programs.<br>Morpheus's purpose was to find the One and<br>deliver him to the Architect. Trinity's purpose<br>is to control the One by getting in love with<br>him. Trinity is supposed to be the mother of the<br>new One every time the Matrix is Reloaded.<br>That's why the sex scene was so important and<br>why she was named Trinity.<br><br>The Architect says, "she is going to die, and<br>there is nothing that you can do to stop it." He<br>was correct though because she did die just like<br>Neo did in the first Matrix (Oracle said he or<br>Morpheus would, and she didn't lie, but he came<br>back to life). Trinity dies, but comes back to<br>life (we are using medical definition of death<br>in all this of course!).<br><br>The Architect has already laid down an ultimatum<br>for Neo choosing the left door: The Architect -<br>"Failure to comply with this process will<br>result in acataclysmic system crash killing<br>everyone connected to the matrix, which coupled<br>with the extermination of Zion will ultimately<br>result in the extinction of the entire human<br>race." Neo - "You won't let it happen, you<br>can't. You need human beings to survive." The<br>Architect - "There are levels of survival we are<br>prepared to accept. However, the relevant issue<br>is whether or not you are ready to accept the<br>responsibility for the death of every human<br>being in this world."<br><br>Looking at this further, the Architect does<br>say "coupled" with the extermination of Zion<br>will the human race be exterminated. So he says<br>everyone connected to the Matrix will die, but<br>if Zion is not exterminated, the human race will<br>not necessarily die. Also, there is likely to be<br>a time-window between not going through the<br>right door, and the cataclysmic crash, thus<br>allowing Neo to unplug as many as possible from<br>the Matrix, then those people won't die. This<br>will be the start of the next Zion. As for the<br>Matrix, a cataclysmic crash doesn't mean the end<br>of the Matrix - just needs rebooting or<br>reloading!<br><br>Agent Smith is the only "human" in this world.<br>He's the one spreading himself like a virus<br>replicating himself over and over until the<br>Matrix will finally get overloaded and fail.<br>Smith is the one who wants to get out of the<br>Matrix for good. He said so in the first<br>Matrix, "I must get out of here, I must get<br>free! And in this mind, is the key," squeezing<br>Morpheus's temples, "my key! Once Zion is<br>destroyed, there is no need for me to be<br>here!"Smith knows that by killing Neo he can<br>escape the Matrix because Neo is the key to<br>resetting the Matrix, or to shut it off. It was<br>originally killing Neo (in the first Matrix)<br>that allowed Smith to become powerful (cloning<br>ability) - so killing Neo again will allow him<br>to gain Neo's powers completely, and thus gain<br>the power to shut down the Matrix.<br><br>So where the hell did Smith come from if he<br>wants to destroy the Matrix? He's obviously not<br>meant to be there - he's a computer virus as he<br>has every characteristic of a virus - he<br>multiplies and spreads and infects (and<br>emulates) other programs like one. He is exactly<br>as he described humans at the end of the first<br>Matrix - "You move to an area and you multiply<br>and multiply until every natural resource is<br>consumed and the only way you can survive is to<br>spread to another area. There is another<br>organism on this planet that follows the same<br>pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus." But<br>who put him there? This will only be revealed in<br>Revolutions (Revelations?) I guess - but I'm<br>betting on humans in the real real world, i.e.,<br>outside of Zion and the Matrix. They're at war<br>with the machines and trying to destroy them by<br>infecting them with this virus - Agent Smith. So<br>the irony with this theory is that Agent Smith<br>represents the human race!! Neo represents the<br>machines! Agent Smith says to Neo just after<br>he's seen the Oracle that he became free when<br>Neo destroyed him in the first Matrix (remember<br>when Neo entered his body and exploded him from<br>inside out) - as a virus, Smith has the ability<br>to "inherit" other programs' abilities and thus<br>inherited some of Neo's.<br><br>The anomaly is all the humans that do not accept<br>the Matrix. The Architect says "Your life is the<br>sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation<br>inherent to the programming of the matrix. You<br>are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite<br>my sincerest efforts I have been unable to<br>eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of<br>mathematical precision. While it remains a<br>burden to sedulously avoid it, it is not<br>unexpected, and thus not beyond a measure of<br>control." This includes Neo, but Neo's Matrix<br>avatar is attached with the One program so that<br>he can follow his purpose as explained earlier<br>under "The One explained".<br><br>However, he is also supposed to protect himself<br>and destroy anything that gets in his way -<br>i.e., Agent Smith - so that he may fulfil his<br>purpose. Further proving Neo - and other non-<br>accepters of the Matrix - are the anomaly, the<br>Architect says,"Your life is the sum of a<br>remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to<br>the programming of the matrix." The clue here is<br>Neo's program name - "The One". Take one- third<br>for example. 1 over 3 is 0.33333 recurring. A<br>computer cannot deal with recurring numbers, so<br>must accept a limit, let's say 0.33333 for<br>argument's sake. Multiply by 3, you get 0.99999 -<br>never 1.00000, where has the "remainder"<br>0.00001 (One) gone? This is the limitation of<br>computers, this is the mathematical imprecision<br>inherent in programming (of the Matrix) and the<br>eventuality of the One anomaly unable to be<br>eliminated.<br><br>What is the equation then? Not sure, but it<br>definitely involves pi. The Keymaker refers to<br>the window of time to open the door to the<br>mainframe as 314 seconds. 3.14 is pi to three<br>sig. figs., or the number of radians in half a<br>circle. Half a circle is like the cross-section<br>of a womb, similar to the alcove of Neo and<br>Trinity's love scene - conceiving the next<br>One? "NEO", incidently, is an anagram of "ONE".<br>Trinity and Neo - one on one; a choice - one or<br>one. Leads us to 101. "101" is mentioned<br>numerous times in Matrix 1 and Reloaded. Neo's<br>room at the beginning, Merovingian is on the<br>101st floor, the 101 freeway of the car chase in<br>Reloaded, then when Trinity is hacking into the<br>power plant system, she resets the password to<br>Z10N0101. Freaky. Indicates that she is a<br>program because that's not some random password<br>she's put in. 101 is binary for 5, which in zero-<br>based binary counting: 000 is 1, 001, is 2, 010<br>is 3, 011 is 4, 100 is 5, 101 is 6 - And this is<br>the 6th version of the Matrix! Then there's 303.<br>303 is the room Neo got shot in Matrix 1, the<br>Oracle lives in room 303, it's also the hotel<br>room number Trinity is in in Matrix 1 and it's<br>seen at the end when Neo fights the Agents and<br>Smith and begins to literally see the code that<br>makes up the Matrix. 101 x 3 = 303, a trilogy, 3<br>+ 0 + 3 = 6 = the 6th Matrix.Trinity means 3.<br><br>Who is the "mother" that the Architect refers<br>to? The Architect says, "Please," in an almost<br>disapproving sense when Neo suggests the Oracle,<br>but does not reveal who it really is or even<br>directly that Neo is wrong. The architect was<br>the one who created the Matrix; the co-creator<br>is neither Persephone nor the Oracle. Both of<br>them are only programs that have a purpose in<br>the matrix, just like the rest. The Architect is<br>in charge of the Matrix world and the co-creator<br>is in charge of Zion. She has almost the same<br>age as the Architect. Therefore, that woman is<br>the Head Counsellor, the only woman of<br>importance that lives in Zion and the one who<br>asked for the two captains to volunteer at the<br>council meeting. She's the one who knew all<br>along about the Matrix. She was the one who told<br>Zion's Defence Minister to cool off and to hlet<br>Morpheus do his work so things could go as<br>planned. Or alternatively, it could indeed be<br>the Oracle. She is the only program that truly<br>wants humans to have a free choice... at the<br>same time, she sees the future, because she<br>knows the program code - she is like God - which<br>is why Seraph protects her - see "Who is<br>Seraph?" below.<br><br>What's so special about Neo's avatar? Neo is a<br>skilled hacker, and his avatar in the Matrix is<br>based on the person that founded the AI of the<br>original machines that eventually took over the<br>world... How? Take a look at the disc he gave to<br>the bloke at the door at the beginning of Matrix<br>1. It said "DISC AI" on it. The hollowed book<br>Neo takes the disc out of is"Simulacra and<br>Simulation" - a collection of essays by the<br>French postmodernist philosopher Jean<br>Baudrillard. He opens it to the section "on<br>Nihilism" (meaning nothing is truly known,<br>etc.). "Baudrillard's concept of simulation is<br>the creation of the real through conceptual<br>or 'mythological' models which have no<br>connection or origin in reality. The model<br>becomes the determinant of our perception of<br>reality--the real." And Morpheus says, "Welcome<br>to the desert of the real," in Matrix 1. I'd say<br>this book describes The Matrix to a tee. So this<br>disc contains the key to the AI, and thus how to<br>destroy the machines, so I think they'll use<br>this info in Revolutions to ultimately destroy<br>the machines, which means he'll have to go back<br>to the nightclub and find the guy he gave it to.<br><br>Who is Seraph? The reason Seraph (the chink guy<br>Neo meets before meeting the Oracle) had golden<br>code and was so spectacular is that he came from<br>the first incarnation of the matrix, which was<br>heaven. "Seraph" is singular for the<br>plural "seraphim". The seraphim are the highest<br>choir of angels and included amongst others:<br>Lucifer, Gabriele, Raziel and Malaciah, and they<br>sit on the 8th level of Heaven just one below<br>God. So Seraph will obviously have a big part in<br>Revolutions, but whose side will he be on - the<br>machines or the humans?? That is the question.<br><br>The Twins<br>They are exiled programs that emulate the human<br>myth of ghosts as the Oracle explained. They are<br>programs behaving badly. Persephone killed one<br>of the Merovingian's bodyguards with a silver<br>bullet because he was emulating a werewolf. So<br>if the Twins could phase into ghost form, why<br>didn't he when his arm was trapped in the door<br>of the garage? Was it because he was wounded or<br>because he can't phase when his arm is trapped?<br>No of course not. The doors of that building,<br>when shut, always led somewhere else(usually in<br>the mountains) when opened again without the<br>Keymaker's key. So if it were slammed shut due<br>to the Twin phasing into ghost form, the Twin's<br>arm would've ended up god knows where, but<br>certainly not attached to the Twin's body.<br><br></div>

How is<br>Neo able to figure out thathe is able to stop<br>the sentinels in Zion near the end of the film?<br>The spoon given to him earlier. It had obviously<br>been bent loads, but how outside the Matrix??<br>This gave Neo the inspiration and the<br>understanding that Zion is still a matrix.<br><br>"The One" is a program, but has to be "attached"<br>to someone in the Matrix.So Mr. Anderson got it<br>in the 6th version of the Matrix. Then "The<br>One"program's purpose is to allow Zion to be<br>destroyed then to rebuild it. The reason for<br>this is because of anomalies - the 1% of humans<br>that don't accept the Matrix. These are all<br>brought out of the Matrix program and into the<br>Zion program by the "Morpheus" program and other<br>similar "ship captain"programs. Then once all<br>the anomalies are out of the Matrix (and in<br>Zion),that is the time for Zion to be destroyed,<br>thus killing all the anomalies off. The Matrix<br>is then upgraded, thus creating the next version<br>of theMatrix, but Zion must be rebuilt so that<br>the next lot of anomalies can be brought out<br>again so that they can be destroyed.This is the<br>feedback-loop, and is the reason to retain a<br>handful of people so that Zion can be rebuilt.<br>So this is why Neo said the prophecy was a lie -<br>the One's purpose was not to end the war as the<br>prophecy stated.<br><br>Unfortunately, "The One" program must be re-used<br>each time, or copied, so itcan be "attached" to<br>a new anomaly inside the Matrix. So what happens<br>to the old "The One" program? It faces deletion,<br>and as the Oracle explained, it goes into exile<br>instead, just like the French bloke(the<br>Merovingian) did. He was the first One (probably<br>from the second version of the Matrix), and once<br>he fulfilled his duty, he became an exile<br>program and "abdicated" his "Oneness" by<br>choosing Persephone and power. This is evident<br>in the bogs when Persephone asks Neo to kiss<br>her. She says she wants him to kiss her so she<br>can feel what it is like again to be kissed<br>bysomething close to human, just like the<br>Merovingian used to be. Then she says to Trinity<br>that she envies her, but that these things are<br>not meant tolast. So the Merovingian used to be<br>just like Neo - a One - thus proving further the<br>feedback-loop explained earlier.<br><br>The correct door in the Architect's room<br>Now there are two possibilities here:<br><br>1. All the previous One's chose the right door<br>allowing a "temporary dissemination" of their<br>code into the Matrix (i.e., the code<br>they "carry" thus indicating Neo is indeed<br>human), then he must select (unplug) 23 people<br>from the Matrix to rebuild Zion. This takes away<br>the possibility that stories from previous<br>rebuilds of Zion will be carried through. But<br>Morpheus indicated in the first Matrix that this<br>is the case anyway. He said, "therewas a man<br>born inside, able to change things, it was he<br>who freed the first of us," - basically the One<br>previous to Neo. And this proves that the<br>previous One chose the right door also. Neo's<br>purpose is also to choose the right door, but he<br>does not because he faces deletion afterwards<br>and has the choice of going into exile -<br>programs choosing to go into exile is the one<br>thing that can't be accounted for in program<br>parameters. Thus, he chooses the left door<br>instead this time. How was Neo able to choose<br>the other door? Because of his extreme<br>willpower? - Even the Architect indicated that<br>he'd noticed this - "Interesting. That was<br>quicker than the others." Or more likely,<br>because the Oracle upgraded his coding with the<br>candy on the park bench. The candy/cookie was a<br>method to change the One's program. She said he<br>has made a believer out of her - this is quite<br>human-like and perhaps the previous One's didn't<br>accept the upgrade candy, now she has hope...<br>hope that Neo will finally choose the other door.<br><br>2. All the previous One's chose the left door,<br>saving Trinity and letting Zion fall. So this<br>time is no different. But the Architect does<br>say, "You are here because Zion is about to be<br>destroyed. Its every living<br>inhabitantterminated, its entire existence<br>eradicated," and also, "this will be the sixth<br>time we have destroyed it, and we have become<br>exceedingly efficient at it," - assuming the<br>Architect isn't lying, then they have already<br>destroyed Zion (i.e., Zion has fallen) five<br>times - i.e., the result of going through the<br>left door.<br><br>Morpheus and Trinity are programs.<br>Morpheus's purpose was to find the One and<br>deliver him to the Architect. Trinity's purpose<br>is to control the One by getting in love with<br>him. Trinity is supposed to be the mother of the<br>new One every time the Matrix is Reloaded.<br>That's why the sex scene was so important and<br>why she was named Trinity.<br><br>The Architect says, "she is going to die, and<br>there is nothing that you can do to stop it." He<br>was correct though because she did die just like<br>Neo did in the first Matrix (Oracle said he or<br>Morpheus would, and she didn't lie, but he came<br>back to life). Trinity dies, but comes back to<br>life (we are using medical definition of death<br>in all this of course!).<br><br>The Architect has already laid down an ultimatum<br>for Neo choosing the left door: The Architect -<br>"Failure to comply with this process will<br>result in acataclysmic system crash killing<br>everyone connected to the matrix, which coupled<br>with the extermination of Zion will ultimately<br>result in the extinction of the entire human<br>race." Neo - "You won't let it happen, you<br>can't. You need human beings to survive." The<br>Architect - "There are levels of survival we are<br>prepared to accept. However, the relevant issue<br>is whether or not you are ready to accept the<br>responsibility for the death of every human<br>being in this world."<br><br>Looking at this further, the Architect does<br>say "coupled" with the extermination of Zion<br>will the human race be exterminated. So he says<br>everyone connected to the Matrix will die, but<br>if Zion is not exterminated, the human race will<br>not necessarily die. Also, there is likely to be<br>a time-window between not going through the<br>right door, and the cataclysmic crash, thus<br>allowing Neo to unplug as many as possible from<br>the Matrix, then those people won't die. This<br>will be the start of the next Zion. As for the<br>Matrix, a cataclysmic crash doesn't mean the end<br>of the Matrix - just needs rebooting or<br>reloading!<br><br>Agent Smith is the only "human" in this world.<br>He's the one spreading himself like a virus<br>replicating himself over and over until the<br>Matrix will finally get overloaded and fail.<br>Smith is the one who wants to get out of the<br>Matrix for good. He said so in the first<br>Matrix, "I must get out of here, I must get<br>free! And in this mind, is the key," squeezing<br>Morpheus's temples, "my key! Once Zion is<br>destroyed, there is no need for me to be<br>here!"Smith knows that by killing Neo he can<br>escape the Matrix because Neo is the key to<br>resetting the Matrix, or to shut it off. It was<br>originally killing Neo (in the first Matrix)<br>that allowed Smith to become powerful (cloning<br>ability) - so killing Neo again will allow him<br>to gain Neo's powers completely, and thus gain<br>the power to shut down the Matrix.<br><br>So where the hell did Smith come from if he<br>wants to destroy the Matrix? He's obviously not<br>meant to be there - he's a computer virus as he<br>has every characteristic of a virus - he<br>multiplies and spreads and infects (and<br>emulates) other programs like one. He is exactly<br>as he described humans at the end of the first<br>Matrix - "You move to an area and you multiply<br>and multiply until every natural resource is<br>consumed and the only way you can survive is to<br>spread to another area. There is another<br>organism on this planet that follows the same<br>pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus." But<br>who put him there? This will only be revealed in<br>Revolutions (Revelations?) I guess - but I'm<br>betting on humans in the real real world, i.e.,<br>outside of Zion and the Matrix. They're at war<br>with the machines and trying to destroy them by<br>infecting them with this virus - Agent Smith. So<br>the irony with this theory is that Agent Smith<br>represents the human race!!

She says she wants him to kiss her so she<br>can feel what it is like again to be kissed<br>bysomething close to human, just like the<br>Merovingian used to be. Then she says to Trinity<br>that she envies her, but that these things are<br>not meant tolast. So the Merovingian used to be<br>just like Neo - a One - thus proving further the<br>feedback-loop explained earlier.<br><br>The correct door in the Architect's room<br>Now there are two possibilities here:<br><br>1. All the previous One's chose the right door<br>allowing a "temporary dissemination" of their<br>code into the Matrix (i.e., the code<br>they "carry" thus indicating Neo is indeed<br>human), then he must select (unplug) 23 people<br>from the Matrix to rebuild Zion. This takes away<br>the possibility that stories from previous<br>rebuilds of Zion will be carried through. But<br>Morpheus indicated in the first Matrix that this<br>is the case anyway. He said, "therewas a man<br>born inside, able to change things, it was he<br>who freed the first of us," - basically the One<br>previous to Neo. And this proves that the<br>previous One chose the right door also. Neo's<br>purpose is also to choose the right door, but he<br>does not because he faces deletion afterwards<br>and has the choice of going into exile -<br>programs choosing to go into exile is the one<br>thing that can't be accounted for in program<br>parameters. Thus, he chooses the left door<br>instead this time. How was Neo able to choose<br>the other door? Because of his extreme<br>willpower? - Even the Architect indicated that<br>he'd noticed this - "Interesting. That was<br>quicker than the others." Or more likely,<br>because the Oracle upgraded his coding with the<br>candy on the park bench. The candy/cookie was a<br>method to change the One's program. She said he<br>has made a believer out of her - this is quite<br>human-like and perhaps the previous One's didn't<br>accept the upgrade candy, now she has hope...<br>hope that Neo will finally choose the other door.<br><br>2. All the previous One's chose the left door,<br>saving Trinity and letting Zion fall. So this<br>time is no different. But the Architect does<br>say, "You are here because Zion is about to be<br>destroyed. Its every living<br>inhabitantterminated, its entire existence<br>eradicated," and also, "this will be the sixth<br>time we have destroyed it, and we have become<br>exceedingly efficient at it," - assuming the<br>Architect isn't lying, then they have already<br>destroyed Zion (i.e., Zion has fallen) five<br>times - i.e., the result of going through the<br>left door.<br><br>Morpheus and Trinity are programs.<br>Morpheus's purpose was to find the One and<br>deliver him to the Architect. Trinity's purpose<br>is to control the One by getting in love with<br>him. Trinity is supposed to be the mother of the<br>new One every time the Matrix is Reloaded.<br>That's why the sex scene was so important and<br>why she was named Trinity.<br><br>The Architect says, "she is going to die, and<br>there is nothing that you can do to stop it." He<br>was correct though because she did die just like<br>Neo did in the first Matrix (Oracle said he or<br>Morpheus would, and she didn't lie, but he came<br>back to life). Trinity dies, but comes back to<br>life (we are using medical definition of death<br>in all this of course!).<br><br>The Architect has already laid down an ultimatum<br>for Neo choosing the left door: The Architect -<br>"Failure to comply with this process will<br>result in acataclysmic system crash killing<br>everyone connected to the matrix, which coupled<br>with the extermination of Zion will ultimately<br>result in the extinction of the entire human<br>race." Neo - "You won't let it happen, you<br>can't. You need human beings to survive." The<br>Architect - "There are levels of survival we are<br>prepared to accept. However, the relevant issue<br>is whether or not you are ready to accept the<br>responsibility for the death of every human<br>being in this world."<br><br>Looking at this further, the Architect does<br>say "coupled" with the extermination of Zion<br>will the human race be exterminated. So he says<br>everyone connected to the Matrix will die, but<br>if Zion is not exterminated, the human race will<br>not necessarily die. Also, there is likely to be<br>a time-window between not going through the<br>right door, and the cataclysmic crash, thus<br>allowing Neo to unplug as many as possible from<br>the Matrix, then those people won't die. This<br>will be the start of the next Zion. As for the<br>Matrix, a cataclysmic crash doesn't mean the end<br>of the Matrix - just needs rebooting or<br>reloading!<br><br>Agent Smith is the only "human" in this world.<br>He's the one spreading himself like a virus<br>replicating himself over and over until the<br>Matrix will finally get overloaded and fail.<br>Smith is the one who wants to get out of the<br>Matrix for good. He said so in the first<br>Matrix, "I must get out of here, I must get<br>free! And in this mind, is the key," squeezing<br>Morpheus's temples, "my key! Once Zion is<br>destroyed, there is no need for me to be<br>here!"Smith knows that by killing Neo he can<br>escape the Matrix because Neo is the key to<br>resetting the Matrix, or to shut it off. It was<br>originally killing Neo (in the first Matrix)<br>that allowed Smith to become powerful (cloning<br>ability) - so killing Neo again will allow him<br>to gain Neo's powers completely, and thus gain<br>the power to shut down the Matrix.<br><br>So where the hell did Smith come from if he<br>wants to destroy the Matrix? He's obviously not<br>meant to be there - he's a computer virus as he<br>has every characteristic of a virus - he<br>multiplies and spreads and infects (and<br>emulates) other programs like one. He is exactly<br>as he described humans at the end of the first<br>Matrix - "You move to an area and you multiply<br>and multiply until every natural resource is<br>consumed and the only way you can survive is to<br>spread to another area. There is another<br>organism on this planet that follows the same<br>pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus." But<br>who put him there? This will only be revealed in<br>Revolutions (Revelations?) I guess - but I'm<br>betting on humans in the real real world, i.e.,<br>outside of Zion and the Matrix. They're at war<br>with the machines and trying to destroy them by<br>infecting them with this virus - Agent Smith. So<br>the irony with this theory is that Agent Smith<br>represents the human race!! Neo represents the<br>machines! Agent Smith says to Neo just after<br>he's seen the Oracle that he became free when<br>Neo destroyed him in the first Matrix (remember<br>when Neo entered his body and exploded him from<br>inside out) - as a virus, Smith has the ability<br>to "inherit" other programs' abilities and thus<br>inherited some of Neo's.<br><br>The anomaly is all the humans that do not accept<br>the Matrix. The Architect says "Your life is the<br>sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation<br>inherent to the programming of the matrix. You<br>are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite<br>my sincerest efforts I have been unable to<br>eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of<br>mathematical precision. While it remains a<br>burden to sedulously avoid it, it is not<br>unexpected, and thus not beyond a measure of<br>control." This includes Neo, but Neo's Matrix<br>avatar is attached with the One program so that<br>he can follow his purpose as explained earlier<br>under "The One explained".<br><br>However, he is also supposed to protect himself<br>and destroy anything that gets in his way -<br>i.e., Agent Smith - so that he may fulfil his<br>purpose. Further proving Neo - and other non-<br>accepters of the Matrix - are the anomaly, the<br>Architect says,"Your life is the sum of a<br>remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to<br>the programming of the matrix." The clue here is<br>Neo's program name - "The One". Take one- third<br>for example. 1 over 3 is 0.33333 recurring. A<br>computer cannot deal with recurring numbers, so<br>must accept a limit, let's say 0.33333 for<br>argument's sake. Multiply by 3, you get 0.99999 -<br>never 1.00000, where has the "remainder"<br>0.00001 (One) gone? This is the limitation of<br>computers, this is the mathematical imprecision<br>inherent in programming (of the Matrix) and the<br>eventuality of the One anomaly unable to be<br>eliminated.<br><br>What is the equation then? Not sure, but it<br>definitely involves pi. The Keymaker refers to<br>the window of time to open the door to the<br>mainframe as 314 seconds. 3.14 is pi to three<br>sig. figs., or the number of radians in half a<br>circle. Half a circle is like the cross-section<br>of a womb, similar to the alcove of Neo and<br>Trinity's love scene - conceiving the next<br>One? "NEO", incidently, is an anagram of "ONE".<br>Trinity and Neo - one on one; a choice - one or<br>one. Leads us to 101. "101" is mentioned<br>numerous times in Matrix 1 and Reloaded. Neo's<br>room at the beginning, Merovingian is on the<br>101st floor, the 101 freeway of the car chase in<br>Reloaded, then when Trinity is hacking into the<br>power plant system, she resets the password to<br>Z10N0101. Freaky. Indicates that she is a<br>program because that's not some random password<br>she's put in. 101 is binary for 5, which in zero-<br>based binary counting: 000 is 1, 001, is 2, 010<br>is 3, 011 is 4, 100 is 5, 101 is 6 - And this is<br>the 6th version of the Matrix! Then there's 303.<br>303 is the room Neo got shot in Matrix 1, the<br>Oracle lives in room 303, it's also the hotel<br>room number Trinity is in in Matrix 1 and it's<br>seen at the end when Neo fights the Agents and<br>Smith and begins to literally see the code that<br>makes up the Matrix. 101 x 3 = 303, a trilogy, 3<br>+ 0 + 3 = 6 = the 6th Matrix.Trinity means 3.<br><br>Who is the "mother" that the Architect refers<br>to? The Architect says, "Please," in an almost<br>disapproving sense when Neo suggests the Oracle,<br>but does not reveal who it really is or even<br>directly that Neo is wrong. The architect was<br>the one who created the Matrix; the co-creator<br>is neither Persephone nor the Oracle. Both of<br>them are only programs that have a purpose in<br>the matrix, just like the rest. The Architect is<br>in charge of the Matrix world and the co-creator<br>is in charge of Zion. She has almost the same<br>age as the Architect. Therefore, that woman is<br>the Head Counsellor, the only woman of<br>importance that lives in Zion and the one who<br>asked for the two captains to volunteer at the<br>council meeting. She's the one who knew all<br>along about the Matrix. She was the one who told<br>Zion's Defence Minister to cool off and to hlet<br>Morpheus do his work so things could go as<br>planned. Or alternatively, it could indeed be<br>the Oracle. She is the only program that truly<br>wants humans to have a free choice... at the<br>same time, she sees the future, because she<br>knows the program code - she is like God - which<br>is why Seraph protects her - see "Who is<br>Seraph?" below.<br><br>What's so special about Neo's avatar? Neo is a<br>skilled hacker, and his avatar in the Matrix is<br>based on the person that founded the AI of the<br>original machines that eventually took over the<br>world... How? Take a look at the disc he gave to<br>the bloke at the door at the beginning of Matrix<br>1. It said "DISC AI" on it. The hollowed book<br>Neo takes the disc out of is"Simulacra and<br>Simulation" - a collection of essays by the<br>French postmodernist philosopher Jean<br>Baudrillard. He opens it to the section "on<br>Nihilism" (meaning nothing is truly known,<br>etc.). "Baudrillard's concept of simulation is<br>the creation of the real through conceptual<br>or 'mythological' models which have no<br>connection or origin in reality. The model<br>becomes the determinant of our perception of<br>reality--the real." And Morpheus says, "Welcome<br>to the desert of the real," in Matrix 1. I'd say<br>this book describes The Matrix to a tee. So this<br>disc contains the key to the AI, and thus how to<br>destroy the machines, so I think they'll use<br>this info in Revolutions to ultimately destroy<br>the machines, which means he'll have to go back<br>to the nightclub and find the guy he gave it to.<br><br>Who is Seraph? The reason Seraph (the chink guy<br>Neo meets before meeting the Oracle) had golden<br>code and was so spectacular is that he came from<br>the first incarnation of the matrix, which was<br>heaven. "Seraph" is singular for the<br>plural "seraphim". The seraphim are the highest<br>choir of angels and included amongst others:<br>Lucifer, Gabriele, Raziel and Malaciah, and they<br>sit on the 8th level of Heaven just one below<br>God. So Seraph will obviously have a big part in<br>Revolutions, but whose side will he be on - the<br>machines or the humans?? That is the question.<br><br>The Twins<br>They are exiled programs that emulate the human<br>myth of ghosts as the Oracle explained. They are<br>programs behaving badly. Persephone killed one<br>of the Merovingian's bodyguards with a silver<br>bullet because he was emulating a werewolf. So<br>if the Twins could phase into ghost form, why<br>didn't he when his arm was trapped in the door<br>of the garage? Was it because he was wounded or<br>because he can't phase when his arm is trapped?<br>No of course not. The doors of that building,<br>when shut, always led somewhere else(usually in<br>the mountains) when opened again without the<br>Keymaker's key. So if it were slammed shut due<br>to the Twin phasing into ghost form, the Twin's<br>arm would've ended up god knows where, but<br>certainly not attached to the Twin's body.<br><br></div>
