            <div class='col-md body'>1. A guy with your IQ should have a low voice too!<br><br>2. Any similarity between you and a human is purely coincidental!<br><br>3. Are you always so stupid or is today a special occasion?<br><br>4. As an outsider, what do you think of the human race?<br><br>5. I'd like to kick you in the teeth, but why should I improve your<br>looks?<br><br>6. At least there'e one thing good about your body. It isn't as ugly<br>as your face!<br><br>7. Brains aren't everything. In fact, in your case they're nothing<br><br>8. Careful now, don't let your brains go to your head!<br><br>9. I like you. People say I've no taste, but I like you<br><br>10. Did your parents ever ask you to run away from home?<br><br>11. If I had a face like yours. I'd sue my parents!<br><br>12. Don't feel bad. A lot of people have no talent!<br><br>13. Don't get insulted, but is your job devoted to spreading<br>ignorance?<br><br>14. Keep talking, someday you'll say something intelligent!<br><br>15. Don't you love nature, despite what it did to you?<br><br>16. Don't think, it may sprain your brain!<br><br>17. Fellows like you don't grow from trees; they swing from them.<br><br>18. He has a mechanical mind. Too bad he forgot to wind it up this morning.<br><br>19. He has a mind like a steel trap -- always closed!<br><br>20. You are a man of the world -- and you know what sad shape the<br>world is in.<br><br>21. He is always lost in thought -- it's unfamiliar territory.<br><br>22. He is dark and handsome. When it's dark, he's handsome.<br><br>23. He is known as a miracle comic. if he's funny, it's a miracle!<br><br>24. He is listed in Who's Who as What's That?<br><br>25. He is living proof that man can live without a brain!<br><br>26. He is so short, when it rains he is always the last one to know.<br><br>27. He is the kind of a man that you would use as a blueprint to<br>build an idiot.<br><br>28. How come you're here? I thought the zoo was closed at night!<br><br>29. How did you get here? Did someone leave your cage open?<br><br>30. How much refund do you expect on your head -- Now that it's EMPTY.<br><br>31. How would you like to feel the way you look?<br><br>32. Hi! I'm a human being! What are you?<br><br>33. I can't talk to you right now; tell me, where will you be in ten years?<br><br>34. I don't want you to turn the other cheek. It's just as ugly.<br><br>35. I don't know who you are, but whatever it is, i'm sure everyone will agree with me.<br><br>36. I don't know what makes you so stupid, but it really works!<br><br>37. I could make a monkey out of you, but why should I take all the credit?<br><br>38. I can't seem to remember your name, and please don't help me!<br><br>39. I don't even like the people you're trying to imitate! (if you are at all !)<br><br>40. I know you were born silly, but why did you have a relapse?<br><br>41. I know you're a self-made man. It's nice of you to take the blame!<br><br>42. I know you're not as stupid as you look. Nobody could be!<br><br>43. I've seen people like you, but I had to pay admission!<br><br>44.

If this classmate mispronounces a part of his speech, laugh very loudly.<br><br>When someone asks you if you have a hall pass, say, "I just killed a man. What did you want, a hall pass?"<br><br>When asked why you're late to class, simply say "I was having my period." If you're a woman, no questions will be asked, and if you're a man, NO QUESTIONS WILL BE ASKED<br><br>Every day, ask the Health teacher to describe the symptoms of a different venerial disease. After she's gone over them, turn extremely pale and say nothing for the rest of the class. Try to look thoughtful and preoccupied. Then, go up to people during lunch and occasionally touch their food.<br><br>Every time the girl in front of you lets her hair fall all over your desk, close your textbook on it.<br><br>If the class is on a second floor, say you fell asleep because of the altitude.<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>
