Perhaps I should have found it pleasanter if I had been able to decipher it. I donÂ’t think that I mastered anything beyond the date (which I knew) and the signature (which I guessed at).

            <div class='col-md body'>hallo colette,<br>sorry for the cheeky joke on ur best pal missus kitty. My sincerest apologies for my attempted humour which comes across as crude and tastless.<br><br>Well, i got no quotes to offer, just this fav, story of mine that i wish to share with u ppl  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>enjoy.<br>Calling the asshole<br>For all of you who occasionally have a really bad day when you just need to take it out on someone!!! Don't take that bad day out on someone you know, take it out on someone you DON'T know!!! Now get this. I was sitting at my desk, when I remembered a phone call I had to make. I found the number and dialed it. A man answered nicely saying, "Hello?" I politely said, "This is James here and could I please speak to Robin C----?"<br><br>Suddenly the phone was slammed down on me! I couldn't believe that anyone could be that rude. I tracked down Robin's correct number and called her. She had transposed the last two digits incorrectly. After I hung up with Robin, I spotted the wrong number still lying there on my desk. I decided to call it again.<br><br>When the same person once more answered, I yelled "You're a asshole!" and hung up. Next to his phone number I wrote the word "asshole," and put it in my desk drawer. Every couple of weeks, when I was paying bills, or had a really bad day, I'd call him up. He'd answer, and I'd yell, "You're a asshole!" It would always cheer me up.<br><br>Later in the year Telecom introduced caller ID. This was a real disappointment for me, I would have to stop calling the asshole. Then one day I had an idea. I dialed his number, then heard his voice, "Hello." I made up a name. "Hi. This is the sales office of Telecom and I'm just calling to see if you're familiar with our caller ID program?" He went, "No!" and slammed the phone down. I quickly called him back and said, "That's because you're a asshole!"<br><br>The reason I took the time to tell you this story, is to show you how if there's ever anything really bothering you, you can do something about it. Just dial 743 8___.<br><br>[Keep reading, it gets better.]<br>The old lady at the NTUC really took her time pulling out of the parking pace. I didn't think she was ever going to leave. Finally, her Proton Saga began to move and she started to very slowly back out of the slot. I backed up little more to give her plenty of room to pull out. Great, I thought, she's finally leaving. All of a sudden this black ah beng Honda Civic came flying up the parking isle in the wrong direction and pulls into her space.<br><br>I started blasting my horn and yelling, "Siao ay!!! You can't just do that. I was here first want leh!!!!" The guy climbed out of his Beng-da civic completely ignoring me. He walked toward the NTUC as if he didn't even hear me. I thought to myself, this guy's a asshole, there sure are a lot of assholess in this world. I noticed he had a "For Sale" sign in the back window of his car. I wrote down the number. Then I hunted for another place to park.<br><br>A couple of days later, I'm at home sitting at my desk. I had just gotten off the phone after calling 743 8___ and yelling, "You're a asshole!" (It's really easy to call him now since I have his number on speed dial.) I noticed the phone number of the guy with the black Honda Civics lying on my desk and thought I'd better call this guy, too. After a couple rings someone answered the phone and said, "Hello." I said, "Is this the man with the black Honda Civics for sale?"<br>"Yes, it is."<br>"Can you tell me where I can see it?"<br>"Yes, I live at Bukit Timah 6th Ave--------- My house's a semi-D and the<br>car's parked right out front."<br>I said, "What's your name?"<br>"My name is Gary T---."<br>"When's a good time to catch you, Gary?"<br>"I'm home in the evenings."<br>"Listen Gary, can I tell you something?"<br>"Yes,"<br>"Gary T---, you're a asshole!" And I slammed the phone down.<br>After I hung up I added Gary T---'s number to my speed dialer. For a while things seemed to be going better for me. Now when I had a problem I had two assholess to call. Then, after several months of calling the assholess and hanging up on them, it just wasn't as enjoyable as it used to be. I gave the problem some serious thought and came up with a solution:<br>First, I had my phone dial Asshole #1. A man answered rudely saying,<br>"Yeah?!?!."<br>I yelled "You're a asshole!", but I didn't hang up.<br>The asshole said, "Are you still there?"<br>I said, "Yeah."<br>He said, "Stop calling me hor."<br>I said, "Don't feel like it leh."<br>He said, "What's your name, F@#$%#?"<br>I said, "Gary T----."<br>He said "Where the F$%# you live?"<br>"Bukit Timah 6th Ave-------. My house is a semi-D and my black Honda Civics' parked out front."<br>"I'm coming over right now, Gary. You'd better start saying your prayers, cos i m going to whack the bloody shi*&amp;  f#$%"<br>"Yeah, i m now peeing in my pants man, Asshole!!!!!!" and I hung up.<br>Then I called Asshole #2. He answered, "Hello."<br>I said, "Hello, Asshole!"<br>He said, "If I ever find out who the chee@#$ you are..."<br>"You'll what hah?"<br>"I'll kick your che@#$ lang!@@ and @#$ @#$%&amp; @#$%"<br>"Well, here's your chance cos i m coming over right now Asshole!!!!" And I hung up.<br>Then I picked up the phone and called 999. I told them I was at Bukit Timah 6th Ave----- and that I was going to kill my gay lover as soon as he got home. Another quick call to TCS 5 and The Newpaper, Straits Times, Berita Harian, Tamil Times,Lianhe Wanbao and Sinmin about the secret society war going on down at Bukit Timah. After that I climbed into my trusty Nissan and headed over to 6th Ave to watch the whole thing.<br>Shiok Man!<br>Watching two Assholes kicking the shit out of each other in front of 6 mata cia and 10+ multi racial reporters was one of the greatest experiences of my life!
