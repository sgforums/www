            <div class='col-md body'>Which Cat high u talking abt? I did lower primary at the Bright Hill building ( where Ai Tong Primary is present day) between 1990-1992 while the campus at Bishan St 22 was under construction. I remember, rather vividly in fact, that there were two moulds erected outside the open field seperated from the soccer field by a fence and a row of trees where primary school kids gathered around every reccess to pick worms from (till today I still can't finger out why we did that?) Besides the worm picking, the other attraction was of course, the two moulds. Rumor has it that inside the two moulds were coffins left behind by the grave diggers when they cleared the land (Bishan was a graveyard before it became what it is today) To spice it all up, it is said that some scouts (it's always the scouts for some reason) saw light illuminating from the mould in the wee hours of the morning. There are many rhetorical versions of this, some claim that student saw 'flying coffins' there one night. Anyway, all this rumors and myths just brought more students to the area for their daily pilgrimage. I remember it got so bad that the teachers actually posted prefects round the area to stop students going round there during reccess.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway, the new Cat high also had it's fair share of supernatural tales. I'm sure my fellow cat high mates would have heard of the primary one toilet. Apparently, some construction worker died there when the school was undergoing construction. Since then, the toilet door 'has a life of it's own', opening and closing by itself.<br><br>Besides that was the area near the band room, rather the area behind the 'barber shop', whcih went out of business after a while for obvious reasons. Before they cement the place up, it was this swamp like area, of which I can now figure out for myself is in such a derelict state because it just wasn't completed. Anyhow, again that area had an aura of attraction not only because of it's swarm like state but because of rumors that there were actually crocodiles living in that heap of mud! Haha, I think for the half a year the frenzy went on, the kids actuallu bought it and actually gathered round the area during reccess.<br><br>Oh yes, how can we forget the 'tunnel along the rifle range, behind the home econs room' The kids will just off the lights and start running through the tunnel and scream the shit scared of themselves. Those were the days.</div>
