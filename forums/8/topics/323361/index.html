              <p>The worst experience for my first, and possibly last time at East Coast Island Resort.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Its gonna be a long post, but give me some advices and viewpoints.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Saturday was a friend's birthday, and the few who decided to stay over rented two sets of mahjong tiles ($20 each), and 2 tables ($15 each).</p>
              <p>We entered the shop, and was made to wait due to the queue. I queued first, and my friend went to get a drink.</p>
              <p>After telling the lady at the counter that i needed 1 set of mahjong and table, she proceeded to fill up the receipt, while another lady opened up the mahjong for me.</p>
              <p>She "checked" the mahjong, and due to the queue, i was allowed a brief look at the mahjong. There are 4 compartments in the container (standard mahjong case), each containing different type of tiles (bamboo etc...) 3 of the compartments was not full, each short of 4, and the last compartment containing special tiles and flowers is full.</p>
              <p>Being an experienced player and the arrangement of the tiles (it was arranged nicely), i knew the missing tiles were "Fei", "Joker", and the empty ones.</p>
              <p>Because i rented from other shops before, i knew they have the habit of taking out those tiles which are not used in the game, and with them "checking" and "okaying" the set, i paid them $115 in total, $80 as refundable deposit.</p>
              <p>I waited for my friend who was behind in the queue, when it was his turn, i stood beside him and the exact same thing happened. So both of us gotten the sets without "Fei", "joker" and "blank" tiles, which was "complete" for the game.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Today morning, we both returned the mahjong to the shop, and they told us both sets are not full.</p>
              <p>We are pissed off and told them it is full, and we even arranged it nicely just like how it was given to us in front of them. Both ladies insisted that both sets should be with the missing "fei, joker and blank" tiles. We forgotten to add that, we were shouted at by the shop owner, as my friend as them to shut up while we are arranging.</p>
              <p>After a brief argument, i figured they were "out to eat" our deposit, so we left the shop with the sets and receipt, and i went to the island resort management to lodge a complain.</p>
              <p>The resort called down this manager, whom after i told him what happened, told me he had to check with the shop. And he returned to us telling us the shop said they had given the FULL set to us.</p>
              <p>After some argument, a chinese staff came to us, and he asked us what is the situation. Without telling him the situation, i asked him does he know mahjong, and his immediate reply was, 148 tiles right?</p>
              <p>I opened up the set and showed him both sets, with 148 tiles (without fei blank and joker) and asked him if anything is wrong, he said no.</p>
              <p>I them re-explained the whole situation. Again, i was given the same reply after they "checked" with the shop.</p>
              <p>Then they added there's nothing they could do, as they only lease the place to them. I told them they should be able to do something about it, as they are in charge of the place, and since they are doing unethical business.</p>
              <p>Again, same replies from them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We took the sets, with the receipts and went home.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So what can i do, its not only about the money, which is $160 (deposits) now, but the lousy management of the resort and the shop.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I checked case, but it seems like they dont handle things like this.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>
              <p> </p>
