            <div class='col-md body'>They want us to use internet banking more often,that's why they opt to charge us for ATM transaction as they are opting for thew hard approach now.So bottomline for them is lower overheads by using internet banking as a smokescreen as lower overheads = higher profits.Funny i never see DBS announce anything about a higher interest rate as although they say they want to follow how the commercial banks operate and implement a minimum balance scheme,but they don't want to increase interest rate equivalent to the commercial bank's interest rate.So now we have 2 announcements by DBS and both involves taking $$$ from us,so i guess in the not too distant future,there will be a 3% charge on NETS transactions using DBS cards to cover the cost of some other miscellaneous overhead  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">))</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I think DBS is getting less efficient and less competitive. This can be shown by the fact they have to resort to charging a fee for those accounts below $500 and now they are even suggesting a charge for use of the ATMs. All these can only happen if DBS is getting less efficient causing their costs to go up. Thus they are face with 3 choices<br><br>1)to absorb the costs themselves like wat our people's bank used to do, absorb the costs.<br><br>2)Restructure and find ways to cuts down on their costs like finding and eliminating any inefficient and ineffective internal policies.<br><br>3)Pass the costs to the consumers.<br><br>I guess they chose the easy way out by deciding method 3 is the best. It is the best for them as they do not have to make too many drastic changes internally and best of all still maintain a good or even better profit as they know many ppl cannot afford to close their accounts as employers require them to have a POSB account to deposit the monthly pay into. Well, to a certain extent, wat DBS is doing is going back on wat they promise the people when they took over POSB. Best of all, there is nothing anybody can do about it. Even by transfering the ppl's CPF into the account to meet the $500 minimum amount, it will only benefit DBS and prove them right that nobody can do anything about the changes. Or should I say those who can chose not to bother about it. So sad to see POSB falling into the wrong hands. An organisation must not only focus on short term profits but<br>must also be socially responsible. Earning money at the expense of the poor shows how desperate DBS have become. Poor DBS, if they really need the charges of $2 each to cover their costs, then I think they might as well close down and not waste too much of our resources. No point having an inefficent bank to suck the blood of us. All the goodwill built up by POSB over the years poured down the drain to affect us by DBS.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You know what i think? I think everything is fair. No meal in this world is for free. What's a small $2 fee compared to $500 fine in teaching people responsibility and not abusing the system?<br><br>Of course, those hit most will be the lower class people. Anyway.. I'm sure a compromise can be reach soon and a solution in the not so distant future.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here is a complaint letter from internet about DBS recent movement.<br><br>Dear DBS,<br><br>You may not admit it, but when you took over POSB in 1998, many POSB account holders were very unhappy. But we had no choice in the matter.<br><br>We were told that we will benefit from better services, and we could only hope that this will materialise. It's now about one and half year since. Let us look at what has been dished out to POSB account holders.<br><br>Our housing loan rates have been increased. Monthly account fees and penalties for not meeting the minimum daily balance have been introduced.<br><br>We now have to pay for cheques. Whereas POSB passcard statements showed useful information like where the NETS transaction was made, you gave me statements with meaningless 3 character general codes. It was not until this year that you were able to give me the type of information POSB could give me years ago. The conversion from POSB internet banking to DBS internet banking was anything but smooth. You discontinued access to the POSB internet banking website without any warning at all. Unauthorised NETS deductions were made from many POSB accounts. For such a serious mistake, you contributed a miserable $1 to me, but only to cover lost interest.<br><br>Sure, DBS has made available to us new investment and other financial services. But such things are of use only to people who need them. And to most POSB account holders, they only need a savings and a current account.<br><br>But POSB already had them. Most will need an ATM card. But POSB had this. Some may need phone or internet banking. But POSB also had them. In fact, I believe POSB was the first to introduce phone and internet banking in Singapore, and if I may add, self-updating passbook printing service and current account auto-GIRO facility, which are all very practical and useful services. I can safely say that the additional services introduced by DBS are pale in comparison to what POSB already offered its account holders.<br><br>Sure, our savings now earn a better rate of interest. But then again, it will soon be offset by the new charges and tax payable. In any event, I dare say that for most POSB account holders, they really did not mind the lower interest on their savings deposits. If they had minded, they would have long withdrawn their money and deposited it elsewhere. This is where sometimes, the people in authority are mistaken. They think that money is everything to everyone.<br><br>Does DBS not realise that for many POSB account holders, POSB is more than just a bank? When I was in a primary school in a rural part of Singapore, POSB used an old silly van to bring the bank to my school. I was taught to lick stamps to paste on some cards. If I am not mistaken, I was also given a POSB piggy bank. I am sure POSB lost money doing these things. But by doing so, POSB achieved two very important things:<br><br>(1) it taught all of us the importance of savings, a habit which Singaporeans can be proud of<br>(2) it secured me as a long term customer. I am working today and still use POSB as my primary banking account. I am sure many Singaporeans do the same.<br><br>POSB allows young children to open cute "My First Account"s with their birth certificates. They even contribute the first $1 to open the account. You don't even need to put in any money. And if the account reaches $1,000, they set up a trust fund for your children.<br><br>As far as I can remember, POSB was the first to encourage account holders to save more by issuing lucky draw tickets for every $500 or $1,000. And they always have this silly but quite entertaining annual POSB show, which by the way seems to have been terminated for no good reason.<br><br>What DBS has is this : penalise account holders if they fail to keep at least $500 in their accounts. Add a $2 monthly fee. This is savings by fear. It may work, but at a price to DBS.<br><br>I am sure that there are far more POSB account holders than DBS account holders. Why is it then that for ATMs, the buttons for POSB account holders are always placed at the inconvenient left side of the screen while those for DBS are conveniently located just next to the command buttons? And those who use phone banking will know how long one has to wait before one can get to the POSB accounts. I know I am a bit pesky but surely the fact that there are more POSB ATM cards and more POSB ATM machines must count for something.<br><br>I am sure if DBS does not want to take our frustrations into consideration, we cannot do much. I am not sure what my maid is going to do with her account. She will probably have to close the account, and I may have to pay her in cash. Maybe we might as well open an account somewhere else.<br><br>As for my own accounts, I will probably close some of them. But I will probably make a request for a new cheque book (which is free for the first request) just for fun before closing my account. It is a nasty thing to do, I admit, but it is just a small protest on my part.<br><br>DBS may have the use of our funds temporarily, but they have lost us POSB account holders' goodwill, forever.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>nay, quarzi, DBS is particularly aiming at account holders like IO, $5 - $50. So $50 x 10 = $500 only =&gt;toilet paper. In fact, they already did their homework. Rate of return on $500 deposits and less &lt; Interest on $500 + overhead cost allocated to servicing of account.<br><br>Close your account and DBS will be very happy, boycott them they don't give a damn. Think GLCs like Income may be coming up with a solution to combat this problem and to appease the oppressed commoners.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by quarzimodo:</div><div class="quote_body">Illegal Operation&gt; but ain't that hurt DBS funds ?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> i dun think it's just the people under $500 that are affected rite ? *remember the atm pay thingy ?<br>if 10 people with $500 terminate account, 10 X 500 = $5000   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">*gapes*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br></div></blockquote></div>
