            <div class='col-md body'>I was walking down the road on that sunny day, near bukit timah road. On the left side, there was McRitchie Reservoir and on the right there was Vivocity. Suddenly, i heard a big bang, and when I looked around, there were 3 robbers brandishing knives, surrounding me! I was aghast, but managed to suck in all the detail. There was a big-sized robber, a medium-sized robber, and an abnormally tiny robber with a tattoo on his face. However, they were all wearing balaclavas over their heads, so that image was simply X-rayed using my supervision.<br><br>"Gimme yr money or gimme yr life!" the biggest robber told me. He rubbed his potbelly on the shortest robber, probably a midget. There was lice jumping out of his navel. Quick as a whip, I whipped around like Jacky Chan and kicked the biggest robber in his crotch. His testicles bounced up and down as he gasped in pain and vomited blood, keeling over dead. The medium-sized robber immediately took action, swinging his knife at me. Using a quick-reflex upgrade that I had purchased from a seedy tavern in DOTA, i caught his blow and deflected it, sending the knife whirling into the air. I delivered a hammer-blow with my iron maiden firsts to his head, dealing about a hundred damage points in total. Before he even slumped over I had the last midget in my hands, squeezing him to death.<br><br>In the end, I walked out of the situation unharmed and into Vivocity. Suddenly, an Umbrella Corporation Army arrived, and the leader, Jill Valentine told me that she had seen my kung-fu moves and she was impressed. She kissed me and told me I was her Prince Charming and that we would live together happily ever after in Raccoon City hunting zombies and S.T.A.R.S members. Intrigued by her visualization of our future together, I promptly accepted her offer to live with her and was soon whisked away to live happily ever after.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, so there I was three days ago, a naive fool. Today, I am wise zombie-killa Chris Redfield. Yesterday I massacared a thousand zombies and three hundred S.T.A.R.S members. However, that was just chicken-feet. I've hunted the nemesis, killed jean grey and professor X, deconstructed Wolverine, slaughtered the Alien and dated the Predator. Jill Valentine is my wife, Carlos my butler and the young kids we found at the mansion our new children. They seem a bit funny though, as if they were mutants.</div>
