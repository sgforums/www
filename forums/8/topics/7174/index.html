            <div class='col-md body'>oki, it's just another motorcyclist who was knocked down by a lorry...<br>normally, i would have just neutral feelings about it, well, when a man<br>needs to go, he has to....<br><br>however, this person was from my school, my course, my batch. Although i<br>don't know him at all, apart from seeing him during lec or lab sessions, i<br>have never talked to him, smiled at him or any minor eye contact...<br><br>i'll never get the chance to do it anymore.......<br><br>most importantly, he was sitting beside me when we took a paper on sat, he<br>was still alive and kicking, so vibrant. I even caught a glimpse of his<br>matric card, saw his photo. commented in my mind that how short his hair was<br>as compared to now....<br><br>AND it was the exact same photo that i can relate to immediately , printed<br>on the front page on the local evening tabloid, with the headline "motorist<br>knocked down by hijacked lorry after exams". i dropped my maths notes, and<br>came to a halt......<br><br>My worst fears came, HE was that person..<br><br>i have no right to be sad, cause i don't know him, but i HAVE the right to<br>be angry, not because of the person who knocked him down is a bastard and is<br>a criminal because of drugs and VCD. That asshole was supposed to have an<br>operation done, but he escaped, hijacked a lorry and in a moment of<br>insanity(god-damn this asshole, why didn't you just get your damn op<br>done???), jammed on the stupid accelerator, knocked down this lec mate that<br>i have never even talk to.....<br><br>and to glamourise the story, the asshole jumped down from a building later<br>after commiting the stupid act....<br><br>and my lec mate wasn't even given a choice to choose whether he wants to<br>save himself......<br><br>and now he is gone....<br><br>F***, we all in the middle of our exams, AND HE DIDN'T EVEN FINISH IT....and<br>he will never know his results.... we struggled so hard, just to get the<br>damn degree, to join the stupid workforce and so on......<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>i'm not trying to act concerned,  kick a big fuss about it, or to feel sorry<br>just because everybody does so, nor that i'm trying to pretend to be a<br>philosophical yuppie<br>i just feel how human lives can be so cheap and worthless, it could end any<br>time, any place, anywhere, any how....<br>and i'm just wasting my life here, killing myself with all the cheap alcohol<br>that i can lay my hands on.....<br><br>through the mountains and the valleys<br>i arrived at my sacred ground<br>an ascetic welcomed me in<br>he has waited for a lifetime<br>smoke and dust greeted me<br>an holy ground<br>the time has come<br>for me to enter into a new world<br>a hopeful world<br>with my faultless body<br>amazing ideology<br>clearing all sins<br>jumbling all history<br>i dream of my holy shell<br>when shall it recieved me...?<br><br>i pray that this "friend" of mine, has already reached his sacred ground<br><br>i have no more mood to study, really....<br>tuts goes on, lec goes on, exams goes on, work goes on, life goes on,<br>sickness goes on, suffering goes on, death goes on...<br>soon this incident may just become our part of our distant memory, long<br>forgotten.....<br><br>a new life starts every second....<br>an old life ends every second....<br>when will it be my turn to start the end....<br><br>this is the end<br><br>anonymous<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SniperJim, I share your sentiments, it aches everybody's heart to see a promising, young guy go just like that and it doesn't help that we were born in the same year, and belong to the same school. My heart goes out to his family and friends.<br><br>Mourn we must, but we musn't forget to learn:<br><br>The dangers of riding cannot be overemphasized; as riders on the road, we are highly vunerable to careless, irresponsible drivers and we can only protect ourselves by (1)Keeping firmly in our mind: Safety no.1 (2)Always practise defensive riding. Safety is something we cannot take for granted.<br><br>Any one more mishap is one too much.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey man, it always sucks when someone you know, whether very well or hardly, just kinda goes like that. I've had the ignominy of going through the deaths of 2 rather close friends, so I know how you feel. It's always so strange, especially when you've just seen them recently, full of life, and the next thing, they're dead and buried, never to walk this earth again.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Life goes on, and I'm sure he's at peace now...<br><br>------------------<br>Virginity is a state of mind</div>
