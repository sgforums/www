            <div class='col-md body'>It was a "shock" for parent like us to send our children to NS! While its chief was assuring us that they will take care of my only son during the sending off ceremony, but on the contrary the trainees were asked not to report any abuse not even to parents! And it was the scar on my son's face that shocked us! His face was kicked by a Malay Sergeant during his jungle training. What if this kick landed on his eye and blinded for life? Who shall I bring this matter up or shall I write to the Minister of defence for redress?</div>

I agree with PsychoV on his suggestions. If in case all are useless, report the case to CMPB.

Singaporean would be so naive if they really think that their son will become a man only if he go thru all these NS shit.<br><br>Deferment only work if your son really have medical excuses and it is only temporary. Best solution to avoid losing your precious child in NS is maybe to give birth to baby girl in singapore and maybe this explain why there is more female populations in singapore. And maybe it is these increasing female population that the government had targeted during GE2001 with their single female new MP candidate to win more vote. Cos what most girls got to do with politics? who care?

            <div class='col-md body'>haha, thats why so many people become clerk. problem is, after you become clerk, once you are out of the army, problem comes! there are people like me who look down on clerks who "faked it all". and its not good for employment in the government sector. just look at the number of ministers who were ex-clerks in the army. zero. those young enough to have completed NS are all officers.</div>
