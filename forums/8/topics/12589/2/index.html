            <div class='col-md body'>corals88, why not you volunteer yourself and serve that 2.5 years cheap labour in NS since you are so positive about it. It's what i had argued b4, since NS do so much good, why don't those positive people go for another round or even longer so that our child in the future who think otherwise can concentrate in other area. Our local especially the guys are losing their grounds to those younger foreign talent that keep swarming the office district. what do the government care is only the revenue that keep rolling in from them.<br><br>Whether this "best solution" thinking of having a baby girl here while having a baby boy abroad was suggested or not in the first place, it does not really matter, cos we are already facing problems like greying population, lacking of young male to fill in for the cheap labour position in NS etc etc. Reason why? The high inflation and cost of raising just a single child in singapore. What do the government care when they put their attentions to the foreign talent in singapore? They care when there is not enuff cheap 2nd class male citizens to defend singapore. They care when foreign investment in singapore drop and hence their revenue. They care when the opposition party grow too strong and threatening to their golden rice bowl.<br><br>What's the use of saluting pple who sacrifice their 2.5 years serving the nation who care about providing jobs for foreign talent while our local umemployment rate is rising then? More and more local citizen will be retrenched in time to come, less and less job available.<br><br>The government hence promised to create more jobs. Maybe a thousands of jobs will be created, but millions of job application forms will be sent to grab these jobs. Who will be employed? The ever increasing foreign talents or the diminishing local 2nd class citizen? Don't think too long about it, esp the local guys. Check your mailbox guys, your enlishment or ICT letters is coming. Serve your nation cheap and well, worry about your own career later unless you wanna be charged to DB.<br><br>Hey, one more thing guys, stop eyeing on that pretty next door singaporean girl. They are for the rich expats holding PR status, ok. Come and challenge only if you can equal yourself with those expats, provided you are safely out of NS now and still in one piece.<br><br>There are so many cases of death and accident that are covered up in SAF. As usual, the media is controlled. Who can we blame then? Blame your son for being so stupid lar, why so careless this and that or being so short-life and unlucky etc. Hope the few thousands dollars and a piece of cloth covering the son's coffin is enuff to cover the parent's pain.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 10 November 2001).]</div>

If you are given the choice to retake your 'O' or 'A' level again just becos you din pass some paper, are you willing to retake the exam?

They are here to stay no matter how their own people complain. Check your newspaper<br><br>People of my thinking are causing Singapore's greying population to increase? Check my previous post if you miss anything. I repeat, whether or not people adopted avoid giving birth to baby boy in singapore in the first place, singapore was already facing greying population problem just becos it's getting too costly to raise a child here. Late marriage, high expectation of singaporean woman, expats influence etc etc. Do you think the local guys who came out late into the working society due to NS can help it? I had stated in some other post, there are so many real life example of singaporean including some of my colleague being single up till their old age. Reason why? for the guys, they are simply not established enuff compared to the expats for singaporean female to have any interest in them. Singaporean female would rather remain single then to settle down with these poor local guys. Why still not established at such late age? Shouldn't they be rich like those high post expats who had being working for a long time? Think about it.<br><br>When thousands of our local citizen go unemployed, you say this has nothing to do with the government. What are they voted and paid for? Just to rule and collect tax? They are kind enuff to bring measures to minimise the situation now????? For show to win vote, you mean?<br><br>how do you know that it is most of the local who are getting the jobs? Did the government issue any priority so that our local unemployed will be employed. The relatively younger foreign talent from china and india who have no EXTRA NS commitment work harder, longer hour and most importantly cheap and loyal. Which do you think the employer will employ? Are you there to control their decision?<br><br>Relationships are based on feelings and not materialism. How romantic you are. Do you think this is practical in this society? Maybe this will apply to some marginal case, but would an example of a female executive settling down with a bus-driver to start a family ever happen in singapore to prove your ideal bgr? Love is not totally based on feeling, my dear.<br><br>True, Accidents and deaths happens everywhere. This include workplaces and even at home... not only during NS when you be working with weapons, explosives etc!!  So next time, corals88, better join NS instead of other company now. As you had said, cos when got accident, the company may not even compensate the family a few thousands and quite bad lor, no coffin sponsored and no cloth to cover some more maybe receive a flower wreath instead (quoted from you). Which mean NS is better for you in term of death compensation. I might be there to salute you if you are marched through the parade square. Wat a great sacrifice for the nation. At least your parent will feel proud and compensated also with that few thousands dollars and also not to forget about that beautiful precious cloth covering you. No offence meant but how do you think of that as a scenario? Great right? Mai tu liao, go sign up for NS.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 11 November 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kyo23<br><br>I am truly a Singaporean and being proud to be one.<br><br>Oh you have not really asked me those previous Qns that I have posted in this thread as well as another thread.  So I dun wish to entertain some of your Qns now unless you answer mine!!<br><br>Everybody will tend to complain whether is it a small matter or a big one.  It is their attitude to change things they are facing now if they can't change their attitude, no matter how much help they get, they will still not satisfy... as a grudge is been bear.<br><br>It seems that everyone having the same thinking as you, going aboard to have babies and getting citizenships out Singapore or maybe afraid of giving birth to a son to avoid NS... isn't this one of the factor that causes the increasing grey population (one of the factor and not the main reason which u have misunderstood from my previous posting)??  So do not bring in factor that are caused by the women here in Singapore... u do sound to me u actually practise sex discrimination here!!<br><br>So do you think you will be well established if you do not have to go thru the 2.5 years NS???<br><br>As for increasing of single or late marriage, this may partly due to the individual mentality and how they manage things.  So do you mind having a girlfren who is smarter and earning more than you rather then phasing a girl accepting a less educated and poor guy???<br><br>The government of cos is unable to help everyone but only a partial of them during the economy downturn.  So if I put it in a simpler way for your understanding, if you have only 4 buns on hand and your stock hasn't or may not arrive and there are 20 hungry children out there wanting the bread to fill their stomach, what can you do to meet the remaining 16 children needs?  Should I label you as heartless and do not show care and concern for the kids when u are unable meet the children demand due to factors that are not in your control???<br><br>In the first place you are arguing that the government only give jobs to the foreign talent so I ask you the qn that how do you know about it as you seems to know so much and now you r asking me how I know the local are getting the priority??? Strange here.  Maybe you should ask this qn urself instead!!<br><br>As an employer of cos I will employed those within the means of what the company can afford and the best person to carry out the duties.  If the local who think too highly of themselves just becos they are armed with a degree and demand high salary and great benefits, it times to swallow their pride and take a bit out of their humble pie now.<br><br><strong>Â“True, Accidents and deaths happens everywhere. This include workplaces and even at home... not only during NS when you be working with weapons, explosives etc!! So next time, corals88, better join NS instead of other company now. As you had said, cos when got accident, the company may not even compensate the family a few thousands and quite bad lor, no coffin sponsored and no cloth to cover some more maybe receive a flower wreath instead (quoted from you). Which mean NS is better for you in term of death compensation. I might be there to salute you if you are matched through the parade square.  Wat a great sacrifice for the nation. At least your parent will feel proud and compensated also with that few thousands dollars and also not to forget about that beautiful precious cloth covering you. No offence meant but how do you think of that as a scenario? Great right? Â” Quoted by Kyo23</strong> Most of what I have quoted here are actually inverse quote of yours. I am not saying the army compensation is better. I am asking you should we avoid places that r prone to death &amp; accidents.  So r u saying that we should not avoid places that may prone to accidents, is it? So y in the first place u are discouraging NS just becos of deaths and accidents??<br><br>What do you think if a country has no defence since people like you disapprove of having NS?  Imaging a country always being attack by bullies and always in a terrible unstable and poverty state where no investor would like to come and unemployment rate is so much higher than we are facing now.  So are we expecting more complains from you again, blaming the government for not doing a good job?<br><br></div>

So I dun wish to entertain some of your Qns now unless you answer mine!!<br></div></blockquote>Asked or answer??? Do not confuse everyone including yourself if your question is not clear. I had asked question specifically quoting your nick.<br><br>Upon scanning your questions in this thread, these are the answers to your unclear questions which i bother to answer you now since you complained.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"><strong>Juz becos u r unhappy about certain things or things that are not up to ur expectation or turn out to be... you thot u can jus push the blame to someone???<br></strong>[/quote]<br><br>Is this a general question ? The answer is dependent on different situation. Not all thing can be controlled by us or caused by our doings. For example, can you as an individual affect the price of HDB flat in singapore? can you fixed the price of COE? can you as an individual abolish ISA? Sorry, you cannot even achieve a single bit of these. Why? becos you are under pple's control. When you are unhappy about certain thing, i guess you always have yourself to blame only you mean? You caused all your suffering to yourself? if you really think so, that mean you have to pay that high extra price for thing you buy in singapore just because you are at fault???? what logic are you toking?<br><br><blockquote><strong>As for jobs, supply is lesser than the demand now of cos most of the applicants will not secure that jobs. But how do you know that it is the foreigners who are getting the jobs? Did the employers told you about that???<br></strong></blockquote>I answered this question with another question. So did the employers told you that they will employ the local??? The answer to both is NO if you bother to answer my question. However, using your common sense, when the government allow foreign talent to come into singapore to compete with local for jobs, the chances of our local being unemployed will be higher. Reason i had stated b4. The foreign talent from china or india esp work harder, cheaper, loyal compared to local singaporean. Cause they are here just to bring money back home to retire and not to stay here for long. Typically, they have no life after working hour and are most willing to stay back working long hour.<br><br>For the guy, foreign talent are relatively younger when they graduate from university just because they have no extra commitment in NS. What matter most to most employer is the age, skill, atitude and the expected salary and not because you had sacrifice for the country in NS b4. Furthermore, there is this ICT that causes disruption to the local guy work productivity and schedule. Example are like my colleagues who have to report back camp for a 2 weeks ICT have to forego the chance of going oversea for a major company project training. And hence major project and task are normally handed down to those expat to do. Yes, you might be proud in the army camp being a officer but have you analysed how much you lose out in your real working life? Think for your own son's future if you ever look into things from a local guy's view.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>It seems that everyone having the same thinking as you, going aboard to have babies and getting citizenships out Singapore or maybe afraid of giving birth to a son to avoid NS... isn't this one of the factor that causes the increasing grey population (one of the factor and not the main reason which u have misunderstood from my previous posting)??  </strong></blockquote>Everyone has their own thinking, they want to migrate to oversea is also their own freedom. If situation in singapore is good, why would anyone do such thing ? If citizenship is more attractive than PR, why would anyone want to give it up then ? If they want to migrate or going aboard to have babies, can you stop them? The goverment don't even bother. They made the mistake thinking that by attracting and replacement with foreign talent and PR, our population will maintain or even increase. Suddenly, they realised there is not enuff local male citizen to be enlisted for NS and hence now they panicked.<br>Why? caused most of the PR or their sons refuse to take up citizenship but go over sea to study instead of wasting time in NS. They are not stupid. When singapore is at war, how many of the foreign talents will stay, i like to ask.<br><br>Did i ever mentioned it is wholly due to women here in singapore that caused the greying populations to mark me as a sex discriminator???<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>So do you think you will be well established if you do not have to go thru the 2.5 years NS???<br></strong></blockquote>A normal local degree take 3 years to complete. What do you think?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>As for increasing of single or late marriage, this may partly due to the individual mentality and how they manage things.  So do you mind having a girlfren who is smarter and earning more than you rather then phasing a girl accepting a less educated and poor guy???<br></strong></blockquote>Why should i mind if the girl don mind? How many guys will envy those guy with a gf who take care of everything for him including paying for his expenses? I have a rare life example of a frn who just started his working life, having a working gf younger than him who pay everytime they go out on a date. She even sup a credit card for him to use and buy a new set of computer for him to play. Does any guy mind having such a gerfrn i like to ask?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>The government of cos is unable to help everyone but only a partial of them during the economy downturn.

Should I label you as heartless and do not show care and concern for the kids when u are unable meet the children demand due to factors that are not in your control???<br></strong></blockquote>Originally, we have 20 hungry children. Suddenly, the gate is opened. 100 more hungier children joined in. Even if your remaing stock of 16 buns had arrived, would your original 20 hungry children be fed?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>In the first place you are arguing that the government only give jobs to the foreign talent so I ask you the qn that how do you know about it as you seems to know so much and now you r asking me how I know the local are getting the priority???

The foreign talent however, doesn't have such mobility due to their work permit and furthermore, their expectation was originally that low. Their pathetic pay in singapore is alot more than what they would get back hometown.<br><br>[quote]<strong>So r u saying that we should not avoid places that may prone to accidents, is it? So y in the first place u are discouraging NS just becos of deaths and accidents?? </strong>Wrong. I was teasing you with your own inverse quote. You seem really confused. Only fool will ever play around a construction site instead of at home?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>What do you think if a country has no defence since people like you disapprove of having NS?

They should recognise their effort instead of forcing and ill-treating the citizen like cheap labour branding them 2nd class compared to those 1st class expat. Fairness or democracy is the game.<br><br>Finally i like to add, this is just a discussion, nothing personnal and serious. There's no need to pinpoint at anyone. Hence, rest assured, Raisin. I'm not hamtaming corals88 at all but answering to her ....hmm.......her great comments "Ur thinking very shallow!!" and her accusation of me practising sex discrimination. I am open also to other's view. Example, I do agree with SAF is a necessity. If i don agree, i don't go insulting others also.</div>
