            <div class='col-md body'>I would have to say that I have no idea how I would react. I can say that I have no problem with gays now. I also understand that its due both to genetic and environment factors, to be a homosexual, and they are otherwise just like anybody else. But when it comes to the crunch, the truth is that I still might be disappointed that my children are not "normal."<br><br>Its very easy to dictate what you would do when you are actually not involved, but in the midst of the action, people might not be as open minded and secure about themselves as they think they are.<br><br>Most people will have expectations on what they want their children to be. As much as we want to think ourselves as accepting, lets face it: being gay is something thats not among those expectations. Its about as far away as any wish for our children as we can have.<br><br>So, basically, I don't know. I hope I can. They are my kids.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 22 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually the idea of homosexual characteristics being genetic is an oxymoron of sorts. I am sure there are instances where this is indeed the case. However, you'd think this genetic "difference" would be self-limiting and breed itself out - that's why genetic diseases with an early fatal outcome are rare - the carriers of the genes don't get to pass them on to the F1 generation. If anyone has any scientific literature talking about genetics and homosexuality, can I have a reference please? I'm keen to find out more.</div>

Emotional characteristcs (like characters and sexual desires) .... err ... still under study.<br><br>And homosexuality is DIFFERENT from genetic diseases. It is not a disease.<br><br>But one thing for sure, human sexual desires is the result of the action of our sex hormones progesterone/estrogen and testosterone. Until now, very few cases of hormonal imbalances are found in homosexuals that means they are perfectly "straight" phenotypically but not psychologically. So that address the issue of wat affects the psychology ? Nature or nurture ?<br><br>Rinoa, you do psychology right ? like to comment ?</div>

My intended analogy was homosexuals don't usually pass on their genes, just like people who die young of severe disease.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm since I have just finished a paper of male homosexuality which I have good appraisal for it, maybe I can contribute more to this thread<br><br>As the correlations for the chances of a homosexual is more of bred and born, the tendency for your kid to be born as a homosexual is really none. Neorologist,Simon LeVay (self-proclaimed gay) tries ways and means using brain mapping to prove that the sexual dimorphism in each sex differs in homosexuals compared to hetrosexuals thus proving that it is a biological trait. How ever, most of his subjects some of them eventually die of AIDS and it might be seemingly the cause of this deadly disease that causes a change in the sexual dimorphism of the homosexual.<br><br>As Willian Byne has stated that male homosexuality especially brought up in a more female dominated environment, might induced them to be more 'female', thus the passive side. As for the 'active' side, it is more of the fact that the external factors like the peers he mixed with as well as traumatic esperience with the opposite sex makes them feel more at ease with males instead.<br>Gays and Lesbians have tried ways and means to prove that they are 'born' this way..because they think that it might be more socially accepted since it is not their choice. No they have a choice and it really takes effort to see the 'light'...<br>Of cos, unless they are so into it that some have even castrate themselves and live as a third gender for the rest of their lives as they gender they want to be.<br><br>So the arguement is if I found out that my kids are homosexuals, due to external influences, I will sit down with them and ask them what exactly has happen, they need support and encourage to let them be straight once again...the crux of the problem is to let them understand that you still love them and no matter what happens, you want the best for them. Tell them that all this is a transition and they will eventually meet someone of the opposite sex the love and tenderness they wanted.<br><br>------------------<br>Writing is a weapon that is more powerful than a man's fist.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 24 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm just wondering why most pple here are obsessed with the idea of "straightening" out these pple who are suppousedly "not normal". It all seems rather patronising to me. The way you guys speak of these pple imply that at a basic level, there is no acceptance, which would lead me to think that since you don't view them as "normal" people, you will treat them differently.<br>Just airing a thought, please feel free to counter my claims...</div>
