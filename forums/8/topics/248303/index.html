            <div class='col-md body'>Hello peeps. I'm a Singaporean and applied for Tution Grant and the rest of the fees are paid through CPF. I'm starting 3rd year soon and I would like to withdraw as I cannot cope with my course's stress anymore. So I wanna withdraw to move on to NS. I have huge aquestions about Tution Gran. Do you have to pay back them to MOE? Is it like the bond? Please help. Thanks <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

At least $100 per month, and has to be paid back fully in 10 years.<br><br>If you are going to NS, I'm not sure how are you going to do that. Because CPF Board stipulates that you have to start paying back one year after you quit school. NS is 2 years.<br><br>Some NS guys will have to help you on this issue.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for thips guys. But I don't think there's any regrets in this. My mum asked me to feel not stressed up with FYP, failing altogether.<br><br>One question though, Tution grant has limitations of 10 semesters. If you continue poly education after NS, you will have like 5 semesters of Tution Grant. Is this true?</div>
