Even a 5 year old kid can tell you that we need to coexist in harmony and forced evangelism does not promote that.<br><br>Your job is just to tell us about your "Good News", whether we accept it or not is our buisness. You took a rather long time to turn to chrisitianity too, so if christianity is the ultimte truth, we should be turning to it eventually, arguing for the sake of it only proves that you don't have confidence in your religion.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Devil1976:</div><div class="quote_body"> [QUOTE]Originally posted by pulse:<br>[b]Hi there,<br><br>What an interesting thread of discussion this is. So far, there's been views from Buddhism, Taoism and Christianity. So let me contribute the Islamic perspective.<br><br>The Quran, which incidentally enough is the Quranic scriptures, mentions that the meaning of the word Islam is peace. It's a literal translation that's reiterated by this verse in the Quran.<br><br>"Religion with God means a commitment to peace. [The Quran, 3:19]<br><br>In this vein, Islam, or peace, was the first thing that God imparted to men. Islam, hence, is not a particular faith, but the theme of all of the world's religions. Whichever faith you delve into, you'll find elements of peace, or Islam, in it.<br><br>The Quran explains the situation quite succiently.<br><br>"And verily, We have sent among every nation a Messenger (proclaiming): 'Worship God (Alone), and avoid all false deities.' Then of them were some whom God guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified" (Quran 16:36)<br><br>Hence, all religions belong to God, and preach the most essential message of peace.<br><br>In Islam, there is a beautiful concept that is called fitrah.<br><br>"Then set your face upright for religion in the right state-- the nature made by Allah in which He has made men; there is no altering of Allah's creation; that is the right religion, but most people do not know." (Quran 30:30)<br><br>Fitrah refers to the nature of man that God has ordained for all mankind. All men were created pure monotheists, but his upbringing and the surroundings push him towards other creeds, other forms of religious expression. It is man who has gone about twisting the numerous revelations that God sent to us.<br><br>"How can you say, 'We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us'? But behold, the lying pen of the scribes has made it into a lie." (NIV Bible, Jeremiah 8:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Fitrah manifests itself when a baby reaches out for his mother's teat for milk; that is a sign of the fitrah working where intelligence has yet to be nurtured. When a human cries out for a god in times of dire peril; that is the person's fitrah reaching out towards the Creator. When the study of genetics established the fact that all animal, plant and human life share the same genetic language of A (adenine), T (thymine), C (cytosine) and G (guanine), we know that the Creator is One who had established One blueprint for life. Fitrah is all of these and much, much more.<br><br>Well, anyway, this is my 2 cents worth...hope I fulfilled FireIce's expectations of not posting something that's gonna run for at least ten thousand pages.     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote>INTERESTING...    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> May I know if you're a busy man? I would like to get your e-mail address from you and stay in contact if possible? Would like to learn more about Islam.... Hmm... I love the way ya see things objectively and your approach for such subject till now... (Probably because you post very little?    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">[/B][/QUOTE]<br>==============<br><br>Hi Devil,<br><br>Thanks for your kind words. Well, if you wanna email me, a simple click on the email icon above will bring out my email addy almost instantaneously.<br><br>Hmmn, as for all the arguements that are being played out here, i think it is unhelpful because none seems to be able to change the other's mind. I would be the first to admit that God is a concept that must be approached through more than one way. FIRST: Through the rational and empircial process as is stated in the Quran:<br><br>"Truly in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, and (in) the ship that sails in the ocean to profit mankind, in that which God sent down from the sky of water thus giving life to the earth after its death, in ever beast that he creates in it, (the earth), in the change of the winds and the clouds that they trail between the sky and the earth, are certainly signs for a people who REASON." (Quran 78:6-16)<br><br>"Have not those who disbelieve known that the heavens and the earth were of one piece, then We parted them, and we made every living thing of water ? Will they not then believe?" (Quran 21:30)<br><br>SECOND: One can also approach God through the mind's eye, and this is the one attribute that matters. In Islam though, both approaches cannot be divided. Muslims are supposed to pursue knowledge because the math and physics that we learn are the signs and laws that God has laid down for mankind to discover.<br><br>Of course, not many people would agree with this view. Most, if not all people would view a severe contradiction between faith and science, and this was amply demonstrated in the Chruch's past persecutions of classical scientists like Galelio.<br><br>However, the contradiction may not be an essential feature of every religion. It only takes an open mind to appreciate the beauty and, as I've mentioned before, the fitrah that is present in all our great religions.<br><br>At the end of the day, if we still can't convince each other, we should take comfort from these words:<br><br>"And they say, Â‘None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian.Â’ Say, Â‘Produce your proof if you are truthful.Â’" (Quran 2:111)<br><br>"It will not be in accordance with your desires (Muslims), nor those of the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians); whoever works evil will have the recompense thereof, and he will not find any protector or helper besides God." (Quran 4:123)<br><br>Anyway, If you'd like to find out more about Islam, especially in relation to other religions and in the Singaporean context, do try visiting this website:<br><a href="http://homex.coolconnect.com/member3/islam_pulse/" rel="nofollow">http://homex.coolconnect.com/member3/islam_pulse/</a><br><br>[This message has been edited by pulse (edited 28 January 2002).]</div>
