I have to AGREE that this is TRULY a SAD CASE.... NOT only with Christianity but with other religions as well...

It has been our choice. Nobody can stop u frm practicising your religion but people can stop you from bugging them, invading their privacy and trying to discredit their faith. The thing abt ur woman thing is that you are saying u love your woman, she is the most beautiful and then you go on to say all other women are ugly and are fakes. That is the part that gets us mad u get it?<br><br>I personally have not resorted to any vulgarity and hope to engage u on a more rational, logical level. You are simply polarizing the issue by dragging raptor and blur blop to your side as you feel you are in a very precarious situation. In short, you are getting extremely defensive.</div></blockquote>i dun hv to drag rapture to my side. he rocks.<br>blurblop is a turncoat.<br><br>------------------<br>God made this world with laws, such as that of gravity, the disobedience of which will lead to serious consequences. Similarly He made the world with moral/spiritual laws as well, such as that the disobedience of which will prove eternally costly. Therefore, let the God who so loved the world that He gave us His only begotten son, Jesus Christ, heal your hurts in the way that He knows best. While it may not be in your ways, trust that He who made you and I, knows the best way, His way.
