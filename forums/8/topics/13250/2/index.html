That He gave His Only Son to die for you and I. He sent His own Son into Hell and then raised Him back up again, so that you and I have a chance not to go through the same fate.<br>the debt of all our wrongdoings has been paid, all we need to do is to accept that the payment has been made for us.<br>if not, and we keep trying to pay our debt ourselves, then it makes the previous payment negligible to us, right?<br><br>------------------<br>God made this world with laws, such as that of gravity, the disobedience of which will lead to serious consequences.
