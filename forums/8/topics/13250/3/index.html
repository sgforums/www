            <div class='col-md body'>Just like to know from those religious fanatic. Any futures? Have you nothing better to do than to siao on religious?<br><br>Foreign student on attachement are working damn siao on on-job attachment learning new stuffs, knowledges and technology in order to replace you. What are you guys doing then? Attending church when these cream are busy improving themselve in library? Isn't it a drag for the world's advances if everyone is attending church instead of indulging in more knowledge gaining?<br><br>What is hitsquad, rapture etc normally busy with? i wonder. If you are saint, maybe pple will listen to you. if you are not, what are you doing now??? waiting for judgement day to come and still fail to go to heaven? Come on, you can do better than posting all these in the forums inciting more arguement when time could be spend on getting yourself less sinful reading more bible, attending more church right?<br><br>If you are not saint yet, don talk too much bible, ok? Cos you are not qualified at all to convert other, to make other believe from your stand point as you yourself are still sinful.</div>
