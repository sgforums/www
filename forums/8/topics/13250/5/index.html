            <div class='col-md body'>Ok!     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> taking a break from cracking my brain over rubbish design issues! Just want to bring out something with regards why Christ is the condition for salvation. In fact He is the only condition that exist. Reason? Simply this : The whole world has fallen into sin and powerless to get herself out of it. Its unthinkable that one murderer can take the place of another fellon so that the other can go free!?! Simply because he must be judged by the court of law for his crimes, afterwhich after he pays with his life he cant pay for another's crime. So the same way for sinful man to wanna redeem himself by good works, he can never achieve it. Even if he goes to hell it is only to pay for his OWN sins.We are created for God but because mankind has fallen, the only way we can be reconciled to God is that a man who has no sins pay that price of death. And Christ Jesus did that. He is the incarnate God in human flesh. Basically because God has judge all our sins on Christ, anyone who puts his faith in Christ he is considered blameless in the eyes of God - its simply the law of double jeapardy ( dun think I spelt that right     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ). In essence what Im trying to say is, no matter how good a murder/thief/(or whatever and whatsoever) tries to redeem himself by doing good, in the eyes of law he is still guilty UNTILL HE PAYS. If God is to make us pay without giving His Son to die, we are all doomed for hell. Thats why good well people will still subjected to eternal punishment if they have not received Jesus.<br><br>To Kyo23: I have this to say to you, go get all your knowledge of technology and acquire all the knowledge of modern sophistication, get all the papers that will make you rich and famous and maybe you be the most learned man in this world. But it will not change your eternal state when you are lying on your deadbed - On your deadbed its between you and the Lord.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there,<br><br>What an interesting thread of discussion this is. So far, there's been views from Buddhism, Taoism and Christianity. So let me contribute the Islamic perspective.<br><br>The Quran, which incidentally enough is the Quranic scriptures, mentions that the meaning of the word Islam is peace. It's a literal translation that's reiterated by this verse in the Quran.<br><br>"Religion with God means a commitment to peace. [The Quran, 3:19]<br><br>In this vein, Islam, or peace, was the first thing that God imparted to men. Islam, hence, is not a particular faith, but the theme of all of the world's religions. Whichever faith you delve into, you'll find elements of peace, or Islam, in it.<br><br>The Quran explains the situation quite succiently.<br><br>"And verily, We have sent among every nation a Messenger (proclaiming): 'Worship God (Alone), and avoid all false deities.' Then of them were some whom God guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified" (Quran 16:36)<br><br>Hence, all religions belong to God, and preach the most essential message of peace.<br><br>In Islam, there is a beautiful concept that is called fitrah.<br><br>"Then set your face upright for religion in the right state-- the nature made by Allah in which He has made men; there is no altering of Allah's creation; that is the right religion, but most people do not know." (Quran 30:30)<br><br>Fitrah refers to the nature of man that God has ordained for all mankind. All men were created pure monotheists, but his upbringing and the surroundings push him towards other creeds, other forms of religious expression. It is man who has gone about twisting the numerous revelations that God sent to us.<br><br>"How can you say, 'We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us'? But behold, the lying pen of the scribes has made it into a lie." (NIV Bible, Jeremiah 8:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Fitrah manifests itself when a baby reaches out for his mother's teat for milk; that is a sign of the fitrah working where intelligence has yet to be nurtured. When a human cries out for a god in times of dire peril; that is the person's fitrah reaching out towards the Creator. When the study of genetics established the fact that all animal, plant and human life share the same genetic language of A (adenine), T (thymine), C (cytosine) and G (guanine), we know that the Creator is One who had established One blueprint for life. Fitrah is all of these and much, much more.<br><br>Well, anyway, this is my 2 cents worth...hope I fulfilled FireIce's expectations of not posting something that's gonna run for at least ten thousand pages.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

If God is to make us pay without giving His Son to die, we are all doomed for hell. Thats why good well people will still subjected to eternal punishment if they have not received Jesus.<br><br>To Kyo23: I have this to say to you, go get all your knowledge of technology and acquire all the knowledge of modern sophistication, get all the papers that will make you rich and famous and maybe you be the most learned man in this world. But it will not change your eternal state when you are lying on your deadbed - On your deadbed its between you and the Lord. Remember this.</div></blockquote>So since you accepted jesus and hence no longer subjected to eternal punishment. Hey, congrate to you, man. You are safe to die and get on your way to heaven. Hurry up.<br><br>So that mean all thief and murderer no need to redeem himself by doing any good. Hey, what a great relief for them, carry on with their evil deed man. just place their faith in Christ after all that can liao.<br><br>It's between me and what? you mean the virtual being LORD??? Well, on my deadbed, there will be nothing left but sweet memories of all the meaninful time i spent with my love one and not time spent on praying praying in church just to go to heaven.</div>

So far, there's been views from Buddhism, Taoism and Christianity. So let me contribute the Islamic perspective.<br><br>The Quran, which incidentally enough is the Quranic scriptures, mentions that the meaning of the word Islam is peace. It's a literal translation that's reiterated by this verse in the Quran.<br><br>"Religion with God means a commitment to peace. [The Quran, 3:19]<br><br>In this vein, Islam, or peace, was the first thing that God imparted to men. Islam, hence, is not a particular faith, but the theme of all of the world's religions. Whichever faith you delve into, you'll find elements of peace, or Islam, in it.<br><br>The Quran explains the situation quite succiently.<br><br>"And verily, We have sent among every nation a Messenger (proclaiming): 'Worship God (Alone), and avoid all false deities.' Then of them were some whom God guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified" (Quran 16:36)<br><br>Hence, all religions belong to God, and preach the most essential message of peace.<br><br>In Islam, there is a beautiful concept that is called fitrah.<br><br>"Then set your face upright for religion in the right state-- the nature made by Allah in which He has made men; there is no altering of Allah's creation; that is the right religion, but most people do not know." (Quran 30:30)<br><br>Fitrah refers to the nature of man that God has ordained for all mankind. All men were created pure monotheists, but his upbringing and the surroundings push him towards other creeds, other forms of religious expression. It is man who has gone about twisting the numerous revelations that God sent to us.<br><br>"How can you say, 'We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us'? But behold, the lying pen of the scribes has made it into a lie." (NIV Bible, Jeremiah 8:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Fitrah manifests itself when a baby reaches out for his mother's teat for milk; that is a sign of the fitrah working where intelligence has yet to be nurtured. When a human cries out for a god in times of dire peril; that is the person's fitrah reaching out towards the Creator. When the study of genetics established the fact that all animal, plant and human life share the same genetic language of A (adenine), T (thymine), C (cytosine) and G (guanine), we know that the Creator is One who had established One blueprint for life. Fitrah is all of these and much, much more.<br><br>Well, anyway, this is my 2 cents worth...hope I fulfilled FireIce's expectations of not posting something that's gonna run for at least ten thousand pages.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote>INTERESTING...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> May I know if you're a busy man?
