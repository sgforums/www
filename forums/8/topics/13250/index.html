Noboby knows the truth yet , you only believe in something that is what we called faith. As for the world, the evidence is not enough to proved that your God is the creator, if you like to said that, then it's fine too. Believe in your dreams, and I hope when the time for you to go comes, you will wake up and see that what you believe is not what you think...<br><br>So have also your good day, and maybe when you see your God, you can said hi for me, caused I don't think I can ever see him.<br><br>P.S I also see it just fine.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>He who knows others is wise;<br>He who know himself is enlightened.</div>

Who are you for us to trust you? Are you qualified enuff in the first place to talk and tell pple which way is right or wrong? Are you a  saint yet? if not think you better do more of your stuff to get your way to heaven. You are late, man. Still dilly dally here with all the posts. You just got yourself to blame if on that judgement day (virtual date as usual), you yourself cannot even be saved by god (virtual being as its existence up till now haven't even being proved or confirmed).<br><br>Save yourself first lar instead of wasting time in this cyberworld and wasting other pple's time.
