Think ya POSTED this TOPIC before?  :p AGAIN, my stand is the SAME... THEREOTICALLY SPEAKING.... 'Ren Xing' is 'ben e'.... (For non-Chinese's sake, 'ben e' means 'originally evil' in this context.. See? All your RELIGIOUS TOPICS makes this DEVIL a MORE SENSITIVE guy ALREADY? THANK YOU people lah.... ~Sigh...~) But in order to SURVIVE, they have to be 'ben shan'... ('ben shan' means originally kind) In this case, it's not really an appropriate Chinese term to use because it's not really ORIGINALLY or I would rather term INHERITENTLY... It would allow RECOGNITION from the others which is ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT during CHILDHOOD (think helplessness...) Even for later stage in life, making friends and SOCIALISING proved to be EQUALLY IMPORTANT... And POLITICS EMPHASIZE on the IMPORTANCE of such RECOGNITION on an even HIGHER LEVEL.... And RELIGION as Pulse (for the benefit of people who dunno him/her, this is a NICK...) has mentioned in his/her other worthy topic is often BLURRED with POLITICS because of the BENEFITS of such RECOGNITION...<br><br>The WHOLE IDEA? A START OFF with 'Evil' (in a sense? Would further elaborate when my theory is established...) and QUICKLY turns into 'Good' which is the TREND on MAJORITY... (Wanna play a game? Learn to play by the RULES..) And SLOWLY with the GAIN of POWER... TEMPTATIONs come in for one to revert into the 'Evil' self.... Being IN CONTROL of situations and all POWERFUL makes a man FEEL like a GOD.... Thus, pushing the 'equilibrium' back towards EVIL.... This is why (I think) a ALL MIGHTY GOD has to EXIST above us (may it be in TRUE SENSE or MENTALITY...)...<br><br>------------------<br>In LIGHT I shall FEAR NOT. FOR what I AM is CUT so DEEP inside of ME.<br>I LIVE my FLESH and SOUL ONLY to BLEED for the OTHERS.<br>FEAR ME NOT. FOR I AM YOUR 'MASTER'. GIVE YOU STRENGTH.

DEVIL PHRASE II<br><br>Though NOT the RIGHT thing to do,<br>This might be the ONLY NATURAL thing to be...<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Just like heat</span> is produced when work done...<br><span style="font-style: italic;">EVIL</span> is the GENERATION of SYSTEM FLAWS... <strong>DEVIL PHRASE III</strong><br><br>In DREAMS you CAN NEVER DIE.....<br>For YOUR LIFE is about the EXISTENCE of....<br>Your Happiness.... Your Sadness... Your Pain.... Your Pleasure....<br>Like a painted sky, when it rains... All CEASE to BE...    DEVIL PHRASE IV<br><br>When Law &amp; Rules are there,<br>they are NOT about JUSTICE.<br>While reality &amp; dreams are there,<br>they are NOT about SURVIVAL..<br><br>And Life &amp; Death NOT about LIVING...<br>Good &amp; Evil NOT about definitions....<br><br>IF truly there is EVIL, it is NOT just one of its kind......<br><br>DEVIL'S SEVENTH PHRASE<br><br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>believe in your faith, hitsquad and rapture or other christians that might have seen our agrument  here, i have nothing against it or whatever since both of you like you god so much. please go ahead and live a good christian life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>i just think that religion and faith of a person is like love, it is very objective. I might love my friend alot, but you might not... so it is always up to one opinion. You can't change the way I think nor I can change the way you think, it has to be submissive. Only if you have experience something, then you will change by your own will...<br><br>Maybe to you, you have experience God love, and you really believe it, good for you. I have nothing against your faith and your ppl and your religion. Please go ahead and spread whatever god news that you have and save as many ppl as you want, and wait for your Jesus to come again in glory.<br><br>As for me, i have experience something that you might not experience, that is why i choose my own path. I never have experience god love, and i dont know what it is like... but i have experience calmness, peace using my path. I guess religion has their own teachings and strong point and weak point which ppl can use it against them.<br><br>Maybe your god is the real god, your bible is the real word, what you said is truth, and your faith is perfect and everything about your god is perfect, so be it, go ahead and save more ppl.<br><br>To proof me your god is real, you want me to be dead??? yah, maybe when i am dead, your god will punish me, so be it, but what can you do, nothing... you can't even save me and you can enjoy in heaven, while i suffer in hell. you can't even tell god that please forgive obiwan, you can't because infront of god, you are just his son, and he won't listen to you for this, for he has said that whoever choose not to believe in christ, will suffer with the serpent in forever hell. it has been stated in the bible already. so what can you do for me... even though i have never kill a single soul, i have done around 10 times of blood donation, i have been helping the old folk home, i have donate to charity, i have help old , sick, young and all the good deed i have done...<br><br>just becuase i chose not believe christ, i have to suffer no matter what, so be it.... i have nothing against it, if hell i am going, i guess i have no regret because i choose it....<br><br>so tell me what can you do my me? tell me how you can save me? nothing, because you have no way, no ideas or whatsoever to do anything to help me. and in your 1 lifetime (no reincairnation for christians), you now got 1 soul you can't save....<br><br>So continue your own journey and I will continue mine. for you towards heaven, for me towards hell. Last but not least, pls continue your good faith and i sincerely hope you 2 save more ppl.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>He who knows others is wise;<br>He who know himself is enlightened.</div>
