So far, there's been views from Buddhism, Taoism and Christianity. So let me contribute the Islamic perspective.<br><br>The Quran, which incidentally enough is the Quranic scriptures, mentions that the meaning of the word Islam is peace. It's a literal translation that's reiterated by this verse in the Quran.<br><br>"Religion with God means a commitment to peace. [The Quran, 3:19]<br><br>In this vein, Islam, or peace, was the first thing that God imparted to men. Islam, hence, is not a particular faith, but the theme of all of the world's religions. Whichever faith you delve into, you'll find elements of peace, or Islam, in it.<br><br>The Quran explains the situation quite succiently.<br><br>"And verily, We have sent among every nation a Messenger (proclaiming): 'Worship God (Alone), and avoid all false deities.' Then of them were some whom God guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified" (Quran 16:36)<br><br>Hence, all religions belong to God, and preach the most essential message of peace.<br><br>In Islam, there is a beautiful concept that is called fitrah.<br><br>"Then set your face upright for religion in the right state-- the nature made by Allah in which He has made men; there is no altering of Allah's creation; that is the right religion, but most people do not know." (Quran 30:30)<br><br>Fitrah refers to the nature of man that God has ordained for all mankind. All men were created pure monotheists, but his upbringing and the surroundings push him towards other creeds, other forms of religious expression. It is man who has gone about twisting the numerous revelations that God sent to us.<br><br>"How can you say, 'We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us'? But behold, the lying pen of the scribes has made it into a lie." (NIV Bible, Jeremiah 8:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Fitrah manifests itself when a baby reaches out for his mother's teat for milk; that is a sign of the fitrah working where intelligence has yet to be nurtured. When a human cries out for a god in times of dire peril; that is the person's fitrah reaching out towards the Creator. When the study of genetics established the fact that all animal, plant and human life share the same genetic language of A (adenine), T (thymine), C (cytosine) and G (guanine), we know that the Creator is One who had established One blueprint for life. Fitrah is all of these and much, much more.<br><br>Well, anyway, this is my 2 cents worth...hope I fulfilled FireIce's expectations of not posting something that's gonna run for at least ten thousand pages.     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote>INTERESTING...    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> May I know if you're a busy man?

            <div class='col-md body'>There are at least a dozen religions out there that can boast the same "evidences" of Buddhism, Christianity or Islam: holy scriptures, saviours, "witnesses", etc etc. There is no way to prove whether these "evidences" are true.
