            <div class='col-md body'><br>shatec is more recognised and established here and overseas than sunrice definitely. classified has ads specifying diploma from shatec, but never sunrice.<br>shatec has a dip in culinary skills course which trains you to be chefs not cooks, and theres is also a dip in pastry and baking course. imo culinary skills is better, you learn briefly to cook a big variety of cuisines and also pastry classes. course fees is ~$6k/year, course is about 2 years, including 6 months UNPAID attachment with shatec restaurants, then 1 year paid attachments of you finding your own hotels.<br><br>after you completed your course and attachments you can find your own jobs with any hotel or restaurant, likely becoming chefs within a year. you will know basically how to own your own place too.<br><br>imo it is not good to work full time in the food industry, you have to work split shifts, go in the morning to prepare ingredients for lunch, then cook lunch, after lunch you clean up kitchen then waste hours before having to come back to prepare ingredients for dinner, then cook dinner, then wash up entire kitchen then go home late. the mediocre pay is not worth it. unless you are confident of becoming a top chef or own your own cafe (similar aim of 10000s not to mention there are 1000 too many restaurants already and shop space rent is up to $40000 a month)<br><br>hopefully you are talented and creative in cooking.<br><br>a 8-6 office job too boring for you? btw im doing accounting n finance not culinary<br></div>

Really ? They train you to become Chefs ? Wow, i should have gone to that school then ! Bravo Shatec ! So meaning after they grad, they become Chefs ?<br><br>TS, depends on what you want.. Shatec is local and the fees are way lower. @Sunrise has a degree program which is joint with Johnson and Wales of the US. One of the better Culinary schools around.. Fees are higher but chances of getting overseas exp are high !<br><br>Btw, im not a student from @sunrise and i'm not promoting em in anyways.. I learnt my trade in Canada, No school can teach or train you to become Chefs. They teach you the fundamentals, the base of Culinary, duties of a Chef thats all. You learn most of your trade when you work under different Chefs.<br><br>All the best TS.. Welcome to the Culinary world ! It's the best job out there if you are one that likes a fast pace in life.. Get the book Kitchen Confidential by Chef Anthony Bourdain.. It gives you an insight of the Kitchen Life...<br><br>[/b]</div>
