Personally - I feel that mistakes in life &amp; love is best to be enlightened at the earlier phrase of your life - in this way, at the very least you know that the future would be better for you - which is more important.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Basically it is psychologically proven that woman who *don't* love themselves, often find partner who treat them like sh|t. So now you know what to do daughter?<br><br>LOVE YOURSELF! Because if you love yourself, you won't chose or even stick with a man who don't even appreciate you. Appreciation is very important in any relation, because each and every one of us isn't super duper chiobu/yandao, drive a limbo, fused with the best characteristic a guy/girl could ever be. We have our positive side and of course the negative side.<br><br>Finding someone who appreciate our positive side isn't easy I tell you. The patience of people nowadays regarding relation are wearing thin.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Regardless of what happen in past relation - you will eventually grow from the lessons and you have to make yourself grow. If not - its rather difficult to advance and move on to better potential in the future.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Cheers</div>
