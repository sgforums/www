            <div class='col-md body'>She's certainly Singaporean. She writes in one of her blogs :<br><br><blockquote>Although I have lived through 4 rallies, my parents were never much interested in politics. Their only choice and obvious choice has always been PAP. Now that I am 21 and it's the first time I'm allowed to cast my vote... I wanted to make my decision a better-informed one. Hence, on the nite b4 polling day, I finally decided to watch a rally. Since the opposition party in my district was SDA, I decided to watch their only rally for that day, which was at none other than Potong Pasir.<br><br>The first time I heard of Chiam See Tong was 5 years ago, when I switched on the TV and heard chants of "Potong Pasir Chiam See Tong". Frankly, at that time, I didn't even know where Potong Pasir was. So this time, I decided to experience the chanting... real live!<br><br>The place was much more crowded than I had expected, I queued for 15mins just to turn into "Potong Pasir Avenue 1". And then only to realise that there were no more parking lots... I ingenuously turned to Wan Tho Avenue hoping to get free parking at that landed estate. Too bad, double yellow lines everywhere... But I was so excited to watch the rally I decided to risk it. Anyway, everyone else was parking everywhere. Aiya how can you expect to have a rally and not provide people with ample parking lots.<br><br>It was hot and the long grass made my legs feel itchy. Felt like there were weird insects crawling up my calves. There were lots of old men sitting around. I was there one hour late and there were already packets of people leaving... mostly those with kids or those young ppl like myself who were just there to see-see. After 10 mins you'll conclude that the rest of the nite will be the same and you'll just leave.<br><br>I heard about 4 politicians speak. Each one spent 50% of the time rousing the crowd to chant Chiam See Tong or SDA and spent 30% of the time saying how bad PAP was. There was barely any content in their rallies, except for instilling fear of the unknown...  "after the elections... if you let PAP win... your bus fares will go up!" Stuff like that. Most of the time, all I hear is... "So who should we vote for??? Chiam See Tong! SDA!"<br><br>Most of the crowd were quite bored and quiet, except for those pro-opposition people right in front who were shouting at everything. But... the magic came... when Chiam See Tong arrived.<br><br>In this video... you can see almost everyone cheering. I was standing right at the back. So you can imagine if I were in the front! To my right, there was a middle-aged woman in leotards jumping up and down and clapping while shouting "Chiam See Tong! Chiam See Tong!" Before that, she was all composed. Two young girls who were chatting on their own and indifferent all along started clapping and cheering as soon as they saw Chiam See Tong coming. Their faces lit up, just like all the thousands of people surrounding me.<br><br>If I were in the ancient times, I would have thought that it is someone like Wu Song coming. The arrival of one who had saved many commoners, such that the sight of him  brought them so much joy. But secretly, I wonder if it will still be the same 5 years down the road when the margin is a mere 55% now. Unless he fulfills his upgrading promise, I think it is goodbye in 2011.<br><br>Anyway believe  it or not I have had bad nights because of this GE. Every night I went to sleep dreaming of politics. All because.. I didn't know who to vote for! My vote, though a small one, meant a lot to me. Now that it's over... phew.<br></blockquote><a href="http://www.xanga.com/princessgx" rel="nofollow">http://www.xanga.com/princessgx</a></div>
