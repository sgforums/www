              <p>Ok peeps. I have no idea if i am supposed to post this here but i dont think there is a more appropriate forum. And i would like to discuss it with singaporeans too..</p>
              <p>Part of my waiting-for-university-to-begin-life involved me reading Isaac Asimov's Foundation Series. its pretty hard to find ppl who are able to discuss this meaningfully with me in real life, so i hope to find some people who are able to do this on sgforums.</p>
              <p>alright, here goes: so i read almost everything the foundation series has to offer. and i must admit it is the best sci-fi series ever written.</p>
              <p>the point is, though, that i hope to discuss the events that you should think might have occurred AFTER foundation and earth. As we all know, foundation and earth took place around 500F.E and there are another 500 years left to the successful establishment of a 2nd Glactic Empire.</p>
              <p>AND... the 2nd Galactic Empire was successfully created! it was very evidently hinted in the first <em>Foundation </em>that the encylopedia galactica was completed by around 1200FE and hence the 2nd Galactic Empire must have come to pass!</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, Asimov died before being able to complete the series of novels, and i was just wondering if there are any people here who have read the novels and are willing to share with me what they think must have happened in the next 500 years post foundation and earth.</p>
              <p>Questions i'd like to raise are: what happens to Gaia? Did the 2nd foundation take over as the rulers of the foundation? Why couldnt the seldon plan predict the first foundation resentment towards the 2nd foundation? Should that not be taken into account in the Seldon plan too?</p>
              <p>ok for those peeps who didnt read the novels and have read this far go read the novels haha its really worth reading :p</p>
