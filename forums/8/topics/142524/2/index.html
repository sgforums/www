            <div class='col-md body'>I am no big fan of TT Durai.<br>However, i feel several allegations has been overblown and sensationalised.<br><br><span style="color: red;">I think you are a BIG fan of TT Durai.</span><br><br>Why is a $1000 gold tap expensive??<br>When was the last time your house change the tap?<br>I have lived in the same house for 20+ years and we've been using the same tap.<br>Assuming the tap can last 20 years. If you amortise the $1000 gold tap over the same period, it only costs 13cts per day.<br>How much did you spend on kopi today? Assuming 1 cup at 70cts.<br>So how is a gold tap that costs 13cts per day expensive???!!!!<br><br><span style="color: red;">How often do you change your toilet bowl ? Your bath tub ? Your address plate ? Or your eating utensils ? Are you saying they should all be in gold? And preferably paid with others' money ?</span><br><br>Also, if you work 7 days a week, 13 hours a day without rest.<br>Would you think you deserve $600,000 a year payroll?<br>If you do, then why is it expensive to pay Mr TT Durai $600,000 for the same???!!!!<br><br><span style="color: red;">Who knows what he does working 7 days a week, 13 hours a day, with or without rest ? Assuming he indeed worked his gut out for the organisation, why was he afraid to tell people his pay? Why must the court of law, after much probing and prompting, exposed his pay and more?</span><br><br>"oh but NKF is a charity organisation";<br>Well, if you continue to use that argument, it wouldn't matter whether the staff is paid $6000 or $600,000 because it is still donors' money anyway.<br>So you might as well ask people to work free since it's donor money, cannot spend on salary.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Transparency my friend, is the issue. If he says upfront how much he is getting or going to get....we decide. So what if it is a million dollar. He deserves it AFTER proving that he has generated much more. But he lied. By giving false numbers he played on the feelings and emotions of the people who give. And he shows no remorse when his lies are exposed before the court of law.</span><br><br>You want the charity organisation to be run efficiently, as professional as a private organisation, but you want people to work free. How to? Why don't you go volunteer to work free for NKF.<br><br><span style="color: red;">WHO said we want people to work free? No. Never. The same argument may be put forth to other CEOs or ministers. They are paid very much by ordinary man perception. But the majority have no qualms on that. They promise and they deliver. We cannot do the job so collectively we pay them. But the same cannot be said of Durai. He did not tell us how much he was getting. We found out the hard and harsh way.</span><br><br>How many of you are even volunteer of charity. So please, talk is easy. Arm chair critic is the best job in the world.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><br>If not for arm chair critics this is going to be a very dangerous world to live in. The rule of the jungle will prevail. Nobody will care about civility, morality even legality. We cannot go on strike like people in other countries do, so we can only criticise sitting on the chair. Anyway dont under estimate the power of the mass whether they are on the street or over the Internet. And in this case they feel cheated. Very much cheated. And the Government knows and action has been taken.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I must say that I'm really appalled by Mrs Goh Chok Tong's comments after the closing of the court case. $600,000 and 12 months bonus might be "peanuts" to a genuine MNC and would be justifiable in the case of the CEO if the company earned good profits in the past year. But for a charity organisation, it is a largesse which it cannot afford. Perhaps our good Mrs Goh let her emotions cloud  over good thinking at that moment.</div>
