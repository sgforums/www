The more money NKF got, the more bonus he gets?<br>ii)Do you have a 10-12 month annual bonus? In fact, how many people have a 10-12 month bonus?<br>iii)And later, the "peanuts" comment (Read my sig), how many people can earn "peanuts" in their lifetime?<br><br>Did anyone say they must work for free, in poor conditions?

Arm chair critic is the best job in the world.<br><br></div></blockquote>Let me get straight to the point... the main issue here is not abt the 600k, NKF is not a government organization... if T.T Durai is worth every cent that he is.. then 600k is reasonable for a CEO.. although still overpriced..<br><br>But that is not the main issue..<br><br>THe main issue are:<br><br>1. He DECEIVED the public.. he inflated kidney patient dialysis numbers to obtain greater amounts of sympathy in the form of donations... he is extremely reluctant with revealing the amt he is paid and the fact that he flies 1st class...<br><br>2. His duties as CEO of the company is to act in the company's best interest... and that is to maximise usage of the donor's money for the kidney patients.. yet in this case he is acting purely for self-interest.. this is evidenced by the following:<br><br>i) Fear of revealing the fact that his gold-plated taps are for his private use, the gold taps are not the issue, its his RELUCTANCE to admit that its for his private use<br><br>ii) The manipulation of his board given "entitlements" to fly 1st class in other airlines using the inflated price of SIA's business class<br><br>iii) Him suing SPH and earlier on another member of the press in 1992, hes suing someone for revealin the truth, the truth that self-interest has taken precedence over that of the company's.<br><br>The list goes on of the many things he did under the guise of "in the company's and donor's interest" such as the directorship of SEVERAL OTHER COMPANIES as well as the usage of NKF's funds for NKF affliated companies which coincidentally he too has a controlling stake in as well..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree one thing though.. a few of us will be tempted to take some of NKF's millions into our own pockets once we realise our signatures have the power to move millions... the few of us with NO morals that is</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe a lot of NKF patients , who are parents work 24/7 and did not get to use the 1000 dollar taps and also 600k annual income.<br><br>And watching the NKF news i began to wonder ? Why are the nice fishtanks doing for the dialysis ??? I wonder if anybody know the cost of maintaining the fishtanks at home . Who gets the contracts to maintain fishtanks for patients who visit the fishes every other week?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aiyah, ibanana, if you got stamps over your eyes, go ahead and donate to Durai to help him defray legal costs lah! Donate your $0.70 a day coffee money for 30 years lah!<br><br>I read the exchanges between T T Durai and Davindar Singh. Among other things, T T Durai was disgustingly evasive. He claimed that the public did not need to know that he was paid $600K. Davindar said it right in court. Durai didn't want the public to know because the amount was an embarrassment.<br><br>NKF wasn't particularly efficient at using donor's funds to help kidney patients. It's admin overheads are higher than that of KDF, in part no thanks to the fleet of Merc, 1st class travel, private bathroom with $900 tap, wtf? The remaining went into the huge reserves. What for keep such huge reserves when there are kideny patients who need the money today? Donors didn't give to NKF to build up reserves, but give to help today's needy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Of course if you say that you spend 13 cents a day on a tap, it sounds a whole lot better than saying that you spent $990 at one go on the same tap. The bottom line will still be the same - donors' money is being spent needlessly.<br><br>It's all in the spin.</div>
