            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong>Suicide rate here of this group is among world's highest, says doctor who tracks such figures</strong><br><br>By Susan Long<br><br>IN EARLY days, people in Singapore who committed suicide tended to be sick, old people in unbearable pain.<br><br><img src="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2004-04-04/news4.jpg"><br>POSED PHOTO: WANG HUI FEN<br>Today, it is female teenagers who are increasingly taking their place on the ledge and jumping to their deaths.<br><br>The rate at which young Singaporean women are committing suicide is one of the highest in the world today, according to Dr Chia Boon Hock, a psychiatrist in private practice.<br><br>In 1991, his figures showed that 3.2 per 100,000 females aged 10 to 19 killed themselves.<br><br>Ten years later, this rate soared to 5.1, an increase of about 40 per cent.<br><br>The proportion of males in the same age group taking their own lives is now stabilising at around four suicides per 100,000 people a year.<br><br><span style="color: red;">HELPLINES<br><br>Â• Samaritans of Singapore: 1800-221-4444<br><br>Â• Care Corner Mandarin Counselling Centre: 1800-353- 5800 (10am to 10pm daily)<br><br>Â• Family Service Centre: 1800-838-0100 </span><br><br>Also, the elderly suicide rate has dropped from 100 suicides per 100,000 people in 1960 to about 30 today.<br><br>But he noted that despondent young women appear to be 'making up' the shortfall.<br><br>Among Singapore's student population, his figures showed that 2.8 males committed suicide for every one female in 1995.<br><br>But by 2002, it was 0.7 males to every one female, because the number of young women killing themselves had risen sharply .<br><br>What tips many of these young women over the edge is a mixed bag of love problems, family frictions, bereavements, school stress, work issues, financial pressures and mental illness.<br><br>Among them, he noted that Malay female suicide rates are growing, although from a 'very low base', as more Malay women join the workforce and face rat-race pressures.<br><br>In 1969, their rate of suicides was 0.5 per 100,000 people a year. It crept up to 1.7 in 1979 and 3.7 by 1999.<br><br>Dr Chia, 68, earned a doctorate in social medicine in 1980 by researching suicide in Singapore. This was on top of his medical degree.<br><br>He has also spent more than 30 years of his life studying whatever court files he can lay his hands on involving unnatural deaths, poring over police, medical and pathologists' reports.<br><br>'Today, collecting data on suicide has grown into a hobby,' he told The Sunday Times.<br><br>His interest in suicide is largely as a psychiatrist and statistician; he stops short of providing pat explanations. 'Suicide is too complex for that,' he said.<br><br>He started tracking suicidal female teenagers here in earnest when a 1994 international study ranked the suicide rate of Singapore's females aged 15 to 24 the fourth highest in the world. The top three are hard-living former communist countries like rural China, Lithuania and Kazakhstan.<br><br>In the same age category, Singapore's young males ranked a more middling 33rd position among the 50 countries studied.<br><br>This bucks the pattern elsewhere, Dr Chia said.<br><br>In most countries, men are more likely to succeed in killing themselves, while women attempt suicide more often, but less successfully.<br><br>In Singapore, however, the odds of dying are even for both sexes because most Singaporeans choose the easy and lethal method of jumping to their deaths from high-rise buildings.<br><br>His statistics showed that 70 per cent of those who committed suicide here between 2000 and 2002 leapt to their deaths, usually from their common corridor, kitchen or bedroom. The rest hang, gas, poison, burn or drown themselves.<br><br>Between 300 and 400 people take their own lives here each year.<br><br>Another group of young women ending their lives prematurely at an alarming rate are Indonesian maids in Singapore. At least 30 have committed suicide in the last three years - but not before writing heart-wrenching letters to their families of their employers' cruelty and scoldings.<br><br>'Many come from impoverished rural villages, are painfully young and barely educated,' he said. 'Like lost souls, they find it difficult to adapt to this strange new land.'</blockquote></div>
