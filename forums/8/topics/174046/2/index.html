Why is this so?<br><br>Please remember the seats are meant for everyone. It is a public utility. Everyone pays the fare. Everyone has the same rights or obligation.<br><br>Whoever comes first, will be served first. Simple principle. It is fair and just if a younger person come first and sit first. Or whoever, insert whatever criteria here: younger, older, fatter, thinner, richer, poorer, male, female, any racial group, etc.<br><br>When you say a younger person should give up his/ her seat to an older person, you take away the principle of equality.<br><br>This giving up seat for an older person is just a completely discretionary act from any individual. There is no such established norm or envalidated social consensus, much less taken as a rule or a must. This depends whether an individual want to or not. It's not an obligation.<br><br>If an individual doesn't want to, don't judge.<br><br>In fact I find further fault in this. You not only discriminate against the younger person, but also the older person unwittingly. Are you saying he is old and weak and useless? You are stereotyping based on his age. You are looking down on him. This actually harms them. Older people need a sense of self-worth more than you. They dont need to step into a bus or train to be pitied by younger people and be specially chosen, based on his old age, to sit. What do you think this will do to their psychology? Subconsciously they will really believe they are old and weak, and cant stand on public transport. Do u think this really help them?<br><br>Please think abt this.<br><br>And this thread has further negative poison.

Are you stereotying and discriminating them?

I just mentioned what i saw and up to the 'intelligent' yourself to judge.<br><br>Equality?  I don't think about equality. I just think from old people's point of view.  Some old folks can walk/stand but they are weak or their recovery rate is not as fast as young people.<br><br>When buses start to move / stop, old people may have higher chance to fall down. When they fall down, they may have bone fracture. ( e.g. my friend's ah ma, she fell down in her house and have to spend her entire life in wheel chair).<br><br>Well, i just want to bring this awareness to people .<br>And i don't want anyone of us be the cause for an old ah ma to spend her life in wheelchair.<br><br>You can still stick to your theory of equality!!! but before thinking of equality, think about the old folks, think about that you may be one of them when you are old.<br><br></div>
