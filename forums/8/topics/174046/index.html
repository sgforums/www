            <div class='col-md body'>glen,<br><br>I think the pressure of being a Singaporean (work-related stress, high education standards, escalating costs of living, etc.) contributes largely to the mentality of our locals who goes about daily life thinking they should at least be entitled to their seat in a bus. Likewise on the roads with motorists.<br><br>The system we have to live with all these decades is a relentlessly undbending one, which makes for a rather self-preserving people as well.

Afterall i have been to 3rd world nations where life is really tough but yet the people are simple and friendly. In fact if you are talking about the system we are in, all educators in this system have been trying to teach the students to be gracious. But most efforts are destroyed by the kids parents themselves. So are you saying that the system itsn't making an effort to change the mindset?</div>

Not any fixed system. Afterall i have been to 3rd world nations where life is really tough but yet the people are simple and friendly. In fact if you are talking about the system we are in, all educators in this system have been trying to teach the students to be gracious. But most efforts are destroyed by the kids parents themselves. So are you saying that the system itsn't making an effort to change the mindset?</div></blockquote>While true that children are brought up by parents, and education system "attempts" to inculcate grace, it's the prevailing unbending policies, rules, and system that governs living in Singapore, that makes people grow up "un-bending" (or self-preserving) as well.<br></div>
