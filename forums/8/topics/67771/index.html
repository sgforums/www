He was a real miser when it came to his money.<br><br>He loved money more than just about anything, and just before he died,  he said to his wife, "Now listen, when I die, I want you to take all my money and place it in the casket with me. I wanna take my money to the afterlife."<br><br>So he got his wife to promise him with all her heart that when he<br>died, she would put all the money in the casket with him.<br><br>Well, one day he died.  He was stretched out in the casket, the wife<br>was sitting there in black next to her closest friend.<br><br>When they finished the ceremony, just before the undertakers got ready to close the casket, the wife said "Wait just a minute!" She had a shoe box with her, she came over with the box and placed it in the casket.<br><br>Then the undertakers locked the casket down and rolled it away. Her friend said, "I hope you weren't crazy enough to put all that money in the casket."<br><br>She said, "Yes, I promised. I'm a good Christian, I can't lie. I  promised him that I was going to put that money in that casket with<br>him."<br><br>"You mean to tell me you put every cent of his money in the casket<br>with him?"<br><br>"I sure did," said the wife. "I got it all together, put it into my<br>account and I wrote him a cheque."<br><br></div>
