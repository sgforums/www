Bad upbringing by parents and bad peer influence. And lians and bengs are delinquents or delinquents-to-be. I'm not talking about the act cool wannabes, I'm talking about those who doesn't go to school, steals, join secret society, and who wouldn't hesitate to fight if they think someone stares at them.<br><br>I believe that prevention is better then cure. Why wait for the kids to become "beyond their control" when they could easily be identified earlier and prevented?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nope, its a bad ideal especially for the students studying in the military schools. Instead of helping them, you might be bringing more harm to them.<br><br>Firstly, you said that students from <strong>poor</strong> families are to attend military schools. This is like hurting the citizens's pride, not only the children but also the parents because we are categorising them into poor and rich. This is even worse then having the EM1, EM2 and EM3 streaming scheme.<br><br>Secondly, the students in military schools will see themselves as society bastards as we made them think that they will turn bad when they grow up which is why they have to attend military schools. This will cause them to lose confidence in life and create more problematic children than decreasing them.<br><br>Thirdly, the students in military schools will be looked down by students from other schools because they are poor and also because they are predicted to become bad in future. Parents will also advice their children not to interact with these children from military school as they might become a bad influence. This will cause hatred to develop within the students.<br><br>Fourthly, the students in the military schools will be deprived of happy childhood memories as they are poor and therefore don't have much money to spent on extra things like toys and in school the teachers are always shouting at them.<br><br>Fifth, these will cause the country to be divided as citizens will be categorized into poor and rich.<br><br>Sixth, building schools requires money and money comes from the taxpayers which means tax will increase. Since we are talking about sending the poor's children into the military schools. We are not talking about building 1 or 2 schools and besides hiring military teachers are expensive. Which means the taxpayers, usually the rich have to pay a lot more.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My stand in this issue is similar to those of Ayukat.<br><br>What you are suggesting is going to introduce in fact, a further polarization of the youth society.<br><br>As compared to the previous streaming policies in mainstream schools, the concept of shipping off all Â‘delinquentsÂ’ into a military is even worse.<br><br>Instead of addressing the beneficial pulls from the Â‘additional attention and careÂ’ from the running concept of the military school that you have, it is higher probable that backfiring will occur.<br><br>Delinquents need to be counseled and reconditioned to allow them to re-enter the mainstreams in society.<br><br>For their sake, educators and parents alike share a common responsibility to ensure that the educational and other all-rounder learning IS there to ensure that the majority of these students are capable of mingling well.<br><br>To have a military school just for the sake of clustering up these particular group from society, especially given their young age, is something rather high-handed.<br><br>Why must a delinquent youth, or someone who has been branded under this term for one, HAS to have his / her future career path decided for by members of the public?<br><br>Is this arrangement a fit with what we call 'democracy' in our society?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well they could set up a military school to throw kids in instead of a boy/girls home.....so only certain kids get there while those good hard working kids from poor families will be able to live out normally and contribute to the nation.....besides it'd also get those rich spoilt brats who cannot be contorlled.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by yangguizi:</div><div class="quote_body">The idea is make it compulsory for every boy in a low income family to enter these military schools. These boys will have to study primary school all the way up to secondary school in this military school. Along the way, they will learn to be disciplined like soldiers do.<br><br>After their O'levels, they will be streamed accordingly. Those with good acadamic results can proceed to enter JCs or Polys of their choice, and will be freed from their military commitment, until their full time national service. The same goes for those who excel in other areas and those with excellent disciplinary records.<br><br>As for the rest, they will be made to sign on as army regulars.<br><br>This idea will address some important issues.<br><br>Juvenile crimes and secret society problems. Harsh but fact, these low income family children made up a large percentage of those who entered secret societies and becoming a menace to public safety, not to mention being a bad influece to other kids.<br><br>Disciplining them from young in a military school will prevent these youths from straying. Training them to be a soldier from young means these people will not end up being jobless after their full time national service. This will give them no chance to do crimes and become bookies. Also, this means SAF will have a larger pool of well trained military personnels, which is good news for Singapore Defense and the other normal boys who can have easier NS.<br><br>Also, the military schools for primary up till secondary can be applied to girls as well. This will address the problem of rising number of Ah Lians and teenage abortion rate.<br><br>Give me your views, and if its good, I'll submit it to Strait Times Forum.</div></blockquote>Hehehe...this military school idea sounds really like the system the U.S is adopting right now.<br><br>Okie...how about this? Let some of the convicts in prison right now to serve their sentence as mrt train marshals. Petty-theft convicts will serve their sentence as security personnel for shopping centres. Some can become mrt train operators...sort of like giving them a second chance in life...anyway, since they are serving their sentence, they don't get paid extra and our mrt fares will not go up...maybe even become cheaper.<br><br>So....what do you people think of it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
