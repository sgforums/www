              <p>Some posts here reflect the same irresponsible and selfish attitude that the big players in the industries adopt towards environmental problems. It's not clear whether it's a natural phenomenon but why do you want to take chances?</p>
              <p>As for green measures, the piecemeal measures we are using now only create more problems. For instance, using energy-saving light bulbs and hybrid vehicles requires toxic and exotic materials that cannot be disposed easily.</p>
              <p>We have to examine the impact of products at every stage, change whole business and consumer cultures, and be more tolerant of inconveniences and smaller returns. At the end of the day, we are all in this together.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 10.85pt;"><span style="color: #333333;">If a homeless man were standing on the corner of a street as you were passing by, screaming "The world is coming to an end!" would you believe him?<br><br>Movies set aside, most would try not to make eye contact and walk by swiftly muttering, "He's crazy."<br><br>But what if this "insane" man's predictions came true? What if a fire started in your own backyard because of a drought or if your entire neighborhood was wiped out by a terrible monsoon one night?<br><br>Global warming is no longer the problem of our future generations. It is our problem.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 10.85pt;"><span style="color: #333333;"><br>Rising sea levels due to melting glaciers; droughts, monsoons, wildfires and greenhouse gasses are all natural disasters that have come to be known as not-so-natural.<br><br>How is something we can't control not natural? Its simple- these actions have been on the rise because of the effect of our every day lives on Mother Nature.</span><span style="color: #333333;"> </span><span style="color: #333333;"><br><br>Whether it's a citizen's daily commute, running their clothes through a dryer in the middle of the day, watering their lawn during winter or even the kind of light bulbs they use, they have a bigger impact on the environment then they are aware of.<br><br>In fact, the United States only makes up four percent of the world's population but is responsible for an alarming 22 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions.<br><br>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the main culprit for our greenhouse gas emissions. Earth is designed to hold just enough CO2 to create a warm blanket, therefore allowing life to form.</span><span style="color: #333333;"> </span><span style="color: #333333;"><br><br>With Americans pumping out millions of pounds of carbon every day with our gas-guzzling cars and ruthless energy use, Mother Nature was bound to lash back sometime.<br><br>There's always the skeptic who couldn't possibly make the connection between them driving their car to work everyday and the polar ice caps melting at alarming rates.</span><span style="color: #333333;"> </span><span style="color: #333333;"><br><br>Anyone who's taken a science class in their lifetime knows that heat melts ice. The more carbon released into the atmosphere, causes more heat to be trapped which means glaciers act as ice in a glass on a summer day in the Valley of the Sun.</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 10.85pt;"><span style="color: #333333;">But what most people don't realize is how much carbon and even money they can save by carpooling with someone who is taking the same route. In a year, it can save 1,590 pounds of CO2 and hundreds of dollars.</span><span style="color: #333333;"> </span><span style="color: #333333;"><br><br>Drastic climate changes aren't the only predictions in Earth's crystal ball.</span><span style="color: #333333;"> </span><span style="color: #333333;"><br>Insect-born diseases such as malaria, dengue fever and encephalitis can be spread by mosquitoes and rodents who migrate to warmer areas.</span><span style="color: #333333;"> </span><span style="color: #333333;"><br><br>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), climate change contributes to 150,000 extra deaths a year. With the climate gradually getting worse, this number can easily be doubled in the next 25 years.<br><br>Respiratory problems are also in the future due to high levels of CO2 favoring the growth of ragweed and other pollen producers. The amount of pollen produced rises with CO2 emissions and therefore causes more asthma and allergy attacks.<br><br>For anyone living in Arizona with allergies or asthma, they might not even be able to imagine it being any worse with all of the dust and plants residing here.</span><span style="color: #333333;"> </span><span style="color: #333333;"><br><br>This is the grim outlook of the world if people continue on the careless path of believing it will never happen to them. Just when we thought it couldn't get any worse, the advancement of our own society is finally fighting back.</span></p>
