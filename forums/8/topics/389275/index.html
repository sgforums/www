              <p>Well, its illegal if  ur friend gains something out of it, e.g of value</p>
              <p>It's not illegal if you're blackmailing for virtually no gain</p>
              <p>By the way, the very nature of blackmail is trying to get someone to do something they normally wouldn't.</p>
              <p>so.. in this case... i highly doubt anything can be done by the courts.. lol .. for now.</p>
              <p>Because the information is usually substantially true, it is not revealing
                      the information that is criminal, but demanding money to withhold it.</p>
              <p>Blackmail is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">gaining or attempting to gain anything of value or
                      compelling another to act against such person's will</span>, by threatening to
                      communicate accusations or statements about any person that would
                      subject such person or any other person to public ridicule, contempt or
                      degradation.</p>
              <p>So it really depends on ur case of what may result in you being compelled to act against your will by that person in order not to have the picture revealed.</p>

              <p>Hi , there is no need to be afraid of the extortion</p>
              <p>in fact , he will be afraid</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Blackmailing and extortion is a criminal offence in singapore .If you report his email or his mode of communication to Criminal Investigation Department ,he will be charged in court.</p>
              <p>your photo does not show anything which is Public Display of Affection .If it is then ,</p>
              <p>that would be a real case</p>
              <p>the thing is, how accurate does this photo shows you and your friend .This is an arguable points and you can even sued the person back as you totally do not know him</p>

              <p>your friend same gender as you or not i keen to know.</p>
              <p>back to topic. its your side of the story only. i suggest you go seek legal advice if you really feel threatened. otherwise its street candid shots that guy taking. bad on manners if never ask for permission but definitely not totally at fault or wrong to post it up online since he / she takes the photo and has rights to display it if he / she feels it is a piece or 'art'. no upskirt shots or indecent exposure / manipulation towards an output that is indecent or racist, otherwise you sure can sue him / her.</p>

              Hi I admire your exceptional understanding of the law and human rights. If you were any stupider I would ask you to go "Get a brain" but why would I right?
              
              <br>
              <br>
              Anyway, given your excellent command of English (judging by your wonderful grammer) I surely have to believe that you are a top lawyer or judge much less familiar with the law.
              
              <br>
              <br>
              In any case since you such a high flyer I wonder if I could rub shoulders with you when we are in public. Perhaps even come up from behind to hug you. I am sure you won't mind because it is in public and in full view of everyone. Since when we are in public and in full view of everyone we have no rights over our privacy of image or contact anyway. Hope to see you around! :)

              Yea man. I have to agree with you. I think educated people who speak proper English are failures in school and in life as well. In fact MNCs are hiring people who cannot speak nor write properly into their key positions. That is where the money is so if you wish to own a nice house, have a nice ride and maybe still have a positive net asset, you can go try for these positions (of course educated people who speak could English need not apply), If you are one of those suckers with good education and speak good English I think you should just mope at home venting of steam in these forums.
              <br>
              <br>
              After all it is like what my great mentor kcockicht teaches, lowly educated people are the people swimming in the fast and furious stream of success. Hence of course the judge must be poorly educated with no sense of logic and therefore would rule in favour of the defendant. For he is only taking a photo of the pretty bus driver.

If TS is very rich and have a reputation, he can engage his lawyer to sue for deframation if the act was mean to be an act of kindless to borrow a sholder for his friend to lean on and that guy took the picture and post it as making the act seems like something else.</p>

              <p>I was on the bus with my friend, my friend was lying on my
              shoulder, this guy behind took the photo without me knowing, and
              posted it online. i told him to removed he and he obliged. However,
              ever since that day, he have been blackmailing me saying that he
              would post the picture up, and me being a loser for not wanting the
              picture to be online.</p>
              <p>Can i do anything about it to stop this?</p>
              <p>Will be helpful if anyone can show me the panel code for this if
