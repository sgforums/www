Impressions aren't made from your school uniform,the more important part of IMPRESSIONS is how you BEHAVE.You can have a A student with their uniforms all tucked out,but they behave decently,i wouldn't think anyone would mind.Of course unless they have unmatured thinking like: Oh if your shirt is sloppy means you are a wankster.Students can also argue back that wearing school uniforms is just to "group" everyone.Like we have the Singapore flag and others have the USA flag or w/e.Also....personally,i feel that Singapore's image is ruined if the foreigners reads about how you type..they'll laugh they white butts off. So..buck up on your english,Mr/Mrs Despondent. Peace out.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, threadstarter has a point. We not talking about tucking in all the way or what so ever. Just a decent image. Just imagine, wearing ur t-shirt the other way round. That is probably a similar effect of sloppy uniform dressing. If u wear ur t-shirt wrongly, ppl laugh at u. If ur apperance is sloppy, the effect is, ppl laugh at ur sch.<br><br>Many think, 'yea, sloppy =cool'.

            <div class='col-md body'>doesnt really matter how you dress actually. its conflicting what they teach at schools these days. on 1 side , they teach that its not what a person wears or how they dress , its what they do that makes the person. and on the OTHER hand... they teach that people judge you by how you look. so how do we go around that? blame the older generation because they judge a book by its cover? think about it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>despondent, u r contradicting yourself.<br>those people who wear their school uniform sloppily dont always say that they are proud of the school/they take pride in their school etc.<br>and on the contrary, the reason of why students wear their school uniform neatly takes pride in their school.<br>furthermore, like what the previous few people had said, people now dont look at school uniform. or rather school uniforms no longer reflects the reputation of the school. its the bloody grade on the results slips the people are looking at.</div>
