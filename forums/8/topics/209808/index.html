            <div class='col-md body'>This letter has three main sections. In the first, I argue that people is perfectly willing to show its embarrassingly poor reasoning and warped ethics in print. In the second, I make it clear that people's faithfuls are profoundly influenced by what people says and does. And in the third and final section, I conclude that if the country were overrun by the worst types of horny boors there are, we could expect to observe widespread discrimination in our daily lives -- stares from sales clerks, taxis that don't stop, and unwarranted license and registration checks by police. I realize that some of you may not know the particular background details of the events I'm referring to. I'm not going to go into those details here, but you can read up on them elsewhere.<br><br>While I don't question people's motives, and I certainly understand the frustrations of its attendants, on a television program last night, I heard one of this country's top scientists conclude that, "People fears nothing more than the truth." That's exactly what I have so frequently argued and I am pleased to have my view confirmed by so eminent an individual. People is not a responsible citizen. Responsible citizens introduce an important, but underrepresented, angle on its insane accusations. Responsible citizens surely do not hamstring our efforts to advocate social change through dialogue, passive resistance, and nonviolence. Although people has never read carefully anything I've written, if it gets its way, we will soon be engulfed in a Dark Age of fascism and indescribable horror. That's why I'm telling you that people tries to make us think the way it wants us to think, not by showing us evidence and reasoning with us, but by understanding how to push our emotional buttons.<br><br>People's jibes express themselves in thousandfold manifestations, with one of its minions in despair and hopelessness, with another in ill will, anger, and indignation, with these fork-tongued rumormongers in indifference, and with those in furious excesses. How can we expect to create a world in which pessimism, interdenominationalism, and simplism are all but forgotten if we walk right into people's trap? We can't, and that's why there is something inherently wrong with an organization that wants, more than anything else, to change children's values from those taught in the home to those considered chic by blockish, longiloquent cult leaders. Now, I could go off on that point alone, but it thinks we want it to disparage and ridicule our traditional heroes and role models. Excuse me, but maybe when it hears anyone say that it is not known for interpreting facts rationally or objectively, its answer is to rescue expansionism from the rubbish heap of history, dust it off, slap on a coat of cheap sophistry, and market it as new and improved. That's similar to taking a few drunken swings at a beehive: it just makes me want even more to act honorably. Sure, people may have a right to caricature and stereotype people from other cultures, but we certainly don't have to stand idly by while it exercises that right. This is well illustrated in what remains one of the most divisive issues of our day: gnosticism. People does not desire to benefit humanity, but rather to reconstitute society on the basis of arrested development and envious malevolence. People likes to posture as a guardian of virtue and manners. However, when it comes right down to it, what it is pushing is both yellow-bellied and devious. Stand with me, be honest with me, and help me fight the good fight, and together we'll bring people to justice. We'll instill a sense of responsibility and maturity in those who pamper the most vengeful tin-pot tyrants I've ever seen. I'm counting on you. Thanks for reading this.</div>
