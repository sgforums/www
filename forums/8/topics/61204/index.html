            <div class='col-md body'><strong>I'll start the ball rolling.. I juz received a email abt Red House..</strong><br><br>&lt;&lt; Any body know the story behind Red house? Who were it's previous occupants? And how it became haunted? Someone told me if u peer thru one of the broken windows of the living room,u will see an old rocking chair with a doll on it. It is said that if u try to remove the doll from the chair, it will let out a sharp cry.<br><br>Another story is about the 2 stone lion. Some other ppl  said tat the head of the lion will turn according to the time of the day. Cool way to tell the time eh!<br><br>The last story happened on one of my friend, he and a few friends decided to visit this Red House. But when they reach the main gate, the one with the 2 stone lion lor. One of the girl suddenly freaked out and suggested they turn around and walk back to the chalet. It was later tat the girl told them she had seen a floating head following them.<br><br>Heard of the Rocking chair one too and also that the Lion's eyes would turn red in the night....i went there many times and once, my fren encountered something... during that time, we went in a group and entered the house...din see the above-mentioned rocking chair, but my fren was looking at our own shadows on the ground,and he counted one extra shadow,which was in a funny pose with both arms up... he kept quiet all the way back to our chalet before telling us... i heard that the mansion used to belong to the founder of ck tangs... anyone can confirm this?<br><br>This is a true story of mine. Went to Red House this year with a few of my friends including a girl and although Red house was locked but if you looked carefully besides the lion statues, you may find a broken fence which you may entered it and the time we went is around 1 midnight and with me in the lead of course, I'm not scared of any ghosts cos I even went inside the cementary in Upp Serangoon Road before with three of my friends and whenever my friends want me to enter a deserted house, they would ask me to be in the lead first.When we reached inside the house, there was not a even a single soul but on that particular night, there was a strong frangance smell and I do not know where that paricular frangance come from but  I'm sure on that particular night, nobody besides me put on that frangance smell and after exploring the whole house, we left and came another group who went inside the house and after that nobody knows what happened after that.<br><br>My friends and i went to this red house In March and we found some offerings just infront of the gate. The strange part is that the offerings consist of a bottle of chicken, perfume, 5 set of cosmetics, 5 pcs of combs, 5 cups..etc...etc. Normally. when we want to pray the "Good brothers"., we would just buy some chicken, fish, incense, fruits...... But it seems that someone/somebody knows that something is very wrong with house. He/she even knows the exact number of people/Ghost and whether they are male or female.&gt;&gt;<br><br><strong>Any stories to contribute on Singapore's Creepiest Place? </strong><br><br></div>
