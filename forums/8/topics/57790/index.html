            <div class='col-md body'>My recent shopping experience with The White Collection Pte Ltd (a subsidiary of Novena Group) at Marina Square branch has left me upset and puzzled over the integrity of its furniture salespersons.<br><br>An exchange of a sofa chair purchase has brought more hassle than I had bargained for. Under the terms and conditions (T&amp;Cs) of the store, a buyer can exchange for any goods purchased prior to 7 days notice before the delivery date provided the total value of the exchange goods are of the same or of higher value. I was told I could exchange my sofa chair for other items in the store but the items had to be at least of the price of the chair and the additional $50 installation and transportation charges.<br><br>I have picked out 4 items to fulfill the required amount of which 3 were items that I do not really require. However, much to my surprise, the salesperson had added on another $30 installation and transportation charges to the bill, in addition to the original amount of the chair and $50 installation/transportation charges that I had to make up to.<br><br>I left the store after having paid about 34% of the total amount as deposit and I had a feeling that I was misled into paying double for installation and transportation even though I had not utilized their install/transport services as yet. Hence, I tried to call up the store for clarification.<br><br>After 5 hours of waiting and umpteen calls and messages left to speak to the salesperson who served me, I finally spoke with him on the following day. However, what left me shocked were the following points he made:<br><br>1)	The salesperson insists that the initial $50 install/transport charges were part of the sales and that it cannot be taken apart from the goods sales amount. However, their T&amp;Cs indicated that the purchase price does not include delivery charges. (these are the exact wordings in their clause). He kept insisting that my interpretation of the charges was wrong and no one else would share my interpretation and repeated trying to indoctrinate me that the install/transport charges had to come together with the purchase price.<br><br>2)	I offered to pick up the items I had purchased with my own transportation and to have both the $50 and the $30 install/transport charges taken off from the bill. The salesperson said that he could only waive the $30 even if I were to pick up the items myself and that they will be absolve from all responsibility if I fail to install the furniture myself if I choose that option. The $50 transport cost would still have to be charged accordingly even though I did not use or require their installation and transport at all as their sales revenue would decrease if they waive it.<br><br>3)	After I have instructed him to hold on to the goods while I seek second opinions on this case (In their T&amp;Cs, it is stated clearly that I have up to 1 month for delivery), the salesperson change his tactics to say that the goods may not be available if I were to delay the delivery.<br><br>When I told him that I was not in a rush for the good to be delivered, he exerted pressure on me to say that I would have to give at least 2 weeks notice before delivery of goods which would leave me with only 2 weeks to inform them of my desired delivery date.<br>(The salesperson seemed to have twisted an original clause in the T&amp;Cs that Â‘if the store cannot deliver on a said date of delivery, the eventual delivery date shall not be more than 14 days from the stated date on the invoiceÂ’, to an added responsibility on me to give them 2 weeks notice before delivery. Hence, I am pressured with another oral T&amp;C by the salesperson, not stated in their original T&amp;C, to limit my flexibility in seeking recourse for my case).<br><br>Despite the fact that the salesperson kept emphasizing that his company is a listed company and trying to portray the company as an authority with affiliation to CASE and some other association/organization, so as to hasten my goods delivery, I told the salesperson off that he should at least have the decency to keep my purchase goods in stock at least for one month as I have already made a deposit for the purchase. At this, he reluctantly agreed.<br><br>This is my first purchase of an item meant for my parentsÂ’ place and my encounter with such dismissive and mercenary salesperson from The White Collection has made me lose faith with the company totally. I am very disappointed with The White Collection and it extends to the Novena Group for their inflexible policies and bad service attitudes.<br><br>What I take away from this episode is that the companyÂ’s profits are more important than the customerÂ’s needs. I totally regret making any purchase with them and got myself in this mess, wasting time and effort to seek clarification and redress! What do I get? I was marginalized by the salesperson when he said that my interpretation of the charges is wrong!<br><br>Hence, I would like to appeal to anyone with advice or comments as to what I should do next. Thank you.<br></div>

The $50 transport cost would still have to be charged accordingly even though I did not use or require their installation and transport at all as their sales revenue would decrease if they waive it.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> From the customer's point of view, no customers would have the interest of the company at mind. So who cares what happens to their company? Anyway, the cost of goods sold is definitely lower that meets the eye. Even if they sell it below half price, they are still making money.</span><br><br>3)	After I have instructed him to hold on to the goods while I seek second opinions on this case (In their T&amp;Cs, it is stated clearly that I have up to 1 month for delivery), the salesperson change his tactics to say that the goods may not be available if I were to delay the delivery.<br><br>When I told him that I was not in a rush for the good to be delivered, he exerted pressure on me to say that I would have to give at least 2 weeks notice before delivery of goods which would leave me with only 2 weeks to inform them of my desired delivery date.<br>(The salesperson seemed to have twisted an original clause in the T&amp;Cs that Â‘if the store cannot deliver on a said date of delivery, the eventual delivery date shall not be more than 14 days from the stated date on the invoiceÂ’, to an added responsibility on me to give them 2 weeks notice before delivery.

I hate this kind of salesman. Too bad you already bought the goods already. I don't think talking to the salesman will be of anymore help to you. You should instead look for the manager or supervisor in charge.</span><br><br>Despite the fact that the salesperson kept emphasizing that his company is a listed company and trying to portray the company as an authority with affiliation to CASE and some other association/organization, so as to hasten my goods delivery, I told the salesperson off that he should at least have the decency to keep my purchase goods in stock at least for one month as I have already made a deposit for the purchase. At this, he reluctantly agreed.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">So what if the company is listed? Does it make a difference to you as a customer?</span><br><br>What I take away from this episode is that the companyÂ’s profits are more important than the customerÂ’s needs. I totally regret making any purchase with them and got myself in this mess, wasting time and effort to seek clarification and redress! What do I get?

Thank you.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">If you are sure that you have been cheated, esp when you are so firm on your intepretation of the T&amp;C, I think you have a strong case. Anyway, it's the company's job to explain the T&amp;C to you.<br><br>You might want to try CASE. I don't know if the administration is going to take a long time or not, though.</span><br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>CASE is NOT a government body. It can only help to mediate btw customer and store. At most it will help you fight the case out. But it has no authority over any stores. But one needs to be a member for them to help, which mean got to pay membership fees and spend time and transport money to go to their premises to talk to them with all relevant document.<br><br>If after they hear you out and decide that your case is not strong enough for them to help, then you would have wasted money and effort for nothing.<br><br>I've thought of a few ways:<br><br>1) Create a big din at the store during weekend. Be like a typical Ah Soh, scream. shout and demand loudly at the salesperson that it's blatant cheating. Emphasis on 'CHEATING' and scare off their potential customers for that day. BE REALLY MAD and CRAZY!!<br><br>2) Pester the CEO and management people up there with lots of phone calls as well as the store. (it's easy, just put on speaker phone and repeat dialing mode. So even if they don't pick up phone, it's no effort and cost to one.)<br><br>3) Be a rogue customer. Need 2 people to do this .Arrange to pick up furniture with own transport. But only upload one piece that covers the cost of the deposit (after checking on the spot very carefully for defects). Get your partner to drive away that one piece while you settle the different for the cost of that one item only. Then tell them you are cancelling the rest of the item an then walk out.<br>If they threaten to sue, smile back and say you welcome their lawyer's letter. That way, you throw the suing business in their court. Let them busy themselves with seeking redress process over a small sum of money (it would be a waste of their time and effort).<br><br>They can't go to Small Claims Tribune coz you have paid in full (including GST) for the only item you took. Not to talk about CASE as CASE is to act for customers not businesses. Courts will not bother with such a small sum of money and it's not a felony. So, where are they going to seek redress???<br><br>So what do you guys think???</div>
