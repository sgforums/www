            <div class='col-md body'>Whistles would not be a very useful tool, since most will just ignore wierd sounds heard. Chilli spray, that's a very interesting tool to use but it would be rather useless if the assailant is persistent. If the victim knows some self-defence, the assailant will definately think twice before attacking again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm a bit emotional over that rape post thingy. I honestly feel for the victim, and the guy who has to go thru all this, so bare with me if I sound erm.... irate.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Gripe 1:<br>Men are physically stronger than women. (E.g. Run longer, stronger. General typicalization here, since girls almost never do P.E. during school..... how the heck are they going to stand up to an average adult male ???)<br><br>Gripe 2:<br>Not matter how well armed/prepared you are, having no pior actual combat situation experience doesn't help, since you might actually panic/freeze up when such a thing actually happens.<br><br>Gripe 3:<br>If the guy(s) is going to rape/rob you, do you even think you would have time to pull out a whistle or the pepper spray for that matter ? Its most likely to be fast and sudden, to prevent the victim from reacting, and to overwhelm the victim as quickly as possible.<br><br>All in all, I would think that a swift kick in between the legs, a knee/kick/punch to the face, and run as if hell is on your heels as a better option. Grab any personal stuff left (e.g. wallets, ICs.), dump the rest (e.g. CD players, walkmans....), and forget about it if you're clothes are in tatters !<br><br>Some stuff that I thought about. If you're overseas, you're probably wearing a track suit or something akin to that, so you can "conceal" stuff like crash guards under your clothes. The hardened plastic would normally give you that extra "Oomph!" when you knee/elbow someone....<br><br>Or wear those funny sport shoes with hardened toe segments. Cross Trainers usually have them. Taking a self defense course would also add to that in a pretty good manner.<br><br>Then again, I don't think I'm making any sense here.....<br><br>------------------<br>"A Gentleman is not an implement."<br>-Confucius, Analects, 2:12</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>io:<br><br>Being in a law enforcing agency, I have seen enough to know that rape, outrage of modesty doesn't happen only after midnight. There was once when this old man on a bus I was on, lifted the skirt of a young lady standing in front of him and I saw it and know that it is no mere accident. Of course he was promptly dealt with. What I want to say is that it could happen anywhere, anytime or even to anyone. I am not trying to cause panic here, but learning how to protect yourself with the many gadgets that allows the gals an edge over these beasts, definitely earns a nod from me. That is what I call being proactive.<br><br>Maya:<br><br>Chilli spray and all that would be useful. But just imagine that someone grab you from behind, I doubt you would have the time to use it. If he is strong you could be disarmed in no time. I would rather suggest that you pick up some defence tatics to protect yourself. Nope, I am not talking about Tek Kwan Do, or something like that. It would take too long, just simple self-defense tactics would be sufficient. They are easy to learn and fast to pick up. And of course you dun need a lot of strenght to use them.<br><br>Here are some tips, for all the gals out there.<br><br><strong>Grab from behind at the neck.</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Normally your first reaction would be to try and free yourself by pulling at his arm. If he is strong, I doubt you can do anything about it. But go for his fingers. Just bend your forearm and go for his little finger. Pull and bend it, the rest of the arm will release. Follow up with a elbow to his ribs and the run.</span><br><br><strong>Grab from behind at the waist/torso area.</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">He will most probably be with his head behind yours in this position. Just knock your heads backwards, and you will hit his nose the most prominent but weakest part on his face, if it's hard enough, you break his nose, either way he will just release you from the pain. You can then turn around and give a kick to his groin and run, or just run if you dun feel confident about the second part.</span><br><br><strong>Frontal grab at the neck.</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Same thing for the grab from behind, go for the little finger, he will release, if he does not, a kneel to his groin will do the trick. Run.</span><br><br><strong>Torso attack.</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Use the tip of your toes and give a kick to his groin. As you kick, you will move backwards, this should prevent him from touching you, even if you miss. Run.</span><br><br>And oh yeah, as you run, SHOUT! That will create attention for anyone in the vincinity to come to your aid.<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 worth</span></strong><br><br>[This message has been edited by Callan (edited 10 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>maya... I think that any of those two would be better than nothing....How effective they are depends on how effective you are in the situation...  No use carrying one around when you know that you can't get it out in time right?<br><br>AS for Mr Critics reply...well don't listen to him maya (psst-it's kaiser again)...<br><br>He ssays that it depends on the situation...but i say he is wrong&gt;  I say it depends on your effectiveness with what you are using.  You can be holding a gun and still get raped.<br><br>Why do I say he is wrong?...let me give you an example....<br><br>For instance, I can use the everyday fork as a weapon to poke out Mr Critic's eyes or guts ...and at the end of the day, eat with the fork...all in all, a most effective use of the fork as a self-defence tool and as a household utensil.<br><br>Let's say you use your hands.  You can punch him, grab him, poke him, jab him, slap him, palm strike him, chop him, knuckle him, thumb him, backhand him, scratch him, ......and that's just using your hands....<br><br>and then after which you can pick him up and dump him into the rubbish bin....no spray needed.<br><br>Like I said, depends on how effective you are with what you have.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Generally, I would still like to think that Singapore is safe enough and there is no need for women to carry whistles and chilli sprays etc. But I dun want to be proved wrong though. I feel that the most important thing is still to steer clear of dark and isolated places. Wherever u go, make sure there r other people around u. At least make sure u can get to a crowded place fast. When going home late, it is best to get somebody to send u home, or to ask a family member to pick you up. Dun give them any chance at all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the most effective defence against a rapist would be to pretend to be submissive and then bite of his penis when you get the chance. (yesh, lure him into putting it in ya mouth)<br><br>MAKE SURE THE WHOLE THING COMES OFF.<br><br>After all these people deserve no mercy.<br><br>You achieve 4 things:<br><br>1) he cant rape you anymore.<br><br>2) he'd be in pain so you can run far far away.<br><br>3) his penis is dismembered so he will have to go hospital and the police can nab him from there.<br><br>4) even if you are attacked by more than 1 person you make it clear to the rest that the man without the dick WILL be apprehended in hospital by the police and he WILL have to admit who raped her.<br><br>Obviously, prevention is better than cure...<br></div>
