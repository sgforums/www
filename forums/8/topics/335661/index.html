              <div class="story_text">I WOULD like to comment on the biased view of private universities in Singapore.
              <p>Many junior college and polytechnic graduates pin all their hopes on getting into a local university, only to be refused a place by all three.</p>
              <p>Hearing of many students with good grades, outstanding co-curricular activity (CCA) performance and good personal character being rejected caused me to question the entry requirements of these universities.</p>
              <p>I understand factors like the vast number of applicants and capped intake every year, but rejection solely due to 'strong competition for places' is just not good enough.</p>
              <p>A polytechnic student who scored below average grades with no outstanding CCA managed to get into National University of Singapore (NUS), it was said thanks to discretionary selection. Her achievement was to have won a beauty pageant.</p>
              <p>This is not a jealous assault as her grades were below average and she had no outstanding achievement. Besides, she did not pursue just any degree but the highly sought-after business degree.</p>
              <p>Private universities are viewed by some as a dumping ground for students rejected by NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University.</p>
              <p>Students try any means to get into a local university because of its prestige. They even do so at the expense of pursuing a degree that does not interest them.</p>
              <p>Questions raised in forums include whether a private degree holder can land the same job as a local degree holder and if private degrees are good enough to get a decent (government) job.</p>
              <p>On top of their unpredictable future, private university students do not get the tuition grant local university students enjoy.</p>
              <p>Private education is already costly, yet no subsidy is given. Won't these students graduate and join the workforce as well? Why is there biased treatment?</p>
              <p>Local university students have more privileges in terms of facilities, transport and campus life. They can buy a concession pass for train and bus travel, but private students cannot. Likewise, private universities have smaller buildings and fewer facilities, which result in a less vibrant campus life.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, private universities model themselves on local universities by organising activities that include sports, performing arts and even community service. CCAs give students more room to explore their interests. Students develop skills that allow them to gain valuable knowledge and insight, which they will find useful in later life.</p>
              <p>I earnestly look forward to a change in the mindset of how private universities are viewed.</p>
