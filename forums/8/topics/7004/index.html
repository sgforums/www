            <div class='col-md body'>(At the risk of infuriating some die hard fans) TCS production really suck.<br><br>Look at their drama serial, for e.g 'Family Matters'. Another boring series on family life. Why the fetish for maids, family quarrels, (yawn)extra-marital affairs?! Again and again we see this on serial after serial; story's the same, only the faces are changed, it leads me to speculate that the producers have imagination on par with mashed potatoes. The new actors especially, suck terribly in their acting. And don't give me the excuse that they are new/raw, if they are, stay off the screen.<br><br>Their so call 'sitcoms' are such a pathetic laughing stock. At 1st, Under one roof was still a credible production. But now, it has degraded itself to levels with those Chinese 'sitcoms'. Their miserly skits could hardly coax a snigger from me, but somehow the 'live' audiences are laughing their heads off at every single line. Did they hire hyenas from the mental institution as the audience? I wonder.<br><br>Whats the big deal with Growing Up? I mean which family(except for SM Lee's)in the 70s<br>speak perfect English to one another?! Not even a hint of realism in the whole show!<br><br>To top things off, TCS artistes(save for some) are a bunch of talentless, characterless, self deceiving brats who will realise that an acting career in singapore is not as glamourous as they thought. No wonder so many of them are leaving.<br><br>Enuff said, gotta load up my Magnum and sleep under it, just in case.</div>

The actors/actresses are at best, believable as living things.<br><br>2. The story is as fresh as preserved mangoes and is so slow moving that I believe I can get more action outta watching my chest hair grow.<br><br>3. One word about the long maned, dog style hairdo actor. I believe he should be imprisoned in the Actors' Dententive Barracks and sentenced to 10,000 hours of reformative acting lessons for his horrendous performance in the show.<br><br>The Ride Home is truly a traumatic experience, and viewer discretion is advised.<br><br>Wonder if I can sue TCS for the emotional distress I suffered....<br><br>[This message has been edited by Axl (edited 21 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Relax,Axl,it wasn't a personal attack on you lah,heheeh.But TCs do produce some good shows like PCK or UOR,but i can say the majority are just poor copies of tried and test formulas taken from overseas,seems they never learn from their SBC days,does anyone remember there used to be this chinese serial when Chen Xiuhuan played an alien???what a rip off of ET,somemore the alien's name sound similar to ET some more <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">PP</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wu Suo Nan Yang is nice leh,quite a good show and shows how our forefathers came to Singapore and made it as it is today,but some are really crap,i think TCS should stick to their strengths like contemporary shows instead of some sci fi or period drama serials  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">))</div>
