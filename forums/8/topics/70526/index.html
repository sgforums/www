            <div class='col-md body'>It was first day of the mid-year exams,<br>therefore<br>i finished school a little earlier, i called<br>him,<br>:Hey, i finished school earlier today, would you<br>come by and pick me up?<br>:Alright, give me 5 minutes.<br>:5 minutes? But my school is just beside your<br>house.<br>:I need to get ready.<br>:Alright, make it fast then.<br>2pm in the afternoon, the sun is extremely hot,<br>I stood under a shaded tree and fan myself.<br>Although it doesn't make much of a difference,<br>it was better that I fanned.<br>5 minutes have passed, he's still not shown up,<br>I was a lil' unhappy while looking at my watch.<br>10 minutes and he's still not here....couldn't<br>be that he was met with an accident?<br>15 minutes passed, he finally shown up.<br>:Why are you so late?<br>He wasn't even a lil' bothered: Nahz, was<br>watching TV.<br>:What?! TV?! Why don't you sleep, bathe and eat<br>before you come down then?<br>I haven't got anything else to say for that,<br>didn't take the helmet he handed me but stood<br>there and stared at him.<br>:Sorry.<br>This was the first time he said sorry to me...<br>He is an egoistical person all along and has<br>never once apologised to a girl.<br>I looked at him, Alright, took the helmet and<br>let him sent me home.<br>He is always acting like this, no explanations,<br>no friction, no quarrels.<br>The only thing he does is to apologise. To me,<br>somethings can't be settled with a sorry.<br>I would never go on asking after everytime he<br>apologises.<br>He told me, that was the first time he said<br>sorry to a girl.<br>Although it take courage to admit mistakes, he<br>never once correct his mistakes.<br>Saying sorry became a word to shut me up<br>instead.<br>Tears flowed down my cheek on the 59th time he<br>apologised.<br>I dropped my head: you don't ever need to say<br>sorry to me again.<br>If you can never change, th en don't let me keep<br>giving you chances again and again hoping and<br>believing that you would change each time.<br>He held me lightly, and said the 60th sorry.<br>Even then, he did not change, and there was no<br>explanation whatsoever.<br>I began to worry if there was something he was<br>keeping from me.<br>:What's wrong with you these few days?<br>:Nothing.<br>:Then why are you acting so strange?<br>:I am not.<br>:What can you say other than this answer?<br>o you know I'm very woried, very insecure,<br>do you treat me as your girlfriend?<br>:I'm sorry...<br>:I don't want to hear you say sorry again.<br>I put down the phone and he did not call back.<br>He doesn't even care about me. Maybe we<br>should....break up.<br>....this was the 99th time he said sorry...<br>From that day onwards, I never once called me or<br>went to look for him.<br>Sometimes I get an anonymous phonecall<br>but everytime I said hello, it was dead, i think<br>it's a call from him, but why don't he speak up?<br>After one month have passed, I couldn't contain<br>the feelings I still have for him anymore and<br>went to his school to find him.<br>I went outside his classroom and looked around,<br>but there was no sign of him.<br>:excuse me, is XOXO here today?<br>:I'm afraid he already stopped schooling.<br>:Huh? Why? When was that?<br>:He hasn't been in school for a month already.<br>:Oh erms...thanks.<br>One month....not in school for one month...why<br>is that so? I stumbled home.<br>Called his hp: Sorry the caller is currently<br>unavailable, please leave your message after the<br>tone....<br>I put down the phone, and called his house next,<br>but there was no answer.<br>How can it be? The whole family migrated?<br>It seems as though he has already disappeared<br>from the face on the earth leaving not even a<br>single trace.<br>I couldn't find him....just as I was feeling<br>distraughted, the phone suddenly sounded, it was<br>my friend.<br>He was one of his brothers and also my good<br>friend.<br>:Hey, what have you been doing? XOXO is in<br>hospital.<br>:REALLY? WHAT HAPPENED?<br>:Oh he is in ZZ hospital, the one you stayed in<br>last time.<br>:I'll be right there.<br>I used the fastest speed my legs could carry and<br>when I reached the hospital I saw that his<br>parents were already there.<br>I asked them for the room number and flew across<br>the hall.<br>He was lying on bed, looking at me, not saying a<br>word, not moving a muscle,<br>:Hey, what happened to you? Why didn't you<br>contact me?<br>He did not answer, and used the same stare on me<br>again.<br>:Come on answer me...why don't you speak?<br>A tear flowed down the side of his eye, and it<br>looked as though he used the greatest amount of<br>strength that he could master to say...<br>:I'm...sorry...<br>After that, his eyes went shut.<br>:Hey, don't fool around alright...why say sorry<br>to me?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">on't say sorry to me....please wake<br>up....answer me please.<br>I wept and fell down on the side of his bed,<br>pulling his shirt I cried out..<br>:Why do you have to apologise? Why don't you<br>give<br>me an explanation instead?<br>:I won't forgive you, wake up, saying sorry is<br>no<br>use...<br>:If you don't wake up I'll never ever forgive<br>you in this lifetime, please I beg of you..open your<br>eyes.....<br>That was the 100th sorry<br>A group of medical staff, doctors, nurses pulled<br>me away and tried to revive him. I had no<br>strength to stand up...<br>My mind was a blank.... my eyes could only see a<br>sea of black.<br>He did not leave this world...I merely lost the<br>chance to touch him anymore.<br>But he would appear in my dreams sometimes,<br>telling me how he was doing.<br>He's still accompaning me, still alive, in my<br>heart would still laugh at my silliness, and call me<br>his darling....just that...he never apologise to<br>me anymore.<br>After a month, his mom came to look for me, and<br>gave me a box...inside was<br>a 100 photographs, everyone had a story behind<br>them..the reasons why he made me angry.<br>The first time, my dear, I did not purposely<br>arrive late to pick you up.<br>I know this excuse is really lame, but I didn't<br>have the heart to tell you the truth then,<br>before I stepped out of the house, I felt a pain<br>in my chest, but I still made it a point to meet<br>you, please forgive me?<br>The second time, my dear, I...<br>The third time, my dear, I...<br>The 100th time, my dear, I didn't mean to leave<br>you alone in this world,<br>It had to be so because God did not give me the<br>chance to say I Love You for this lifetime of<br>mine, and to put the ring on your finger....<br>You are the first girl I apologised to.<br>And also the first girl I want to be with for<br>the rest of my life...<br>Forgive me for not able to bring you happiness<br>but I have thus become your angel, always<br>looking out for you...<br>Looking at you while you find your<br>happiness...promise me...don't shed a tear...<br>I don't want to see you weep like this for me, I<br>Love You ~XOXO<br>How can I not cry? What you said was just too<br>impossible.<br>The last photograph was of him in the hospital,<br>Although he was skinny, the smile on his face<br>was bright as ever.<br>His face was white and yet he tried his best to<br>give his last smile on the last photo, the 100th.<br>At the time when he needed me the most, I wasn't<br>with him.<br>:I'm sorry.<br>I held the photo tightly and cried for us.....<br><br>I guess everything comes with a reason...but<br>what's the point of driving it out of someone if<br>it's something you don't want to hear in the<br>first place? "I want the truth" ---so easy to<br>say but so difficult to accept</div>
