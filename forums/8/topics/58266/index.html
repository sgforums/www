            <div class='col-md body'>GEEK is the new chic.<br><br>Before, gadgets such as PDAs and digital cameras were considered toys for the boys. Today, gadgets are flaunted and worn by fashionistas like designer shoes.<br><br>Mobiles phones are worn around the neck, digital music players are strapped to the arm, and wireless earpieces for phones are stuck full-time in the ear, giving new meaning to the phrase 'always on'.<br><br>Gadget makers have seen this coming for quite a while. Almost every major electronics company has a product on the shelves aimed specifically at the trendy.<br><br>Technology giants such as Philips and Siemens have gone one step further with entire gadget lines designed specifically for wearing rather than just carrying around.<br><br>Philips' line of Key Ring audio players and digital cameras are designed to be the size of key chains and worn around the neck.<br><br>Siemens takes that concept further with its Xelibri line of wearable mobile phones. Designed to be worn around the neck or clipped to lapel or handbag, the Xelibri line will offer new models for each season much like big fashion houses such as Prada.<br><br>'Today, most people buy the mobile phone that looks the best, and many have a habit of showing it off,' said Mr George Appling, president of Xelibri division.<br><br>'This shows that mobile phones are potential fashion accessories like watches, handbags and shoes. We envisage the scenario where people will own many fashion accessory phones and wear the one that matches their mood, the occasion or their attire.'<br><br>Mr Gautam Kiyawat, Philips' regional marketing and business director of audio and video products, agreed that gadgets are becoming important fashion statements for the tech savvy.<br><br>'These devices are no more just functional products,' he said. 'They are becoming more and more a means of personal expression. Design and materials are becoming more important.'<br><br>Many other big players in the gadget game are not far behind with their own take on wearable technology.<br><br>For example, Motorola showcased its Offspring line of wearable gadgets earlier this year.<br><br>Still in its prototype phase, the line features items such as a watch/PDA, sunglasses with built-in heads-up display and a thumb-sized digital camera that can be clipped to one's collar. All are wirelessly linked to each other.<br><br>The prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology even has a research department dedicated solely to research on wearable technology, with its successful projects (like a full-function PC that looks like a school backpack) being sold by its spin-off company, Charmed Technology.<br><br>And fashion tech junkies such as sales manager Regina Lee, 29, can't wait for more of these wearable gizmos to hit the shelves.<br><br>'Gadgets like phones and cameras used to be so big and blockish looking,' said Miss Lee, who wears her Nokia phone and Canon Ixus digital camera around her neck when she goes to parties. 'Now they are petite and have curves and colours. And you know how girls like to mix and match accessories.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>WEAR IT<br><br>CREATIVE MUVO NX<br><br>It may weigh next to nothing, but the MuVo NX is a heavyweight when it comes to features. Able to hold up to eight hours of music as well as other digital files like photos and documents, it also comes with two different coloured body casings to match your wardrobe.<br><br>Price: S$349 (256MB)<br><br>PHILIPS KEY RING<br>MP3 PLAYER AND DIGITAL CAMERA<br><br>To the untrained eye, they look like quirky pendants that go with almost any Saturday night outfit. But hiding under their thumb-sized casings are an MP3 audio player and a digital camera. The digital camera has enough memory to hold hundreds of pictures, while the MP3 player can be controlled using buttons sewn into its lanyard.<br><br>Price: $249 (128MB)<br><br>SIEMENS XELIBRI 3<br><br>FUNCTIONAL yet fabulous, this mobile phone-cum-fashion piece does not have a number pad - all calls are voice activated. Just say a name, and Xelibri dials it for you. It is the first pendant phone designed with an antenna and earpiece integrated into its necklace.<br><br>Price: $768<br><br>NOKIA HDW-2 WIRELESS HEADSET<br><br>THIS is one earpiece you might never want to take off. Why would you, when you can answer calls with just a tap of a button on the headset? And since it works on wireless technology, you can answer calls even when your phone is stashed away in your purse or backpack.<br><br>Price: $180<br><br>CANON IXUS I<br><br>The Ixus i cameras looks so good, it could take the place of your pendant. Weighing only 100g, this all-metal Canon is one of the smallest 4 megapixel cameras. Besides taking high-resolution pictures, it can also record 180-second video clips with sound.<br><br>Price: (available end-October)<br><br>BOSE QUIETCOMFORT 2<br><br>ired of having your favourite classical piece being interrupted by the roar of traffic noise or a wailing baby on the MRT? The Bose QuietComfort 2 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones features technology that cuts down environmental noise so that you can cocoon yourself in nothing but your own music. It has a fold-flat feature which allows you to slip it very snugly into a bag.<br><br>Price: $560<br><br>CASIO PRO-TREK WATCH<br><br>Instead of a watch, think of the Pro-Trek as a weather station on your wrist. Not only does it have a thermometer, barometer (for telling air pressure) and altimeter (for telling altitude) packed into its rugged frame, it is solar powered to boot.<br><br>Price: $350-$380<br><br>http://it.asia1.com.sg/newsdaily/news004_20030929.html<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
