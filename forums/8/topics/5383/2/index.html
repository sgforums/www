            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, analysis....<br><br>I would have to say that at her age, she's probably still quite insecure about herself.  I don't think that it is really cockiness on her part so much as just trying to make Spy feel/know that there is competition for her...maybe in hopes that Spy will pick up the pace and speed it up a bit and not be so suaku....:-)<br><br>Mainly, I think that she's still looking for assurance that guys do like her.  It doesn't matter whether the girl is pretty or not, as they all feel this way...If she bothers to look pretty, then there is a high chance, for someone her age, that she IS insecure about herself...and hoepfully by telling u about the competition, it would make u work harder for her...treat her better...make her feel more like princess  and not be slack....ultimately to boost her self-esteem...maybe.<br><br>As for the grading system that she gave u Spy, most likely she is telling the other guys the same thing, and also is looking to see which one will treat her better...Girls are like this man...especailly at that age...no offence Atax...:-)<br><br>Or maybe they don't exist at all, and she's telling u this because she thinks u really are cute and afraid that u find her not interesting or pretty enough to chase after the first date...so must add competition....right?<br><br>:-)<br><br>sOmthing to keep in mind.</div>

IMHO, the main thg in a relationship is how you guys feel abt each other, practicality wld come later. so relax, sit back and enjoy your time w this "chiobu". dont take it so seriously cos if you do can you imagine what she'll be telling her frens?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>haiyah, see lah. you're prolly scaring her away by coming on too strong. thk it's best you relaxed, and let her take the initiative for awhile? a common rule most of my frens (guys AND gers) live by when chasing their OODs: they wld call the OOD for a week (ie take the initiative but only if the OOD is receptive to this), be very sweet, pg bomb alot. then after a wk, they stop calling/pging. not acting dao but simply stop taking the initiative. how the OOD reacts to this sudden "coldness" wld show how she/he feels. trust me, it works. it's a great gauge of how your OOD feels and how you shld proceed w your "relationship", if you can call it tt.<br><br>but at the end of the day, you'll know best. you yourself wld be the best judge of what's happening. of course, you can always lie to yourself and be "optimistic" but occasionally in your life, you have to be brutally frank. being idealistic and optimistic is fine, cos it prevents you frm becoming sucidal, but your feet must always stay firmly rooted to the grd. be realistic. you shld be able to tell how she feels for you. dont let your "desire" and "love" for her cloud your judgment until you only see what you want to see... at times like this, it's best to be cynical and have a backup plan in case you fail.<br><br>but, hell, you're 16! which actually makes you older than me... why get so worked up over it? if you get her, you get her. if not, it's her loss. we have our whole lives waiting for us, why be bothered w inane stuff like this? it may seem like a matter of life and death now but ten years down the ride, will you even remm this? will you even remm her? relax and go along for the rd. if you succeed, gd for you; if you fail, just chalk it up to exp. no pt brooding over crap like this.<br><br>[This message has been edited by ataraxia (edited 15 November 1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seems I am lagging behind in this forum ! Been too busy with projects and outings Hehe... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>My opinion would have to be different from everyone else's...I am not here to dispense with "good" advice on how to date and chase a 15/16 year old girl ? No way...!<br><br>Let me just state that at 16, I was still blissfully clueless about girls in general, and saw them as just another human being. I never worried about dates, gf, ratings and such stuff ! Probably my school was a very kiasu one that really stressed on studies and doing well, or maybe it was the post-80s so I didn't really fit in ? I don't know....<br><br>All I am saying is...you're a little too young to go for such dates and have such thoughts. The girl (whom u said likes the dancing arcade game) sounds a little Ah Lian to me (no offense)...but saying all that to a guy shows that she is rather experienced in this area and wishes to show it too. Obviously she realises she has something to flaunt and chooses to flaunt it. It's sad but I think irc and icq are causing youngsters to start dating and falling in "love" much too young. As a result, their perceptions get clouded and they get confused. These days, even 12 year-olds know about sex and condoms etc...it's a scary world !<br><br>So just concentrate on your O Levels first and leave the girl alone. Be friends with her if you wish but don't think too far. It's the media hype which makes us think this way...and I may be a victim too for all you know ! Still, I try to keep my head on my shoulders and so far have not "stumbled" into a BGR yet...<br><br>Cheers !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm, it's true that nowadays, us "youngsters" are growing up faster. but we're not maturing at tt same rate. we're exposed to many more new thgs, new cultures, new lifestyles but despite all this exposure, have we really "grown up"? i thk not.<br><br>yes, now kids as 'young' as 12 know abt condoms and sex, but, how much do they know? all they have are vague abstract ideas of what these adult-sounding words are, most dont know the real deal. IMHO, sgrean teenagers are definitely lacking in sex edu. most of them dont know anythg! they just thk it's "cool", it's "hip", i'm matured enuff to do anythg i want.... what a load of bull! i thk tt sex edu shld start young. in p sch maybe? so kids dont thk it's some mysterious taboo topic tt they HAVE to explore to be "adult". and by edu i dont mean those crappy christian bull abt abortion/pre-marital sex/etc. tt's just blatant brainwashing. schs shld offer info objectively, in as clear a manner as possible, instead of having teachers mumbling to themselves or telling the kids to read the book. sex edu in sg is severely lacking, the govt definitely has to do smethg abt it..</div>
