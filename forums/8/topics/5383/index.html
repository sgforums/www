            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Mr. Spy:<br><br>Don't get discourage yet!  Continue on with your foot on the gas pedal, not on the brake pedal.<br><br>First, the date should actually belongs to you and her only; meaning, don't bring friends along!  How are u gonna talk to her in  private or do shit (I mean good thing) with the presence of her friend and yours?  Don't u think that the first time her friend and yours already made u looked stupid enough?  What gives that you wanna ask your friend and hers out on the second date to Sentosa?  I don't mean to sound rude here, but just wanna smarten u up a bit! For your own good, ok!<br><br>Nevertheless, you are still doing a good job, way way better than me when I was 16. So, you are not as wimpy as you think!  It's just that you need a little refinement in your "chasing" skills.  After some improvement, you would be one hell of a pro! HehHeh!<br><br>Also, further to ur questions, I suggest roses on your second date.  Depends on the girl, I think most girls don't have problems with roses.  That's what I gave to my future wife when we were first going out on our second? ot third? date.  I can't even remember now, hahaha!.  Her impression of me got even better after I gave her the roses. So I hope it works for you too!<br><br>Let us know your progress!  Keep up the good job!<br><br>Good Luck!  All the best!<br><br>PS:  Remember to look at her when u are talking to her.  I don't mean stare but look natural.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Come on SPY!<br>If you are the one from HWZ,then you don't seems to be those type of timid person. Your new date with her is going to Sentosa. Just go with her ONLY. Ask her, if she agrees, then there is this high possibility that she likes you too. Just be natural. No point in read those books. If you have watch enough movies, high chances they will feel. Just take it as a trip you would go with your friends. Go and enjoy yourself! Don't think so much. Don't try to inmpress her too much. That might cause negative effect.<br><br>Just want to share something with you. Got into this situation before many years back when I'm still 16. A good friend of mine WAS approach by this girl wanted to know him. So she left her number with him. He's not interested at all, so I take over the number and talk to her on the phone for hrs that night, pretending to be my friend. But the next day when I called her, I told her I'm not my friend, but we still continue to talk. We arranged to meet up on Sat, each of us bring along a friend. It's a horrible one. She's not so chio and worst, she can just spot any handsome guys and approach him and give him her number!!!! This is what we call "chee hong"? Anyway, after the date, we NEVER talk to each other again. She hated me probably, finding me fat and ugly. but somehow my friend and her friend ended up together!!!!!! hahahahahha.... After that lotsa things happened! But spare everyone the details!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>So for you, just be yourself. If she is willing to go out with you ONLY, then there is this possibility that she DO likes you and you might just stand a high chance. Remember, don't ruin this one this time. My first actually date with the person I like also ended like what happened to yours, only slightly better. She called me out for the first time(probably she can't find anyone else to go out with coz it's LNY). Went down to Marina, being ages since I last go, so dunno where to go. So ended just move from places to places. So happened that I'm realy really broke then, so dun even have money to treat her to a decent dessert. We went down to NYDC at Suntec. Then we just spend some time roaming around there, then went home. I really regret not sending her home.<br><br>Ops, just to remind you, better send her home. Even if she says it's okie not to, you BETTER send her home. Unless she really insist you don't do that for this or that reasons, then don't push too much. If not you better do else .............;P<br><br>------------------<br>why, bishamon? why bish?<br>coz he's God of War!!<br>But he's a peacelover! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

And i think that u shouldn't ask ur friends along either....<br><br>I took a date to Sentosa once...I don't really think that it's a smart choice maily because it gets bporing there very fast...although it might seem romantic....What seems like hours to u will only have been ten minutes...It's like that, so she might get bored very quickly....Just my opinion...<br><br>Probably better to bring her somewhere where u can talk to her, but if the talking doesn't go well, u can still say, "Hey!, I just thought of something...do u feel like doing....."<br><br>U see what I mean?  Tehn u won't have to worry so much about what u want to say.  It's like a security/backup plan....Once u know there's a backup plan, u surely will be a little more comfortable instead of worrying about whether ur conversation with her is any good....<br><br>Just an opinion..<br><br>Hope it turns out well...<br><br>Ps-and oh yeah, I suggest u don't let her know u asked Ataraxia out after ur GF told u Yes.....:-)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So glad that you finally met the gals of your dreams, I am sure alot of guys out there is green with envy after reading it. Although it sounds bad having additional friend there but in a way, it helps to break the ice. Let's say that she is too shy to chat with you....then the conversation sort of becomes one-sided with you running out of topic. Having a friend there means that she has the option to chat with someone she knows well enough and thus creates unnecessary silence. I thought things work pretty well and you should be looking eagerly to your date with her at Sentosa. Did she mention anything about her opinion whether she prefers to go out on a date or as a double date?? At least she expressed her opinion that you are still likable after the first meeting and don't mind going out with you again...so no worries. No matter how people always say that it is old fashioned to give flowers, gals still love it unless they are allegic to them. Just don't overwhelm her by giving a big and expensive bouquet, something simple will do. Maybe one flower wrap elaborately with a message?? Just don't pressurised her to be your gf, just let it flow and let her and you enjoy the date. Most importantly, be yourself cos gals have this radar that can detect whether you are trying to be someone else. So...be sincere in your thoughts and actions. No use petending to be someone else and bluff your way thru. Better for her to accept you for what you are, imagine if she knows the truth and found out that you have been bluffing her all these while. All the best!!!<br><br>------------------<br>Godfrey AKA Lightningbolt<br></div>

Worse still, start trying to decipher hidden meanings in her actions or words, because it's highly likely that there aren't any! Enjoy yourself, ask her out again, just be relaxed.

Don't forget!  Not until the fourth or fifth date, I asked if I can give her kiss on the forehead and cheek. So, remember to ask before you kiss her.  It's preferable that you kiss her on the forhead or cheek before moving on the lips until a few dates later.  So, you won't be perceived as a wolf. HAHAHA!  Don't presume that she would accept your kiss the first time!  So, ask, something like, "Can I give u a kiss on the forehead? or cheek?"  If she says yes, go ahead and kiss her on the forehead or cheek and nothing else.<br><br>Good luck, buddy!</div>
