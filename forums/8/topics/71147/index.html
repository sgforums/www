            <div class='col-md body'>Do you have a burning science question? In our weekly series, we get experts to help unravel the mysteries of the universe. Send your questions to stlocal@sph.com.sg<br><br>IS IT true that not all years that are divisible by four are leap years?<br><br>A LOT of people know leap years are meant to account for the fact that the Earth's journey around the Sun takes 365 1/4 days.<br><br>Throw in an extra day every four years and the calendar ought to work.<br><br>However, the monks and astronomers who fretted over such things many centuries ago calculated that the Earth's trip actually takes a few minutes under 365 1/4 days.<br><br>So, to keep the calendar honest, the church decreed late in the 16th century that years ending in 00 would not be leap years, unless they were divisible by 400.<br><br>Thus, 1600 and 2000 were leap years, but 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not.<br><br>This means the calendar year is 365 days long, unless the year is exactly divisible by four, in which case an extra day is added to February to make the year 366 days long.<br><br>The reason for these rules is to bring the average length of the calendar year in line with the length of the Earth's orbit around the Sun, so the seasons always occur during the same months each year.<br><br>In 45 BC, Julius Caesar established the Julian calendar, which was used in the West until 1582. Here, each year contained 12 months and there were an average of 365 1/4 days in a year.<br><br>This was achieved by having three years containing 365 days and one year containing 366 days. The leap years were not inserted correctly until AD 8.<br><br>However, the tropical year, which follows the cycle of the seasons, lasts 365.24219 days.<br><br>The discrepancy between the actual length of the year - 365.24219 days - and the adopted length of 365 1/4 days may not seem important, but over hundreds of years the difference becomes obvious, and the seasons, which depend on the date in the tropical year, were getting progressively 'out of sync' with the calendar date.<br><br>In 1582, Pope Gregory XIII instituted the Gregorian calendar, which has been used since.<br><br>The change from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian involved the change of the simple rule for leap years to the more complex one in which century years should be leap years only if they are divisible by 400.<br><br>The net effect is to make the adopted average length of the year 365.2425 days. The difference between this and the true length will not have a serious effect for many thousands of years.<br><br>The error amounts to about three days in 10,000 years.<br><br>The Gregorian calendar also stipulated that the year should start on Jan 1.<br><br>Catholic countries adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1582, doing so by eliminating 10 days. They went from Oct 4 to Oct 15 that year.<br><br>In non-Catholic countries, the change was made later. Britain and its colonies, for instance, made the change only in 1752. They went from Sept 2 to Sept 14 that year.<br><br>Mr Joseph Yeoh, astronomy enthusiast<br>Dr Toh Kok Aun and Dr R.
