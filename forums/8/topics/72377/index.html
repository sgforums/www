            <div class='col-md body'><strong>By Carl Skadian </strong><br><br><img src="http://images.google.com.sg/images?q=tbn:ZYndPQOn96EJ:www.reger24.de/fundstuecke/intel-inside-idiot-outside.jpg"><br><br>FINALLY, Microsoft has announced that it will do something about the holes in its software and the threat of hackers exploiting this to create trouble.<br><br>In an announcement last week, the company said it will release a new version of its Windows XP software which will automatically download and install software patches onto personal computers.<br><br>It is supposed to keep a user's computer virus-free by keeping antivirus patches up to date. It will also include a stronger Internet firewall and new forms of protection against computer viruses.<br><br>It's about time.<br><br>For too long, Microsoft has done little in the area of computer security, which is quite odd when you consider the number of alerts it puts out due to flaws in its software.<br><br>The only other people I can think of who put out products with this many holes are the Swiss - in their cheese.<br><br>A quick check of the software giant's website shows three security update bulletins - two in the 'critical' category and another which is classified as 'important'.<br><br>One update concerns the company's Internet Explorer software, the most dominant Web browser around.<br><br>And that's just over the last month or so.<br><br>This after Mr Bill Gates himself declared more than two years ago that his company would make boosting the security of its software a top priority.<br><br>Since then, viruses such as SQL Slammer, SoBig and MyDoom, to name just a few, have driven network administrators everywhere batty.<br><br>But now, at least, the company seems to be getting tough. I guess it's a case of better late than never.<br><br>The announcement made last week also highlighted something interesting.<br><br>In its report of the announcement, The Washington Post said: 'The upgrade is meant to make it easier for the millions of home computer users who surf the Internet but are not computer-security experts.<br><br>' 'Security is not something most computer users think about unless there is a computer worm or other high-profile threat going around,' said Mr Neil Charney, Microsoft's director of Windows product management.'<br><br>That is the other half of the problem: Computer users who have no clue about what harm they can do and don't listen to constant warnings to update their antivirus software.<br><br>Here's more from The Post's report: ' 'The majority of users don't want to have to worry about changing a lot of settings and taking the enormous amount of time it takes to secure their systems,' said Mr Neel Mehta, a security researcher at Atlanta-based Internet Security Systems. 'This is a far better approach than leaving it up to the end users to secure the operating system.' '<br><br>Yes, he is talking about you - the clueless folks who insist on clicking on virus-laden e-mail attachments disguised as free games or photographs of naked supermodels.<br><br>A majority of the viruses succeeded so wildly because people just couldn't keep their trigger-happy, double-clicking fingers off the mouse.<br><br>Someone pointed out to me that it is unfair to single out users. After all, you can't expect users of washing machines, TVs or cars to know how to fix their machines when they go on the blink.<br><br>That's missing the point. Car drivers don't run their machines into brick walls and I don't suppose anyone washes his pet rocks in washing machines either.<br><br>In the United States and elsewhere, movements are afoot to banish people who spread viruses by either opening attachments they shouldn't, or because they have not updated their protection programs.<br><br>While many reserve most of their bile for those who create viruses, there is growing resentment against those who spread viruses because their computers are not properly patched.<br><br>Letters in some newspapers from those who have been hit by viruses have been forcing meek apologies from those who have clicked on suspicious attachments and started the vicious chain.<br><br>There are even calls for them to be made liable for causing damage to others.<br><br>That might be carrying it a bit too far, but then again, I haven't been hit by one of those malicious worms we're reading about with increasing frequency these days.<br><br>But I wouldn't have a quarrel with the folks at winxpcentral.com who have a decent, though tongue-in-cheek suggestion: Make them wear a shirt that says, 'Yes, I'm the idiot who infected your computer!'<br></div>
