Thats all I can say. Maybe you 2 dated before you 2 had a chance to get to know each other better before deciding to date? It occurs for many couples and both side are have responsibilities towards the relationship between themselves. It takes 2 to make it work, not 1 loh.<br><br>If you found it strange why only 1 side is contributing and nth from the other side, you can more or less know this relationship is going nowhere.<br><br>Next time when anyone meets a person he/she likes or feel attracted to, STOP!!!<br><br>Make friends 1st, then get to know that person better. Know much about that person, behaviour, likes and dislikes, patterns, characteristics and traits. THEN decide should the relationship go further than just friendship level to "better friendship" or deeper relationship.</div>

Relationship is never meant to be easy as two people who are very different are to walk down the same path hand in hand. Neverthless time will tell if she's the one for you. Maybe you should try having a face to face talk in a peaceful manner and try to peace things out will with her. Then try to give in to each other.</div>
