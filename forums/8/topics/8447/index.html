            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Selena,<br><br>I fell in love with Kevin Kern's "Sundial Dreams" and "Paper Moon" in his "Enchanted Garden" album, and I have the other three until the one called "In my Life". I loved his music, touched with love and romance.. I used to have my ex-gf lying by my side on the  couch and we listened to it... It was a very nice feeling.... Does he have any new albums lately? Can come back to SG and get it...<br><br>Yukie's albums are good as well, my favourite one is the all-piano version entitled Virgin, which is pieces played on grand piano. For good nice and soft music of hers, (which FM933 DJ Fong Hui Shi used to play when she was doing night shift), it is in the 3rd track in her Graceful album....<br><br>yours<br>Prodigal<br></div>

Tracks feature Yuki at her best.. piano, accompanied with light strings backings.<br><br>Its just my opinion, but I feel that Yuki deteriorated after the Virgin album. Perhaps she was just too abstract in her compositions for my liking.<br><br>Try Kostia from the Narada label if you like Yuki's recent solo piano works. Or if you enjoy new age piano (Jim Brickman style) , listen to David Lanz from the Narada label too. Get this album called Return To The Heart.<br><br>.... now back to my VCD.
