Without morality (skillful action, skillful speech, skillful livelihood), you will suffer bad karmic consequences and your life will be in a mess. You will bring others and yourself lots of unnecessary troubles and sufferings.<br><br>Next part is mental development, which consists of skillful energy, skillful concentration, and skillful mindfulness. They are necessary otherwise the mind is scattered and will not be able to focus and develope insights. This part of development can lead to all sorts of amazing meditative experiences like jhanic bliss (I had some of these experiences before) which are more blissful than anything (including sex). They may even lead to development of psychic abilities. However, in Buddhism, concentration is not used as a means to itself or to develope psychic powers, but used for developing Insights and Wisdom. Non-Buddhist meditative practises such as Qi Gong, Yoga, etc, belong to the Shamatha category, which are concentrative practises but by itself does not necessarily lead to insights.<br><br>The last part, Wisdom, is essential to develope insights into Reality, so that one may awaken from the dream of samsara... into to the dream of samsara. Because nirvana is not somewhere far away, it is just samsara rightly seen. Only a quantum leap in perception is required and this time you know it's dream-like and no longer grasps on appearances. All appearances are self-luminous (expressions of pure awareness) and empty (no locality, only dependent co-arising out of conditions), self-arising and self-liberating. You'll be able to see how the nature/characteristics of phenomena as impermanence (arises and passes instantaneously), dukkha (suffering) and not-self (no self to be found anywhere).<br><br>The wisdom section has the two last parts of the path: skillful thought or intention and skillful understanding or wisdom. They are about understanding the truth of your experience and aspire to kindness and wisdom in your thoughts and deeds.<br><br>Mental development and Wisdom part is where Shamatha-Insight practise comes in. Whether it is Theravada (they call it Samatha-Vipassana), Zen or Vajrayana (Shamatha-Vipashyana), they all teach this part to develope wisdom that leads to enlightenment.<br><br>Here, strong mindfulness and clarity is developed which is able to penetrate through our illusions to realise the nature of our reality/experience (self luminous emptiness, 3 dharma seals, etc). For example we always assume and are comfortably identified with our body-mind as our sense of self. In deep meditative clarity, the arising of thoughts are clearly perceived... In such meditation, one will discover that there is really NO observer of these thoughts. The subsequent thoughts that arise after the previous thought are the 'observation' of their predecessors. This is just an example, paraphrasing one of my friend's own realisations and experiences. There are many series of realisations along one's path, what is mentioned is only one of them. In a way it works like the 'regression' concept you mentioned earlier. Insights developed through deep clarity shatters all our delusions and attachment.<br><br>How will people know they are enlightened? When they no longer have doubts about the nature of reality because what is more real than real cannot be doubted. Will an outsider be able to verify? Other enlightened ones have ways to verify, for example Zen Masters have 'checking questions'. Usually enlightened people will know another person's enlightenment just by meeting each other and having a few conversations. For people like me, I can usually make a good guess base on his writings and my guesses are usually quite accurate, though I cannot be sure because I am not enlightened yet.</div>
