The market is believed to be worth at least $50 million, and still growing<br>By Lionel Seah<br>DON'T scoff at the business shirt even if it is worn by only men from nine to five on a normal work week. The starched apparel does a good, brisk trade here.<br>In just under a week, two homegrown business shirt labels have opened new outlets.<br>Singapore shirt specialist CYC, which was established in 1935, opened its second custom-made boutique over the weekend at Republic Plaza 2.<br>Meanwhile, newcomer Raoul, a month-old new label from high-fashion retailer FJ Benjamin, will also open its second outlet at Hitachi Towers tomorrow.<br>In addition, French label Alain Figaret is on the lookout for a location for its third outlet along the Orchard Road belt.<br>Ms Fong Loo Fern, the managing director of CYC, says: 'Men here don't wear suits. So shirts are one of the most important items in a man's wardrobe in terms of appearance. And men do invest in well-made ones.'<br>At CYC, which shifted its focus from selling mass-produced shirts to custom-made ones in 1994, more than 1,000 pieces of men's tailored shirts are sold a month.<br>Each shirt, which can take up to a week to produce, is priced from $75 onwards.<br>Customers choose from more than 1,000 kinds of fabrics, 60 different collars and 10 different cuffs at the Raffles Hotel Arcade and Republic Plaza 2 branches.<br>Ms Fong declined to comment on annual turnover, and would only say it is 'in the millions' and that it has grown at least 10 per cent since 2000.<br>She is confident the market, believed by insiders to be worth at least $50 million a year, will expand.<br>Ms Nancy Goh, the retail manager for Alain Figaret, agrees, adding that the brand has been experiencing double digit growth in annual turnover since its launch here in 1996.<br>Figaret shirts are priced between $169 and $189.<br>Its two boutiques at Millenia Walk and City Link Mall get about 70 male customers a week each, and each buys, on average, three shirts at one go.<br>Male customers are also getting much younger.<br>Where they used to be at least 25 years and above in 1996, 18- to 25-year-olds now form about five per cent of the regular male clientele for CYC and Figaret.<br>Mr Douglas Benjamin, CEO of FJ Benjamin and the man behind the Raoul label launched last month at Millenia Walk, adds: 'There is a gap in the market for well-made, fashionable business shirts at affordable prices.<br>'And this is what men want - especially the well-read and fashionable ones who are in their first jobs.'<br>Raoul, which aims to appeal to top executives and first-timers alike, seems to have identified that niche in the business shirt market.<br>Its 800-sq ft Millenia Walk boutique gets about 210 customers a week who buy between one and four shirts. These are priced between $59 and $109.<br>After opening Raoul at Hitachi Towers, FJ Benjamin intends to open two more within the next eight to nine months.<br>Guess there's no business like shirt business.<br><br>Seams like a good buy<br>PRICE can be a good indicator of a good shirt. But it should not be the deciding factor. Mr Ronnie Tang, the master tailor at Anson Tailor, offers some pointers.<br>Â•  Plastic buttons scream 'cheap', while mother-of-pearl or shell buttons are must-haves.<br>Â•  The more stitches a seam has, the more durable the shirt will be. The rule of thumb is that a good shirt should have between 20 to 35 stitches per inch.<br>Â•  Good shirts have raised or French seams on parts of the shirt that are subject to wear and tear like the cuffs. A raised seam sews two pieces of material together. The joined interface is turned over and sewn again on top. This procedure is expensive but makes the seam very durable.<br>Â•  Prints, checks and stripes on patterned shirts should match where the shoulder joins the sleeve. Otherwise, reject them.<br>Â•  A generous amount of material should be used for a shirt. The back should be cut longer than the front. When the wearer bends over, the shirt will not slip out from the back.<br>Â•  A good shirt should have two pleats at the back. These allow for movement, like driving and waving the arms without restriction.<br>Â•  There should be several pleats where the sleeve meets the cuff. In addition, a small button above the cuff prevents the sleeve from opening up.<br>Â•  A split yoke in the middle of the shoulder blade area is a sign of an expensive shirt. As people have shoulders of different sizes, a split yoke is used to adjust to different builds.<br><br>Copyright @ 2002 Singapore Press Holdings. All rights reserved.<br><br></div>
