              <p>i have no problems with her english, because seriously,</p>
              <p>i) how many of those singaporeans who criticise her can speak good english?</p>
              <p>ii) on the Miss Universe stage with tens of millions or more of people watching you, the pressure is there. I'm sure in normal situation, she can speak well. Must be due to butterflies in the stomach at that moment.</p>
              <p>iii) speaking her kind of english standard is WAY better than BANANAS, white-washed idiots and ang-moh wannabes, like most of our local channel 5 actresses and english radio stations.....neither there nor here.</p>
              <p>HOWEVER, the only problem i have with our choice of Miss Singapore......is that we always send average-looking girls to represent us, which is a letdown.</p>
              <p>i've seen way prettier chicks than the F1 grid girls (btw, they're not that pretty), but the thing is these pretty chicks always don't wanna apply for Miss Singapore / Universe.</p>
              <p>i propose that in the next Miss Universe competition (2010), we either send a lady who looks like the one below, or don't participate at all :</p>
              <p><img src="http://img32.imageshack.us/img32/1880/cc6b9b4e3c73f328b3de05eb.jpg" alt=""></p>

              <p>or we can buy foreign talent into SG and get them to represent SG as well (like our table tennis players).</p>

              <p>I guess the main gripe is that she will be representing
                  Singapore and yet her English is not very understandable by many,
                  therefore she is receiving so much criticism and flak. Some even
                  wonder how did she win when she cannot even speak English, an
                  international languag, well. If she steps out on the stage in front
                  of an international audience, they might just assume that everyone
                  in Singapore speaks poor English and cannot pronounce properly.
                  It's just the same as how many ppl think that Singapore is a part
                  of China.</p>
              <p>But if she were just some pedestrian who was being interviewed,
                  i guess not many ppl would give a hoot to this. Afterall, many

              <p>i have no problems with her english, because seriously,</p>
              <p>i) how many of those singaporeans who criticise her can speak
              good english?</p>
              <p>ii) on the Miss Universe stage with tens of millions or more of
              people watching you, the pressure is there. I'm sure in normal
              situation, she can speak well. Must be due to butterflies in the
              stomach at that moment.</p>
              <p>iii) speaking her kind of english standard is WAY better than
              BANANAS, white-washed idiots and ang-moh wannabes, like most of our
              local channel 5 actresses and english radio stations.....neither
              there nor here.</p>
              <p>HOWEVER, the only problem i have with our choice of Miss
              Singapore......is that we always send average-looking girls to
              represent us, which is a letdown.</p>
              <p>i've seen way prettier chicks than the F1 grid girls (btw,
              they're not that pretty), but the thing is these pretty chicks
              always don't wanna apply for Miss Singapore / Universe.</p>
              <p>i propose that in the next Miss Universe competition (2010), we
              either send a lady who looks like the one below, or don't
              participate at all :</p>
              <p><img src="http://img32.imageshack.us/img32/1880/cc6b9b4e3c73f328b3de05eb.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2249/2362691667_786a1d219f.jpg" alt="" width="348" height="371"></p>

              <p>or we can buy foreign talent into SG and get them to represent
              SG as well (like our table tennis players).</p>
              <p>i don't mind.</p>

              <p>I feel that her english was deemed bad, not because of the accent, more so due to the fact that she was unable to express herself clearly. She kept going "yah....yah...yayapapaya..". I mean, theres absolutely nothing wrong with speaking english with an accent. Germans/French/Americans/Brits/Aussies all speak it differently. Why can't we?</p>
              <p>I don't really expect her to speak with the angmo-ish accents, but at least make the conversation more smooth flowing...But all the colloquial terms being used in such a competition is just inappropriate!</p>
