Movie and TV shows are known to contribute to the violent behaviors of man young children. There are also a lot of people that are 1/2 1/2. In other words watching an emotional movie will be the deciding factor in their selection of religion rather than long considerations.<br><br>True the show is really on teaching bad values or promoting cult teachings. However<br><br><blockquote>As I've mentioned before in another forum, my friends who watched this was touched to the core and rocked by the suffering that jesus went through.<br><br>IMO, all christians, and even non-christians should watch this. By reading the bible alone, it is hard to get a feel of what it was like then. But to have an re-anactment, the actions and what happened then being laid out in front of you, it would help those christians better understand the last days of jesus, and experience the love he has for man. </blockquote>From this guy, the show seems to have a hidden agenda into making more people joining christianity because they are emotionally, not intellectually agitated. To me it seems like brainwashing.</div>

I think it's pretty cool to gather all Christians and non-Christians to go watch such artistic films.. Organising such events doesn't mean they are trying to brainwash u or whatsoever.. Whether u want to be a Christian, it's totally up to u.. And if watching a movie could brainwash you, I really pity u..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>What's wrong wit understanding about other religions? Be it whether ure Christian or not, I think it's good to know about other religions other than stucking up in ur own religious world.. Afterall, we are in Singapore and we ARE a multiracial country...<br><br>Lastly, please respect other ppl's religion by not saying things like "damn, why do those guys have to do such shit.."  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div>
