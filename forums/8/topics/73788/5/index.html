"yeah, i want to come.. but i was afraid people would laugh at me.. it's good this person here "compelled" me.. so that way, i wouldn't be laughed at.." it's hard to judge from the surface, really.. well it doesn't apply to everyone... but in our friends' anxiety to see us 'saved', they wouldnt mind being seen as the 'adamant pusher'..  besides, who are we to judge when we are, ourselves, man who have erred?<br><br>As for HYS, i suppose it must have caused a big hoo-haa bcoz she's a pastor.. i understand her dresses are sponsored.. which means, there wouldn't be much of a choice.. i thot it was a beautiful dress.. wonder if i'll get to don on such an outfit.. *day-dreaming* really, it's the way people think.. the restrictions they place in their heads.. i know one of the solid gold dancers who later became a pastor (and is still spreading the good news)... she didn't accept Christ bcoz she thot Christians were boring people(the way they acted and dressed).. In fact, she didn't go to church until she met with an accident and got paralysed waist down..  I can relate to her feeling of despodence since i dance too..  the feeling of not being able to use your legs anymore would have been worse than death, especially since Solid Gold was so popular in the past.. She eventually went bcoz her friend, some drummer who dressed in leather clothes &lt;-- what was considered cool then, invited her.. Fashion is an opinion, there is no rights/wrongs.. what matters is how one dresses up for the occasion.. we can't expect her to wear long-sleveed turtle neck and long black pants and look all solemn, eh? she's doing great works, sadly, some people just find ways to tear her down.. They only look at the surface of things.. of coz it's easy to just point fingers and judge! anyone can do that.. even a two yr old!</div>

In fact, all CHC members paid for their own tickets. It's free only for non-christian friends that CHC members invited or brought along... because it was meant to be an outreach, an opportunity to let those who are unbelievers know about Christ. And there was no singing, no worship nor any prayer whatever heresy you heard... it was just like an ordinary outing to the movies....</div>
