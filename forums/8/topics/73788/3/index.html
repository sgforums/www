The 83-year-old pope viewed the film on a video monitor in his apartments, the source said.<br><br>Abraham H. Foxman, U.S. director of the Anti-Defamation League, said the group would respect the pope's views<br><br>"The pope has a record and history of sensitivity to the Jewish community and has a clear moral voice and understanding when it comes to anti-Semitism," Foxman said.<br><br>"We hope that Mel Gibson has heard our concerns and those of Christian and Jewish scholars and religious leaders, who expressed unease about the earlier version... and its potential to fuel, rationalize and legitimize anti-Semitism," he said.<br><br>Many Vatican officials have seen the film in its latest form and have rejected charges of anti-Semitism.<br><br>"I loved it and it is not anti-Semitic," Father Augustine Di Noia, a senior official in the Vatican 's doctrinal department, told Reuters on Thursday.<br><br>Asked if the film was as violent as has been reported, Di Noia said: "It not just violent, it's brutal."<br><br>Cardinal Dario Castrillon Hoyos, head of the Vatican department in charge of priests, liked it so much he said in September: "I would gladly trade some of the homilies that I have given about the passion of Christ for even a few of the scenes of his film."<br><br>Gibson paid $20 million to $25 million of his own money to make the movie, but despite his status as a top box office draw and Oscar winner, Hollywood 's major studios shied away from distributing the film due to the controversy surrounding it.<br><br>The film is based on Gospel narratives and contains dialogue only in Latin, Hebrew and Aramaic, the vernacular of ancient Palestine .<br><br>Gibson is a member of a traditionalist Roman Catholic group that rejects some of the reforms of the Second Vatican Council and still uses the old-style Latin Mass<br></div>

Other movies like the 10 commandments etc are kinda slow.</div>
