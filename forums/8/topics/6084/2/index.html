Guys change girls like they change underwear?! hmmm....I think that's a bit too much...Maybe it's true, but I don't think that I can bring myself to a point where I will believe that.  Who knows, maybe if one day I really do meet a guy like that, then I will, but for now, I haven't and I hope I will never... =)<br><br>But I think it's quite sad to even think of such a thing.  When I enter a relationship, there's always total trust and it's up to him to keep it for not...Lots of ppl tells me that trust shld be earn and not given, but I like to give ppl the benefit of the doubt...<br><br>Naive?!<br><br>Redmarble:<br><br>I totally agree w/ you.  If my bf were ever to find someone that is more suitable for him, then I will be happy for him.  I will be hurt, but hurt w/ slowy fade away as time goes by.  As for him, I know that if he decided to change his heart because he found someone more suitable for him, then I know that I am not the right one and that he will be happy w/ this other person.  But if he does decided to change his heart over another girl's look then I have nothing to say, but that I am happy for myself.<br><br>Seifer:<br><br>YES! Talk is cheap!  Action is better than words.  But I think I would be happy already if my bf tells me that he won't change his heart at all.  At least the thought is there, and if he does lie, then at least he cares abt me and make an effort to lie to keep me happy...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it is important that we understand the following: Typically guys are more stimulated by visual images. That is why guys like to watch porno stuffs, ogle at gers etc. Gers, on the other hand, are more resistant to visual images. However, they are more stimulated by emotions. That is why gers like to read romantic novels, watch romantic movies etc.<br>Therefore, it is hardly surprising that guys will stray more when confronted with a stunning date (read visual image). Whereas for gers, they wud tend to yearn more for love and built-up relationship, hence the lesser probability of straying...<br>Of coz there are always exceptions....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would have to disagree about women being less prone to stray....<br><br>In fact, i would go so far as to say that women in todays modern society are more willing to stray than the guys are.  Just from observations and experience from either myself or thru friends, colleagues and what have you....it seems that the modern woem has the ability and "want" to change when and if they feel like it.<br><br>maybe because of the women's rights thing but they no longer feel that they need to be anything anymore...and hence is more socially acceptable than ever for them to do as they please with few consequences...<br><br>poor guys...that's all i have to say...hahahah<br><br>I dun know why we have this conception that it is the majoirty of guys who are like this...I tend to beleif the opposite...or at least it's 50 50....nothing less</div>

Hmmmm...I think gals would be attacted at first, but if a good personality don't go w/ that nice body then what's the point?!  Just like a nice face that doesn't go w/ a nice personality...something is missing there!<br><br>I want to ask all the chio bu's out there...Did the thot that maybe your bf went after you cuz of your look ever crosses your mind?  Or maybe just your friends or whatever...<br><br>I personally truely believe that no one can change their heart because they met someone more sexier or attractive.  Add 30 yrs to that person, they will look like a raisin.  Judging a peson by their looks is so superficial.  If one's bf was to change his heart because of someone else's looks then the girl shld be happy she's no long w/ that dumbdumb!!!<br><br>I know a friend that changed herself because of the bf.  Her bf changed his heart and went for another girl. Why? I have no idea...  And as silly as my friend is, she changed her look just to be like the other girl!!! ARGH! This kinda stuff really irritate me!  No one shld change themselves for someone else, and the fact that she is changing herself to win her ex-bf back is ridiculous! At least, I know I will not for a million years! If that person like me, he shld like me for who I am and nothing more, nothing less...<br><br>Firewire:<br><br>again...you sound really old ah~  =P<br><br>Lastly, I think it's all a test...a test of true love...if it wasn't meant to be then it wasn't...but if it is then it is...<br><br>[This message has been edited by NaiveGirl (edited 09 February 2000).]</div>
