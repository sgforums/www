            <div class='col-md body'>Recently I have seen a entertainment programme in Canada called "Change of Heart"..it is actually a test of a couple where the TV station will let the couple to go for individual dates with another guy/gal just to see if their so called love has reached to a standstill or a relationship that stand thru times...<br><br>But the sad thing is that...thruout the whole show the couple will be saying each other strengths and weaknesses...and it is where they began to spill the beans of each other's habits and secrets...and as the show progresses, the dates they went out too came out to actually tell the audience the 'wonderful experience they had going out with the bf/gf of the couple...Then, penalty showdown...the compere asked the couple if they would stay together or a change of heart...the sad thing is usually the guy's date is gorgeous and sexy...and therefore leading to a change of heart...and the girl though having a cool dude for a date still values the relationship...what a tragedy..and U can really see that the girl is going to cry out in front of the audience for making a fool of herself...<br><br>So now the question..if U were to face the same problem...approached by a sexy and beautiful gal whom u think it is so wonderful...would u have a change of heart or remain faithful?Gals can answer it as well...<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 06 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It all boils down to how much one feels for the other. If they love each other deep enough, no matter what happens, they would stick together. In a relationship, it is bound to undergo alot of tests, within themsevles (eg. characters) or others, like having another person coming into the picture.<br><br>Life is full of challenges, in studies, love, career, raising children. Conquering one stage would be an achievement for some, and it's with these challenges what bring about the motivation in life, for us to strive.<br><br>Think I strayed a bit off the main topic, but I think changing of heart is a challenge, if you are unable to overcome it, it's a failure in your love. You have not learnt how to love someone wholly that your heart wouldn't change for anything else. For me, if I am truly in love with someone, I will not change for anyone else..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa....I would never leave a girl for someone else...never would i play behind her back also...even if she does it to me...i think you already know that..kekeke tok to u so much already u sick of hearing..hahaha<br><br>no lah...from then on, it would really depend on how hard the girl is helping me work for the relationship and what kind of attitude she has towards teh relationship and me...if that level of commitment isn't there on her side then i would seriously consider changing .<br><br>Maybe it doesn't sound fair, but it's most fair for the person suffering in the realtionship right?...  I also realise that tehre will be times throughout the realtionship when a couple goes thru a lag time and are not so close anymore..and lord kknows I've been thru that also...but it never crossed my mind to switch...duriong all this time i was propositioned by 2 girl and both time si declined becasue i belief in making it work out...no matter what.<br><br>But now there must be a stage where you relaise that it's not going anywhere and no matter how hard you try it aint moving because the other person has stopped altogether...and no matter what yousay or how many times you discuss it, it doesn't change a thing...<br><br>hmmm...yes if this is the case i am willing to change...does it sound bad?.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmmmm.....One tough question!!!<br><br>Actually, I personally would never do such a thing.  I believe what goes arnd comes arnd.  But the most important thing is that, I don't think I can bear w/ myself if I know I have hurt someone else, especially someone that I once or still do care abt and that he also care(d) abt me...no matter how bad the situation turns out to be.<br><br>One thing I wanna to know is, is there such thing as mutual love?  If not, then can the relationship stand up to all these problems?<br><br>Plus, I think if someone has a change in heart it doesn't only take a sexy male/female.  The relationship must have other problems that is much more serious.  A person don't just cheat on their love one because he/she sees a sexy and attrative person. I also believe that no one shld blame one another for the relationship falling apart, especially a 3rd party.<br><br>[This message has been edited by NaiveGirl (edited 06 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In my opinion, I would remain faithful because I am looking for a long term happiness. I think that the most important thing in a r/s is that both of them should work at it. Nobody is perfect. We each have our shortfalls and weaknesses. The only reason for most people is that they lost the compatibility after realizing that they were not meant for each other. I suppose that I realize one thing in my life is that I can compromise even the woman is not who I want in my life.<br><br>At the end of the day, one must realize that we must factor out every possible thing out, and ask whether we are still in love with the other person.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe in the saying 'Don't judge a book by its cover'. The only way to know what is inside the book is by reading it from cover to cover. Only then can you know whether the book is your type of reading or not.<br><br>Getting to know people is a similar process. It takes some time before you know whether you click with that person or not. It's not just about good vs bad character but more of whether you have anything in common with the other person. There are a lot of people with good character but you have no idea how to strike up or maintain a conversation with them. Some people click with you but some don't, it's that simple.<br><br>I think to decide on a relationship will take up longer and more careful consideration. If a person can have a change of heart just after a few dates as compared to a long time relationship, I have only one thing to say : he/she is a jerk.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, in that show from canada, the gal doesn't have to cry out loud. in fact if she found out that her bf has ditched her for a better person just becoz the other woman is of better physical characteristics, then she should be happy. well, why? because isn't it better to find out now then later, in marriage for instance, then the pain will be greater and the cut will be more painful in the heart. so actually i think that such a test benefits instead of hurt , in the long run i mean, right?<br>i would take a particular stand here as to whether i will still love my gf or not coz as being said by SEIFER, you will not know until when you really are in that kind of situation. well, i haven't been thru that though... and by the way, a person once said that(sorry i forgot what the law is and by who)males will spread their seed as wide as possible and females will choose the best sperm for reproduction.<br>isn't it? you always see two male cats fighting for a mate with a female cat but not two female fighting to mate with a male...<br><br>------------------<br>Better be sure what you want to do, and do your best once you know what you want to do... ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, personally, a pretty lady would definately catch my attention. But then again, there's nothing wrong with that. If so, why do people dress up and try to look pretty?<br><br>The feeling is merely an admiration of beauty. Most people will still stick to their chosen partner. Cause when choosing their partner, personality is more important. And if really one day your partner decides to forsake you for someone more beautiful or handsome, then be grateful that it happens early. Cause the person really is not worth your devotion. Isn't it?<br><br>Well, what's next? Start looking loh! What else?<br><br>}:-)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>perhaps sometimes when faced with someone who is totally different from someone that you have been seeing, be it whether she is prettier, more humourous etc etc, a lot of times, the new person would seems to be better..<br><br>but rinoa, i think not all the guys in the show have a change of heart rite? there must be others who were able to resist the temptations and remain faithful to their other halves..<br><br>ending on a more optimistic note, the girls know what kind of guys they were going out with, although it must have been a rather public discovery.. sigh..</div>

Better that a building collapses during the building of the first floor rather then the 99th floor. There would be less people getting hurt. E.g KIDS.<br><br>------------------<br>ZeroS</div>
