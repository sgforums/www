            <div class='col-md body'>heyz take it easy....<br><br>supp paper isnt made to fail ppl<br><br>the actual concept is that they take the percentage u gained from the sem paper den calculate the required % u need to get for supp paper to pass the moduel overall.<br><br>so actually as long as u gain that % during supp paper, u will pass the module.<br><br>the % u will not know cuz they wouldnt say....<br><br>so in any case if you do kena "supp paper" *touch wood lah*<br><br>just pull up ur socks and study for it~~<br><br>i confirm u will pass it 1. unless u totaly know nuts abt the module  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ya. Anyway, I have heard of people passing supps. Its not impossible to pass so you should have no problem over there. Its going to be hard, everyone who had been/is in poly know it. I think plus all the ICAs and practicals, projects and presentations, the worst we could get is an E. Big deal, E. I got two of them. As for P's, I got some of them as well. Haha. They are hard, I'm not lying. But I work my arse off to make sure that I passed them and I did. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> If me, a full time slacker can do it, everyone else could too.<br><br>Just tell yourself that you can do it and you eventually will. Work even harder next semester, I bet you can go for a Distinction. Nothing is impossible in the world. Meanwhile, focus on that yucky Met Bio thingy and enjoy life for about a months or so.<br><br>Cheers.<br></div>
