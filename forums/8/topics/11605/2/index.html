True that chinese betrayed chinese more than malay betrayed chinese during WW2..but the reason is that chinese know much more abt the activities of their own people + the majority of anti-japanese people are the chinese. And whenever betrayal occurs in different races, it's not going to be as simple as "u-betrayed-me"...but it's going to be like "your-race-had-betrayed-my-race, &amp;-WE-are-going-to-kill-your-entire-race!!" The outcome? Racial war of course, &amp; that's going to spread like wild-wild fire. No one dare to imagine if that happened in SG today.<br><br>Betrayal by different races occurs during WW2, but it does not lead to big-scale racial war because the japanese are the controller then, &amp; revenge or murder only occurs secretly.<br><br>Another example..everyone knows that the indian hero Gandhi was murdered by a hindu fanatic..&amp; there was no racial war because the murderer was also an indian &amp; hindu. But can u imagine if the murderer was a Muslim (there's lots of conflict between hindu &amp; muslim at that time)? Well, one can be sure that the muslim in india are going to be murdered like mad.<br><br>The above are the past. But tragedy can still happen anytime today. If the malays are found to do something (eg seriously betraying the country during war time) which cause damage...it's not too difficult to imagine what will happen to the chinese &amp; malay then...<br><br>That is likely to be a great worry for the government, so for the security of the nation &amp; to prevent racial war from happening, the government had no choice but to selectively accept malay into military.<br><br>Another danger could be that: if war occurs &amp; some enemy disguise as "SAF-malay-soldier" to cause internal destruction (u imagine the destructions yourself)...what are we going to do? Maybe there will be a "curfew-for-malay" to prevent further destruction then...<br><br>It is not possible that the government discriminate the malays or what...but it is for the sake of security for the entire nation, &amp; also to prevent racial conflicts if betrayal occurs.<br><br>One of Singapore's Shared Values "Nation Above Community, and Society Above Self" is something to be practiced by every Singaporean. Let's take the security of "Nation" and "Society" more seriously, &amp; let's stop blaming each another in why there isn't many people from any race in the military.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to begin with there are many malays in the army, of course looking at entry qualifications as well as population ratio, i guess the number would be around 20%. With that surely you dont expect to see many right?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>NEARLY 13 years ago, then Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew triggered a debate about Malay loyalty with televised comments he made before a university audience (December 1986). Lee stated that the government had taken two opinion polls prior to and following the visit of Israeli President Chiam Herzog (November 1986) to the republic.<br><br>The poll found that the number of Malay respondents who were not against the visit fell sharply from one poll to the next, while the proportion of non-Malays who did not oppose the visit rose marginally.<br><br>Lee interpreted this to mean that "in certain circumstances, the Malay Singaporeans react with the emphasis on Malay/Muslim rather than Singaporean.<br><br>For the rest of the article, visit  <a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw99/90915loy.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.singapore-window.org/sw99/90915loy.htm</a><br><br>------------------<br>'Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. -- Alfred Lord Tennyson</div>
