            <div class='col-md body'>If u guys read ur history, u'll know that in any kinda war there are always traitors; however u see, whether they were willing or unwilling.<br><br>But to write off malays as capable wartime Ns men is typical of bigots like u.<br><br>Half the ppl i served with, especially the men are malays. Many of them are fitter, faster, more field-smart then their chinese or indian counterparts (u can throw in eurasians and PRs if u like) and handle their weapons like they were born with them.<br><br>In contrast, the chinese are the main culprits of "chow geng" and lack of fighting fitness. They do things to wayang in front of their supervising officer and then declare that they know wat to do.<br><br>The majority of pple who fail IPPT are chinese. (care to disagree?) I admit there are always shortcomings with any race, but to single Malays as the hopeless ones is pure discriminaion however u claim it.<br><br>A big risk to field malays in the army during war? How different is pulling the trigger of a M16 compared to loading the shell of a FH2000 or preparing bombs on planes and chopters? There are malays in those departments as well so is the SAF gonna one day restrict malays from serving on all fronts?<br><br>Now's not the time to point fingers. When u consider urself (or in this case ur race) flawless, then u may explore that option...at ur own time as well.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If u read the war history of other countries e.g Malaya, u'll notice that the Malays had sided the invader during war. During the Japanese Occupation in Malaya, the Malaysian malay actually looked upon the Japanese as their saviour from British rule. Not only that, many malays are known to sell info to japanese regarding the activities of those anti-japanese group (which consist of mainly chinese). There were cases where the malays actually directed the japanese to the hiding place of the resistance fighters. Because of that many anti-japanese fighters were killed.<br><br>Cases of malay betraying the chinese also happens in the Malayan People Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA) resistance group. The story is that: initially the MPAJA are reluctant to accept any malays as resistance fighters, but later got accept a few of them. And know what happen?
