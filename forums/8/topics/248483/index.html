            <div class='col-md body'>To many people, a dream is nothing..<br><br>But to me this dream which i just had while i took a rather long afternoon nap (usually i don't take naps)..<br><br>Although the dream was repeatedly being shown to me in my sleep over the years since i was young, there are however some changes inside as well.<br><br>Via this dream it reminded me that Busy is an excuse to not show care and concern towards family memebers and silbings...Inside the dream I saw myself and my elder brother...together with our mother...running away, trying to escape from a huge crowd out to kill every single who stands in their way (i know it's silly) but it's meaningful to me when i link up the whole dream which i had just now<br><br>There my brother and I was running faster than my mother...asking her to catch up, but in times of life and death we often neglect some points..Her age..It was only at the verge of Death in my dream that I picture myself seeing my brother returning back in front of the advancing danger to help massage my mother's tired legs..<br><br>Than it came to me that I know inside me, I only have 1 mother, once lost, will never come back to me...thus I decide that I rather die in the dream (which looked so real to me when i was asleep) rather than to live with the guilt of being un-fillal..<br><br>When I went back to my mom, using hp to massage her (don't laugh; perhaps its a new technology in future) , the smile on my mother's face was something that was shown from the bottom of her heart..something special that money can't buy...It's being a long time since I felt this way.. (It was only when my brother and i got back to massage for my mom and she smiled than the advancing crowd stopped and scattered back to their usual shelf whereas intially they were having this aura of No Money No Talk until my brother and I went back to help my mother to massage her tired legs...(Linking to real-life; it's very true, how the charity are able to collect so much funds are when they show the people who's busy working, something which can't be bought with money - that it's worth them spending/donating money to)<br><br>Perhaps it's due to my hectic schedule, in an attempt to work towards the corporate ladder..I push myself too hard, to the extend i did tuck into bed and rest, but my brain wasn't resting...as there's no dream at all for 2 weeks..<br><br>Is it due to the cruel fact that Singapore is a No Money No Talk Country that made me who I am before I had this dream - A guy who looks towards $, to help let my mother have a happy retirement as well as my friends. But after waking up from the dream, now what i want is just to let my mother live happily, at least don't need to rush and worry so much home chores etc...friends also, for friends, at least we can still meet up reguarly perhaps on a yearly basis to catch up or whatsoever..as long as it's something truthful..it's something worth the deal..<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>When do we as Singaporeans have the time to slow down our pace and look around us, the people suffering, and lend them a helping hand? </strong></span>I'm gald this dream woke me up..if not I will still be a person who looks towards money rather than real bonding among family members and the invisible trust of family bonding..coz it's only in danger than will we learn to appreciate what's there in their real value - (like when we are down and bankrupt the only people and friends that stays are our real friends - mostly the people behind us are our family members holding us together so dearly which we often deem as normal..Cherish our parents and siblings they will not be forever there to give us a helping hand..it's what i learnt from this dream - the nightmare<br><br>Lucily i have friends around me who shares the same direction if not i will just end up like another aimless working bee outside with no moral values.<br><br>It's maddness - for me to start the adult life - work, travel slp, for just 1 month is scary enough to remove my feelings and sense of personal touch of a human...<span style="text-decoration: underline;">i wonder how many people out there are still emotionally a human or just a machine only working to clock up and meet targets..such as how many mouths to feed back at home and negelect one another feelings.</span><br><br>Is it due to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: darkblue;">guys being more rationale</span></span> and <span style="color: red;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">girls more emoitional</span></span></strong> that girls understands and cherish their friends and family more than guys thus girls have more friends that last a life-time?<br>Now I've though of it, i think it make some sense..</div>
