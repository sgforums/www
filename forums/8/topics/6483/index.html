            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>Actually, I would like to crosspost in Speaker's corner, if someone could do the favour for me, thanks in advance.<br><br>Well, recently in London, there is a whole big issue about the running of London Mayor. What happened is that both Labour and Tory have to field one candidate to run for the mayor of London. The Mayor of London would be responsible for the social and domestic policies and most importantly, the transport policy in London regarding the tube (the MRT equivalent to Singapore) and London transport company. In Labour, there were 2 people fighting to be fielded, namely Ken Livingstone and Frank Dobson. Well, both decided to go thru what is called the electoral college, but it ended up because Tony Blair played some politics (since he doesn't like Ken Livingstone, Ken lost). Well, because Ken Livingstone made a lot of contributions to the Londoners with his brilliant transport policies in the last decade before Thatcher disbanded the Greater Council of London (i.e. the former Mayorship of London), the Londoners would want to him to run, and according to polls, he won over 50% of the voting.<br><br>So, after getting threats from the Labour party and public pressure, Ken Livingstone has decided to run as an independent for the Mayor of London. But he was accused of breaking his promise earlier because he declared that if he lost the electoral college vote (which was manipulated), he would not run as independent. Now, he is running (as he declared yesterday). If he wins, it would be a new phenomenon in politics, because it is very unlikely or almost 0% chance of winning if you don't have party support. But Ken Livingstone is still supported by Londoners in this battle. So, as an outsider, it would be a nice show to watch.<br><br>This issue reminded me a few years back of a relevant situation when I went to listen to an Independent, by the name of Chia She Teck. He gave very sound policies and was very much like Low Thia Khiang or Chiam See Tong in his race for a MP seat. However, because he did not have a party backing, he lost, but it was a 4 man race for his constituency, he managed to get number 2 in votes with his campaign, which  I thought was remarkable. So, I was wondering, in retrospection, this whole thing about having a party backing, is it really that essential?<br><br>Should we not allow an Independent with capabilities to run the constituency? Perhaps, I would like to hear your comments about this...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there are a couple of reasons why an independent is frowned upon by the establishment. first, you don't know the person's politics. without a party mantra, the independent is a wildcard and wildcards are tricky phenomena. most run on charisma and have the ability to slip away when things turn sour without a party or organisation to hold responsible. the fact that the independent is automatically juxtaposed as underdog makes it very tempting to blind vote him/her as an act of frustration with the establishment. every grouse and complaint becomes a potential vote for the independent and the establishment is well aware of this.   secondly, its probably perceived that there are no holds nor checks on the independent. you get gems of independents once in a while and while co-option is a possibility (witness the NMP debate in s'pore) a lot of the moral ground consolidated from independent standing is lost, which of course makes the individual useless to the party in the polling boothes.<br><br>as for the london mayor candidates my choice is out of the running....*gripe*<br><br>cheerio<br><br>------------------<br>There are a number of mechanical devices which increase sexual arousal in women.
