              <p>Given China's propensity for industrial policy which is honestly, another method of command economy albeit in a capitalist environment, one cannot expect a Nobel Prize winner out of a China resident anytime soon.</p>

              <p>TS, just that Singapore excels in many areas and you expect or demand that Singapore must have a Nobel prize winner or otherwise Singapore system is useless according to your logic. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>By the way, the award of the Nobel prize is biased towards the western world as the Nobel prize is the product from the western world. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>there is no formula for this prestigious prize...but it comes from very very rare imagination and sacrifice to reach this zenith...</p>
              <p>just some examples:-</p>
              <p>Marconi - humiliated by many as a stupid and crazy scientist for his theory of wireless telecommunication and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1909;</p>
              <p>Gao Xingjian - persecuted for his novels that exposes the cultural revolution of his times, betrayed bu his wife to the communist party, and escaped to France to publish his great novel Soul Mountain - the first PRC to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2000..</p>
              <p>its not about world class facilities...but a need to oppose conventionalism - empirically, politically and personally...not many can endure that.... </p>

              <p> In the past Nobel prize is really meant for what it is. Now its
              still the same, but with political agenda behind it. They choose the
              recipients. </p>
              <p>Founded by Alfred Nobel, in <strong>his last will</strong> he state to <strong>create
              a series of prizes for those who confer the "greatest benefit on
              mankind" in physics, chemistry, peace, physiology or medicine and
              literature."</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Alfred Nobel had died</strong>. And now is the Nobel prize commitee deciding how the Nobel prize are allocated. Therefore <strong>It is not Alfred Nobel's will anymore. </strong></p>
              <p>You <strong>cannot deny </strong>that there is a political agenda behind the Nobel prize. Just take a look at <strong>US's president Obama </strong>and  <strong>Mahatma Gandhi</strong>.</p>
              <p><strong>Can
              you say Mahatma Gandhi don't fufil the requirement of the Nobel prize
              candidate???Mahatma Gandhi don't deserve Nobel prize???</strong></p>
              <p><strong> Even the American citizen question and criticise the Nobel prize commitee. </strong></p>
              <p>Gandhi spend 27 years for passion of peace. <strong>The civil rights movement in south africa</strong>, <strong>his role in the zulu war</strong>, <strong>contribution to India's independence</strong>, <strong>his role in world war one</strong>, <strong>freedom and partition of india</strong>...etc <strong>till the day he was assasinated</strong>.</p>
              <p>Coming to this statement: <strong>"greatest benefit on mankind" As a part of mankind</strong>,
              I understand from the US point of view, Obama hold the views and rights
              to change America. And in the years to come by, if really applicable.
              The rest of the world can benefit from it. But he had not really done
              it did he?</p>
              <p>Nobel prize always have this <strong>Eurocentrism.</strong> They award prizes to people who really really deserve the prize, But on
              the other hand they also hold back on some who really derserve the
              prize.  Especially people of Asian origin. I respect Alfred Nobel. I
              had no qualms against him and his purpose of the Nobel Prize.  Its the
              people who are in control that is distorted.</p>
              <p><strong> You don't need a now-distorted-Nobel prize or a free country
              to develop or prove your inventions/creations/contributions are
              worthy/brilliant.</strong> I understand that society now in Singapore and
              China it is very difficult to regain the then rich culture. Every era
              have their difficulties and restrictions.</p>
              <p>It doesn't matter
              whether is it in Singapore or anywhere in the world. As long as it is
              from mankind. We should be happy for anyone who get the prize. And for
              people who are brilliant but never get appointed or anything? I think
              people who are not blind and is appreciative will not care whether or
              not they have any titles on hold. They are brilliant means they are
              brilliant. Those who manage to make it possible struggle tremendously
              for it.</p>
              <p>So actually there is no formula. What Fcukpap said is
              right. The problem with you is you marginalise people. "Why Singaporean
              cannot get Nobel prize? or why China people cannot get nobel prize?".</p>
              <p>Do you even understand what Nobel prize is all about?? <strong>Its for Mankind</strong>.
              In fact, anybody who contribute/leaves a mark in history base on peace,
              inventions and righteousness deserve our respect. Stop complaining.</p>
