              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: #333333; text-align: left; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 17px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">I am here to urge your support of this year's Nobel Peace Prize being bestowed upon the founder of China's Charter 08, Liu Xiaobo.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: #333333; text-align: left; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 17px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">In spite of Liu Xiaobo's many friends and supporters, I came to know him quite late, and we first met personally only a few years ago. In the mid-1980s, when Liu Xiaobo rose to prominence within the literary world, I was a visiting research fellow at Oxford, and became familiar with his ideas through Chinese periodicals published overseas.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: #333333; text-align: left; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 17px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">Contrary to the view held by many, what brought Liu such attention at the time wasn't merely the sharpness of his writing or his pointed critiques, but also how thorough he was in his thinking and how much more influential his criticisms were of mainstream ideology and dogma in China than those of other intellectuals.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: #333333; text-align: left; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 17px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">Throughout the student-led democracy movement of 1989, I had the opportunity to observe Liu Xiaobo. He had been lecturing abroad for quite some time, but when signs of suppression began to appear and others began making arrangements to flee overseas, Liu Xiaobo instead chose to discontinue his academic pursuits and return to Beijing to immerse himself in the struggle for democracy.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: #333333; text-align: left; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 17px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">On the nights of June 3rd and 4th, I was in Tiananmen Square, not far from the Monument to the People's Heroes. Liu Xiaobo, along with three other intellectuals, was taking part in the student hunger strike; it was they, who, on the early morning of the 4th, convinced the students to peacefully evacuate the Square and begin discussion with the soldiers suppressing them, negotiating a smooth withdrawal.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: #333333; text-align: left; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 17px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">I remember clearly the difficulty and pain Liu Xiaobo and his comrades-in-arms— raised as they had been with the most radical type of an education — experienced in reaching this decision, one which only later was understood to have saved the lives of several hundred students.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: #333333; text-align: left; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 17px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">Liu Xiaobo's involvement in the 1989 democracy movement illustrates his transformation from an eminent cultural critic to public intellectual concerned with social and political problems and human rights activist.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: #333333; text-align: left; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 17px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">His activities in 1989 can be seen as formative in the entirety of his following writings and other works, characterised by an unwavering bravery and refusal to back down in the face of danger and suppression, by the pursuit and defence of human rights, humanism, peace and other universal values and, finally, adherence to the practice of rational dialogue, compromise and non-violence.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: #333333; text-align: left; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 17px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">For many years, Liu Xiaobo has been the most representative figure and foremost organiser in mainland China's struggle for human rights and democracy. He has been at the forefront of protests made in support of writers and intellectuals imprisoned for their work, in appeals made for farmers and urban residents deprived of land and home, in advocating for protection of the religious and cultural rights of ethnic minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang, and in fostering constructive dialogue toward seeing peaceful co-existence between Han and all ethnic minorities.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: #333333; text-align: left; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 17px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">In a series of protests aimed at upholding the fundamental rights of all Chinese citizens, Liu Xiaobo placed consistent emphasis on the fact that the rights and freedoms of all Chinese citizens are protected both by the Chinese constitution and in law, as well as a series of United Nations and international declarations and covenants signed by the Chinese government which safeguard human and civil rights.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: #333333; text-align: left; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 17px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">Liu placed particular emphasis on seeing the Chinese government's obligation and responsibility to abide by its own constitution and laws as well as international covenants as commitments to both the Chinese people and the international community.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: #333333; text-align: left; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 17px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">In launching and signing Charter 08 in 2008, Liu Xiaobo's intent was to reaffirm, with the Chinese government already recognising the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and having signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, that these are the norms with regard to interaction between the Chinese people and the Chinese government: to be a qualified and responsible member of the international community would require China to adopt the universal values embodied within these two documents.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: #333333; text-align: left; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 17px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">For this, Liu Xiaobo was imprisoned, his third arrest as a result of striving for freedom and democracy in China. On Christmas Day, 2009, Liu Xiaobo was sentenced to 11 years in prison. In his final statement to the court, Liu Xiaobo said that he had neither enemies nor hate; to those who kept him under surveillance and arrested him, to the police who interrogated him and to the public attorneys who prosecuted and judge who sentenced him, the message Liu Xiaobo felt it most important to convey was that despite their various roles leading to his imprisonment, he considered none of them his enemy.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: #333333; text-align: left; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 17px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">As a political theorist and public intellectual also concerned with social and political problems and the defence of human rights, as well as a signatory to Charter 08, I strongly feel the need to point out that in the judgement read by the court which sentenced Liu Xiaobo, evidence cited to prove Liu's guilt included his participation in Charter 08, that he collected signatures for it, and even the content of the Charter itself - naked provocation of the universal values held by humankind, common norms held by the international community, and especially of the Chinese people themselves.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: #333333; text-align: left; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 17px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">As I see it, the Nobel Peace Prize both embodies and represents the core values of civilised society: respect for life and faith, the sanctity of the individual and the right to express one's self. Given that Liu Xiaobo and many others signatories of Charter 08 have faced persecution and oppression merely for reaffirming these values, the blatant challenge they face behooves a response from the civilised world.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: #333333; text-align: left; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 17px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">To bestow the Nobel Peace Prize upon Liu Xiaobo is one of the strongest responses which could be sent.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: #333333; text-align: left; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 17px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">This would, clearly and unambiguously, reaffirm the values held most dearly by humankind, serve as monumental support for the struggle for the freedom and democracy which China's 1.3 billion people lack, and would mark a major step in defence of world peace.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: #333333; text-align: left; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 17px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">The Chinese authorities are able to destroy this country's constitution and trample upon its laws wantonly, which is why external voices, voices from the international community, are needed to make Chinese authorities pay heed.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: #333333; text-align: left; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 17px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">Bestowing the Nobel Peace Prize upon Liu Xiaobo would serve as indirect opposition to the current state of affairs, as well as a both authoritative and effective signal.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: #333333; text-align: left; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 17px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">With protest movements now taking place all across China within every community and at every level, it is imperative we remain vigilant in preventing violent trends from taking hold. Awarding Liu Xiaobo the Nobel Peace Prize would have just such an effect: people struggling for human rights in China and around the world would find hope and strength in rational, non-violent resistance, and see anew the possibility of putting violence and authoritarian rule where they both belong - in the past and behind us all.</p>

              <p>OSLO – After its Obama bombshell last year, the Norwegian Nobel Committee could make waves again this year, some predict, by awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to a Chinese dissident.</p>
              <p>The Nobel season opens Monday with the Medicine Prize, followed by awards for exceptional work in physics, chemistry, literature and economics.</p>
              <p>But all eyes are fixed on the prestigious Peace Prize, which could create an upset again this year if some predictions come true.</p>
              <p>"If the Nobel Committee is courageous, and I think it will be, it should reward Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo," said Asle Sveen, a historian and Nobel Prize specialist.</p>
              <p>"There's been talk of a Chinese dissident for the prize for so long," he told AFP.</p>
              <p>Such a choice would certainly infuriate Beijing.</p>
              <p>Geir Lundestad, the influential secretary of the Nobel Committee, recently said he was warned in June by Vice Foreign Minister Fu Ying that rewarding a Chinese dissident would be seen by Beijing as "an unfriendly gesture" which could affect the relationship between China and Norway.</p>
              <p>Liu Xiaobo, a 54-year-old writer, was sentenced last December to 11 years behind bars for subversion after co-authoring a bold manifesto calling for democratic reform, "Charter 08", which was signed by more than 300 Chinese intellectuals, academics and writers, and thousands of others after it was circulated on the Internet.</p>
              <p>Online betting website paddypower.com deemed him a gamblers' best bet this year with odds of 6 to 1.</p>
              <p>He is ahead of Zimbabwean Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, Russian human rights group Memorial and its founding member Svetlana Gannushkina, and Ireland's Mary Robinson, a former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, who all have odds of 8 to 1.</p>
              <p>"Liu would be a popular choice in the Western world, where he could help people forget that Obama fell short of expectations," Sveen said, adding such a pick could help re-establish the prize's luster in the United States.</p>
              <p>US President Barack Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 after less than a year in office and as Washington was waging wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
              <p>The pick triggered widespread criticism of the Norwegian Nobel Committee.</p>
              <p>This year, the five members of the committee will have a record of 237 candidates to choose from. The list is secret, except for the names revealed by those who suggest them.</p>
              <p>"I believe the winner of the 2010 is somebody few people will know about," said Scott London, a US journalist and author who closely follows the Nobels.</p>
              <p>"It may be somebody working for peace in an unconventional way -- a peace researcher, for example, or an investigative journalist," he said.</p>
              <p>The head of the Peace Research Institute in Oslo, Kristian Berg Harpviken, said this week the committee would probably "be somewhat more traditional in its selection of a candidate than it was last year."</p>
              <p>He said Afghan human rights activist Sima Samar, the Oslo-based Democratic Voice of Burma radio and the Special Court for Sierra Leone were likely picks.</p>
              <p>Other nominees include three people widely regarded as the creators of the Internet: Americans Larry Roberts and Vint Cerf and Britain's Tim Berners-Lee.</p>
              <p>The International Space Station, Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege and Chinese dissidents Hu Jia et Gao Zisheng are also known to be on the list.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: #2d2d2d;">Iranian Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi is an eyesore
                for Tehran. When she won the prize for her struggle for democracy and human
                rights in 2003, the Iranian government experienced agony. Tehran could hardly
                afford to welcome the award since it clearly understood that the Nobel
                committee recognized Ebadi to encourage the improvement of human rights and
                democratization in Iran and the Islamic world. Nevertheless, Iran could also
                not ignore its first winner of the prestigious award, which was cause for
                national celebration.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: #2d2d2d;">Tehran countered
                through a passive welcome and continued oppression. It welcomed Ebadi’s honor
                in the name of the Islamic republic through a government spokesman, and
                approved a welcoming event of 5,000 people for Ebadi at the airport when she
                returned after the award ceremony. After a short atmosphere of welcome,
                Tehran has constantly harassed Ebadi, who is an anti-government activist.
                Last year, the government took her prize certificate and medal. Under
                reinforced oppression by the Iranian government, Ebadi has become a fighter
                who is more aggressively fighting for her nation’s democratization and reform
                by traveling around the world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: #2d2d2d;">In China,
                anti-government activist Liu Xiaobo is considered a leading candidate for
                this year’s Nobel Peace Prize, the winner of which will be announced Friday.
                In 2008, he led a signature-collecting campaign for a “2008 Charter,” which
                demanded revocation of China’s one-party rule by the Communist Party and
                reform. His campaign was assisted by progressive scholars, lawyers and
                writers. Liu was sent to prison after receiving an 11-year sentence. If he
                receives the award, he could emerge as China’s version of Aung San Suu Kyi,
                the symbol of the democratization movement in Myanmar. As such, Beijing has many
                reasons to fret. Two other Chinese dissidents, Wei Jingsheng and Fu Jia, have
                also made the list of Nobel Peace Prize candidates this year again after
                doing so last year.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: #2d2d2d;">Beijing is openly
                staging a plot to block Liu from receiving the award. Geir Lundestad,
                director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute, which assists in the selection of
                Nobel laureates, recently said he was threatened by the Chinese foreign vice
                minister, who warned that giving the award to an anti-government activist
                will be considered an unfriendly act and hurt Oslo-Beijing ties. China’s
                diplomatic habit of using retaliation or threats when in conflict with
                another country is even shaking the foundations of the Nobel Prize. If the
                Nobel institute succumbs to Beijing’s pressure, the Nobel Peace Prize will
                see its reputation go into free fall.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">BEIJING - China's activist community on Monday said they held

              as the winner of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize.</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial;    ">Nobel Committee faces down the dragon</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial;    "><br> By Sreeram Chaulia <br> <br> With the Norwegian Nobel Committee scheduled to announce the name of this
              year's Peace Prize winner on October 8, speculation that jailed Chinese
              democracy activist Liu Xiaobo is the frontrunner is mounting. <br> <br> News agencies including Reuters and Agence France-Presse have reported that
              Liu, who is serving an 11-year prison sentence in Liaoning province for
              "inciting subversion of state power," is the bookmakers' favorite
              among 237 nominees to bag the most political of Nobel prizes. <br> <br> The prognosis has clearly not gone down well in Zhongnanhai, the power center
              in Beijing, where there is concern about China-bashing and sullying that could
              jeopardize the country's mounting international influence. <br> <br> The director of the Nobel Institute, Geir Lundestad, revealed last week that
              Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Fu Jing had met him in Oslo in June to deliver
              a warning that the "unfriendly gesture" of honoring Liu with the
              prize "would have negative consequences" for bilateral relations
              between China and Norway. <br> <br> The Chinese Foreign Ministry confirmed that pressure was being exerted on the
              Nobel Committee on the grounds that Liu had never promoted "peace between
              peoples, international friendship and disarmament." According to a
              ministry spokeswoman, awarding Liu would be contrary to the ideals of the
              prize's founder, Alfred Nobel. <br> <br> Although China has a long track record of rebuffing and categorically
              dismissing international calls for domestic political reform, its climb up the
              ladder of world-power standings has somewhat increased its sensitivity to
              foreign criticism of its authoritarian regime. <br> <br> Chinese strategic elites have strived over the past decade to devise
              image-burnishing doctrines like "peaceful rise" (<em>Zhongguo heping
              jueqi</em>), "peaceful development" (<em>Zhongguo heping fazhan</em>)
              and "harmonious society" (<em>hexie shehui</em>) to counter portrayals
              of Asia's behemoth as aggressive abroad and bulldozing in its
              high-modernization drive at home. <br> <br> Beijing is aware that its growing clout in the international system must be
              accompanied by improved stature, which is a more amorphous term predicated on
              accumulated goodwill, soft power and positive feelings. <br> <br> Dominique Moisi's theory that emotions like fear, hope, humiliation and
              admiration are as important in international politics as material factors like
              economic and military calculations explains China's recent attempts to assuage,
              convince or even coerce the rest of the world to accept its bona fides as a
              normal state with a humane polity. China's "charm offensive" (<em>Joshua
              Kurlantzick</em>) is thus a necessary weapon in its ascent as a great power. <br> <br> Should Liu be named as the peace laureate, Beijing will deem it a
              public-relations setback because the aftermath of the prize helps train
              worldwide attention on the cause espoused by the winner. <br> <br> Older-generation leaders in the Chinese Communist Party still remember the
              contretemps that followed the Nobel Committee's selection of the exiled Tibetan
              spiritual leader the Dalai Lama for the Peace Prize in 1989. The combination of
              the Tiananmen Square crackdown and the conferral of the Nobel on the Dalai Lama
              increased China’s isolation to its highest level since the Mao Zedong era and
              deterred foreign direct investment and economic growth in the early 1990s. <br> <br> Liu could be elevated into international celebrity by virtue of the prize,
              shining renewed light on China's dark spots, including political prisoners.
              Although the Barack Obama administration of the United States has thus far
              dealt with China on pragmatic rather than ideological terms, the
              democratization drumbeat will become deafening, at least for a while, if Liu
              wins the prize. Washington then might resurrect the old concern about
              human-rights violations. <br> <br> What appears to particularly gall Beijing is that the Nobel Committee might
              pick Liu as the 91st Peace Prize winner at a time when China is unarguably the
              second-most powerful state in the world. Lundestad's recent contention - that
              Chinese pressure did not prevent the Nobel Committee from feting the Dalai Lama
              in 1989 and will not do so in 2010 either - seems to mock Beijing's belief that
              it can translate 20 years of economic growth and muscle power into having its
              way on delicate issues. <br> <br> Compared to 1989, today's China does enjoy a much bigger arsenal of pressure
              points and leverage instruments to deter a range of international actors from
              doing what they would otherwise do for the sake of principle. Beijing enjoyed
              limited success in 2009 by sending strong signals to the Obama administration
              not to entertain the Dalai Lama in the White House. When Obama belatedly did
              meet the Tibetan spiritual leader in February 2010, it was an in camera event
              with no public photographs, in clear deference to Chinese sentiments. <br> <br> Similar Chinese warnings fell on deaf ears in France, where President Nicolas
              Sarkozy openly shrugged off Beijing's anger and met the Dalai Lama in Poland in
              December 2008. In retaliation for this "unwise move," China
              threatened to disrupt trade ties with the entire European Union and canceled a
              planned EU-China summit. <br> <br> China has also capitalized on its economic and strategic ties with a wide range
              of countries to win diplomatic concessions on sovereignty disputes that it
              considers to be its "core national interests." <br> <br> One of the standard conditionalities for Chinese loans, trade and
              foreign-investment largesse in Africa and Latin America has been withdrawing
              recognition of Taiwan and acceptance of Tibet as an integral part of China. The
              "one-China principle" is a standard feature in mainland China's
              checkbook diplomacy and has worked to the disadvantage of Taipei, which finds
              its international repository of state backers shrinking with each passing year. <br> <br> Without question, China now has the wealth to throw around and buy silence or
              acquiescence from many world capitals that find themselves in hock to the
              world's biggest market and a major foreign investor. But the Nobel Committee is
              a different matter altogether and has matured to define "peace" much
              more liberally than the traditional "inter-state peace" that Beijing
              claims to stand for. <br> <br> The mainstreaming of the international human-rights and environmental
              consciousness has frequently pushed the committee to award the Peace Prize to
              domestic activists for political freedom and green justice who struggle against
              autocratic rulers, notably Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar, Shirin Ebadi of Iran,
              and Wangari Maathai of Kenya. <br> <br> Some observers have predicted that the Nobel elders in Oslo will avoid
              "risky" choices after last year's controversial verdict to anoint
              Obama. Liu's exemplary record of sticking to non-violent means and his
              martyr-like halo of sacrificing personal freedom for the sake of collective
              rights for the Chinese people actually make him a safe bet. <br> <br> Come Friday, should the committee plump for a candidate like Sima Samar - head
              of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission - instead of odds makers'
              favorite Liu, China will uncork the champagne for possibly pulling off another
              diplomatic coup. <br> <br> But China is not quite the British Empire of the 1940s, which might have had a
              hand in denying Mahatma Gandhi the Peace Prize despite his nomination on five
              occasions. More crucially, the guiding philosophy of the Nobel Committee has
              globalized and transformed radically since the dark days of the "White
              Man's Burden." China's vulnerability to Nobel Peace Prizes cannot be
              wished away. <br> <br> <strong><em>Sreeram Chaulia</em></strong><em> is Vice Dean of the Jindal School of

                academics issued a statement Tuesday calling for this year's Nobel Peace
                Prize to be awarded to Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo, who is currently serving
                an 11-year sentence in Beijing. <br> <br> The Taipei Society issued the statement ahead of the announcement of the
                winner, due Oct. 8. <br> <br> China, with its track record of abusing human rights and repressing political
                dissidents, naturally regards Liu's Charter 08 Initiative and his bid for the
                peace prize as threats to the legitimacy of its regime, and has warned the
                Nobel Peace Committee not to award the prize to Liu, according to the
                statement. <br> <br> The group said it stands in solidarity with Liu and called on the Nobel Peace
                Committee to award the prize to Liu, despite China's official warning. <br> <br> The society said that a Nobel Peace Prize for Liu would mean not only
                recognition of his long-term dedication to human rights and democratic
                reforms in China, but would also send a clear message to the Chinese communist
                regime that the world stands in solidarity with Chinese people who share
                Liu's vision for a strong, prosperous and democratic China that respects
                individual freedom and human rights. (By Eva Feng and Lilian Wu) ENDITEM/J</span></p>

              was forced to cut the odds on Liu Xiaobo winning earlier this week from 3-1 to
              (odds-on) 4-5 after a late surge of betting including several bets of 200 were
              placed by punters across the globe.</span></p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.5; padding: 0px;">(Reuters) - China will try its best to block a Nobel Peace prize for jailed Chinese writer and dissident Dr. Liu Xiaobo, his wife told Reuters ahead of the Nobel Committee's announcement on Friday.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; padding: 0px;">Liu is considered one of the front-runners for the prize, although the Nobel Committee often confounds expectations. Czech politician and former dissident Vaclav Havel is one of those pushing for Liu to win the prize.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; padding: 0px;">The Nobel Committee will announce the winner on Friday.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; padding: 0px;">"This government is one that has never given reasons for its actions. It is a government that thinks there is nothing it can't do," Liu's wife, Liu Xia, told Reuters in an interview.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; padding: 0px;">"To get what it wants, the Communist Party will spare no effort. It will use all types of methods to block the prize or anything else that would hurt the party. They will use their money and power to get others to support them."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; padding: 0px;">Liu Xiaobo was jailed for 11 years in December 2009, more than a year after his detention as lead author of Charter 08, a manifesto issued by Chinese intellectuals and activists calling for free speech and multi-party elections.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; padding: 0px;">He was charged with subversion of state power.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; padding: 0px;">The former literature professor rose to prominence as one of the leaders of a hunger strike during student protests on Tiananmen Square in 1989.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; padding: 0px;">He was later jailed for 20 months and then spent three years in a "labor re-education" camp during the 1990s, as well as months under virtual house arrest.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; padding: 0px;">Liu Xia said she had a feeling Liu would not get the prize.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; padding: 0px;">Deputy Foreign Minister Fu Ying warned the head of the Nobel Institute against granting the prize to Liu during a visit to Oslo this summer, saying it would hurt ties between China and Norway.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; padding: 0px;">A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said last month that Liu's actions were "diametrically opposed to the aims of the Nobel prize."</p>
