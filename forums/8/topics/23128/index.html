            <div class='col-md body'>Of course i would only post up opinions supporting the Korean team. But i'm not totally deaf or blind to what others have been saying about the team...be it conspiracy to win, bribery.....etc..<br>I think it's perfectly normal that some people find it hard to swallow the fact that the Korean team CAN be this good. Referees are humans too and they make mistakes. There've been a lot of shots called against the Koreans too...not all were in their favour.<br>You don't hear people screaming conspiracy back when the french won on their home ground.<br>And one last thing, crowd does not count towards whether the team has good sportsmanship or not...it's the players.<br>I have nothing against people who don't like the Korean team but to call them 'cheaters' is another thing.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>*By Andy Gray<br>BBC Radio Five Live's summariser*<br><br>I have been hearing some anti-Korean stuff mooted about and I find that amazing.<br><br>The Korean team has been one of the most honest I have seen in these championships.<br><br>They work harder and have to be more disciplined than other teams.<br><br>You don't see them throwing themselves about, you don't see them feigning injury, and you don't see them going over the top and topping people.<br><br>They have just had an enormous amount of good luck.<br><br>The reaction back home from some newspapers saying that people shouldn't support Korea because of what has happened is extremely unfair and really over the top.<br><br>The players haven't asked for these favours, Guus Hiddink hasn't asked for these favours.<br><br>But that's what football does. It sometimes gives you a bit of luck and for South Korea to reach the semi-finals, they needed a bit of luck.<br><br>Although I must admit, I didn't think it would be this much.<br><br>The real fault lies with Fifa for appointing these officials.<br><br>That's been glossed over and Fifa has done a good job in shovelling the blame elsewhere.<br><br>But I think Fifa is at fault first and foremost for the people they appoint.<br><br>Oliver Kahn's statement has put pressure on the referee<br><br>There's a bit of political correctness here in selecting referees, instead of selecting them on ability alone.<br><br>It's rubbish to think that because a country is a member of Fifa they should have a representative.<br><br>Referees from the Maldives, or Trinidad and Tobago haven't officiated in football of the standard they have to take part in here.<br><br>The best referees must come to the World Cup, particularly the best linesmen because I think the job of the assistant referee is harder than the referee.<br><br>I don't think the game would mind at all if the best referees were appointed, no matter where they came from.<br><br>I also see that Oliver Kahn has said the Germans are prepared mentally to have goals disallowed.<br><br>All this is taking the gloss off what's been an incredible journey for Korea.<br><br>When you've been in Seoul you get the feeling there's a lot of disappointment at the reaction of the world's press.<br><br>Oliver Kahn is experienced and a very cute man in respect of letting the referee know what the Germans are thinking.<br><br>Fifa should be picking him up and saying 'you can't say that before a semi-final.'<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>article by a fellow singaporean<br><br><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/rnb/hailie/pics.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.angelfire.com/rnb/hailie/pics.html</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If anyone look at the results of this world cup, i personally feel that maybe there may be some conspiracy about this world cup. Or maybe that the fact that the standard of other team from africa and asia have rise over this couple of years. If the Koreans or even the Japanese or senegal can maintain or better the performance they achieve in the next few world cups, i truly believe that the gap of world football may have shorten and is not like the same old team winning the tournament everytime and this also may provide some entertainment value in it. So let us just wait and see for the next few years what is the trend in world football is like.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wah what can i say about korea is this.<br><br>THE BAD: they have a tendency to cheat(maphack) in multiplayer games online, eg. starcraft. gives me the impression they pull out all the stops to win. they are hardworking and run fast, buttheir football isn't great, and they won their last 3 matches only because of refereeing "oversights", and the statistical probability of all of them going korea's way in 3 consecutive matches is simply close to zero.<br><br>THE GOOD: 3 words. song hae gyo.</div>
