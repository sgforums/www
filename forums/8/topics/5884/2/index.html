            <div class='col-md body'>HK,<br>I think I understand what you are trying to say.  But in many cases in life, you usually get and little and sacrifice a little too.  Chio ppl might or might not get a lot of attention in pubs/clubs whatever, cuz some guys just instantly assume that the girl is w/ someone or is too much for him OR the girl might just attract unwanted attention.  But to be realistic, I really believe that chio ppl gets advantage in what they do...sad to say, but this is life  =P<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The only disadvantage of being so called "chio"..is that you will invite unnecessary trouble from guys and pick up from guys in the clubs or bars....Other than that I thinkit got its advantages but seriously the emotional struggle to reject guys ia simply immense and for others to hard to bear....so it will turn out that it is a big bad news when U know some one like u.....esp if ut is ur own personal fren...How to reject??so that is one big problem</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well... i think good-looking people are very confident of themselves... but their are also very self-conscious as well... coz they noe they good looking and dey dun want to do anything to make themselves look stupid... (maybe another stereotype... but i think there's some truth to it)<br>plus... sometimes good-looking people maybe a little insensitive to other average people around dem (but not notice it) and in dat sense, they can be at a disadvantage coz there are more average looking people than good-looking people... and u dun want to make enemies with people who are greater in numbers...<br>BUT there are nice good-looking people around who treat everybody w/ respect regardless of who or wat they are... juz up to ur luck whether u bump into da assholes or not... frankly... if a good-loooking guy is an ass... he won't stay dat way anymore...</div>

I think lots of girls have low self-confident cuz of the way they look and they will always try to it up in other ways...like..wearing sexy clothes, etc...<br><br>If this is a perfect world, looks won't be important.  Ppl have the choice of how they want to behave/act, but w/ looks, you are born with it, really nothing you can do, except plastic surgery.  So, why not like the person for the way they behave/act rather than the way they look?!<br><br>Anyways...too bad it's not a perfect world! =P</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it would be interesting for people who are chio to exchange role with not chio people for 3 months. 3 months better than one day. You can't see/experience anything for one day.<br><br>Anyway, that isn't likely to happen in the next 10 years, so we will have to live with what we get. Let me just say that I hope the people who say they don't judge by appearence really practice what they say, because I really think its not easy. You won't be able to know how it feels to be judged by appearence after you experience it yourself. Its like reading a book on race car driving as opposed to actually getting behind a wheel.</div>
