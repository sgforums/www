              <p>No. When we become freed from all illusions, we can live an ordinary life like anybody else. We continue to see, hear, smell, taste, touch, think, after enlightenment but no longer are we deluded by them, no longer do we cling to them. In fact we will find the bliss in Life, but Life without a Center or a Self (we realise there never has been a Center or a Self in the first place, apart from the process of life). Naturally of course, we also stop fearing death.</p>
              <p>All seeing, hearing, etc, are the pure functioning or Buddha-Nature or Pure Awareness. (And our Buddha-Nature has been ever-present, with no beginning nor an end, never lost at any moment for countless aeons, and doesn't increase upon enlightenment... but upon awakening it becomes realised, like the clouds of intellectual (erroneous views of reality) and emotional (greed, anger, jealousy, pride, etc) obscurations blocking the Sun of Awareness (Buddha-Nature) that was ever-present finally becomes dispelled and Reality as-it-is reveals. Even though the clouds of intellectual and emotional obcurations has prevented us from seeing our Reality as-it-is, nevertheless it is still there shining through the clouds, otherwise there would not be any awareness at all (no light shining upon the world), no awareness of anything. Our Buddha-Nature is also described as being like a mirror, having the capacity to reflect everything as it is whether ugly or bad, or belonging to samsara or nirvana. That is why "Even though one says that it exists, it does not actually exist (is empty of substantial or inherent existence). On
                                              the other hand as a source, it is the origin of the diversity of all
                                              the bliss of Nirvana and all of the sorrow of Samsara." and "It is the single nature of mind that encompasses all of Samsara and Nirvana." -- Padmasambhava</p>
              <p>Everything we experience is an expression of luminous Buddha-Nature, pure presence or awareness. Anyway the point I want to say is the goal of Buddhism is not about entering a state of nihilism. As Guru Padmasambhava states about our nature, "it  is not a mere nothingness or something annihilated because it is  lucid and present.")</p>
              <p>Normally human beings experience things through a point of reference, and that point of reference is the Self, the Observer, the Doer, etc. It is the sense that there is a truly existing and permanent Agent/Self that is behind acting, observing, basically experiencing life. Or, a soul, a ghost in the machine. And what they see, hear, etc, appers to them to be 'external objects separate from himself', appearing to have a substantial inherent existence.</p>
              <p>Not understanding the 3 dharma seals (the three characteristics of phenomena/the nature of reality) which is Impermanence, Suffering and No-Self, -- and Empty -- we continue to impute the false sense of a separate self upon our sensate reality, and we continue to grasp on what we perceived as inherently existing entities.</p>
              <p>When realisation into the nature of reality (Emptiness) dawns, all clinging and attachments and sufferings end. Sights, sensations, thoughts, etc, continue to arise but are no longer viewed through a reference point of a Self, are no longer grasped due to ignorance, which is like an illness causing us to hallucinate/project imaginary reality. (sutras describe this as being like a cataract that cause us to see flowers in the empty sky)</p>

              <p>No Fighting Buddha. Buddhism is a teaching that emphasizes on non-violence and compassion.</p>
              <p>Jade Emperor is a deva, devas are under the 6 realms of existence and has not been freed from birth and death. Buddha has transcended samsaric transmigration.</p>
              <p>Buddha has been known as the 'Teacher of Gods and Men': <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/jootla/wheel414.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/jootla/wheel414.html</a></p>

              <p><br>Oh no, u see, the markets had lots of products for you choose, let say a pair of shoes, you may want Reebok, addidas, nike, panda, or simply bata..it depend on your budgets and your lifestyle, so you bought what you think it suit you, and in the end you get a pair of shoes on your feet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tho religions are not same as thing, but the markets remain the same, you got Buddhism (which some say it is not a religion but a study of human doctrines), Islam, Christianity, taosim, etc etc etc, and within each religions, there are many more branches and different way of practicing. There are many heavens and hells, just like you can go to Takashimaya, Plaza Singapura, city plaza to buy your shoes etc etc, you decide what you want, study it, understand it, and once if you feels that is the one for you, go for it, believe in it and practice the good of it. Dun worry, take your time, for all the different heavens can wait for you, just that hell cannot wait.</p>

              <p>i like your logic. i agree with you, that one should choose the religion most suitable for him, instead of blindly following the religion he was born into.</p>
              <p>i prefer to go around barefoot, in that sense.</p>
