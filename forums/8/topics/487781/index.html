              <p>Recently, i have started calling people of black skin color as "blackies" and have faced a backlash of comments that says I am a racist.</p>
              <p>While I wont deny that I am a racist, my statements in themselves are not really racist as I only call them "blackies" because their skin is black. i refer to all races that have black skins as "blackies" irrespective of their races. Malays, Banglahs, Pakis, Kalings,  Africans and even black skin Chinese.</p>
              <p>Are people of black skin color ashame of their skin color?</p>
              <p>I have brown skin, I dont mind people calling me a "brownie".</p>

              <p>Some are, some aren't. I guess it makes sense, but actually in areas with more racial tension (eg American ghettos, rather than the overly PC UK), people are generally prouder of their race and heritage - afterall, it's more of a 'us vs them' kind of attitude.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And I guess I've got a skewed perspective, but here in the UK, black people are generally friendler and more accepting than many whites. I mean, since they're also minorities in the UK, then they can relate to different minorities, even if they're from other races...there's nothing that can convince me otherwise, that even though I'm friends with them, deep-down plenty of white people consider minorities as "dirty/ugly chinks/niggers/pakis" etc. I dunno, maybe you're racist against white people as well, but to specifically single-out blacks (or people with dark skin...) seems strange, especially when they will consider themselves equal to you - trust me, whites certainly won't!</p>

              <p>If a person has black skin, he's probably suffering from a severe skin disease. </p>

              <p>ok??? see the hostility</p>
              <p>all i am asking is why people of black skin color are ashame of their own skin color.</p>
              <p>jojobeach's response seems to be he/she is living in denial, ie - there is no different skin color and people who can see different skin colors are color blind (that is not how color blindness work by the way)</p>
              <p>SJS6638 claims I am trying to instill disharmony and imply that I should be jailed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do sincerely apologise if anyone is offended. When I suggest trying calling people blackie, obviously it is to people that you know and not to total strangers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If jojobeach and SJS6638 are people with black skin color, would you care to share why you feel offended by my statement? It is not personal and I really do not mean to offend you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>People with white skin tones do not feel offended when they are refered to as whites but people with black skin tones feel really offended when they are refered to as blacks.</p>
              <p>Take the so called "africans-americans", they will shoot you in the face if you call them "blacks" or "africans". I think that they are ashame of their black skin color and their own race/origins/ancestors.</p>
              <p>This behavior is again seen when you refer to Malays as Javanese (the origins of the Malays from the island of Java is a scientific fact) and the Indians as Ka-lengs.</p>
              <p>As a Chinese, i do not feel offended when someone calls me a Chinese.</p>

              <p>@jojobeach. Yup, no problem if it is a fact as</p>
              <p>1. Chink is short for Chinese<br>2. Slant eyes, maybe not so accurate as it also covers Koreans, Japanese, Thais and basically all those with slant eyes. Then again my eyes not so slanty. Need to check more, maybe check if people with slant eyes feel offended when others call them slant eyes.<br>3. Puny dicks also scientifically proven that easterners generally have smaller penis compared to black people. I do admit that my own penis is of average size for a Chinese but it serves its purpose to procreate. I will also admit that I have other Chinese friends who are ashame of the small size of their penis that they opt to undergo silicone injection to their penis to increase its length and girth artificially.</p>
              <p>again, so much hostility</p>
              <p>so again jojobeach, I assume you do have black skin color?<br>Why do you feel so ashame about this that you need to deny it?<br>Is it due to<br>1. social/community perception/pressure that having black skin color is somehow inferior?<br>2. personal experiences caused by the fact that you have black skin color?<br>3. how others with black skin color have behaved so badly that you feel ashame that you also have black skin color?<br>4. family/cultural beliefs as you grew up?</p>

              <p>Dear jojobeach</p>
              <p>I do apologize if i had misread your posts as being hostile. Maybe I am the only one with the opinion that you are feeling hostile when I read your posts.</p>
              <p>Like I said, I have no problems with facts.<br>I am proud to have African and Siberian ancestors (if it were true). If other people see Chinese as having yellow skin, I have no problem with that (like you said, maybe those Chinese have jaundice or the Chinese people that they saw really are yellow in color).</p>
              <p>I can see now that my comments have really distressed and offended you as a blackie and you are not willing to discuss/explore why you are ashame of your own blackie skin color.</p>
              <p>this will be my last post to you in regards to this issue as it is highly unlikely there will be any constructive progress made to my question of why you are ashame of your own blackie skin color.</p>
              <p>Thank you for your participation</p>

              <p>I have actually prepared a wall of text discussing how I think everyone is a racist in their own way and why I think I am a racist even though I had physical relations with malay, indian, filipino, Japanese and Korean ladies(I eventually married Chinese).</p>

              people with darker skin tone are not ashamed of their skin color. It is YOU who is ashamed of being associated with them, that's why you needed to differentiate yourself by the tone of your skin. 
                  
                  Are u ashamed yet? You should be.
