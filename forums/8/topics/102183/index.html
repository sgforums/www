            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2004-11-11/p48.jpg"><br>WHAT would my weekends be without my wife and my wi-fi?<br><br>Rhetorical questions aside, Antonia and my Internet surfing are precisely what make my weekends ideal.<br><br>Feel free to laugh - after all, I don't exactly fit the stereotype of a young executive jetsetting off on extravagant weekend escapades.<br><br>But it really does put a smile on my face to spend my weekends decked out in breezy T-shirts and shorts, scouring the flea markets for eclectic knick-knacks with Antonia, and exploring the Web world.<br><br>Often, I spend at least two weeks per month overseas doing business, especially in Thailand and Hong Kong, so my weekends do not follow any fixed pattern.<br><br>But there is one permanent feature on my overseas weekend schedule: visiting flea markets.<br><br>Antonia often joins me wherever my travels take me, and we always make it a prerogative to tramp through the flea markets - be it in Britain, Bangkok, Hong Kong or Milan.<br><br>The flea markets open at the crack of dawn, so I - being a natural early riser - wake up at seven o'clock and hustle my sleepy wife out of bed.<br><br>Needless to say, we make sure we dress the part: gearing ourselves up in the requisite flea market attire: the drabbest, 'hole-liest' T-shirts and slippers we have, and armed with an eagle eye to spot the unusual items nestling deep within the piles of knick-knacks.<br><br>Then off we go to soak in all the fascinating sights and snag a few terrific bargains before the eclectic wares are sold out by early afternoon.<br><br>I can't say I've mastered the art of bargaining, but my experience in the timepiece dogs, inherited from the older generation of the Tay family.<br><br>We both have rather eclectic tastes, so we avoided the usual breeds of ornamental fish. Instead we picked rather unusual, even ugly-looking species, such as baby puffer-fish the size of 20-cent coins, ghost fish which look like black feathers, and several weird creatures that we nicknamed 'spare ribs' because they have transparent bodies. It's like a swimming X-ray fish - you can see its bone structure, but not its digestive system.<br><br>The salesman at the fish-shop said that fish are hassle-free and their upkeep required only an occasional cleaning. In reality, Antonia and I have found ourselves every Sunday cleaning the tank, pumps and filters. But we actually do enjoy this sort of manual labour, it's therapeutic for me!<br><br>My wife and I have quite a lot of fun goofing off and making hilarious comments about the fish, analysing their quirky behaviour and speculating about their personalities.<br><br>On Saturday nights, we like to have a quiet dinner with a few close friends, many of whom I had grown up with, at a small restaurant and an occasional trip to Velvet Underground. I don't drink, which surprises a lot of my acquaintances. So I usually just sit in a corner chatting with another teetotaller friend.<br><br>I do a fair bit of work on the weekends, doing research on the Internet for new merchandising ideas, promising companies to invest in and reading up on corporate finance.<br><br>Even as we lie in bed watching The Apprentice or Six Feet Under on a Sunday night, Antonia and I like to surf the Internet on our laptops while bantering about anything that strikes our fancy, from fashion design to ideas about nation-building to the reasons why Japanese food tastes so good.<br><br>My work, weekends, wi-fi and family life are quite seamlessly intertwined. Perhaps many Singaporean yuppies my age, who are rising in their careers, travel frequently on business overseas, have recently gotten married, plan to start a family and are active in community projects, will identify with this sort of lifestyle.<br><br></div>
