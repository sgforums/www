              <p>
              </p><p class="p1">To all who are planning to pursue any course in the SAE, Singapore Here is my word of caution.</p>
              <p class="p1">This will not be of use to you. If you do some research online, you will know that gearslutz is the only place where professionals in the audio industry are around. Read the posts about SAE there, You will see you sae works.</p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">In simple words, Take Money &gt; Give certificate.</p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">SAE employs their own students, which mean you are learning from people who could not make it in the industry or somewhere gave up. </p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">The teacher's have a very wrong attitude, its more like "Do it by yourself" They do not encourage the students or even create interest in the students. Words such as the "f word" the "b word" are openly spoken by the teachers in lectures. </p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">Every time i asked a teacher whether they had time to have a listen to a mix i did the answer was "I'm busy now, maybe later?" </p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">In the year 2012, the batch of audio engineering has a total of 30 students, they all have been split in 2 batches, one morning and one afternoon. </p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">Most of time times, the morning batch end up coming in the afternoon making it a huge class and thus the attention level by the teachers is very low. </p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">We as students have to book studio in order to do our recordings, and because of the high count of the students, there is no availability. I recently had a booking and had a lecture right after it. </p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">I needed a table to keep my artists piano, The so called TSO's never helped me pick up the table, I had to by myself drag it all the way to the studio and back to the storage. </p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">When i entered class, the teacher said that i had been marked absent or late which i don't remember due to the stress that i had gone through with all the picking up and carrying of the studio equipment.</p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">The internet in the school is always very slow, when asked why, they blame it on the students for using p2p. Using an analysis, I could see that the p2p transmission was blocked. Thus their claim of p2p being used causing slow internet was a lie.</p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">The student lobby is always noisy, where even the staff use abusive words and laugh out loudly. The environment is not of a school but that of a fun vacation for students.</p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">After paying a large amount of money, i had never expected this from sae. </p>
              <p class="p1">I so far regret taking admission in the sae singapore.</p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p2"><span> </span></p>
              <p class="p1">They will give a very great service before you are admitted.</p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">Why?</p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">They need the money, simple.</p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">None. Everything they give, they will charge you for it.</p>
              <p class="p1">The teachers do provide education, but nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
              <p class="p1">Most of the teacher have their own companies so they will not pay much attention to the students.</p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">Full of utter non sense. They have the m box mini and the m box interfaces, headphones most of which are really bad. </p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">Teachers are found eating / drinking in the studios whereas they were very strict in the first place about drinking or eating in the studios. </p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">Even in the student lobby, the staff members are seen, having a fun time, shouting, singing loudly and eating where there are signs which say no eating allowed.</p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">Future in the industry? </p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">none, unless you are the teacher's pet. I have noticed, the teacher's give more attention to the students who are exceptional.</p>
              <p class="p1">The one's who need attention are left hanging</p>
              <p></p>

              <p>Thank you for link to the news article.<br>I just don't want other's to fall prey to the SAE Singapore.</p>
              <p>They literally bribed students with SAE printed T-shirts so they could help them out (promote) SAE on their open day. I am looking for more places where i can give this issue some exposure. People should know that what is happening is not right and they should not waste their money on a school like SAE.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am very much considering a transfer from SAE, and guess what? I had taken a package of 2 years, they take a bigger amount for the first year and the second year, you pay less. Now when i ask to transfer my credits, they say that the remainder won't be refunded. Cheaters. This was never told to me in the first place.</p>
