            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for your advice.<br><br>But i scare if i see him i would just give in again......<br><br>All my frens have been asking me to let go and told me he's not worth it.<br><br>i thought by giving him that second chance he would actually realise his mistake and change for the better instead he actually took it for granted.<br><br>I hate him for betraying my trust and love as well as taking me for granted but to be honest the feeling definitely is still there.<br><br>He pushed all the blame/fault to himself but i do think that third party also plays a part too. She noes he's attached and she herself is getting marry soon after she return to her homeland and that dude also noe he himself have a gf and that third party is leaving eventually and is someone else wife to be yet both of them just get together. True love or fling only they noe....perhaps that dude of mine is really true love but for the third party....hmmm only she noes. The dude of mine claimed the third party love him too but living standard in SG is too high for her and also mentioned too bad they met late....<br><br>I always believe if u love a person u would go all out for the person and even if in the future didn't work out but at least u have tried but this third party dun even willingly to give it a try due to living standard in SG too high....that's a selfish but practical thinking. She makes me very mad yet envy ....cos the dude of mine loves her so much yet she doesn't seen to appreciate much and me ...love my man so much but he is showering his love and concern for her.<br><br>My frens think i cares and thinks for him too much even under this kind of situation i still bother bout how he feels. Wat to do if u love a person u would just unconditionally shower ur love and concern to that person and wanted the person to be happy.<br></div>
