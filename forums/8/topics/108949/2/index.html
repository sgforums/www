            <div class='col-md body'>true, can see she's quite brave and resourceful. And she has a good heart, probably, seeing that she helped the old lady sell her wares, and that's wonderful.<br><br>but at the end of the day, how can sneak off just like that and leave the parents wondering where she went? totally reckless and irresponsible. young children must be taught how to behave.<br><br></div>

The gal wasn't even missing for 24 hrs to warrant an island-wide search.<br>3) Volunteers should be paid a nominal sum to cover their transport expenses (so what if they call themselves volunteers?)<br>4) The stupid little gal should be sent to a girls' home for a duration of 2 months. During this period, she is to be confined and not allowed to venture out of a cell.<br>5) Subsequent 'missing acts' by the same girl will call for a doubling of fine and possibly jail sentence for the parents who have been negligent.<br><br>(WHO'S NEXT TO BUTTER UP TO FOREIGN PEASANTS?!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> )</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I wouldn't go so far as to demand that her parents pay a fine or go to jail or something like that. The least that they can do, however, is to issue a public apology on the little girl's behalf for causing all the unnecessary trouble. Mind you, lots of peoples' time was unnecessarily wasted here. And that's just for the good-willing volunteers who spent their free time looking for the girl when they could have been doing other more meaningful tasks.<br><br>Heck, this little fiasco tied up the resources of the police.<br><br>The parents should issue a public apology. I still haven't heard a single word of 'sorry' escaping their lips.<br><br>Heck, they should call for a press conference and get the girl to apologize and promise that she'll never do anything like that again.</div>
