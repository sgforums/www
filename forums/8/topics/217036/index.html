If you checked properly, IIT's degree is not globally recognized hence you can't take that to anywhere in the world which needs your professional specialization. If fact, that certification is mainly recognized in the Indian subcontinent, although a few graduates made it big in US.<br><br>Yes, Singapore does employed those that it recognizes through the LAOTSE plan. And paywise, which Singaporean graduate can take a S$900 per month paycheck. Only the local graduates from IIT can afford such a paycheck and still survive.</div>

Brief description of the higher education system in India<br><br>The India higher education sector has expanded at a phenomenal rate in the last century. The European system of higher education was introduced in India by the British in 1857 with the establishment of universities for European education in three cities and withdrawal of support for indigenous education. By India's independence in 1947, an additional 18 universities had been established. In 1950-51 when the country's First Five Year Plan was launched, there were 27 universities serving 174,000 students. By 1997 there were 229 universities (composed of general universities; science and technical universities; open universities; agricultural universities; women's universities language universities; and medical universities), more than 8,000 colleges, and 6.4 million students, making India's system of higher education the second largest in the world (Chitnis, 1999, 26).<br><br><strong>India also have ranking of their uni.</strong><br><br>India Today<br><br>Reference<br>Year 2006 survey, India Today - [citation needed]<br><br>[edit] The Toppers<br>Arts: Stella maris, chennai<br>Science: loyola college,chennai<br>Commerce: SRCC, Delhi<br>Engineering:Indian Institute Of Technology Bombay<br>Law: madras university, chennai<br>Medicine: AIIMS, New Delhi<br><br>Arts<br>QUEEN MARY'S COLLEGE,CHENNAI<br>Presidency College,chennai<br>Loyola College,Chennai<br>LSR College,Delhi<br>St.Stephen's College,Delhi<br>STELLA MARIS COLLEGE chennai<br>Fergusson College,Pune<br>Hansraj College,Delhi<br>pratyusha science College,ootacamund,tamilnadu<br><br>Science<br>Loyola college,chennai<br>Madras christian,chennai<br>Presidency College, Chennai<br>Presidency college,kolkata<br>St.Stephen's college,delhi<br>stella maris,chennai<br>Mt.Carmel college,bangalore<br>St.Xaier's college,kolkata<br>ethiraj college,chennai<br>Christ college,bangalore<br><br>Medicine<br>All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi<br>[madras Medical College]], chennai, Tamil Nadu<br>AFMC,pune<br>Jawaharlal Nehru Iinstitute of Post-graduate Medical Education and Research, Pondicherry<br>CMC vellore,tamilnadu<br>Kasturba Medical College, Manipal, Mangalore District, Karnataka<br>Maulana Azad,delhi<br>Grant med.college,mumbai<br>St,John's bangalore<br>Bangalore Med.

Up to third position in 2005 from fourth place last year, the IITs are a source of Indian national pride as well as innovation and wealth."<br><br>The technologists among our peer review panel regard Imperial College London as the UK's hottest university, ahead of Cambridge University and fifth in the world, the statement adds.<br><br>The rankings, THES said, is dominated by the United States, no surprise for the world's top high-technology nation. It appears 26 times in the top 101 institutions in our list. For once, this area is one in which Harvard University ranks outside the elite, appearing in 21st place.<br><br>"Our definition of technology covers the main engineering disciplines including information and communications technology. Viewed alongside the tables for science subjects, our rankings suggest it is possible for a university to be strong in science but not technology, and vice versa," THES said.<br><br>The top science institutions, Cambridge and Oxford universities, cut less of a dash in engineering and IT, placed 6 and 13, respectively, while the IITs come 36th in science despite being third in technology. Overall, 10 of the top 20 institutions in science are rated by our peer review panel as being in the top 20 for technology and IT.<br><br>In contrast to science, many technology academics appear rarely in the world's top research publications. This applies especially to institutions outside the English-speaking world but also to some well-rated universities in Australia and elsewhere. It suggests that big US institutions such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the California Institute of Technology, Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley generate not only highly regarded papers but also many commercial innovations and spin-offs, THES said in a media statement.<br><br></div>
