Unfortunately the beautiful young girl came under the bus and died on the spot.<br><br>Angry passengers took the conductor to the police station, who in turn took him to the court.<br><br>The judge was not at all impressed with him and gave him capital punishment.<br><br>He was taken to the electrocution chamber. There was a single chair in the center of the room and a single banana peel at one corner of the room. The conductor was strapped to the chair and high voltage current<br>was given to him. Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz<br><br>But to everyone's amazement, he survived. The judge decided to set him free, and he returned to his profession.<br><br>After a few months, this time, a good looking middle aged woman tried to board the bus but the conductor didn't stop the bus. Unfortunately, this time also,the good looking middle aged woman came under the bus<br>and died on the spot.<br><br>Again angry passengers took him to the police station, who in turn took him to the court. The judge took one look at the conductor and gave him capital punishment.<br><br>The conductor was taken to the same electrocution chamber where there was single chair in the center of the room and a single banana peel at one corner of the room. He was strapped to the chair and high voltage current was given to him. This time also to everyone's amazement, he<br>survived. Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz<br><br>The judge decided to set him free, and he returned to his profession.<br><br>A couple of months later, an elderly gentleman tried to board the bus. This time the conductor, remembering his earlier experiences, stopped the bus.<br><br><strong>Unfortunately the elderly gentleman slipped and died due to his injuries.</strong><br><br>The conductor was taken to the police station and then to the court, to the same judge. Though he hadn't done anything wrong, but considering his past record the judge decided to set an example and gave him capital punishment.<br><br>The conductor was again taken to the same electrocution chamber where there was a single chair in the center of the room and a single banana peel at one corner of the room. He was strapped to the chair and high voltage current was given to him. Bzz<br><br>This time he died instantly !!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>The question is why didn't he die on the first two occasions ,but died instantly the third time??</blockquote>He killed the 1st two but the old man death was an accident....</div>
