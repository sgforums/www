            <div class='col-md body'>Well...basically, I'm a 17 year old singaporean guy this year, and as you know it, would most probably be going off for NS after my A'levels. However, I have hardly a single idea of what NS is like, though I would like to know more so as to mentally and physically...I've never ever pass my NAFA test before in my entire life except during sec 4 graduation with 'help' given from the teachers.<br><br>But anyway, as the tittle suggest, I want to know more about how NS is like, and have A LOT of question to ask:<br><br>~ How long after the A'levels do you have to sign up for NS?<br><br>~ I heard something about Basic Training. Though I don't know what it is, from the name, I can guess it's kind of a...errr...basic training. But what exactly is it (as in what you do in it?), how long does it last, got pay? (my friends said you'll be paid in the army, though I don't quite believe such good thing will happen)<br><br>~ How frequently do you get to get out from camp? What's the duration each time? Err...how's the food in there like? (Haha...lame question, I know, but well...everyone has got different types of concerns...)<br><br>~ How's training like? I know it's tough...but how tough? What else does one learns and does except for physical training?<br><br>~ How's the people in there like? As in, do you still get see lots of ah bengs like you do in secondary school?<br><br>~ Finally...how terrible will your time be in there if your physical fitness is like...almost non-existent?<br><br>Thanks ^^</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>~ How long after the A'levels do you have to sign up for NS?</strong><br>You will receive a letter from mindef soon, calling you for a medical checkup at cmpb, which will classify you according to your medical status (from pes A to F; A is healthiest). Since you are an A lvl student, you might enlist in the january or april batch. If you fail your J2 napfa or obese, you will enlist few weeks earlier than the rest of the same batch. If you are under pes C, you will enlist few weeks later.<br><br><strong>~ I heard something about Basic Training. Though I don't know what it is, from the name, I can guess it's kind of a...errr...basic training. But what exactly is it (as in what you do in it?), how long does it last, got pay? (my friends said you'll be paid in the army, though I don't quite believe such good thing will happen) </strong><br>Basic Military Training. At Palau Tekong. You will learn military drills, how to march, how to use a rifle, how to live outfield, undergo physical training for ippt (which is the 'napfa of ns'), run obstacle course, train leadership, etc etc. Normal duration is 9 weeks, can vary depend on your medical status and napfa result.<br><br>It's so rare for you to think that getting paid in army is a good thing. Many often complain that their pay is insufficient.<br><br><strong>~ How frequently do you get to get out from camp? What's the duration each time? Err...how's the food in there like? (Haha...lame question, I know, but well...everyone has got different types of concerns...) </strong><br><br>During bmt, default is once every weekend, except the first 2 weeks you wun get to go home. As for after bmt, it depends on your vocation. You can book out as frequent as everyday to once a week. There are always exceptions though.<br><br>Some ppl like the food some think it sucks, depends on your taste buds.<br><br><strong>~ How's training like? I know it's tough...but how tough? What else does one learns and does except for physical training? </strong><br><br>How tough is considered tough? This is so open-ended, differs from person to person. You might want to ask your seniors. Anyway army is not as tough as last time.<br><br><strong>~ How's the people in there like? As in, do you still get see lots of ah bengs like you do in secondary school? </strong><br><br>Since you are in the A lvl batch, you probably wun get to see much ah bengs. Try to get along with the ppl and make more friends, dun outcast yourself. There will always be ppl whom you dislike and they piss you off, and vice versa.<br><br><strong>~ Finally...how terrible will your time be in there if your physical fitness is like...almost non-existent? </strong><br><br>Dun fret, bmt is there to train you up.<br><br>You can visit the saf forums for more in-depth info abt ns.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>~ How long after the A'levels do you have to sign up for NS?</blockquote>They'll send you a letter telling you when you'll sign up. You'll either sign up in the Dec/Jan batch or March/April batch.<br><br><blockquote>~ I heard something about Basic Training.

(my friends said you'll be paid in the army, though I don't quite believe such good thing will happen)</blockquote>It's what it is, basic training. 4 &amp; 1/2 months if you failed your NAFRA, 3 months otherwise. You are a **** recruit with no pride and being pushed around like a dog by your segerent. You do things like your obstance course, your IPPT, your rifle skills (with shooting range), your field camp (the low point), your marching etc. It's usually the low point of SAF and possibly your life, since you will lose all your pride there. And worse of all you have to live in an island every day, away from civillization. But how bad it is depends on what company you get posted to, some company is worse than others. It's bad but really not that bad, since in recent years there has been a push to make the SAF more easy (kids nowadays have no balls <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )<br><br>The pay is $450 a month if I am not wrong. Your friend wasn't lying to you.<br><br><blockquote>~ How frequently do you get to get out from camp? What's the duration each time? Err...how's the food in there like? (Haha...lame question, I know, but well...everyone has got different types of concerns...)</blockquote>Depends on where you go to. In your BMT in Tekong, and your specialist or officer training you won't get to leave your camp except in the weekends. But if you are lucky and get posted to some places that don't have a bunk you can stay out. You book in on the morning and book out on the evening to go home. If you are lucky.<br><br>The food there will be the worst food you have ever eaten in your life. That's all you need to know.<br><br><blockquote>~ How's training like? I know it's tough...but how tough? What else does one learns and does except for physical training?</blockquote>Depends on where you go. As I said in recent years they have been making SAF more humane and more safe, so no matter how hard the training is you won't die from it. As for what you learn, why bother?<br><br><blockquote>~ How's the people in there like? As in, do you still get see lots of ah bengs like you do in secondary school?</blockquote>You'll see a lot of Ah Bengs (who will all learn how to smoke from SAF) but most of the time you'll hang out with people from JC and Poly. Unless you become a specialist and have to take change of those Ah Bengs.<br><br><blockquote>~ Finally...how terrible will your time be in there if your physical fitness is like...almost non-existent?</blockquote>Very, firstly because one of the source of your lost of pride is the fact that everyone is fitter than you. But more importanly you MUST pass your IPPT fitness test, and if your fitness is bad enough (like mine) you might not be able to pass your BMT and you'll have to do another 3 months of the same ****. Trust me, you don't want to do that.</div>
