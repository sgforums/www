Unfortunately, I have no idea of how to get close to her.<br>Whenever I meet her, she will be avoiding my eye contact or worse, I will be the one avoiding hers due to my shyness.<br>Well, we have been exchanging "HI!"s these days but nothing more.<br>I can't take it anymore, I need to at least know if she likes me too.<br>Now, all I can do is to stand around and hope to catch her without her usual company of friends and try to cook up a conversation.<br>At least, I know she don't mind spending time talking to me...<br><br>Any "tactics" to give an eager student ?<br></div>

Even if their friends started gossip or whatever, just ignore or simply say "yah, I am chasing her, so what?"<br><br>To start a conversation anything will do. Remember my first sentence with my gf was "Take bus ah?" when we both were sitting on the same bus going home.<br><br>finally some killer moves.<br>Threaten with her "Ai kia stead mai? if not<br>I cry hor"<br>"dun go stead with me I beat you ah"<br><br>Hehe last part just joking, brain short circuit liao with heavy work load... come here to relax<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>next time you catch a conversation with her, casually ask if she would like to have lunch with you or go for a movie.  eg, 'have you watched Eating Air?'  if she has, then maybe ask whether want to catch another movie together or if she has not, then invite her to watch with you.<br><br>if she's shy, then suggest a group date where each of you bring along a fren.<br><br>but if she keeps declining your dates, then prob she doesn't like you.  however, it's normal if she declines your first date, then you should just keep asking the next few times you meet.  b'cos once you asked her, she knows you want to go out with her, and she'll prob be prepared the next time you ask her.<br><br>hope it's not too confusing and you catch the drift.<br><br>good luck and have a little courage.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for the help guys!<br><br>Hobbes, when you said to ask the girl for a movie, wouldn't she REALISE that you are trying to woo her ?<br>Wouldn't she give you a funny look or something?<br><br>Cryogenic, I do have her phone number.<br>But you don't just call someone for no reason right? What should I do ?<br><br>Orion, I would love to hear more of your "bus love story".<br>Could you please please please tell me what when on next?<br>What happened after you ask her "taking bus?". How did your relationship bloom?<br><br>Don't know why, still veri shy leh. Keep on saying the wrong things in front of her. Perhaps I should try the "direct" method.<br>After I go cut my hair (Then can become "yandao"), I just walk straight into her face and ask her if she wants to go out with me.<br>Any comments guys ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>dear croag: one of the 'indirect' way of knowing whether someone likes you or not is to try to date her.<br><br>sure, she'll give you a funny look the first time, but only for the first time.  but if she likes you, she might wait for you to ask her a 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th time, ... if she doesn't, she wouldn't avoid you but when you try asking her out subsequently, she'll juz politely decline you or come out with reasons like she's busy with schoolwork, projects, family, ...<br><br>or you can continue finding opportunities to talk to her until the cows come home.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, the idea IS to let her know you like her, silly! If you're to scared to tell, how is she to know? However, if you're afraid of rejection, try talking to her close friends. Ask them what she thinks of you and whether she likes you or not. No, wait. That's too fast... You can't even hold a proper conversation with her... Hmmm... Tough luck then... It looks like you'll have to depend on Lady Luck. Let nature take it's course and try not to rush things. Sooner or later, there'll be a chance to get close to her and know her better... Good luck!<br><br>[This message has been edited by Malbordus (edited 22 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A girl's opinion here...<br><br>Hehe, I must say that the 'Bus' tactic may just work. Provided you 2 catch the same bus home lah. But you still can follow her onto the bus lah... just that you 1) dun let her know where u going (pretend that you can take that bus even if u can't)... 2) get off the bus after her... 3)make sure her frens are not around... then you can take the chance to sit beside her on the bus. Start a conversation.<br><br>Before I bumped into my fren on the bus on the way home... we usually didn't talk much. But it improved after we met each other... but of course, this is coincidental one lah. Get to talk to her because... unless she really wants to avoid you... she'll have to get off the bus (before her stop). So, you get to sorta accompany her home and at the same time... talk.<br><br>Err, if you are really that shy... then ask your frens (those that you trust, will keep the secret) to help you find out. Must make sure the sources are reliable also lah.<br><br>Or, you could try the "asking her out" thing. Strike when the iron is hot, i.e., maybe in the movies, when it's dark... you try to hold her hand (this one you must have a lot of guts)... or you can always bring her to a scary movie. So, she'll come to you when she's SUPER scared. But first must make sure you also not scared of horror movies lah.<br></div>
