            <div class='col-md body'>The Ministry of Governmental Salaries Oversight Committee announced today that in light of the poor performance of the global economy, the salaries of ministers will be raised. It is hoped that this drastic measure will encourage our government leaders to work harder and help Singapore regain its competitive edge quickly.<br><br>"Now that the economy is doing poorly, Ministers and top civil servants will have to work harder and longer hours. It only makes sense that their efforts do not go unrewarded," said Mr Foo Lo Chit, chairman of the Oversight Committee. "Obviously they're not getting paid enough now, which is why our economy has gone into a technical recession. We must take immediate action to correct this injustice."<br><br>Although details of the new pay package is confidential, Mr Foo hinted that in light of Singapore's recent National Day celebrations, some Ministers might get up to a symbolic 36% pay increment. Mr Foo declined to give more details, explaining: "How would you like it if I announced your salary to everyone in Singapore?"<br><br>Public reactions to this move have been overwhelmingly positive. A poll of three people around the office revealed that 66% of respondents feel that this initiative could only bring success to Singapore.<br><br>"It's always worked before, what," commented Mdm See Cher Suo, 'Director' of Janitorial Services, "Every time the economy is okay, it?s because the gahmen is getting paid a lot. Now times are bad, naturally should pay them more!"<br><br>Responses from government leaders have been more mixed. While most welcomed the move, some felt that these new measures have not gone far enough.<br><br>"I've just bought two new Mercs and shares in a pillowcase factory in Suzhou," complained a leader who wishes to remain anonymous, "Surely the taxpayers have a moral obligation to incentivize me to boost the economy by subsidizing my expenses!"<br><br>Others were more philosophical. "Times are very rough now, and we all must do what we have to in order to survive. So I guess I have no choice but to accept the pay raise."<br><br></div>

I read it before.<br><br>for commercial companies, you're right, they won't do it. The article is poking fun at the (not so) recent announcment by the govt to change their wage system in view of the (then) widespread cutting of pay and losing of jobs.<br><br>If you remember, they said that they won't take a fixed salary (which is already very high) but will adopt a flexi wage system that, when economy is bad, they will take their (very high) minimum wage. When times are good, they will get proportional increament (or something like that). I'm not too sure about the exactly wordings or system, but this is the rough idea.<br><br>I may have misunderstood some points tho... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>we all know why stocks command higher returns than bonds. because stocks carry a lot more risks than bonds.  stock worth $100 today maybe worth nothing tomorrow.  on the other hand, bondholders enjoy regular coupon payments and get their principal back.  because stocks are riskier, they command a higher price over bonds.<br><br>similarly, private sector jobs are riskier compared to jobs in the public sector.  chief financial officer today maybe sacked tomorrow and end up washing dishes at hawker centre. but what about a top civil servant?  no risk whatsover the outcome of the economy.<br><br>so what happens when a bondholder demands a stock price?</div>
