We don't even need to mention China.<br><br>In my opinion, though factory workers aren't paid much, their pay is much higher than other menial jobs like public cleaners etc. There is only so much a employer can do. They can either lower their costs or raise their margin. But there is only how much margin they can raise to remain competitive. The alternative is to keep costs down.<br><br>Isn't it better to have low pay then to have the company collapse and have no pay at all, with unemployment to boot.<br><br>As well, no one said life is fair. How much one deserves is dependent very much on one's own doing. If it is not possible to break out of the poverty circle, there will not be so many rags-to-riches stories.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>sooooo...... now i know why those 52" plasma tvs cost so much......</strong><br><br>I believe for all electronic products especially those with new technology built in they will cost a lot even if the manufacturing cost is little. The reason is simple. The company wanna recoup the research money they spent in their labs for the new technology. They know very soon the new technology will be copied and produced and then price will drop alot. So when first release muz charge high to earn first else later earn very little liao with copy cats in market under-cut your price.<br><br>I think this is logical deduction?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it would be better if they diverted the money from professions like lawyers, doctors, PAP members so that we get a little bit more than usual. What are those people doing anyway? They don't need all the money, and it's not like the are working hard to earn their keep. Don't you think?</div>

I use to pay up only the minimum of $100 each month until I save enough to pay lump sum. Total loan was something like $20K I think. Don't need to make your life miserable by paying more than you are willing to pay. Parent can also discuss if you find it tough. But it depends on how reasonable your parents are too. I got a friend who gives $800 per month to her parents and I am always amazed by that.<br><br>Can forget car and house if you are not at least above average in income. Housing, if really needed, can consider 3-rm or even 1-2 rm flat. 3 rm can get about $120K with grant in the northern region (~$480/mth for 30 year HDB loan), 1-2 Rm will be less.</div>
