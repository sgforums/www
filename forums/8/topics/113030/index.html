            <div class='col-md body'>NSFs get $300-400??  Shucks, when I was in BMT, I only got $95 per month.<br><br>Actually, a lot of these factory workers get paid more than S$800 per month because they're on rotating shift duties and the graveyard shifts usually earn more (twice more, if I'm not mistaken).  The average pay is about S$1k+ per month lah.<br><br>Its definitely not enough if you're trying to support a family in Singapore.  You have 3 kids, each one ask for one pair of those wheelies (those shoes with wheels, whatever you call them), finish liow.<br><br>But many of these workers are from Malaysia, who shuttle back and forth between JB and Singapore (with the help of company transportation).  $1K+ = RM 2500....which is higher than many fresh grad's pay in Malaysia.<br><br>Geeee....I currently work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and I get nothing!

            <div class='col-md body'>Most of the factory workers are foreigners - either Malaysians or Chinese.  I know of a Malaysian who has saved enough money as a factory worker here to buy an apartment in JB!<br><br>The Singaporeans who work there are mainly bored old housewifes whose kids have grown up, so they just want to escape from the loneliness at home, etc.<br><br>There are, however, a handful of Singaporeans who work at these factories and its really a pitiful case.  I heard of this guy who would finish his shift near midnight and would walk out 20 minutes to catch the bus.  When asked why he didn't want to take the feeder bus out, he said he needed to save every single cent because he's the only one who earns in his family.<br><br>Very heartbreaking to hear of such stories hor?

I wonder how could anyone survive in singapore with only 800 dollars a month ? a salary in the 80's to compromise modern living standard in singapore...<br><br>Curious, i call up and ask... and the deal i got was that i can work OT to supplement the short-fall... working 12hrs a day, 7 days a week, i could earn a decent 2k+.. that their OT is end-less, and i could work forever if my health permit...<br><br>I was sad, not because i don't have a choice.. i am sad because i know some fellow singaporeans, who don't have a choice will take up the job thats being exploit by the cunning employer... sad that salary in the 80's is still around when our GDP was peg at 8.1% ...</div></blockquote>If the Govt set a min wage requirement for the workers the cost of manufacturing the good goes up. Most likely the factory will be relocated to China or Malaysia resulting in the increase of the unemployed.<br><br>Anyway most manufacturers here are at the mercy of their customers (being sub contracted manufacturers). Bigger US companies will force the manufacturer to meet their price or renew the contract with a cheaper overseas manufacturer. I know of an instance where a company was forced to supply below cost in order to maintain the contract. In cases like this cost will have to be cut else the company would go under, workers pay etc. Even the company director's took on mortgages on their houses to help out.

In Manufacturing the only thing that Singapore can offer is quality, accuracy &amp; speed even those areas are being fast caught up on. Every manufacturing equipment available to us is now also available to them which places Singapore on par. Heavy reliance is now on a good management to put together a skilled labour pool at a price in order to provide what Singapore can offer best.<br><br>Btw majority of the workers are Malaysians which come over cause they can earn more then working in the factories over there (the rate is something like 500 RM a month which is what my relative gets as a bank teller).<br><br>I too would be happy if the lower income workforce got a better pay or subsidy. But this will result in a direct cost on the economy or government which I'm pretty sure they're not willing to inccur.<br><br>A place like Australian has good welfare system and min wage law, then again with their multitude of natural resources they can maintain that having other things to export. Also the personal tax is 30 - 40% to subsidies the lower income population.<br></div>
