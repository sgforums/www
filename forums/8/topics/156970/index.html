Gates' foresight and his vision for personal computing have been central to the success of Microsoft and the software industry.<br><br>Under Gates' leadership, Microsoft's mission has been to continually advance and improve software technology, and to make it easier, more cost-effective and more enjoyable for people to use computers.

Six weeks later the family moved to Munich and he began his schooling there at the Luitpold Gymnasium. Later, they moved to Italy and Albert continued his education at Aarau, Switzerland and in 1896 he entered the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich to be trained as a teacher in physics and mathematics. In 1901, the year he gained his diploma, he acquired Swiss citizenship and, as he was unable to find a teaching post, he accepted a position as technical assistant in the Swiss Patent Office. In 1905 he obtained his doctor's degree.<br><br>Einstein's researches are, of course, well chronicled and his more important works include Special Theory of Relativity (1905), Relativity (English translations, 1920 and 1950), General Theory of Relativity (1916), Investigations on Theory of Brownian Movement (1926), and The Evolution of Physics (193Eight). Among his non-scientific works, About Zionism (1930), Why War? (1933), My Philosophy (1934), and Out of My Later Years (1950) are perhaps the most important.<br><br>Albert Einstein received honorary doctorate degrees in science, medicine and philosophy from many European and American universities. During the 1920's he lectured in Europe, America and the Far East and he was awarded Fellowships or Memberships of all the leading scientific academies throughout the world.

            <div class='col-md body'>although Bill Gates contribution to the IT world is undeniable, Albert Einstein is a far greater man den Gates.. he devoted his lifetime into his research not for the sake of fame &amp; money but for the benefit of mankind &amp; to the world of physics. Gates is jus businessman wif tremendous foresight, but how much does he contribute back to the society??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The odds of Bush grabbing the nobby was 1000-1, I'm sure MJ would have faired much better.<br><br>Einstein was and is (Lived on by his works) a genius. Gates too is a genius in his own right, and a very successful entrepreneur. Their works have influenced the way we see and do things, and have added to the betterment of mankind. So I guess admiration should be confered on both.</div>
