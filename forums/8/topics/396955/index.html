              <p>In today's newspaper,</p>
              <p>There is some coverage about some commission or some body, whose head is quoted in saying, that there is nothing wrong with radio DJs using Indian accents for jokes.</p>
              <p>This makes me a little bit preplexed.</p>
              <p>One would think that as the chairman of such a body, he would be having a more enhanced sense of sensitivity. But what happens is the opposite.</p>
              <p>He said, since it is a joke, and there is no explicit content which is insulting or denigrating other groups, it is Ok.</p>
              <p>The newspaper in another article, reveals the result of instant street interview / poll.</p>
              <p>It shows that nearly 40% of respondents say that they would object / be offended / disapprove.</p>
              <p>Some of them are non-Indians.</p>
              <p>This makes me wonder, why is the chairman is so disconnected from reality.</p>
              <p>Why it happens that way.</p>
              <p>Is this an indication of bigger things?</p>
              <p>That once people sit as high level bureaucrats, that they lose their proper senses ?</p>
              <p>Or maybe as a chairman of a powerful body, maybe he does not want to exercise his power easily, so therefore he hesitates, and as a result, overcompensate, or can not exercise his judgements accurately.</p>
              <p>Whatever the case, there must be an evaluation. There is systemic failure.</p>
              <p>This is the opposite case with some other bodies.</p>
              <p>There is another supervisory body, who is so proactive and on, that they barged in into a private event, and stopped a movie screening and seized the CD. This happened some time ago. Just because it has some "political content"</p>

              <p>Yo, ah neh, in hokkien and teochew, Chairmen mean blind men, so what do you expect from a blind person, just take his paid and enjoy life. Sometimes, i buy indian foods, they indians also disturb me with singlish accent, so how??? as a multi racial society, we must learn to tolerate each other, you cannot have the best of the both world, yes, of course being in the public, or as a public speaker, by taking other people culture or language as a joke is uncall for, but then dun we all do it once a while, like i like to use the PRC gals way of throwing responsible away...when something seriously gone wrong...just said... Wo Bu Zi Tau..(I dunno) and everything is not your problem already. Learn ya</p>

              <p>Mocking of indian accent has been happening for ages. However, I feel that as DJs, they ought to have more sense and know that mocking of indian accent is distasteful, especially if they do it day after day. It not only sows discord among races (I might be exagerrating), but also gives people a bad impression of them. Hopefully, with this brought to attention, the DJs will come to their senses and stop this senseless mocking.</p>
