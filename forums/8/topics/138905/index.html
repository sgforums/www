            <div class='col-md body'>Alright, say you are blessed with a decent look and you are a wonderful man with a great sense of humor. Women love your company, and always like to be around you.<br><br>You have known many beautiful women; youÂ’ve had exciting conversations, fun outings and really close moments together with them.<br><br>So, when you have finally decided to Â“do itÂ” and pop the magical question, they tell you:<br><br>Â“YouÂ’re a great guy, but we should just stay as friendsÂ…Â”<br>Â“YouÂ’re really nice, but youÂ’re not the type for me, letÂ’s stay as friends, shall we?Â”<br>Â“YouÂ’ll always be my best friend!Â”<br><br>ItÂ’s always when you start to express romantic feelings for them, they begin to isolate themselves from you or quickly notifies you as their friends.<br><br>Worse still, they tell you they like great guys with characters like you, but end up with another guy that is different.<br><br>And you are still alone.<br><br>What is the problem?<br><br>Man, having brainwashed from media &amp; female propaganda, has always been following this set of rule:<br><br>1) Befriend her first,<br>2) Chat with her to know her better, and let her know you better,<br>3) Ask her out for casual lunch and movies, to know her MORE and let her know you MORE.<br>4) Give her presents on her birthday and stupid occasions, begin to let her know that you like her.<br>5) Let her know that you like her officially, ask her out for an official date.<br>6) Live happily ever after.<br><br>Well, we are not saying this set of rule doesnÂ’t work, we are just saying it OVERWORKED most of the time.<br><br>Man, ask check out if you are suffering from the Â‘Nice FriendÂ’ syndromes<br><br>- You are always there for her when she needed somebody to talk to.<br>- You will always cheer her up when she feels bad.<br>- You compliment her hair on a bad hair day.<br>- You talk to her everyday and know everything about her.<br>- You know exactly what kind of guy she likes and hates.<br>- You know her motherÂ’s birthday.<br>- You never fail to get her presents on occasions.<br>- Goes out with her when she feels bored.<br><br>The real issue<br><br>Men do not understand, but attraction does not work the Friendship way. Women are attracted to a man who is unpredictable and challenging.<br><br>Being always there for her and giving her so many attention, in a context of friend, works in developing stronger friendship, but never heavier attraction.<br><br>In the dating jungle, being overly nice and sensitive might get you to the top, but it never holds you there for long. In actual fact, it is a turn off.</div>
