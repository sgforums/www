            <div class='col-md body'>This article is interesting...<br><br><a href="http://english.pravda.ru/usa/2003/03/23/44874.html" rel="nofollow">http://english.pravda.ru/usa/2003/03/23/44874.html</a><br><br>02:31 2003-03-23<br><br><strong>USA Steals IraqÂ’s Assets</strong><br><br>The Bush administration and its allies have added thievery to its growing list of criminal actions after three days of terrorist and murderous activities in Iraq have left hundreds of civilians injured and at least five dead. These are war crimes. Bush, Rumsfeld, Blair, Hoon and their administrations are terrorists, murderers and war criminals.<br><br>Washington has stolen 1,740,000,000 USD of Iraqi assets held in the United States of America in 18 banks, claiming that it will be sued for the reconstruction of Iraq after the removal of Saddam HusseinÂ’s regime. In a further action of blatant arrogance, Washington asked the international community to close Iraqi embassies and to expel its diplomats, a move which was met with a humiliating and resounding No, almost without exception.<br><br>Washington claims that none of the ambassadors appointed by the BaÂ’ath regime of Saddam Hussein will be allowed to perform their duties by the new government of Iraq (which it has already carefully chosen).<br><br>Washington has no right under international law to interfere in the affairs of a sovereign state. Like the colonial powers which created the hotspots in the world today by drawing lines on maps with the philosophy Â“This is ours and that is yoursÂ”, the many straight lines visible in any Atlas bearing witness to this, Washington intends to install a western-style government in a geographical area in which this model is alien. One has only to look at all the other countries in the region.<br><br>Freedom and democracy, as usual, are the flags waved by the USA, a country in which the media is far from free, a country which practices censorship, which uses blackmail in its international diplomacy, treating the UN Security Council with overbearing despotism and now, on top of this, Washington commits acts of terrorism, murdering innocent Iraqi civilians in an illegal war.<br><br>Difficult times lie ahead. Washington and London wrongly imagine that the rest of the world will soon forgive and forget this war once the economy takes up again. This will not happen, since the anti-war movements are all connected, determined and are pooling resources. The world is uniting against a new wave of tyranny, the world reacts against a new evil.<br><br>This act of terrorism, these acts of murder, are the beginning of the end for the Bush and Blair governments. No administration has the right to flout international law, disregard the United Nations, attack a sovereign state, remove its government and install a puppet regime so that its resources can be stolen.<br><br>George Bush, Donald Rumsfeld, Tony Blair and Geoff Hoon are hereby notified that they are guilty of acts of murder in Iraq and will be accordingly prosecuted under the norms of international law, the terms of which they chose to break.<br><br>These anachronisms are a block to the progress of humankind and will pay the price of all those before them who misjudged the moment, went too far and paid the price as the heavy hand of History has so often proved.<br><br>Timothy BANCROFT-HINCHEY<br>PRAVDA.Ru<br><br></div>

It both emboldens the blood, just as it narrows the mind. And when the drums of war have reached a fever pitch and the blood boils with hate and the mind has closed, the leader will have no need in seizing the rights of the citizenry. Rather, the citizenry, infused with fear and blinded by patriotism, will offer up all of their rights unto the leader and gladly so. How do I know? For this is what I have done.

            <div class='col-md body'>Russian military intel report: March 22 UPDATE<br>22.03.2003 [23:46]<br><br>March 22, 2002, 1300hrs MSK (GMT +3), Moscow - Additional information about the situation in the primary combat areas in southern Iraq became available by 1300hrs (Moscow time, GMT +3). The US command reports about the supposed surrender of the entire Iraqi 51st Infantry Division turned out to be a complete fabrication. According to our sources the 51st Division continues to fight on the approaches to Basra and we can only talk about individual cases of Iraqi soldiers being captured in combat.<br><br>Elements of the US 3rd Infantry Division and the 1st Marine Infantry Division ended up in an exceptionally difficult situation. While attempting to encircle Basra from the north and to block An-Nasiriya? elements the 3rd and 1st infantry divisions found themselves wedged between the defending Iraqi forces. The Iraqi command used this situation and delivered a decisive counterattack with up to 80 tanks in the open flank of the US forces, slicing through their combat orders. As the result of this counterattack these US units are now at risk of being separated from the main coalition forces and being surrounded.<br><br>By 1100hrs MSK Iraqi units advanced into the US attack front by 10-15 kilometers and Gen. Tommy Franks, the commander of the coalition forces, ordered his troops to switch entirely to defensive operations. At the same time he issued orders to the forward-deployed coalition tank units to halt their reconnaissance operations in the directions of Es-Samaba? and An-Najaf? and to move immediately to support the defending US forces. However, the situation is complicated by the fact that a part of the coalition tanks are currently disabled due to the lack of fuel and are awaiting the arrival of fuel convoys. Thus the tanks are able to gradually rejoin combat in small numbers as the fuel becomes available.<br><br>Currently the US and the Iraqi tank forces are engaged in mobile head-on combat approximately 70-90 kilometers to the south of An-Nasiriya?. Combat orders have been received by the carrier borne aviation in the Persian Gulf, which until now did not take part in this battle. At the same time orders were issued to all available coalition strike aircraft in Qatar to scramble in support of the defending coalition forces.<br><br>Intercepted radio communications indicate that during the morning period of March 22 the US forces lost 10-15 tanks destroyed or disabled and up to 30 other armored vehicles. Medevac helicopters flew more than 30 search-and-rescue missions, which suggests heavy coalition losses.<br><br>Our sources report that during the early morning hours in southwestern Iraq in the vicinity of Akashat the Iraqi forces have engaged and surrounded a tactical paratroop unit of the 101st Airborne Division. Some of the surrounded paratroopers were able to break out into the desert, where they request air support and finally lost their Iraqi pursuers. However, up to 30 US troops were killed or captured in this engagement. Additionally, Russian radio intercept units report that one the US attack helicopters providing close air support was shot down.<br><br>The top US military command is planning to enhance the coalition command. During the Joint Chief of Staff meeting its Chairman Gen. Richard Mayers expressed strong criticism of the actions by the coalition commander Gen. Franks and proposed to strengthen his headquarters with several other senior military commanders. Gen. Franks is required to do everything he can to change the current situation on the front. Analysts believe that, if during the next 3-5 days Gen. Franks fails to achieve any significant results, than it is entirely possible that he will be replaced as the commander of the coalition forces.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm, i saw the interview of the iraq women. they revealed alot of evil stuff the iraq ppl did, one of the interviewee's sister 16 years old was taken for writing some stuff against the governement. the teacher saw it and told the higher authority. then the sister was taken, was beaten everyday, then used shock treatment on her sensitive areas of her body, then later was thrown to a "raping hall" where all the officials would rape her, and taped it to send to the higher officials, to show them what a good job they are doing. they also send the tape to family members. and sometime not only the "guilty one" is taken, sometime the whole family is taken. the threat of rape as a humilation to the women controls the women, and controls the men as well. not only that, the monster saddam even used gas, and biological weapons on his people, tested on his countrymen, thousands of women, men, and children killed. poisoned, foaming in the mouth, lying on the street. tell me. why isn't this war justified? you think the people really supports saddam? they are only showing their support cuz they also believe in their god allah, and saddam would win in the end, cuz allah is on saddam's side, and anyone who shows their support elsewhere will suffer later after the war. they are afraid. TELL ME, WHY THIS WAR ISN'T JUSTIFIED. those "peace lovers" have no idea what the people are going through and they are so superficial.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jeremiah 50<br><br>A Message About Babylon, today known as iraq<br><br>1 This is the word the LORD spoke through Jeremiah the prophet concerning Babylon and the land of the Babylonians [1] :<br><br>2 "Announce and proclaim among the nations,<br>lift up a banner and proclaim it;<br>keep nothing back, but say,<br>'Babylon will be captured;<br>Bel will be put to shame,<br>Marduk filled with terror.<br>Her images will be put to shame<br>and her idols filled with terror.'<br>3 A nation from the north will attack her<br>and lay waste her land.<br>No one will live in it;<br>both men and animals will flee away.<br><br>4 "In those days, at that time,"<br>declares the LORD ,<br>"the people of Israel and the people of Judah together<br>will go in tears to seek the LORD their God.<br>5 They will ask the way to Zion<br>and turn their faces toward it.<br>They will come and bind themselves to the LORD<br>in an everlasting covenant<br>that will not be forgotten.<br><br>6 "My people have been lost sheep;<br>their shepherds have led them astray<br>and caused them to roam on the mountains.<br>They wandered over mountain and hill<br>and forgot their own resting place.<br>7 Whoever found them devoured them;<br>their enemies said, 'We are not guilty,<br>for they sinned against the LORD , their true pasture,<br>the LORD , the hope of their fathers.'<br><br>8 "Flee out of Babylon;<br>leave the land of the Babylonians,<br>and be like the goats that lead the flock.<br>9 For I will stir up and bring against Babylon<br>an alliance of great nations from the land of the north.<br>They will take up their positions against her,<br>and from the north she will be captured.<br>Their arrows will be like skilled warriors<br>who do not return empty-handed.<br>10 So Babylonia [2] will be plundered;<br>all who plunder her will have their fill,"<br>declares the LORD .<br><br>11 "Because you rejoice and are glad,<br>you who pillage my inheritance,<br>because you frolic like a heifer threshing grain<br>and neigh like stallions,<br>12 your mother will be greatly ashamed;<br>she who gave you birth will be disgraced.<br>She will be the least of the nations-<br>a wilderness, a dry land, a desert.<br>13 Because of the LORD's anger she will not be inhabited<br>but will be completely desolate.<br>All who pass Babylon will be horrified and scoff<br>because of all her wounds.<br><br>14 "Take up your positions around Babylon,<br>all you who draw the bow.<br>Shoot at her! Spare no arrows,<br>for she has sinned against the LORD .<br>15 Shout against her on every side!<br>She surrenders, her towers fall,<br>her walls are torn down.<br>Since this is the vengeance of the LORD ,<br>take vengeance on her;<br>do to her as she has done to others.<br>16 Cut off from Babylon the sower,<br>and the reaper with his sickle at harvest.<br>Because of the sword of the oppressor<br>let everyone return to his own people,<br>let everyone flee to his own land.<br><br>17 "Israel is a scattered flock<br>that lions have chased away.<br>The first to devour him<br>was the king of Assyria;<br>the last to crush his bones<br>was Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon."<br><br>18 Therefore this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says:<br><br>"I will punish the king of Babylon and his land<br>as I punished the king of Assyria.<br>19 But I will bring Israel back to his own pasture<br>and he will graze on Carmel and Bashan;<br>his appetite will be satisfied<br>on the hills of Ephraim and Gilead.<br>20 In those days, at that time,"<br>declares the LORD ,<br>"search will be made for Israel's guilt,<br>but there will be none,<br>and for the sins of Judah,<br>but none will be found,<br>for I will forgive the remnant I spare.<br><br>21 "Attack the land of Merathaim<br>and those who live in Pekod.<br>Pursue, kill and completely destroy [3] them,"<br>declares the LORD .<br>"Do everything I have commanded you.<br>22 The noise of battle is in the land,<br>the noise of great destruction!<br>23 How broken and shattered<br>is the hammer of the whole earth!<br>How desolate is Babylon<br>among the nations!<br>24 I set a trap for you, O Babylon,<br>and you were caught before you knew it;<br>you were found and captured<br>because you opposed the LORD .<br>25 The LORD has opened his arsenal<br>and brought out the weapons of his wrath,<br>for the Sovereign LORD Almighty has work to do<br>in the land of the Babylonians.<br>26 Come against her from afar.<br>Break open her granaries;<br>pile her up like heaps of grain.<br>Completely destroy her<br>and leave her no remnant.<br>27 Kill all her young bulls;<br>let them go down to the slaughter!<br>Woe to them! For their day has come,<br>the time for them to be punished.<br>28 Listen to the fugitives and refugees from Babylon<br>declaring in Zion<br>how the LORD our God has taken vengeance,<br>vengeance for his temple.<br><br>29 "Summon archers against Babylon,<br>all those who draw the bow.<br>Encamp all around her;<br>let no one escape.<br>Repay her for her deeds;<br>do to her as she has done.<br>For she has defied the LORD ,<br>the Holy One of Israel.<br>30 Therefore, her young men will fall in the streets;<br>all her soldiers will be silenced in that day,"<br>declares the LORD .<br>31 "See, I am against you, O arrogant one,"<br>declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty,<br>"for your day has come,<br>the time for you to be punished.<br>32 The arrogant one will stumble and fall<br>and no one will help her up;<br>I will kindle a fire in her towns<br>that will consume all who are around her."<br><br>33 This is what the LORD Almighty says:<br><br>"The people of Israel are oppressed,<br>and the people of Judah as well.<br>All their captors hold them fast,<br>refusing to let them go.<br>34 Yet their Redeemer is strong;<br>the LORD Almighty is his name.<br>He will vigorously defend their cause<br>so that he may bring rest to their land,<br>but unrest to those who live in Babylon.<br><br>35 "A sword against the Babylonians!"<br>declares the LORD -<br>"against those who live in Babylon<br>and against her officials and wise men!<br>36 A sword against her false prophets!<br>They will become fools.<br>A sword against her warriors!<br>They will be filled with terror.<br>37 A sword against her horses and chariots<br>and all the foreigners in her ranks!<br>They will become women.<br>A sword against her treasures!<br>They will be plundered.<br>38 A drought on [4] her waters!<br>They will dry up.<br>For it is a land of idols,<br>idols that will go mad with terror.<br><br>39 "So desert creatures and hyenas will live there,<br>and there the owl will dwell.<br>It will never again be inhabited<br>or lived in from generation to generation.<br>40 As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah<br>along with their neighboring towns,"<br>declares the LORD ,<br>"so no one will live there;<br>no man will dwell in it.<br><br>41 "Look! An army is coming from the north;<br>a great nation and many kings<br>are being stirred up from the ends of the earth.<br>42 They are armed with bows and spears;<br>they are cruel and without mercy.<br>They sound like the roaring sea<br>as they ride on their horses;<br>they come like men in battle formation<br>to attack you, O Daughter of Babylon.<br>43 The king of Babylon has heard reports about them,<br>and his hands hang limp.<br>Anguish has gripped him,<br>pain like that of a woman in labor.<br>44 Like a lion coming up from Jordan's thickets<br>to a rich pastureland,<br>I will chase Babylon from its land in an instant.<br>Who is the chosen one I will appoint for this?<br>Who is like me and who can challenge me?<br>And what shepherd can stand against me?"<br>45 Therefore, hear what the LORD has planned against Babylon,<br>what he has purposed against the land of the Babylonians:<br>The young of the flock will be dragged away;<br>he will completely destroy their pasture because of them.<br>46 At the sound of Babylon's capture the earth will tremble;<br>its cry will resound among the nations.<br><br></div>

The 1/10 are linked to Saddam Hussein's regime.<br><br>The invasion should be seen through the eyes of the Iraqi people. Whether there is war or no war, Iraqis are dying.<br><br>Allow me to recap Saddam's murderous 24 years in power.<br><br><strong>1979-present day</strong><br><br>Ruthlessly purged Iraq of groups or individuals who were seen as being anti-Saddam, even remotely, including butchering the Iraqi Shia in the south, and gassing Iraqi Kurds in the north. Three million Iraqis are living in exile because of Saddam, my father among them.<br><br>Unlike most refugees, Iraqi exiles long to return to Iraq.<br><br><strong>1980-1988</strong><br><br>Invaded Iran; half a million Iraqis died in a pointless conflict which cost Iraq dearly in human and financial terms. This does not include the half a million Iranians who also died. Most Iraqis killed in this war were Shia.<br><br>The Iraqi Shia are less fundamental and more liberal than their Iranian neighbours. In fact, most Iraqi Shia do not want Iraq to become a theocratic state like Iran.<br><br><strong>1990-1991</strong><br><br>Invaded Kuwait; this led to 100,000 Iraqi deaths. Saddam led Iraq into yet another catastrophic military campaign, torching oil fields and killing innocent Kuwaitis.<br><br>The greatest opportunity for regime change came after this war, with revolts occurring all around Iraq, but the allied back-up to maintain those uprisings never materialised and the people were crushed ruthlessly by Saddam's Republican Guards.<br><br><strong>1990-2003</strong><br><br>Iraq, which has the second-largest oil reserves in the world, has been subjected to a humiliating 12 years of United Nations-imposed sanctions.<br><br>This reduced a once rich and proud nation to misery and poverty. So, where does it all end?<br><br>I quote my father: 'We Iraqis need an electric shock; we, an intelligent and cultured people, allowed a thug to rise to power and lead Iraq from one disaster to another. If the electric shock comes in the form of an American invasion, then so be it.'<br><br>To all those who are anti-war, I suggest that they go to Iraq and experience life in Saddam's Iraq.<br><br>They will soon change their view and understand why Iraqis await the day when they are rescued from the evil regime.<br><br>LAITH MUHMOOD AL ADELY<br><br></div>
