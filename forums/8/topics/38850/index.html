It all depends on the situation. If a quick fix is necessary( eg. WW2), then maybe it's something inevitable.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by gasband:</div><div class="quote_body">Since he has such disregards for human lives, it is time to take him out  and the best way is war and after the war, it may take time, but it shall liberate Iraqis from a country of no human rights just as Afghanistan was.<br><br>Cheers.</div></blockquote>ermm...I think as long as there are oilfields in that region of the world, the countries there will always be the subject of conflict and will never be truly free and liberated.<br>We can only hope, i sincerely hope what u said will come true as well <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

USA may prove to be an ven bigger  bully in Iraq than the current oppressor, Saddam. But that remains an uncertainty. But if SADDAM does not GO, the  CERTAINTY is that Iraqis would continue to live under oppressing environments, women will forever be 2nd class, there is no room to even discuss politics without fear. So, if Saddam goes, Iraqis at least have a chance to live a good life, under Saddam, there is none.</div>
