            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br>This is my first post in this forum. Today, I would like to tell u a sexual harassment event, which happened in a university campus. A girl live in campus hostel. One day, she went to a friend's room to borrow books, her friend was not in his room but his roommate only. The guy molested the girl. The girl did not report to the police. But she punished the guy by posting this event in the school web-site. She posted the guy's detailed personal information and with his photos. and forward it through icq. It became hot topic in the campus and everyone knew that who he is and what he did. And a local newspaper also reported this event because of her posting. According to the newspaper, she said that she didn't report to the police because she doesn't want to see the guy losing anything. He may be charged with sexual harassment and university may kick him out. Aha, Actually, he already lost very very much liao, how can he face his schoolmates, friends, his parents and himself? He may escape from prosecution, but he is facing the blame form the society and ethical punishment.  no one saw him in the campus after this event, you can imagine that how dare he go to school again. Is this punishment too heavy to him?<br><br>ehm, don't get me wrong, I am not expressing my sympathy to this guy or saying something for him. As a girl, I definitely pissed  off these molesters, especially, it happened in campus. University students are so-called high-educated group in the society, but I don't know why there are still so many sexual harassment events in campus. Why? Why? I wonderÂ¡K.<br>Back to this event, I don't think it is the best way to punish the molester by posting it in internet. What punishment should he get? I think it should be judged by law.  give him a fair punishment even if he is a evil criminal, If I were the girl, I would call the police. if I were the guy, I also prefer the girl report to police, rather than post it to the internet.<br>What do u think about this event? Share your opinions, pls<br>Riona, as I know that your sister was molested lately. u may quite appreciate the punishment to the molester, right?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, actually I have similar sentiments to those that you've expressed. I think he has lost more in this way, and in the end he's still being charged. He kinda deserves it to a certain extent, but it would have been preferable if he was dealt with through the proper channels.<br><br>I wonder what were the circumstances like? Was it an outright molest? A misunderstanding? Was the roommate a friend who got wrong signals etc... It's still no reason for a guy to molest a girl.<br><br>What I'm concerned about is if the guy didn't do it, he's ruined anyway. This situation is always really scary... accusations from girls will most often land guys in deep trouble, even if the guy is innocent. I'm not saying this case is such, but just bringing up a separate concern.<br><br>Hope that girl is okay. And good luck to the dude, too.<br><br>------------------<br>Is it cold in here, or is it just me?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cryogenic:<br><br>Sorry, in my previous post, I did not tell the detailed information how the guy molested to the girl and what the circumstances were, u may doubt that if this story is true or not, aha, actually, I also don't know the details what he did to the girl.<br><br>The university deleted her post before I visit to the web site. I read this news from newspaper and hear it from my friends. But it is true that the girl complain that she was molested by the guy. The guy may be really innocent, or the girl may just make a hoax to him, no one knows the truth except themselves. so every one hopes that the guy comes out and says something for himself. But he disappeared after this event was posted in the internet.<br><br>Any way, assume the guy really molested her, I think that the girl should report to the police, don't punish him by her own way. That is the main point I want to say here.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Molest..so esay to accuse some one of molesting isn't it. But what is the defination of molest. Putting your hand on a gals back? Putting a hand on her tighs? The think is different countries have different standard of errr..aceptable social behaviuor? I am not sure if I am puting this right cos my england not berri good. But wat i am saying is the gals from a more western counrty are more open and puttiing your arms ard her is not condsidered molesting.<br><br>What i think is molest is when a guy does something to a girl and that action,the girl don't like or she feel uncomfortable with it. But the IMPORTANT thing is she must say it becos the guy may be froma different country/culture who think nothing of his action.<br><br>And after he has been told and he still does it then its molesting.<br><br>Err am i making any sense?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm.....I think the best is to bring the girl out as well as the guy out to replay the whole scenerio...cos I dunno if the girl is saying the truth in this case.<br><br>You are right..the girl should not take things into her own hands, I think there are certainly some loopholes in it cos there are no eye-witnesses. The funny thing is since the guy is staying in the campus...he should not have just vanished into thin air just like that. I think the school will definately do some investigation..Before the verdict is out, the guy should not be lablled as a "molester"....<br><br>If he really molested her, then he really deserved it, cos psychologically he is mentally disturbed which I supposed that is why the girl posts the case to the net...to disgrace him.But, I think the police is the best to settle the case, in the eyes of the law...<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not to say that this case isn't true, but in cases like these, one has to be very careful...There have been numerous cases where really spiteful girls, who have nothing better to do, go and accuse other guys becaus ethey got jilted. rejected or didn't want to do the girls homework for them...It's really ridiculous...but becasuse university and public law is so strict on these kind of allegations made by females, the guy would still suffer just as badly as a real molestor...So it is really necessary to bring in the police as they can suss out the facts and not leave it to the whims of the individual...It is the only way justice can be achieved....I would say that your friends method can be used as a last resort if she really can't get satisfaction from the law...juss my opinion...:-)  I would have thought that the guy, if he's innocent, would have spoken up already...if he's innocent and dissappears, it looks very bad on him...makes him look very guilty....Bad choice to run.<br><br>In any event, he got what he deserved if he was guilty of it...but if not, then poor guy...<br><br>A lot of times also, the girl comes onto a guy and then after everything is done and finished, they decide that they didn't like what happened so they report it as molest or rape... (?)....several cases on uni campus when I was in SFSU....so only the police can fairly handle this....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>OK, let's compare two scenarios, assuming that he's guilty:<br><br>1) She complains about him through the Internet. He loses face.<br><br>2) She reports him to the police. The newspaper prints a story about him and he loses face. He also gets some time in jail and get kicked out of uni.<br><br>If he's guilty, then secenario 1 is a lighter punishment.<br><br>But if he's not guilty, then scenario 1 is worse because it's harder to clear his name. (then again, stuff you get from the Internet is less believable, so the damage may not be that bad). In this case, he should sue her for defamation and demand a public apology from her on the newspaper and the school's message board.<br><br>I don't think she should have taken the law unto her own hands. If he has done something wrong, then he should be punished accordingly.<br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 01-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>kk, i'm not trying to criticise ur friend here. but how would other pple view the students from that Uni when this whole incident is out on the papers?<br><br>the best way to deal wif this situation is to call up the police to do an investigation immedaitely instead of posting onto the uni's website. if that guy is reali guilty, u r alerting the guy that actions will b taken against him and the whole matter will not b put to rest by posting onto the uni's website.<br><br>i'm sure words will get ard in the hostel when pple try to speculate who is that gal being molested.. when they have identified that the gal is ur friend, wouldn't it b some sort of unwanted publicity for ur friend? *sigh*<br><br>Cheers.<br><br>------------------<br>=====================<br>who else but me......<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fingers:<br><br>First of all, tell u that neither the girl nor the buy is my friend, hehe, I agree with u some part. I would say that the girl did not handle this event in the most sensible way.<br><br>What is the truth?? Is he guilty or not?? We all want to know the answer. The university is trying to find him out for investigation, aha, he may come out next week, because it is the final exam week, poor man!! ehm, any way, if I know the further news about it, I will tell u all later.<br><br>Before the verdict is out, allow me say something by my own intuition, if it was only defamation to the buy, isn't it too costly for her making this hoax? She faced great pressure form her schoolmates and friends after all. Although I can't totally agree with what she did, I still tend to trust her.<br><br>On the other hand, as Killjoy mentioned before, what is the definition of molesting? It is really difficult to define, every one has diffident perception to it. Among all the molesting cases, we can't deny that some so-called molesters are innocent, they may be the victims, because some gals "overprotect" themselves, or some one may make spiteful defamation. I feel pathetic to these "unlucky" guys. The only thing I can say to u guys here is that u should be careful and behave yourself lor, hehe, But I think majority cases are true. Trust us, we gals usually are not problem-makers, especially in this aspect.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok, we have heard of how some females have lied abt being molested, and (altho I'm a girl) I have to say that it plays unfairly into the girls hands... People will tend to believe the victim rather than the accused,and if for some reason, the girl hates a guy, its s perfect way to "get back". So handling these cases should be left to the authorities, cos taking it in your own hands can discredit you and your story.<br><br>I can understand why the guy disappeared from campus, which doesn't necessarily mean he did molest her. Humans are overly critical and too judgemental, who wants to walk ard campus like an outcast, with people sneering and bitching abt u wherever u go? And as for the girl, she should know better than to step into a room with a guy she doesn't know very well. Duh? I think its bloody common sense... if she really needed the book, urgently she could have brought a friend along or waited outside and ask the roommate to go get it for her. Better safe than sorry...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ms Suess,<br><br>how did you know that the girl doesn't know her molestor? In many cases, girls are lulled into a false sense of security by somebody they know and end up being molested.<br><br>Even if she didn't know him, I also feel that it is ridiculous to blame her for 'stepping into' the room. You do not know what happened at all. For all you know, he may have tricked her into the room by saying that his roommate left the book on the table.<br><br>I think it is unfair and insensitive to pass critical comments based on your assumptions.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey purr,<br>well what i said in my previous post i deduced from the original first post by KK. When she reffered the guy to as "the roomate", i assumed they probably knew each other as acuaintences. Ok maybe my judgement was not properly grounded, but if he had been a friend of hers, i think it would have been mentioned in the post.<br><br>Yes its true i do not know what happened at all, maybe you do? But anyway, like i said, prevention is better than cure. Maybe she was a little too trusting, maybe he lulled her into trusting him, i really wouldn't know and i do apologise for coming across as INSENSITIVE (pardon me, i tend to be too frank), but what I'm trying to put across is that she SHOULD have used a little common sense... Girls should be kept on their toes. If he TRICKED her into coming into the room saying the book is on the table, *haha* what? was the book glued to the table? Did they have to pry it out together? I'm really sorry, but she's an undergrad, that's a really lame line for wanting her in the room, like i said, common sense! If he said the book's on the table, she should have asked him for it, and if he said he didn't know where it is, she should have asked him to search or come back later! Also it would have helped if she called the room to make sure her friend is in b4 dropping by?(oh, that's common courtesy,and i guess the courtesy campaign hasn't taught us that yet huh?) I mean c'mon! book on the table, go get it gurl, talk about walking straight into the trap! Common sense will remind you of what your mom said abt being alone in rooms with boys, common sense will tell you to keep at least 1-2 meters away from strangers, and common sense will tell you to report the guy to the police.<br><br>purr, even if she knew the molestor, her going behind the proper auth and taking matters into her own hands is uncalled for. If anything, i think her story will lose its crdibility. If you read deeper into her actions, the malicious and vindictive manner of her revenge, it could be guilt on her part, going around the auth and taking it into her own hands may suggest that she has something to hide. Reasonable doubt.<br><br>OK I did not know what happened, i'm just suggesting possibilities, I'm human, I'm biased, and not only that, maybe in your eyes I'm tooo damn opinionated. If you want to get very angry with me, go right ahead, it won't help anything, what's done is done, nothing can reverse it, and the trauma will probably linger for quite some time. Maybe we should take this as a lesson, like we should have all those earlier molest cases reported. Be on your guard, don't b too trusting, and pinch of common sense will help too..<br><br>okok i'll probably be labelled insensitive and critical again. Better end now before i anger anyone else...</div>

Now you not only seem more insensitive than before but also extremely biased. You ask the girl to learn her *supposed* lesson but you haven't learnt your own.<br><br>How can anyone take you seriously?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My DEAREST Purr,<br><br>Hello, how are you this semi-fine saturday? Anyway, HOW in the world do YOU know that she DID use her COMMON SENSE?<br><br>And I'm soo sorry for missing "your point", what is "your point"? Maybe i need new glasses... If you would kindly reiterate "your point" then maybe I'll get "your point" cos right now, "your point" eludes me...<br><br>OK, i'm really sorry if i seem overly critical, but WHAT ELSE is there to criticize on if not the possible scenarios???? Even ecomonists work that way. The original post is rather vague, I'm assuming she stepped into the room, oh pardon me, I'm not to make assumptions... Do u think its possible that... oh wait, lets not go there, its only a possibility... What IF... oh no can do! its not a fact!<br><br>Yes i AM extremely BIASED (this in my totally biased opinion), in fact, I may even be a bigot! Oh teacher, teacher, can you please tell me what the lesson of the day is?? Can you please, please please enlighten me?? I do not seem to get these epiphanies as often as you do, oh wise one!<br><br>Oh woe is me, oh woe is me,<br>to not be taken seriously!<br>Oh what cursed fate is this?<br>The venomous snake so spits and hiss<br>Which path should now be taken?<br>Since my "seriousness" hath been forsaken?<br>Oh woe is me, oh woe is me,<br>to not be taken seriously...<br>*sniffle sniffle*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ms Suess,<br><br>this is my last post to you. My point is, I repeat for the third time:<br><br>'I think it is unfair and insensitive to pass critical comments based on your assumptions.'<br><br>If you insist that you're right, I won't bother to argue anymore. I've just realised that it's such a waste of time to post messages to you. True, it'll give great satisfation to say something nasty about you back but I'm just too lazy to go into a cyberwar with somebody like you.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Darlingest-tesst-tesst purr,<br><br>OK, I agree it was unfair. I did admit the assumptions were not grounded, and ok, i was just itching for some verbal banter. I AM SOOO SORRY!!!!!!!! I wasn't planning to go to war, but as a GP topic once went, "He who longs for peace, must prepare for war", so i shall!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Ok i really wasn't looking for a cyberwar, I'd perfer one face to face, so lets just drop this ok? I think we have strayed from the topic anyway. So my humblest apologies, if I made it seem like I was declaring war or whatever, and also for rufflin your feathers (or fur). If i wasted your time, well, people who surf the net probably have too much time on their hands anyway, and since its the holidays, short of going out in the pouring rain there isn't much to do at home anyways. Right, shall end here, lest i waste anymore of your precious time. ttfn!</div>
