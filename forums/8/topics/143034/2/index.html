For the price you paid although you can't get a really good one however its enough for a moderately NEW DZI.<br><br>Real or Fake? The difference lies in the Material used &amp; the Etchings. Mostly Fakes are made of Glass, Plastic &amp; other synthetic materials &amp; of coz they don't radiate much vibration at all. Even Real DZI beads there are grading whether its a NEW or OLD Bead, Low grade, Medium grade, High grade or Super grade, these Relics are just like precious stones. Slight difference can make vast difference in its monetary value. Well its hard for a layman to see the difference but with a reliable source &amp; if you are sensitive to energy, you can easily tell a difference between NEW &amp; OLD Beads with the explanation of the owner.<br><br>Well the perspective you have about dZi beads is what many others may have. Fake dZi beads are made of synthetic medium &amp; they are not all Dirt Cheap some can be sold for a nifty sum by Unscrupulous Seller which did happen before as we can see in Newspapers, definitely they do not emit any vibration as the Authentic ones do in term of Spiritual Aspects. In term of Gemological Aspect, they will definitely fail as Authentic dZi is of Natural Rocks &amp; Minerals. In term of Value, dZi is an Ancient Relic, a piece of History sought after by collectors of coz that relies on whether its a NEW or OLD Bead.<br><br>Hope all these answer your queries.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong><br><br></div>

However by Naked Eye, Real or Fake, NEW or OLD dZi can be determined by someone of Substantial Appraisal Ability &amp; experience, will definitely have a considerable degree of reliabilty &amp; validity but of coz not to the extent of Fail Proof,  the more you see the more you handle, making a seriously wrong appraisal is very remote.  Experience play a big part. Even Microscope can make a mistake but usually the case is NEW bead sold as OLD bead. To ensure 100% Accuracy probably a Full Gemological Laboratory Test consisting of various methods will be adequate to make such a Guarantee. dZi bead's Structure &amp; translucency can be of more opaque or to that of almost transparent Crystalline of few various Mineral content eventhough they can be of similar AGE. I don't think they can be explained in mere few words neither it can be learnt in a short period of time. I been collecting &amp; dealing with dZi since early 90s but untill today i am not confident to say i am very good in making appraisal of all dZi with 100% accuracy.<br><br>As in if you never tasted Foi Gras, how wouly you know how it taste like?, what you eating is that Foi Gras? Of coz you got to depend on the Integrity &amp; Reliability of the Professional which is the chef or the Restaurant. If you never owned a 600k dZi, how would you be able to determine its Authenticity? How would you be able to determine how it look like? Again you got to rely on the Professionalism of the Seller, Emptor Caveat!<br><br>DZI is Priceless in term of Monetary Value, if fate permits, you are agreeable with the Price Tag behind it, you may have the chance to own it. again this does not mean you can get an Authentic Ancient dZi for a very dirt cheap price but everything you got to make your own judgement, at times its really true what you pay is what you get, expectation somehow got to tally with the price which is applicable to all aspects of life. Price wise its determined by the Owner whether the buyer is willing to part with the Price is another issue. Reasons can be plenty but it need not necessary be due to its AGE! A Similar AGE Ancient dZi monetary value can be a VAST difference with another dZi, why is that so? It can be due to the Etching Motif, the quantity of it available since both dZi is of similar AGE &amp; Material.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>
