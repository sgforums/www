I think this is an escalation of Rinoa topic of people 2-timing their BF or GF.<br><br>What happen was that a couple was married, then wife hv another lover, tells the husband and ask for a divorce.<br><br>Can you really say she is wrong? While she was wrong for having an affair, is she wrong for pursuing true love(if that was)?<br><br>Lets assume the husband did absolutely nothing wrong as a base for discussion.<br><br>I wud think she did her husband a favour by telling him the truth and asking for a divorce.<br><br>I believe there are many marriages whom one party hv an affair, but did not dare to let the wife/husband know, so as not to face family/public/frens pressure, if you can imagine.<br><br>As usual, there are no absolute right or wrong.

            <div class='col-md body'>It is such a perplexing issue..I got friends who can tell me that they are bored with their marriage life and the thought of having an affair comes to mind...I mean if u are married, one should try their utmost means to retain it...I dun believe that the love between two couples can die just like that..they just need something to be rekindled...that fire again to build up the feelings and chemistry.<br><br>And the kids too have to come into consideration. For sure, if any of my parent is having an affiar..I will beso hurt. Especially if my dad has done nothing wrong. And it is going to have a developmental effect on the child when they grow up, mistrust, isolation, inferiority...<br><br>Ppl now get divorced without considering all the factors, selfish and egocentric! A marriage is not only bound by love but commitment and responsibility...No matter what, a couple must try very hard to salvage a marriage. If the third party comes to place, they have to thrash things out together...They are too much correlations to consider...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it prob depends on the marriage in consideration, but i think it could be that there will be more sadness than happiness. actually, even tho sometimes ppl tell themselves that "things just happen", i don't think that's very true. things only "just happen" if u are not self-reflective enuf abt ur current position or the problems u have with ur spouse. then someone else comes along and u actually "let it happen", rather than "things just happening".<br><br>so if u are aware of ur problems wif ur spouse, i think there is a right and wrong. ur first duty/obligation or whatever should be to ur spouse. that's the "absolute right" part of it. i think only if u have serious communication problems and can't resolve things do u go for a divorce. u don't find a solution by falling for someone else, not when ur married. if u do, it's prob more a case of problems with the marriage than one of finding ur true love.<br><br>i noe someone wif this problem. and the grass is always greener on the other side. but oftentimes, the passion fades and then it's a matter of getting along wif the other person. same will prob happen with the new "mistress". so the key is prob to only say yes to someone for life if u are completely comfortable with talking and sharing with them.<br><br>which brings me to a related point. there are different views on this usu from guys and gals. guys usu say that being unfaithful in marriage is when u sleep with someone else. girls usu think that less than that is considered being unfaithful (maybe holding hands or kissing only, without the sex). what do u ppl think?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>fadingstar...<br>Well...as still a very conservative individual, I would think that anything that ranges from holding hands onwards as in more than a friend would consider unfaithful...cos woman needs a great sense of security and assurance. Therefore, I think that before any woman were to marry a guy, the behavoir the guy thus possess a great factor to see if he has the quality of a good husband.<br><br>It really depends on how a person defines faithfulness. In my opinion, faithfulness means having one love and no other.No physical intimacy with another individual other than the one you really loved. No one night stands. Well, it is just me...<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>mmmm.....i think so too....strange tho that many of my guy frens think unfaithfulness is only if u sleep with someone. but some girls think that certain emotions and feelings should only be reserved for them. so even if you express ur feelings for someone else, say, in a cyber-space r'ship, that is being unfaithful/having an affair too. would this be going too far?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to me, marriage is an institution you should do your best to uphold once you're in it. people who claim they get "bored", and want "a change in their lives" are simply finding excuses to justify their infidelity. if you weren't sure of your love for this person, why get married at all? i feel, that many people nowadays take marriage too lightly. they just do it so they can quickly go queue up for their flat.. if you get married, get married for the right reasons. not because of pressure from your family, pressure from the society, 'cos you're afraid you're getting old, you want kids... and even if you do, go in with your eyes wide open, and be utterly aware of the consequences of this decision.<br><br>my point? infidelity is wrong. nothing excuses it. you MIGHT fall in love while you're in a marriage, 'cos, IMHO, love might last forever but passion doesnt, however, do you have to get physical? yes, falling in love with someone else is infidelity too, but, that's something that 'cant be help' in that, can you really choose who you want to fall in love with? but, if you were really committed to your marriage, you would have noticed all the prior warning signs and do your best to stop the "relationship" frm progressing further. but if you can fall in love with someone else while you're married, i thk it's a NEONLIGHT indication that there's something wrong in your marriage that needs resolving..<br><br>but if someone really falls in love with someone else while married, i think the best thing that person could do, is confess to his(or her) spouse, and let the latter decide what she/he wants to do. i think that's the least you can do...<br><br>of course, some may find my view childish and idealistic, but i still believe that marriage isnt a must. people should only get married if they're 100% sure because, by getting married, it isnt just a "game" between you two now...<br><br>PS. congrats fadingstar! been reading your posts... still as entertaining, and intellectually-stimulating as ever..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>[This message has been edited by ataraxia (edited 03-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Worm, your story is one of the most amazing thing I've heard of a marriage, that your fren actually dun mind the husband having an affair. Maybe I a bit sua ku, but I doubt such things are common....<br><br>I agree with fadingstar in the sense that many people are trying to use another relationship as an escape route to a failed marriage, but what I think is that sometimes, people just can't help falling in love.<br><br>In that sense, ataraxia probably had a very very good point that we may fall in love no doubt, but we shd never be unfaithful, and there is no excuse for being unfaithful.<br><br>As to the definition of unfaithful, I think I will consider the mere action of holding hands(in the nature of being BF/GF) as unfaithful. If you're married, or hv a BF/GF, how can you start another relationship with another person, with or without physical intimacy....<br><br>fadingstar, do you really think ONLY sexual relationship can be considered as unfaithful? You must hv quite a open mindset huh... I think Rinoa and myself still belongs to the conservative...<br><br>Appreciate all those views posted... can see that all of you thought quite deeply into this issue, and gave very mature and thoughtful answers that undid a few knots I hv in my mind.<br><br>BTW, this topic is not about me... it did happen to my fren and I'm just bringing it up for discussion sake...

            <div class='col-md body'>Bochap...<br>As young as I am...I think Marriage is a magical and divine process. I agree with Fadingstar that in the case of marriaige, you might find lonliness too, but how many marriage couples in the world are still together even though love and chemistry is already fading away..it is the love for the children, responsibility to the family. Marriage is not the two individual but it involves ur friends and family, where ur wife is officially acknowledged in the family and the status is changed.<br><br>In a socialhistorical context, woman without an appropriate status while living with the man is considered immoral by the older generation.<br><br>It really depends how u are brought up as well. If you are brought up by a whole family, your whole concept of marriage will be a positive one. If you are brought up by a family where your parents are divorced, or in a single-parent family, you will be more pessimitic in regards to the role of being a husband or wife bound by a the word "marriage"...<br><br>So...see what ur gf has to say, if she wants to marry you and you do not know if marriage is the ultimate route to ur relationship...I better think thrice...<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm.. yeah, was off for awhile.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> been pretty busy and all.<br><br>well infidelity to me, can begin even in the mind. IMHO, by falling in love with someone else, you're already being unfaithful. however, the most important thing is, you cant let it continue on to the physical level. you can claim that falling in love is beyond your control (dont really agree.. but..) but moving on to the next level is very much a conscious decision. but i guess the most important thing, is what the allegedly unfaithful spouse deems unfaithful. if he feels that holding hands with a member of the opposite sex is perfectly fine, then i dont think he's being unfaithful. and this applies to both guys and girls, attached or married. but i dont think alot of pple out there think the way i do.. for me, it's perfectly ok to hold hands with guy friends, but, if my bf doesnt like it, i think it's best to talk things out.... and reach a compromise.<br><br>[This message has been edited by ataraxia (edited 05-12-1999).]</div>
