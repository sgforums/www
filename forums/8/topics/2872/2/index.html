            <div class='col-md body'>Guys tend to go for looks while girls tend to look for the character. But that doesn't mean they dun care abt the looks of the guys. Being gd looking is always a plus. Am i right, girls? The most impt thing is taht the couples are happy with each other ie they can get along with each other very well. No pt having a couple where the guy is handsome and the girl is pretty but their character clashes.<br><br>On loletta, juz wanted to say her photos and the presidency of singapore are 2 different issues. Her photos will not affect u much, but the president( actually its the prime minister) can affect all of us, we can't say that we can criticise loletta juz bcos we can criticise the president.<br><br>Mind<br><br>[This message has been edited by Mind (edited 01-01-2000).]</div>

Good looking guys care about themselves more than they would care about their galfriends cos they well are 'selfcentered'<br>and really only are capable of caring for number one(being themselves.<br>This is all a load of crap , and its due to sterotypes and hearsay that lead gals into having insecurities about good looking guys and ITS NOT FAIR.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi tetrutetrumon,<br><br>In the first place, I don't think that you are picking on me. It is just that you want to state your opinion and that is perfectly fine with me. However, if you are out to pick a fight, then do it privately in email, and I can assure you that I will not pull my punches even if you are a gal. Afterall, women always demand equality of sexes.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Not that I am being bitter about my own experiences (yes, I do have them, but they have nothing to do with you) or see such things happening around me as bad as divorces. It seems to be the case. From where I am studying in Europe, most Singaporean guys including myself have already given up on Singaporean gals, the reasons being very simple : they are mostly spolit and pampered, very short-term in thinking, with their demand of 5Cs and don't really care about the feelings of the others.<br><br>To be honest, I have a better impression of my Taiwanese and Hong Kong lady friends, because although they are like in the age of 19-22, yet they are mostly mature and sensible because they come from countries where they need a better qualification to make their lives better (because their environment are much more worse as compared to Singapore).<br><br>Just as there will be bad eggs in the Taiwanese and HK gals, similarly, I will say that there are nice gals in Singapore. Just that, the proportion of bad Singaporean gals mentioned as of the above, are definitely much higher. I have a lot of friends who have got themselves attached to Taiwanese and HK gals because they are sick of Singaporean gals and I can understand why.<br><br>prodigal70@hotmail.com<br><br>[This message has been edited by prodigal (edited 02-01-2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To ataraxia :<br><br>I am both amused and irked by your accusations of the guys being immature in the newsgroup. To me, the gals in the newsgroup are also making equivalently the same blatant remarks which they don't seem to admit that they do.<br><br>I was looking at goodbookmarks' reply to you and yours back to him. You may choose not to defend what you say, but that does not mean that we cannot pass any comments to what you have said in your earlier post. First of all, I have no comments on the Loletta issue, and I have not seen any of her photos nor know her to pass any judgement. I agree with you that the guys are being immature in their comments.<br><br>Suppose if I reverse the issue by using the analogy of a hypothetical guy called Lawrence being featured (as of what Loletta did), both the guys and gals can make the same comments, and some gals I am perfectly sure that they will make some comments like "this guy sucks and he should go back to his house and look into the mirror instead of coming here.." Are you sure that such comments only come from guys only, and not from gals as well? By this hypothetical example, I will say that your accusations and comments like<br><br>"you guys come in here with your cynical judgement on girls, trying to prove how     'adjusted' you are already to our 'bad taste'. all it proves, is that we were right never to choose any of you."<br><br>makes you no better from those guys whom you are condemning in the first place. I would speak for some of them who may be cynical about women, and I can dare say that these guys must have suffered some injustice in the past, and they may be nice guys before but shattered by some unhappy incidents.<br><br>What they are saying are from their perspective, and can't you even tolerate another point of view?<br><br>Then what's the newsgroup for? Most of the gals here want to paint the rosy picture, telling the world how nice their bfs are that they could give away their virginity to their bf, and equally you should be ready to accept people telling the other side of the story which is real and harsh to your beautiful fairy tale. Note that I am not picking on you or anyone, but you all should tolerate other points of view. There is always a place here where we can accomodate all points of view.<br><br>Lastly, the affairs of the state are more important than a trivial issue about a gal featuring herself here. If the people don't make a statement/criticise or make a check to what the government do and just let the government doing things behind their back (i.e. corruption), what you get is political chaos later like Indonesia. So don't confuse issues of that magnitude with this little issue here.</div>

They say the same thing.  Exactly the same thing!  which one do you think is more negative?  Which one ultimately hinders other people from coming forward and which one do you think people will respond better to?<br><br>You may not like something, but u can say it in a more tactful way.<br><br>AS for what MR&gt; JACK CHEN (goodbookmarks) has stated and the way he stated it....I have this to say....<br><br>Jack...U should have learned your lesson by now....you don't remember the flaming you got last time for being a loudmouth uncouth tactless defender of "justice"...?<br><br>I told you in that thread also that there is a way to say something that will produce favorable results...or if not, then more positive points than to just find the worst way to say something....and it doesn't mean candy coat what you say.  if you feel the need to be direct then be direct...but being direct is not the same thing as being insulting, which you are being.<br><br>And I know that message boards are here for people to state their minds...and if we need to compare as bookmarks has with government bodies, then lets do it like this:<br><br>If the government allows it's citizens freedom to voice their views and opinions freely, then they must do it with respect, dignity and responsibility directed towards others and themselves.<br><br>Imagine if everyone can anyhow tok anyway they want to in a country that is already stifled enuff as it is.  let's say that the government one day gave us the freedom of open speech and public opinions....What do you think will happen when some guy or girl comes up and starts to rant and rave about how fucked up president is and how he should go and fuck a sheep after getting a blowjob from his daughter....<br><br>All I can say is that you destroy the chance for everyone elses views to be taken seriously on those issues that were put up in the first place....you in effect slander the whole freedom process for other people who have something good to say...in a word what you do is: deface...<br><br>So take some responsibility onto yourself and do some self-censorship before you go and spout what you think may be constructive criticism...when in fact it is destructive criticism....and there is a very big difference in that.<br><br>please have some common curteousy.<br><br>to be a "technopreneur", I think you still have a long way to go before you mature to a level needed to be one in deed other than in name.<br><br>how was that statement?...a very direct hint to grow up with a tinge of insult but with enuff tact for u to know what I mean without being blatantly rude right?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>firstly, i admit and apologise for some sweeping generalisations i've made in my first post. but i still stand by the fact that some people definitely fit into them. and they were aimed at the select few who actually agreed with blueturbo's comments. i never said anything about people not being able to criticise the government, if you actually bothered to read my whole post (i'm not insinuating anything here but some obviously have not) you would have read:<br>" there are always ppl out there, who never take responsibility for anythg in their lives"<br>im referring to that group of people, who when everything is seriously fine, start nitpicking and complaining. those that claim that all the problems and troubles they've faced in their entire life stems from the government, their family, their social circle, the whole world. when the shit hits the fan, it's everyone's fault but theirs.<br><br>im not saying that you can't 'comment' on my posts and remarks, hell, go ahead. criticise them if you want. but do you honestly believe and agree with what gdbkmark said? i think that's taking the whole freedom of speech thing a little too far. yeah, i agree with you, we're all entitled to our own points of views, and even if we don't agree with others, we should at least listen and respect them. but guys who think that chiobus should only 'go' with yandaokias, guys who condemn 'average-looking' guys as being unworthy and not good enough for 'above-average' girls, and people who criticise others without a thought for their feelings... i'm sorry if you fall into any of the above categories, but i can't and won't stand for any of them. what other side is there to this? that perhaps 'chiobus' should stick to their own 'type'? that 'ugly' guys should stop 'aiming beyond their reach'?<br>"It is in my opinion (anyone can dispute with me on that) that Singaporean women liked scum, jerks and etc, but not nice and boring guys anymore. They have no sense of long term goals and would just see things for a short term."<br>arent you guilty of the same generalisation and unfair comments you're blasting me about?<br><br>i chose not to reply to gdbkmarks (not not defend my statements) because of the sheer futility of the whole exercise. does it seriously make sense to any of you? but in the face of more gross assumptions, i'll go ahead and act against my better judgment.<br><br>jackchen:<br>"1) An ugly person can also critique a better-looking person."<br>what im trying to say is that NO ONE has a right to judge/condemn anyone else. you're entitled to your own opinions but they're just that. YOUR opinions.<br><br>"2) Anybody can judge anybody. As long as they don't go too far. Just think, if we all keep thinking we're not worthy to judge people, then Singapore will be full of low-self-esteem people. We have the right to judge. Everyone agrees?"<br>firstly, i dont see an overwhelming support for this sweeping statement. when is it too far? when you claim that someone is making you suffer by forcing you to look at her photos? i still stand by the fact that no one has a right to judge others. it's not about self-esteem, it's about you. are you that great? that perfect? that flawless? are you so goodlooking you can say that loletta is ugly as hell? it's a case of the pot calling the kettle black. and even if you are that perfect and flawless, the minute you start criticising others for no reason, without a thought for their feelings, then there's a chink in that flawless armour of yours. what firewire says is right, go ahead and criticise, but how you word it, and your 'contents', differentiates your comment from a insult or a criticism.<br><br>"3) If we praise ANYONE who features herself on the website for courage, then we all "siao liaoz". Later some old hag come and feature herself on the website, just to be praised.<br><br>We don't have to praise anyone featured on the website. As I've said before, if she's good, praise. If she's bad, boo!"<br>i'm sorry if you don't think the same way. that a girl shouldn't be blasted simply because she isn't 'chio' enough by someone else's standards. if thinking so makes me 'siao', then i'll be crazy voluntarily. i'm not saying it's a MUST to praise each and every one on the site. in fact, most of my friends agree that someone of the girls don't live up to the term 'chiobu'. but hey, someone else thinks they do, and does it really matter? if you like it applaud, if you don't, the gracious thing would be not to say anything at all if it doesn't help. telling a girl she isn't goodlooking, what are you achieving by that?<br><br>"And also, for a 'not-chio' girl to have the 'courage', I think it's because...<br><br>She "buay chio" but think she is very chio!"<br>if you think so, then that's your opinion. just like how we credit it to courage.<br><br>"4) Please hor. On the Internet, we can only see pics hor. We can see what's inside the person through pics hor. So don't tell us that we should "look beyond appearances and see the qualities within."<br><br>Try this: Take a look of a picture of an old hag and tell me her personality and character.<br><br>*duh!*"<br>ok, maybe loletta is a total bitch. so? if she's rude, criticise her for being impolite. if she's prone of vulgarities, insult her on her lack of social graces. but does it give you a right to insult her appearance? it's simply that some of us chose to look on the positive aspect and see the amount of courage and confidence required to agree to be featured. to seize the moment and do what she wants instead of always conforming, always being afraid of what others think.<br><br>"5) Ugly guys very lucky. Can get beautiful girls. But can ugly girls get handsome guys?<br><br>*duh!*"<br>this comment is so senseless, i simply have nothing to say.<br><br>maybe i'm being very idealistic, to think that we should always be polite and gracious, and try our best not to hurt others unnecessarily. perhaps it's a sad fact of life that you must learn to face up to criticsim and detractors. but what im hoping for, is that people would practise some compassions and be a little more caring and considerate.<br>blueturbo:<br>im sorry if i misinterpreted your earlier post but i do not see any mention of you being angry on behalf of 'better-looking' guys.<br>"I hate it. Everyday when i walk on the streets i see beautiful pretty girls and well there always holding the arm of some average looking or even worse ulgy guy. It just isnt really fair, i mean these gals have class and looks and all but i mean what they have on their arms(ulgy bf's) jsut isnt befitting of them."<br>all i see is an angry person, upset because he cant get the girls he 'deserves'. and moaning that such girls are in the wrong for having such bad taste to choose someone unworthy of them. if you really meant what you said in your 2nd post, that you were simply upset over the misconceptions others have on 'gd-looking' guys, then fine, i'll give you the benefit of the doubt. but dont accuse me of colouring your statements with my own hangups. i didnt. you made absolutely no mention of the 'gdlooking guy misconception'. yes, it is true that some people think like that, but i'm sure if that guy is really a nice person at heart, and chases the girl sincerely, he'll be able to break the myths.<br><br>i've done my best to 'defend' my statements and POVs, and clarify any misunderstandings. if you still disagree then go ahead and criticise. but unless you state your viewpoints clearly, logically, lucidly, don't accuse me of not standing by what i say.<br><br>[This message has been edited by ataraxia (edited 02-01-2000).]</div>

They have no sense of long term goals and would just see things for a short term." arent you guilty of the same generalisation and unfair comments you're blasting me about?<br><br>I have to admit that I made the above statement, but I suppose that I did not add "most Singaporean women" and it lead to a sweeping generalization. It was my mistake anyway but I am not retracting my statement as I already put it clearly that anyone can disagree with me.<br><br>As for goodbookmarks, if he insists on his own ranting and get himself fired, I do not care, afterall, I have already given the appropriate advice.

            <div class='col-md body'>X-men: I think being good looking CAN get you a good job. Or more accurately, it gives you a better chance of getting a job. I read somewhere that good looking people (thats right, both guys and girls) give better impression to other people, so you are more likely to get hired over someone of the same qualifications, more likely to get off lightly when kanna something wrong less likely to get rejected for stuff e.g. pay raise etc.<br><br>But won't push your grades higher, thats for sure. Directly anyway.</div>
