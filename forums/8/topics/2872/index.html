            <div class='col-md body'>i agree.... 'looks isnt everything'  especially gals nowadays are much more educated and sophisticated in looking for their the other half... they are more on going for brains and others like 5Cs in guys... rather than looks... looks cant last as in 10-20 years everyone will aged and become old..<br><br>------------------<br>A unknown force!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That is the kind of reality you perceive to be. I am more inclined to say that Singaporean gals no longer cares about what kind of guys they go out with, whether he is ugly or handsome, a Ah Beng or rich yuppie. It is in my opinion (anyone can dispute with me on that) that Singaporean women liked scum, jerks and etc, but not nice and boring guys anymore. They have no sense of long term goals and would just see things for a short term.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Different ppl have different perception of beauty. What you might think is pretty, the girls themselves might not think so. As far as I know most gals whom guys think they are pretty does not think they are pretty enough. So they do not get guys that are good looking becos they are not confident of keeping them...<br><br>Another reason is that very good-looking guys might be more egoisitic abd they pay more attention to their own looks. As far as I go out with looks, the most important think is the chemistry. Definitly looks plays a part but not the ultimate in a relationship<br><br>------------------<br>The love in your heart is not for it to stay, you can only feel love when it is given away<br><br>[This message has been edited by Sashay (edited 31-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For why pretty gals go out with average looking guys :<br><br>Take to the fact that females are more emotional than males are. And for this generation, most girls are inclined to look what type of attitude their love interest have. It is obivious that both males and females are more interested if the other is pretty&lt;females&gt;/handsome&lt;males&gt;. But with that type of reason, Relationship will not last long.<br><br>Loletta : She has good assets. But some people feels, " why the fuss on over just one girl when there are many more ?" .<br><br>She has the courage to be willing to feature herself. And also risking the possiblities of being stalked, humilated. You should also understand that anyone can be vulnerable in the internet.<br>And would anyone on this world do not need attention ?<br><br>&lt; Face it , I m just a lonely guy and i m best left alone. &gt;<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>all i can say is, you guys are so fucking immatured. how dare you even judge who's worthy of who? who are you to condemn others for not being physically attractive enough to suit a 'chiobu'? all that shows, is how low and unworthy YOU are. you people who go out there and condemn others, who appt yourselves as the judges of society, passing general, unbased opinions on others. if the girl is 'chio', so what? do you thk you're that great looking? do you honestly believe you're WORTHY enough for her? who are you to say that the guy isn't good enough? what gives you the right to judge? if anything, the guy is better than you already, for not being so petty, spiteful, envious, and shallow. all of you go out there and condemn us singaporean girls. we fall for 'ugly' guys. we fall for 'bad' guys. but can you blame us if our option is ppl like you?<br><br>and for those who condemn loletta, for having the courage and self-confidence to agree to be featured, for not being 'chio' enough, all i can say is, you guys are the reason why society in sg is so sad now. whether she's chio or not, is that her fault? goodbookmarks, you UTTERLY DISGUST me.<br>"It's just like having a bad president for a country.<br>The president sucks like hell and the people are all suffering. Do we still have the praise the president for having the courage to lead?<br>Same goes here.<br>We are all suffering looking at Loletta, cos. she's not that good."<br>sometimes, even in times of peace, ppl blame the govt. they claim they arent liberal enough, they dont give the citizens their 'freedom', they dont give enough welfare, they tax too much... there are always ppl out there, who never take responsibility for anythg in their lives. somethg bad happens? it must be the govt's fault, not mine. these people sicken me. they go ard claiming the world 'sucks'. people 'suck'.<br><br>who the hell are you to say that you are 'suffering' by 'having' to look at loletta? firstly, no one forced you too. no one ever MADE you come and look at her pics. everything is absolutely VOLUNTARY. if you desperate enough to search the net looking for pics of 'chiobus', if you're nosy enough to hunt out every bit of controversy,then that's a 'risk' you gotta take. that some people are actually matured, and sensitive enough to look beyond appearances and see the qualities within. the qualities that will always be lost to you thanks to your pettiness and narrowmindedness.<br><br>you guys come in here with your cynical judgement on girls, trying to prove how 'adjusted' you are already to our 'bad taste'. all it proves, is that we were right never to choose any of you.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>aiyo, ataraxia's so long.<br>I skipped most of it, but I think I get the main point.<br><br>1) An ugly person <strong>can also</strong> critique a better-looking person.<br><br>2) Anybody <strong>can judge</strong> anybody. As long as they don't go too far. Just think, if we all keep thinking we're not worthy to judge people, then Singapore will be full of low-self-esteem people. We <strong>have</strong> the right to judge. Everyone agrees?<br><br>3) If we praise ANYONE who features herself on the website for courage, then we all "siao liaoz". Later some old hag come and feature herself on the website, <strong>just</strong> to be praised.<br><br>We <strong>don't</strong> have to praise anyone featured on the website. As I've said before, if she's good, praise. If she's bad, <strong>boo!</strong><br><br>And also, for a 'not-chio' girl to have the 'courage', I think it's because...<br><br><strong>She "buay chio" but think she is very chio!</strong><br><br>4) Please hor. On the Internet, we can only see pics hor. We can see what's inside the person through pics hor. So don't tell us that we should "look beyond appearances and see the qualities within."<br><br>Try this: Take a look of a picture of an old hag and tell me her personality and character.<br><br>*duh!*<br><br>5) Ugly guys very lucky. Can get beautiful girls. But can <strong>ugly girls get handsome guys?</strong><br><br>*duh!*<br><br>------------------<br><a href="http://www.goodbookmarks.com" rel="nofollow">Goodbookmarks.com</a> - Daily updates of good and honest website, plus a daily joke!<br><a href="http://www.goodbookmarks.com/Submit_URL/submit_url.html" rel="nofollow">Submit Your Site Now!</a><br></div>
