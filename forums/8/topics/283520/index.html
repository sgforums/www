            <div class='col-md body'>1 . The time span of finding a job within graduation from poly can also be aided by given a good testimonial from your personal mentor . That being said, companies which usually recruit poly students for work attachments usually seek opinions from your personal mentor on the listed students. So you're supposed to lay a good impression on your mentor from day one in poly .<br><br>However there is no specific time span from which u can find a job after graduation . All this will be determined by how well you impress the company's HR managers ,results and testimonials from teachers.<br><br>2. Face it, a polytechnic diploma holder can never go on to management level in a<br>MNC( if that's the kind of organization you're referring to ) . This is because the minimum requirement for attaining management status is to have a degree. That's what my teacher told me . Yes you can attain management level , but that's only if you start your own company ( no pun intended ) .<br><br>However if you excel in your work at any MNC organization , the top management may consider sending you back to school ( they will even sponsor a part of your studies, or maybe the foot the entire bill)  . Upon getting a degree, they'll automatically promote you to management level.<br><br></div>

MBA, PhD. If not, you will alway find frustration in doing so much works but the credit goes to your superior who holds a higher education. That is the true of it, and you just couldn't get over him/her, cos he/she got so much time to further his/her knowledge by studying.<br><br>On the street today, about 70% middle age and below hold diplomas, so it is very common, you should make yourself to a sell out/valuable by advancing your skills and knowledges further.<br><br>Out of 1000 poly graduates, only 10 are the real hardworking and "cunning" ones that will go to the top, rest will just be doing mono jobs same like playing Mono-Poly.<br><br>If you aint get a job, dun talk about promotion.</div>

That being said, companies which usually recruit poly students for work attachments usually seek opinions from your personal mentor on the listed students. So you're supposed to lay a good impression on your mentor from day one in poly . </span><br>However there is no specific time span from which u can find a job after graduation . All this will be determined by how well you impress the company's HR managers ,results and testimonials from teachers.<br><br>2. Face it, a polytechnic diploma holder can never go on to management level in a<br>MNC( if that's the kind of organization you're referring to ) . This is because the minimum requirement for attaining management status is to have a degree. That's what my teacher told me . Yes you can attain management level , but that's only if you start your own company ( no pun intended ) .<br><br>However if you excel in your work at any MNC organization , the top management may consider sending you back to school ( they will even sponsor a part of your studies, or maybe the foot the entire bill)  . Upon getting a degree, they'll automatically promote you to management level.<br><br></div></blockquote>hmm from year 1 first day i agure with the mentor i think she had bad impression about me.  She not even lect us any module yet can give testimo (describle from result maybe) but i prefer to work to prove my working ablitiy than to use some lousy testimol to help me.<br><br>btw how other how long u work when 1st promote</div>
