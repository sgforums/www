            <div class='col-md body'>IRC doesnt suck. Having in IRC for 5 years now, I seriously think that it do not suck.<br>Personally up to now, I have met over 40 IRC friends in real life, some of them became good friends with me. There is no harm making more friends and widening your social circle. If you think that IRC is purely for entertainment, then you will miss out a lot. Its a place of making new friends from different races and different ages. They are ppl you wun normally meet if you were not to IRC.<br><br>In short, its all up to you on whether you wanna make friends. If you are serious about making new friends, I can gurantee that you WILL make new friends.<br><br>------------------<br>The Prince Of Death...<br>______________<br>| |Ã” NiVleK Ã” | |</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm IRC...why do some ppl say if you chat on IRC u hav no life? is there a difference with makin frens online an makin frens offline?<br>Yea i agree, irc is a great place to meet ppl. But different ppl think differently. Some would like to be your fren and hav the same objective as u but others may just want it as a form of entertainment and not take it seriously. And when both conflict...trouble arises.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nah, IRCing doesnt mean that you have no life. Again this depends on indivduals, I IRC to keep in touch with some of my pals and to make new friends. Others can IRC to kill time. THats why u see lots of lamers in IRC tokking crap, making a nusiscane of themselves. Yet some others IRC to buaya or flirt, I confess that sometimes I do buaya around but this is not my purpose of IRCing. If all my pals were to disappear from the IRC world, I guess I will not be so interested to stay there to make more friends. It may sound ironcial, but it is what it is.<br><br>Yes. I guess there is a difference in making friends online and making friends in the world outside of internet. Would you go up to a stranger and sit beside him/her and say "Hi, would you like to chat?"<br>I bet the moment you say this the person will walk away. This issnt the norm in society for us. People will think that you are lunatic if you do that. However in IRC, you can msg a complete stranger and will be able to strike up a nice converstation with him/her.<br><br>Again, I know the trouble of conflict in IRC. But there is one simple thing you can do in IRC if there is a person irritating you. Just type /ignore "nick"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> This way, whatever he/she types will not be in your view anymore. Why bother with such lamers?<br><br>Everything in this world has its pros and cons. You cant say that IRC is a great place or a lamer's/ no life ppl's paradise. It all boils down to indivduals and your personal net ettiquete.<br><br>------------------<br>The Prince Of Death...<br>______________<br>| |Ã” NiVleK Ã” | |</div>
