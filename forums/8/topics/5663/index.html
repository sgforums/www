Underage nevermind too.. coz i never plan to do any F***ing until i am married, coz i find sex b4 marriage not a responsible behavior.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm... I setup a very similiar topic in another forum, but here is my POV<br><br>I believe that a relationship is split into 2 parts, the attraction and the maintainance.<br><br>During the first stage(attraction), you dun really know much about the other party, so I should say that the main attraction comes from the physical aspects. Thus in this perspective it is almost impposible to judge whether he person is of great character or of high intelligence. But it is this very basic and superficial attraction that makes us wants to know more and get us closer to the other party. And of course you can't just judge beauty in a general sense. Different people have different perspective of beauty, you might be attracted to a really normal looking girl if she have the most beautiful ears. But that is of course if you really like beautiful ears?!?<br><br>But once the first phrase is over, the second pharse(maintainance) begins. At this stage the physical attraction will slowly died away. It might take years, it might just be a week, but it will slowly die off, but while it is dying off, this is where personality comes in. Personality starts to maintain your interests in her/him. And as you get to know more and more about her/him, the physical attraction becomes more and more secondary. If there is not enough personality of the type that you are interested in, you will soon become bored and it will be difficult to maintian your interests in her/him. So I shall say the this is how the beginning of a break up starts.<br><br>Thus my verdict, you got to be attractive in some physical sense to attract others to know you. But if you have a rotten character you can forget about keeping the relatioship for life.<br><br>Do you agree with my thoughts?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>My $0.02 worth</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agree with Callan's thoughts. It's normally the certain physical outlook that attracts first( whichever parts will depend on the different people). Then part 2, the characters will play an equally important aspects on the relations to make it a lasting one.<br><br>For the characters to come first, it's normally in cases where 2 px are put together(doing a project or colleague etc) for a period of time, u will learn more about the character &amp; might develope into more.<br><br>Of coz it will be good if u can have both.<br></div>
