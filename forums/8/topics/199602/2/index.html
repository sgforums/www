Hurts relationships and does no good to the reputation of PUB as a contracting party in this case.<br><br>Things may however transpired in the course of the performance of the contract such that IBM could have been in a difficult or compromised position to deliver the terms of the contract.

One of the main factors is the forever changing requirement by the fickle minded users that de-stabilize the system. IT software is not you today say want this, by one week I can give you. It is a brain cells work job!<br><br>My company also face same problem when I join but they later settle it out of court with terminated vendor and partly because we are not legally part of the Gahmen body. In the end we do salvage of the system and getting the correct software engineers coming in to fix it and viola it was launched 2 years ago.<br><br>Lesson to be learnt is it is not the top mgmt or brilliant sales pitch the vendor sell, it is wat kind of software engineers are they able to recruit to do the software works as fast as the user requirement changes. This catching up with requirement changes is a skillset all software enginners MUST MASTER!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>It is not I say I look no up sporeans but this forever outsourcing of tax payers money for IT systems cannot work. They gotta train and nurture their in-house sporean programmers. Alas most are snapped up by DSTA and ST Engineering bodies that left very few enginners ard for the Gahmen and stat boards to recruit.
