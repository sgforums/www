            <div class='col-md body'>Let's say you have the choice, maybe you already have work experience, a bit of savings etc, which one do you choose?<br><br>I find doing business very scary cuz I am already doing that.  Though very small, but already dump in some money.  The beginning stage is very very scary one.  I had nothing but fear this fear that.  A lot of "what ifs" in my mind.  A lot of hard work.  But then, I come to think of it.... working for people also not easy what.  Also must work hard.  But not necessary good money for you.  If suay suay company give excuses not to increase your pay, you're forever poor.  Also people always have the wrong impression that jobs are more secure than businesses.  My friend working in a health product company for 20 years as a regional director also kenna retrenched.  She didn't expect it and didn't want it to happen.  My ex company (a very famous local attraction) not giving variable bonus, though their 50 year old female director claimed to the media that they have so many businesses, making so much blah blah blah.<br><br>At least work hard for own business, you will do well.  You arrange for more meetings with people, your chance of closing a deal is higher.  Thus higher income.<br><br>But still.... every day I have to make decision myself.  Do accounting myself (small business mah.  dun have budget to hire accounting staff).  Tonight have to do stock take.  So far, I don't really have any friends who are doing own business.  So I feel like an odd man out.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good friends !==&gt; Good partners.<br><br>Very often, willingness to work hard is very different. Also, vision is also very different. And when one works harder than the other, quarrels happen. Then friendship gone liao. So, must be clear who is in charge, how much effort each partner is expected and such. Sometimes, can just have sleeping partner who contribute $$ but don't usually get involved in the running of the business at all.<br><br>If not friend, lagi worst. Partnership often allows a partner to sign on behalf of whole business and that means you can get cheated without knowing. If register as Pte. Ltd. still not so bad, lose capital only. If register as business, then siao liao. In this case, you lose not just your capital, you can even lose your house, car and everything you owe + bankrupcies and huge debt (business means unlimited liability).<br><br>As for working for people vs doing own business. Of course own business better lah! But got to worry a lot of things and need to control finance very well. Not everyone can do it lah! More fun and exciting career but a lot more unstable also loh. Suited only for those who are extremely hard working and got business instinct or those who already reach a point in their life where they got their bases covered.<br><br>Personally, I am always thinking about it, but got a lot of things to think before jumping into it. Also, depend on what job one is holding at the moment loh. I got good boss and reasonable pay now, so push factor very little.</div>
