              <p>wow! you must be very rich! in the olden days, there were people
                      who started with nothing, working smart and hard to become
                      millionaire. nowadays, how to start with nothing ?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>You can create something out of nothing, whatever your means. Intellectual property can be created out of thin air; no cash involved. Code of a proprietary software can be the basis of a company that takes in seed funding at $1 million pre-money valuation (cf. Bill Gates, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison, etc.). Stories and fictional ideas can be the basis of a best-selling novel (cf. JK Rowling, Dan Brown, Isaac Asimov, etc.).</p>
              <p>In fact, I contend that today the cost and information barriers of starting a business is actually lower than in the past. The internet is the magic enabler; leverage on it, but don't be a loser who tries to make money from putting Google AdSense on your blog, setting up a blogshop or making a highly-duplicable portal/platform/forum to connect a [party A] and [party B], who have trouble accessing each other. <strong>You cannot diversify your way to wealth by seeing your online blog as an additional revenue stream.</strong></p>
              <p>Invest your time and learn to code if you're intelligent; the rewards are much bigger. Take note of research/patent areas with significant activity in them, examine the state of the art and then build your own proprietary algorithm or process flow. Then identify a lucrative market, develop a minimum viable solution with the resultant technology and push forth your value proposition. Reiterate and acquire customer feedback, both qualitative and metric-based (e.g. obtained through A/B split-testing) feedback.</p>
              <p>What I have just said can be considered entrepreneurship, even by the strictest standards. Replicating tried-and-tested product offerings and business models is NOT entrepreneurship; it's a money-making technique that merely reduces the market risk, because the market is proven and demonstrated. Entrepreneurship is about vision and innovation, tackling either known problems with unknown solutions or unknown problems with unknown solutions. Entrepreneurship is a whole culture, a movement, not some money-making gig.</p>
              <p>While entrepreneurship cannot be taught, it can be learnt through a <strong>fundamental paradigm shift</strong>. That would mean some major epiphanic moment that causes you to see things totally differently than before, either through some intense experience or serendipity (unlikely). <strong>That means constantly trying, on a daily and even hourly basis, to convert what your non-comfort zones are into comfort zones by just immersing yourself in your non-comfort zones as a habit. You cannot psycho and motivate yourself into becoming an entrepreneur -- no matter how determined you are -- if the lens through which you look at the world is fundamentally flawed and incongruent with entrepreneurial principles.</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong>This is the part where most people stumble because they do not have the strength of character to constantly torture themselves and sacrifice social time for personal development. The bigger problem, though, is that most people are complacent: they think they're good/smart/worldly enough already, an arrogance developed from cocooning themselves in their comfort zones all the time. It takes an immense paradigm shift for one, at the risk of developing severe self-esteem issues, to honestly think that they are stupid and still have a lot to learn after getting their BBA, MBA, PhD, LLB, BEng, BSc, BA, MBBS, etc.</p>
              <p>The clock is ticking. Every lost second translates to a second unmonetised. My advice to budding entrepreneurs, coming from someone who is also struggling his way through an entrepreneurial journey, is to just get your hands dirty: talk to real entrepreneurs, try to build something cool and then approach customers/investors with the "something" that you created out of "nothing".</p>

              For retail business, the location is very important, then the product range to meet the needs of customers' profile frequenting the shopping mall.

              <p><br>I'm not in any business at the moment. But if you really want to do business, it is most profitable selling things that are expendable such as consumables. One good place to look for the item would be in your home. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>And who says you must rent a shop to start a business? How come you cannot invest the money meant for rental on TV advertising?</p>
              <p>If you think f&amp;b is going to fail and you have no confidence in making it a success, then why must you insist on doing f&amp;b business?</p>
              <p>The difference between a successful business person and an unsuccessful business person is their mindset. If you are stubborn and inflexible to adapt to your current situation and environment in the marketplace, do you think you are going to be the successful or unsuccessful business person?</p>
              <p>The important keypoint to success is to NOT and NEVER focus and dwell upon your obstacles. You should be focusing on how big you expect your business to grow, and the rest of the plans will fall into places.</p>
              <p>And don't come tell me it cannot be done, because many people has done it already. The only thing that cannot be done is you, yourself. You cannot make yourself into a successful business person if you think it cannot be done. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Oh...and do it yourself, don't beg for partners if you are looking to succeed. Cos there can really be one king, one dictator, one champion. Anything that is formed by ONE is most likely to succeed.</p>

              <p>The most important thing is actually...</p>
              <p>Connection.</p>
              <p>With connection, you can be anything.</p>
              <p>Connection is the net which help you when you fall down.</p>
              <p>Connection is the one which put you in high places and overtake
              others with the same capabilty as you.</p>
              <p>Connection is the one which opens door.</p>
              <p>So, to conclude and exapand on this idea.....I would say...the
              greatest way to achieve this method is by......yes, marriage...</p>
              <p>Since you cannot choose your parents, you can only choose your
              spouse.</p>
              <p>So, for all young men out there, go seduce a rich man's
              daughter.</p>
              <p>Once you get married to a rich man's daughter, waaa.......how
              many steps have you jumped?</p>

              Cannot depend on connection.
              
              The real entrepreneur doesnt depend on connection.
              
              Many start out from scratch -"White hand up family"
              
              If one has the thinking of depending on others to help him build his business, then he is bound to be disappointed.
              
              Connection wont last.  Because business people are not stupid, unless you are useful and can be made use of all the times, once you are of no value to him, out you go.

                              I'm not in any business at the moment. But if you really want to do
                              business, it is most profitable selling things that are
                              expendable such as consumables. One good place to look
                              for the item would be in your home. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
                  --------------------------------------------------------------
              
                              
                              Depends. consumables and whatever you have in your home already have businesses supplying. There are already so many competiters around.
                              
                              How to get people to buy from you rather than the present suppliers is the challenge you need to take.
                  ================================================================
                              
                              
                              <p>The difference between a successful business person and an
                              unsuccessful business person is their mindset. If you are stubborn
                              and inflexible to adapt to your current situation and environment
                              in the marketplace, do you think you are going to be the successful
                              or unsuccessful business person?</p>
                              <p>The important keypoint to success is to NOT and NEVER focus and
                              dwell upon your obstacles. You should be focusing on how big you
                              expect your business to grow, and the rest of the plans will fall
                              into places.</p>
                              
                  
                  ------------------------------
              
                    
              Not that simple. There are many factors that determine whether a business can be successful or not. Some are internal factors, which are easier to manage.  The worst are external factors which are beyong control.  Many a times, successful businesses are killed by competitors and change of circumstances.
                              
                  ==========================================================================
                              
                              <p>And don't come tell me it cannot be done, because many people
                              has done it already. The only thing that cannot be done is you,
                              yourself. You cannot make yourself into a successful business
                              person if you think it cannot be done. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
                              <p>Oh...and do it yourself, don't beg for partners if you are
                              looking to succeed. Cos there can really be one king, one dictator,
                              one champion. Anything that is formed by ONE is most likely to
                              succeed.</p>

              <p>U can always do a pre-nup agreement u know. So at least ur current property before your marriage will remain yours in an event both parties seek a divorce. But only property after marriage can be considered.</p>
              <p>If my future wife tells me this, then I just buy own house n put under my own name. And if issue of trust cant even be resolved, then might as well divorce, or just treat her as the big wife while u have small wife. Wonder whats the point of marriage under that context. hahaha</p>

              <p>So many rich people displaying their wealth in here, how come they are not afraid of being kidnapped, kept in a basement dungeon and sexually abused for days?</p>
              <p>Evil people don't really want money for ransom, some monsters just need to feed their diminished ego by proving they are sexually superior by assaulting girls beyond their reach.</p>

              <p>i have seen many shops with few customers. my friends and i
              wonder how they survive. any idea ? the rental is at least
              $8000 - $10 000 per month.</p>

              <p>Ya I wonder too.</p>
              <p>But doesn't matter. If they fail, the money (rental) still goes, and eventually, a wee tiny bit still makes itself into my pocket via REITs.</p>
