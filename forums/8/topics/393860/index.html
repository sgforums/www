              <p>basically all you need is some money, a product, good marketing strategy and thats it.</p>
              <p>i started mine with just a few hundred dollars before i make thousands per year.</p>
              <p> but be prepared to set aside 500 dollars to start a business bank account which you have to open within 3 months from the day you register your business at ACRA.</p>
              <p>one other thing is that you must be confident and commited yet careful. first few months are very difficult, but once you get a regular customer, you'll start to see your business is making profit.</p>
              <p>I say dont start a business if you a scared of commiting and you're not confident of your product. Do some research first on the demand of the product here. Calculate the risk, how many percent profit you will make, etc.</p>
              <p>depending on what business you want to start, best is to have at least 20K for capital the minimum...</p>
              <p>hope this helps</p>

              <p>i went to this shopping centre in surabaya, indonesia, found a hush puppies shoe and checked the price. It was about S$180. The same in Sg sells for $165. The average hush puppies salesperson in sg earn $1500 a month? The one in Surabaya earns $100.</p>
              <p>Taking into account the rental difference between Sg and Surabaya, it is indeed more difficult to do a business in Sg. Wonder why there are so many rich indo-chinese? hahaha.</p>

              <p>By the time you finish thinking and planning (that's if you finish because it will never be enough), others would already be way ahead.</p>
              <p>The key thing is the perception of money. You are extremely afraid that all your hard earned money will be gone; you can't afford to risk a single cent. And that's where differentiates the successful and the failures in businesses. There's no such thing as a totally risk free venture that will make you a tidy sum.</p>
              <p>The same thing goes for investing. I researched a lot and determined that I want to enter a particular stock, and told my sis so. She said will only buy if I can guarantee her will profit within 6 months. I told her forget it, don't buy. {There are other concepts here as well which I won't touch}.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another example: I started a finance blog which has about 100~200 unique readers a day now... Starting from US$1 a month or less from adsense advertising, it has grown to about US$20+, while I'm doing it to help myself think clearer before plugging my funds into any investments. My main risk is the time I took to set it up, because the opportunity cost of my time is quite huge; I can easily go outside and ask for much more. But I just went ahead and set it up.</p>
              <p>The key is, just do it. Learn and think as you do. Think too long and you won't go and do it in the end.</p>
