              <p>For a start, you might want to stop abusing the term "entrepreneur" when you mean to refer to "businessman". I take offence when people compare what I do to what a restaurant owner, retail store owner, blog owner, web design firm owner or events management company owner does. Just for starters, you might want to appreciate the following differences (since you've demonstrated that resourcefulness is not your strength):</p>
              <p>1) Entrepreneurs have vision. They tackle known/unknown problems with unknown solutions. They build a compelling product or service to address pain points that most people are blind to, even if it's their own needs.</p>
              <p><strong>Translation for you</strong>: Entrepreneurs are substantially original in one way or another.</p>
              <p>2) Entrepreneurs only build scalable businesses. The crap that most wannabe-businessmen dabble in is not what one would call scalable.</p>
              <p><strong>Translation for you</strong>: Entrepreneurs are not looking for a money-making machine to fund their hedonistic lifestyles.</p>
              <p>3) Entrepreneurs appreciate the necessity of intellectual property, preferably of the "technological sophistication" variety, for their businesses to grow. If you don't have a technical skill, you're not an entrepreneur.</p>
              <p><strong>Translation for you</strong>: Entrepreneurs are highly intelligent.</p>
              <p>Don't simply use the word "entrepreneur" again; you sound stupid, ignorant and severely unworldly and under-educated. I'm not wasting anymore time -- time to build more sweat equity.</p>

              <p>I am highly confident of graduating with at least US$100,000 in cash (I have two more years or so, and I'm halfway through that figure), plus another uncertain figure of illiquid equity in my company (seven figures valuation if I hit certain business milestones in time).

              <p>Glad we're all on the route to a better financial state. I mean it. By the way, 25 years old is a really young age to start too. Where I work, there are tons of 25- or 26-year-old entrepreneurs who pay themselves something like S$500 to $1,000 a month just to build their businesses. I suppose though, people have different appetites for risk.</p>
              <p>I don't have to do NS; I'm neither a PR nor a citizen, so I graduated from JC in 2007 and enrolled in university in 2008.</p>

              <p>Glad we're all on the route to a better financial state. I mean
              it. By the way, 25 years old is a really young age to start too.
              Where I work, there are tons of 25- or 26-year-old entrepreneurs
              who pay themselves something like S$500 to $1,000 a month just to
              build their businesses. I suppose though, people have different
              appetites for risk.</p>
              <p>I don't have to do NS; I'm neither a PR nor a citizen, so I
              graduated from JC in 2007 and enrolled in university in 2008.</p>

              <p>2nd paragraph is very true, yet also very wrong.</p>
              <p>The ultimate aim is there, but the path to reach it will require you to work from morning to night. Many think only about the end, and not the pathway, and that's one of the reasons why many businesses startups fail. Imagine working 20 hours day for only like... $5 a day intially?</p>

              <p>One must have certain traits, mentality and character to become a successful businessman.</p>
              <p>To start a business is not easy and to sustain the business is even more difficult.</p>
