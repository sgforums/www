If that 3000 is for general expenses to stay in the us... Then i would say its pretty doable...<br><br>If you're willing to backpack (I know some great hostels in LA) and you might have to live on a fast food diet most of the time (Very little variety of food) to save cost. Hostels there are pretty much safe.<br><br>Average expenses would set you around USD$75 a day in LA &amp; Las Vegas<br><br>San Francisco would be a little more pricey = USD$80 - USD$90 a day<br><br>New York would set you back around at least $100 a day to easily $150<br>(New York taxes &amp; cost of living is almost comparable to Tokyo)<br><br>Florida there actually isn't much to see if you're into seeing city sights. Only thing good there is the theme parks and beach. Beaches you can go in LA also.<br><br>Public transport is a nightmare to use (except in NY) so you might be waiting at bus stops and train stations alot so plan your day early.<br><br>Travelling city to city the best way is taking the amtrak (Train)<br>Safe, Clean, Excellent Views &amp; Damn Fast<br><br>There is the cheaper "Greyhound Bus" but unless you're willing to sit in a bus full of ex-cons and mexicans, i salute you. so DON'T take it if you fear for your own safety.<br><br>Best way to carry money is carrying a credit card. Usually when i travel half my money is in my wallet and i guard it with my life along with my passport.<br><br>Get one of those "chest vests" to keep ur personal stuff under your shirt<br>(dunno if you male or female so...yeah =P )<br><br>If you got more questions PM me<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>get a debit card and just keep a minimal amount of cash with you. Almost everything can be bought using credit/visa card.<br><br>West coast is nicer than east coast I think. Cities wise.. you'll find that cities are about the same after you visit a few of them. I'll prefer to include at least one national park in a usa trip.<br><br>West coast, you can try Yosemite national park which is 4 hrs drive from San Francisco (I'm thinking of gg in late april)<br><br>If you go Las Vegas, you can try to go Grand Canyon (5 hrs drive)<br><br>Los Angeles isn't too amazing unless you like beaches and it's warm enough OR if you want to go Disneyland and other theme parks<br><br>I can give you more tips if needed and when you have a more concrete movement plan across the country. Be warned... USA is a massive huge country!<br><br>Also you need to state when you are going and whether you'll be driving cos seasons affect your plans and it is quite useful to drive around in usa.</div>
