All I get is a bill."<br><br>"If you talk to women about how they use men for money, they all say, `Oh I know women like that, but that's not me. I'm not like that'. Then just watch them throw themselves at a guy who pulls up in a Porsche!"<br><br>"There's a difference between the sex you pay for and the sex you get for free. The sex you get for free usually costs more."<br><br>"Women want a guy who looks like Tom Cruise, acts like James Bond, who just won the Lotto and reads poetry. Women are stupid."<br><br>"What really aggravates me about women is that they can have sex anytime they want to. They can just walk up to some guy they think is attractive and say, `Let's do it'. What's the guy going to say? No? Men aren't game-players like women. But, if a man wants to get laid, he has to jump through hoops, and then maybe she'll sleep with him. And after you've spent all that time and money and mental bullsh*t just to get her into bed, she wants to cuddle. How much of this can we take?"<br><br>"Love is a five-letter word. M - O - N - E - Y"<br><br>"I hear married women complaining that their husbands come home dog tired and don't have the energy to do anything. Well, somebody's gotta pay the mortgage . . .Â”<br><br>"Women want money now-they don't care about a guy's potential. They're walking cash registers. The only possible exception is if you're in some training program for a highpaying career, like medical school. Then they'll work to put you through school becausethey're dreaming of the big house you're going to build for them. It's like making an investment in a growth stock. It's funny-once in a while you hear a story about a woman who helps put her boyfriend through school, and then he dumps her after he graduates. My God, you'd think the world had ended! This babe is on the Oprah show whining and moaning about what `pigs' men are. But think about it, turnabout is fair play. Women have been doing this to men for centuries. They can dish it out but they can't take it."<br><br>"Let's be honest. Women accept you or reject you as a lover based solely on the level of your income. They say they don't, but they do. You can be short, bald, fat, and ugly, but if you've got a million dollars, you'll get a woman. But turn the equation around-what if a guy said to a woman, `I'd like to go out with you, but your t*ts are too small'. She'd be calling him every name in the book. Yet she feels it's O.K. to reject men without big bucks. Pretty sad."<br><br>"Women think that men want to have sex 24 hours a day. Sure we would, if you look like something out of Playboy."<br></div>
