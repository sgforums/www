Why cane the soldier if he is too anxious to jump from the plane?<br><br>Sorry, but to a forigner, canning in Singapore seems like the main solution to all problems. Can't read? Cane. Can't do the exercise? Cane. Can't stop discussing a specific issue? Cane. Child doesn't stop crying? Cane. Arrested person claims innocence? Cane to he declares himself guilty.</blockquote>When i was young..... my parent cane the sh** out of me. But come to think of it, they were right to do so. Must admit that i wasn't such a good apple as my bro &amp; sis...... i steal, lie, cheat at school and fail my test.<br><br>But in no way was i ever abuse by my parents. Now, as an adult... i must thank them for the beating because it set me on the correct path in life. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Please try to understand that in <strong>Asia Culture</strong>, caning a child is for his/her own good. WE still believe in the saying - <strong>Spare the rod, spoil the child</strong> - but <strong>ABUSE</strong> is a big <strong>NO NO</strong><br><br>For Rapist and Criminmal........ caning will remind them what <strong>NOT</strong> to do next time.</div>
