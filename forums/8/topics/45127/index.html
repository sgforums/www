            <div class='col-md body'>Today afternoon, i sat on my friends brother's motorcycle. I once commented that i never have a chance to sit on a bike and my friend suggested that i take a ride on her brother's bike. I did not refuse and she called her brother down. Her brother was quite good looking but i can't help but notice that he was staring a me from head to toes.(this was the first time we met even though her sister and i were very good friends.)<br><br>Anyway he started his bike and i tried very hard to get on board his bike. I was still in school uniform. Then we hit the road and he went quite fast. I was initally holding on to the sides of his bike but i was so scared that i grabbed his waist. I told him to slow down as i was terribly scared and my skirt was hiking up.<br><br>Of course he didnt slow down much but forunately it was a short ride. When we got back to the car park where my friend/her sister was waiting, i hurried of his bike as soon as he stopped. My friend ask whether it was fun. i said no and passed the helmet to her. I said that it was a horrible experience . Guess i am a very timid girl after all.<br><br>My friend and his brother waved good bye to me and they went off.<br><br>Haha i know that bike riding is supposed to be fun but maybe i am too timid.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

I once commented that i never have a chance to sit on a bike and my friend suggested that i take a ride on her brother's bike. I did not refuse and she called her brother down. Her brother was quite good looking but i can't help but notice that he was staring a me from head to toes.(this was the first time we met even though her sister and i were very good friends.)<br><br>Anyway he started his bike and i tried very hard to get on board his bike. I was still in school uniform. Then we hit the road and he went quite fast. I was initally holding on to the sides of his bike but i was so scared that i grabbed his waist. I told him to slow down as i was terribly scared and my skirt was hiking up.<br><br>Of course he didnt slow down much but forunately it was a short ride. When we got back to the car park where my friend/her sister was wait, i hurried of his bike as soon as he stopped. My friend ask whether it was fun. i said no and passed the helmet to her. I said that it was a horrible experience . Guess i am a very timid girl after all.<br><br>My friend and his brother waved good bye to me and they went off.<br><br>Haha i know that bike riding is supposed to be fun but maybe i am too timid.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> </div></blockquote>Actuali e 1st time i ride my bf's bike i oso v scared.
