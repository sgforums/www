            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe its because of this "high living" that is why you see maid abuse cases.A developed country does not necessarily means its denizens are gracious,let's not mix that up.<br>Living in sg and having a maid myself(she's close to the family),i can testify that there are maids out there who are treated in a "humane" and modest manner.<br>It just all boils down to luck when working for different households if you ask me.Some maids have all the freedom and live like princesses(allowed to wear jewellery and frequent orchard) while some of the other low-ends barely live to see another day.<br><br>Now on to why some are treated like slaves.There is a need to treat others equally but a certain code of hierachy in a servant-master context means that the maid is bound to her duties while the employer has no obligation in his contract to see to more "preferential treatment" than what is stated in the terms of agreement.So if a maid happens to land in a family that extends warmth to her then it is indeed a blessing already....in sg.<br><br>------------------<br>Because anyone hides pain in the depths of their hearts.Or so I knew.<br>If there's a reason to fight in this time, this place,<br>Then I can fly, without being afraid of being lost.<br>I unsheath only my rage.<br>Live now, in everything<br><br>[This message has been edited by Sweet_vengeance (edited 21 January 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A fair way to look at a maid's pay packet is to compare it based on the pay packet given out to a comparable foreign labour.<br><br>For example..take a Blangadesh construction worker. He works something like 8 hours a day, is entitled to live in quarters, is free to go out with his friends after work, enjoy public holidays and sundays.<br><br>Now a Blangadesh worker earns much more obviously. But the quarter probably will ask him to pay for his meals.<br><br>Well, you decide.</div>
