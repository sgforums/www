            <div class='col-md body'>1.   Be realistic about each other.<br><br>Don't try to turn your partner into something he or she is not.Let's face it, guys, there's only one Pamela Anderson in the world,and even she has had her implants removed!  Give your woman a break and<br>understand that her physical appearance is not going to change overnight with the help of a few facials or treatments.  And ladies, Brad Pitt has already been taken, so you're gonna have to do with what your man is like!  Chill out, love each other for what you are.  There is more to your partner<br>than what meets the eye.<br><br>2.   Always talk things out.<br>Now guys, I know this is probably not your favourite pastime or mode of resolving issues, but you know what?  This works with the girls. Don't make assumptions about each other's feelings.  Learn to express yourself better so that your partner understands what you're angry about, or hurt about, or even happy about!  When you stop talking to each other from the heart, it's the beginning of the end.<br>3.   Do stuff together.<br>Make an effort to do things together.  Do some sports or involve yourself in some shared activities; something both of you enjoy and are interested in. It could be as simple as watching VCDs together, or just<br>strolling hand-in-hand down Orchard Road.  Watch soccer with him once in a while, though the green patch on TV puts you to sleep in 3 seconds. And guys, do give in if your gal asks for another day at window-shopping, rather than suggest that she go out with her girlfriends or that sort<br>of activities instead.  If you're spending more time with your friends rather than your partner, it's a warning sign that you're drifting apart!<br>4.   Meet each other halfway.<br>If he agrees to throw out that rotten T-shirt with the Hulk Hogen print, you shouldn't kick up too much of a fuss if he asks you to keep your room tidy. There's got to be a little bit giving and taking in a<br>relationship, so learn to meet each other halfway.<br>5.   Show your love.<br>Buy her flowers or chocolates or perfume every now and then, even if you have been together for five years.  It's wonderful to continue showing someone that you care for him or her.  Cook him a special meal,<br>paint him a Valentine's Day card.  Knit him mini-socks he can't wear,<br>buy him a packet of milk for breakfast, or pack his wardrobe for him? so he<br>knows you can still be romantic and loving despite having been together for a<br>while.<br>6.   Respect each other.<br>Stop making jokes about her hair or skin, or whatever it is you love to laugh at.  Ask yourself if she thinks it's funny.  And if he has an inferiority complex about his height, stop ogling at tall guys and<br>make him feel worse! Love is about respecting each other's feelings and being<br>sensitive to each other at all times.<br>7.   Bury the past.<br>Stop bringing up the past.  No one wants to be reminded ofthe things that they're not proud of, so if he made an ass of himself over something trivial, laugh about it in private but don't keep bringing it up<br>with him! And forgive her for her occasional dramatic throws of hysteria; she'll probably feel a lot more awful about it than you later.  Whatever happened before is over.<br>8.   Sit on your jealousy.<br>All of us go through spells of insecurity at the beginning of the relationship, but don?t translate that insecurity into<br>jealousy. If you're going through your partner's mail and cupboard, and<br>eavesdropping on conversations, you know something's wrong with you!<br>Jealousy is like a poison that slowly spreads through the relationship before<br>killing it. Trust your partner; love has to have trust in it.<br>9.   Keep your commitments to each other.<br>If your partner is standing you up all the time and cancelling dates<br>and breaking promises, you need to talk!  If you're in a relationship, make your partner your priority and don't disappoint them if you can help it. It's really terrible when someone promises to take you to<br>dinner, and then calls to cancel it.  Don't make promises you can't keep.  If<br>your partner starts to feel that he/she is not important enough to you, you may<br>just lose him/her.<br>10.  Be honest.<br>Honesty is not scowling at how awful she looks first things in  the morning, or telling him he has the biceps of a fly!  When we say be honest, we mean expressing your feelings clearly, not being bitingly cruel. When you're hurt, say so, and when you're angry, tell him/her, without getting<br>hysterical. If you can't be honest with your partner, who can you be honest with? Love is also about honesty, and a relationship where no honesty exists probably isn'tworth it!<br><br>------------------<br>Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they<br>were to success when they gave up ....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FRIENDSHIP.<br>May sound strange to some, but I believe that the relationship is actually a BONUS to the friendship that already exists between the two people.<br><br>Ideally, your spouse, if he or she were to be of the same sex as you, should be someone you choose as a best friend. Someone whom you can tell virtually anything to. Be utterly and painfully transparent with the other person.<br><br>It is so unwise to embark on a relationship (our infamous line: Guy to Girl, "Eh, ai gia steady mai?") when you hardly know the person. Knowing and understanding each other are the fundaments of even a friendship!<br><br>If you compartmentalise your boyfriend or girlfriend from your friends (as in he or she wouldn't occur to you as a friend) then it's time for a re-evaluation of your attitude and respect towards him or her.<br><br>Perhaps I may be speaking nonsense, but these are some of the qualities that will hold the relationship through when the nice feelings don't come as often.<br><br>Love is not about feeling good or high. It's a commitment that both willingly give themselves to, and sticking by each other even when it sucks. It's also to say, "Dear, though I utterly dislike what you're doing, that doesn't change my love for you." The love is not dependent on what he or she does, or doesn't do. It's a commitment to the deepening and the strengthening of a precious friendship, an opening up of yourself that you would never do with anyone else.<br><br>------------------<br>Speak when you are angry and you will make the best speech you will ever regret. -- A.
