            <div class='col-md body'>19th Dec at about 7pm.<br><br>We were turning in from Jalan Eunos into Bedok Reservoir at block 634<br><br><a href="http://&lt;br%20/&gt;http://maps.yellowpages.com.sg/maps/scripts/default.asp?1=RadioButton4&amp;postcode=470140&amp;x=34&amp;y=15&lt;br%20/&gt;" rel="nofollow"><br>http://maps.yellowpages.com.sg/maps/scripts/default.asp?1=RadioButton4&amp;postcode=470140&amp;x=34&amp;y=15<br></a><br>It was raining so we were moving slowly. From way behind, a traffic warden with lights flashing, speeding all the way ahead of us. There are 2 lanes to turn into Bedok Reservoir. But instead he choose to cut in front of our lane in the middle of turning into Bedok Reservoir Road. Right in the middle of the junction.<br><br>If we had been a little faster in turning, we would have an accident with the warden. For all you know, if the accident happened, the warden might claim he didn't break any law and charge us for neligent (what a broad term) driving. He KNOW he was in the wrong. He turned back during mid turn and look at us. I should have shown him my middle finger. He's a skinny, very young, chinese male.<br><br>Then to prevent us from taking down his number plate, he speed off very quickly and dangerously squeezed in between buses, trucks and cars to get to the front. Then he made quick turns and disappear into a car park around that area.<br><br>From the responses in this forum, I don't know what the resident police is going to say to defend their fellow wardens as always. Maybe its the same political crap that "Wardens have important business to Book More People Jay Walking Across Car Parks therefore its alright he exercise his right to break every law in every book to get his JOB done, Hit Quota to make a couple more millions in Fine, even if it kills a couple of singaporeans. Surely, with the FT policy, 10K PRC FT will swam in and easily replace 2 Stupid, Un-Contributing, Singaporean."<br><br>This encounter all the more reinforce the message that as long as they are police or associated with police, they seem to be above the law.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Xcert:</div><div class="quote_body">got its license plate number?</div></blockquote>He saw us, we saw him when he turned around. I pointed that to his number plate. He speeded up and then cramp himself dangerously between sand trucks, buses and cars on a slippery slope on a rainy day just to 'escape'. So No I wish I had his number plate. The TP would have gotten my feedback that their own people are doing dangerous things to endanger the public.<br><br></div>
