            <div class='col-md body'>I read from various government job vacancies (for degree holders @ ministries and statutory boards) that they require good honours, or good degrees from recognised universities (esp our very own local universities). And even when they ask for only " At least a pass in a degree from a recognised university ", they seldom consider degrees below 2nd lower honours (including degrees without honours). And if forunately you get shortlisted for an interview, it's like you have to go through tedious QC (quality control) before you actually get the job(if you're lucky). They just wanna make sure that they are employing the cream of the crops.<br><br>Is that true??<br><br>Well, that's only my perspective, which may not be correct. Thats why I'm posting such a thread here....any views or verifications?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Speaking from real life experience, YES!!! It is very true. You need a good piece of paper to get in. After all, they are trying to get the cream of the crop into their ministries and statutory boards.<br><br>As for GLCs, there is more leeway but they would prefer good grades and if you were former gahmen ppl then better cuz you would have know their working corporate culture.<br><br>As for private sector, some don't like to employ former gahmen ppl becuz they know most of those are use mouth order ppl do work not hands on ppl. But then they still will employ if say company biggest customer is gahmen.<br><br>You all will be surprised how much money worth of contract is thrown out by gahmen every year to boost the economy. Mindef and MHA and MOE are the fat sheep a lot of private companies are eyeing cuz they are given the largest pie of the budget every year.<br><br>To go gahmen sector, please prepare a big piece of paper  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was recently employed by a certain government ministry even though I only have a 2nd Lower Hons Degree. But I have 2 years of work experience in the private sector and this tipped the scale in my favour during the selection process.  And I think the that the test-essay that they will make you do during the 1st or 2nd interview will count during the selection process as well.<br><br>So it's not true that the government will only take in the "cream of the crop".  They consider other factors too before employing someone.<br><br>It's a great job...and it took me 2 years before I found it.  But it is worth the effort ...I wrote to this ministry 3 times in my 2 years before I succeeded on the 3rd try...<br><br>Good luck in your civil service job hunt  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
