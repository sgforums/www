            <div class='col-md body'>MY gf of 6 years broke up wif me on the 25th May, saying she wanted to be alone. I was living in hell for 3 weeks before she agreed to patch up wif me on the 10th Apr. I was so happy I could jump and pluck the moon down for her if she asked.<br><br>But ALAS, she broke off wif me again on the 14th Apr, she even wrote down her feelings on a piece of paper. I'll take a few extracts from the letter:<br>- during these few days that we're together, I feel that I really can't bring myself to love you, there's no feeling towards you at all.<br>- I am not ready to settle down at 23, and you are not the guy now to consider settling down wif. You are no longer the guy I love.<br>- I'm still young and there's a long way ahead of me to walk. I can't bring myself to plan my future wif you.<br>- I wish that you'll stop sms me, call me or look me up. I need a peace of mind, a clear mind.<br>- I wanna say sorry for the past few days that I've given you flase hope, for holding on and thinking far with me.<br><br>We had an hour long talk last night, she sounded happy, relaxed, excited at the new found single-dom. Though she admitted she loved me alot alot, but it was the past, the feeling has faded. I almost cried out, but I told myself not to cry infront of her. She assured me and my uncle that there's no 3rd party. She just want to be alone. Why the sudden change? I don't understand.<br><br>She let our r/s of 6 years go so easily! I really love her very much and I really feel like it's end of world now. I want to die, but I can't. I haf no mood for anything now. No one has ever made me so miserable b4, the 3 weeks of tears I've shed are more than wat I've cried when I was still young. This fall is so great, I don't think I'll be able to get up. The scar is so deep, I won't accept another.<br><br>I don't her to be owned by other ppl, other guys. I want her to be mine alone only. I even joked to her that if ever she's married to another guy and she invites me to her wedding, I'll sing Eason Chan's Hun Li De Zhu Fu. I can't imagine other guys, holding her hand, kiss her cheeks, etc. I'll go MAD. I think I'll kill the guy, kill her then kill myself. I'm serious..<br><br>There's this girl I'm very close to all along, during the 3weeks, I confided in her most of the time. She had hinted that she'll be wif me if I asked. I feel she just wanted to help me forget her. All the more I can't accept her, I can't bear to let my ex go, I don't want to hurt this good friend of mine. I've become self protected, I'm afraid I'll be hurt a 2nd time.<br><br>She flew off to China this morning 10am for a week long holiday wif her sister. Women can be so heartless ya? After hurting someone she's loved so long, still can go enjoy...<br></div>
