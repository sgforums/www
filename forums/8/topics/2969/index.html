I eventually broke up with her but she never knew the real reason and i dun think i should tell her. i was guilty being with her. it reminded me of my sin and immorality and i could not talk with her as she was not a christian and would not understand. now... i tell myself that i will never do it again except with my wife. it took pretty long for me to forgive myself...<br><br>some advice... once given, never forgotten... save it for marriage.<br><br>------------------<br>Let him that move the world, first move himself.</div>
