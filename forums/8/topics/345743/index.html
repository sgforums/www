              <p>Just curious, but for those who know, what do you need to be a teacher in kindergarten?</p>
              <p>need to go poly and take up some diploma course in childcare education or something?</p>
              <p>also, what does the course teaches?</p>
              <p>recently, i started to discover myself and that i actually like little kids so much! those under 5 yrs old, or even 3 - 4 years old, are so cute! everytime when i see them, i suddendly forget all my worries and troubles etc, not to mention playing with them.</p>
              <p>i can spend 1 whole week doing nothing but playing with them!</p>
              <p>but then, for a guy to become a kindergarten teacher is very weird, because people tend to think that:</p>
              <p>1) you're a paedophile (seriously, those **** paedophiles have given people like me a bad name and people now are wary of guys who likes kids)</p>
              <p>2) you've no backbone, no ambition, a loser in life etc.</p>
              <p>anyway, i'm already 25 yrs old liao, now working in office type of corporate life and i dread it. And 25 yrs old go to poly and study childcare with mainly 16 - 18 yr old girls is the weirdest **** in the world.</p>

              <p>The fastest/easiest/least stressful way to go into kindergarten teaching is just to take up a CPT (Certificate, preschool teaching) with any private school. As for what you will learn, let me just copy-and-paste. Is up to your own interests and passion if you want to take this route, as long as you have a clear conscience don't need to worry unduly about what others think.</p>

              <p>Yes. That would depend on the scale of the centre and how many kids there is. If you go to neighbourhood small set ups, expect only about plus minus 1.2k, but that's because you will probably be working only half days, and will be expected to take care of the kids (vomit, pee, tantrums, ear splitting tempers) more than actually teaching.</p>
              <p>However, if you do get a position at one of the bigger franchised preschool education centres, your salary will be adjusted accordingly to your qualifications, 1.8k upwards if you're lucky, but do remember that such centres have reputations, syallabuses to follow and certain teaching 'styles' you have to adhere to. Do note that competition for such places are inevitably fiercer.</p>

              <p>Yes. That would depend on the scale of the centre and how many kids there is. If you go to neighbourhood small set ups, expect only about plus minus 1.2k, but that's because you will probably be working only half days, and will be expected to take care of the kids (vomit, pee, tantrums, ear splitting tempers) more than actually teaching.</p>
              <p>However, if you do get a position at one of the bigger franchised preschool education centres, your salary will be adjusted accordingly to your qualifications, 1.8k upwards if you're lucky, but do remember that such centres have reputations, syallabuses to follow and certain teaching 'styles' you have to adhere to. Do note that competition for such places are inevitably fiercer.</p>

              <p>Yep, 1.5k, your take home pay is 1.2k about there mah. But FI is right, classroom prep takes up a lot of time. And being a preschool teacher requires one to be extremely patient and tolerant. Helps to be good at Arts and Crafts as well.</p>
              <p>Does TS still wants to be a preschool teacher? the kids won't be cute and cuddly ALL THE TIME, well, most of the time they will be trying to test the limits of your patience, you will be their maid and servant more than being their playmate. If the "cuteness" is the only motivating factor, I think you may like to seriously reconsider your career change.</p>
              <p>By the way, you're not allowed to get angry/lose your temper at them hor.</p>

              <p>Just curious, but for those who know, what do you need to be a
              teacher in kindergarten?</p>
              <p>need to go poly and take up some diploma course in childcare
              education or something?</p>
              <p>also, what does the course teaches?</p>
              <p>recently, i started to discover myself and that i actually like
              little kids so much! those under 5 yrs old, or even 3 - 4 years
              old, are so cute! everytime when i see them, i suddendly forget all
              my worries and troubles etc, not to mention playing with them.</p>
              <p>i can spend 1 whole week doing nothing but playing with
              them!</p>
              <p>but then, for a guy to become a kindergarten teacher is very
              weird, because people tend to think that:</p>
              <p>1) you're a paedophile (seriously, those **** paedophiles have
              given people like me a bad name and people now are wary of guys who
              likes kids)</p>
              <p>2) you've no backbone, no ambition, a loser in life etc.</p>
              <p>anyway, i'm already 25 yrs old liao, now working in office type
              of corporate life and i dread it. And 25 yrs old go to poly and
              study childcare with mainly 16 - 18 yr old girls is the weirdest
              **** in the world.</p>

              <p>You only need a diploma, maybe lesser, and a definite passion for kids.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Sure they're cute, till they start pissing and pooping all over the damn place.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> You spend 52 weeks a year playing with them, then see if you still dread it.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Little kids are always cute, coz if they aren't, they won't be called cute little kids.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Don't consider the certificate. Go to RTRC-Asia and take up a diploma in ECH. Diploma holders can now get a starting pay of $1600 - $1800. Btw, for ECH teachers now, you need at least a B4 in english o levels before you're qualified to be one.</p>
              <p>P.S. RTRC-Asia isn't a poly. more of like private thing. So you don't have to worry about meeting teenage girls. My lecturers say there are middle aged people attending the diploma course as well.</p>
              <p>P.P.S: There are guys in my course! 4 guys. Don't worry too much. Lol.</p>
