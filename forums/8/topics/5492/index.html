            <div class='col-md body'>Woohoo!!! here comes the legendary<br>StarGazer from NUS's School of Computing's<br>fame!<br><br>It seems that there are a lot of heart<br>wrenching experiences here by a lot of<br>people here. It seems that guys here get<br>hurt by girls quite often, it leads me<br>to think how often are girls hurt by guys?<br><br>Nowadays with guys starting to be tied to<br>the bed and get whipped, it is not strange<br>to think that gals are armed, more and more,<br>than they were in the past to hurt guys.<br>Perhaps this is a side product of the<br>feminist movement.<br><br>I read about some stories about some<br>girlfriends of guys here sleep with other<br>guys. While I do respect your choice of a<br>bed partner, please dump the other guy<br>before you do so. It is very hurting for<br>a guy to know that his galfriend sleeps<br>with another guy. If you dump him before<br>you do so, perhaps he will be less hurt.<br><br>Anyway, about the gathering you people are<br>talking about, if you do not mind a lao<br>ah pek (I am 26 years old) joining you all<br>I would like to come as well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>While a few of us have been hurt, I think that we still try to keep a positive outlook...right guys?<br><br>Also, it has to do with a few of us having to deal with our own feelings towards what happens to us...ok-quite vague compared with my other posts, but i guess it will have to do...<br><br>I realise just tonight how nice and friendly a lot of pretty girls are...but I came away from that experience even more depressed than when I was thinking a lot of them are screwed up.  It has more to do with how the individual deals with his situation.  I guess i was depressed becasue I knew that nice or not, these same friendly girls would neevr be mine.....<br><br>Quite tragic.....I know that some of u know I got a GF, but I can't tell the whole story as i am afraid she will enter this board one day...:-)So for now, u will have to think that I am a bastard...but hopefully when u know the full story...nothing exciting...then maybe...u will be a bit more forgiving of me...<br><br>:-)<br><br>Cheers<br><br>PS-Wanna join us join man....I'm 25 yars old.  AS long as u don't wear bright purple pants and feathers on your head with flashing blue lights evertiem ur fone rings,...then OK....Even then, come and join us...but I think that most will be quite young...</div>
