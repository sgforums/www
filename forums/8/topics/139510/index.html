            <div class='col-md body'>while  my story might be a bit off tangent... i was in a LAN shop (about 7 years ago when lan shops started getting hot) when police came in and shut the place down. Apparently the dude had no licence and didn't put up appropriate notices. Out of ALLLLLL my friends.. i was chosen to give statement. I remember them asking me "do you know its illegal for you to play games in this shop wearing your school uniform?" (haha we were all in sch uniform that time) and "how much are you paying to play here?" and "do you know that this shop has no licence"<br><br>wah i felt damn bad for the shop owner.. young ah beng... damn poor thing. And after that when the police let me go (not at station.. still at the shop) the owner tell all of us no need pay and that he very sorry.<br><br>The funny thing is.. there was a shop blatantly selling pirated games just 5 shops away around the corner... and although the mata was inside.. they were browsing and buying games leh... hmmmmmmmmmmmmm</div>
