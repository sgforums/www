Cries of pain, bawls of sadness, and wails of torture, all echoed down the corridor. AMEN shuddered once she heard the cries. A firm hand pressed onto her left shoulder. He scrambled to him, wrapping his arms around his waist. His purpose of coming into this haunting laboratory wasÂ… downright disturbing.<br><br>AMEN tilted his head upwards, looking at the man in a white lab coat. He could not make out how he looked, or even see the top half of his body. All he could see was the bottom half bloodstained white coat, black trousers that were starched and gleaming shoes that clacked every time he paces. He stopped. AMEN followed suit. The scientistÂ’s grubby hands into his shirt pocket before pulling out a key with a Swastika logo stamped on it. Unlocking the rusty iron door, AMEN soon realized what he needed to do. All that he was required to do was sit on the steel, experiment chair. The dried bloodstains on it stabbed his mind, as if telling him to turn back. Howls of pain echoed once again. His legs quivered as AMEN made his way to take a seat. While doing so, he could feel the cold concrete floor numbing his feet even though he wore shoes. The eerie atmosphere enveloped him, as if he was being consumed. The cold steel rubbing against his skin was like a knife hacking a portion of his flesh.<br><br>Â“Huh?Â” was his only reply when the scientist began to chain, and straps him up.<br><br>AMENÂ’s arms were strapped to the arm rests by thick, bloodied canvas and belted. His legs were chained firmly, preventing movement. His torso was wrapped just firm enough to allow slight movement and air flow with canvas and belted. By then, he was ready. Ready, to be the scientistsÂ’ guinea pig. Ready, to either change his life, or end it. AMEN could see the translucent dull grey fluid in the syringe where the scientist was holding it. He panicked, momentarily. A thought ran into his mind, somehow calming him down in the process. A sharp pain could be felt on his left arm at the deltoid. He could feel the cold contents entering his blood system as AMEN flinched for a split second. The scientist yanked the syringe out before moving towards the glass windows with a thumb up. AMENÂ’s eyes began to drift around as he makes an attempt to look at the group of scientists on the opposite room separated by several thick glass panels. One of the scientists then mouthed his words to her.<br><br>Â“For Fuhrer, for Mother Germany. Good luck, AMEN.Â”<br><br>A group of people, majority in white lab coats, stared at the test subject, whom had his eyes wandering around. They sighed, thinking that they had failed once again. Fifty years of perfecting this devastating concoction, which had claimed countless lives, had all gone to waste. A couple entered the room where the scientists were. One of them pointed his index finger to the boy in the other room. The couple turned their attention. There he was; their son, who had foolishly agreed to be the test subject.<br><br>AMENÂ’s mind was slowly drifting away until he took notice of a couple; his parents. He gazed at them, eyes telling his parents that he would be all right. However, things started to turn for the worse before AMEN could lift a smile on his face.<br><br>Â“UhÂ…AghÂ…Â”as the noises he could only voice out.<br><br>He could feel his pulse increasing. His breaths became heavier as second ticked by. His heart began to burn, as if someone was clawing it. His head began to pulsate, breaking out from a headache, to severe migraine. AMEN tried to move his arms, but they were belted firmly. The world around him began to spin as his eyes rolled. Saliva dribbled down his chin uncontrollably as the torture continued. He could feel as if his torso was beaten up with whips, baseball bats, and hammers. His legs broke out with severe cramps, sending a shock into his brain. AMEN shot his head upwards, before voicing out his moment of despair.<br><br>Â“Argh! Agh! Urgh! ErggÂ…Agh!Â” his cries echoed before more came out from his mouth. Â“Arg! Argh!Â”<br><br>Hot tears began streaming down his eyes. Cold sweat broke out from his forehead before beads of it trickled down to the cold concrete. Veins protruded out from his temples, throbbing violently, each time knifing into his brain. His torso trembled. His shirt was completely drenched in sweat. His arms bled due to the rust on the arm rests cutting into AMENÂ’s flesh. He shook his head, trying to get rid of the throbs in his skull. Nothing seemed to work. Instead, another bout of beating was felt on her torso ensued, this time as if he was being stabbed.<br><br></div>
