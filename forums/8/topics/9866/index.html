            <div class='col-md body'>During exam time I find myself fantasizing even more than usual. It takes the mind away from the more important things and give my near empty brain a break.<br><br>Other than the usual fantasies regarding flat screen monitors, T3 connections, and joint Elva and Coco concerts, lately I have been wondering what sort of job I would be most suitable for.<br><br>I've decided that I would make the perfect Guardian Angel.<br><br>For one thing, I have no life. My charge/s will be able to contact me 24/7 either on ICQ, home phone, or email. And I'll be there in a flash. Even on public holidays. I'm probably not doing anything exciting.<br><br>I don't drink or dance. So if I follow my charge to a club, I can look after your drink so that no one does funny thing to it e.g. spit in it. I am perfectly happy to sit and people watch, so I can keep an eye out for pretty people.<br><br>If you need to mess someone else up, I know a few Ah lians (sorry, I can't name them) who owe me some favours (i.e. money) and who hold themselve very well in bar room brawls.<br><br>I also know a few well connected people who also owe me favours (i.e. even more money). They are those that can get you free tickets to hot concerts and media passes to important events. All except for the Coco concert those useless idiots I don't know why I still talk to them.<br><br>Thats all I can come up with at the moment. Geez I'm bored. I hate biochem. I hate exams.<br><br>But all the best for everyone taking them.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 26 October 2000).]</div>

Dun deny it...u knw u wanna do this!<br><br>Besides, from an expert's point of view, you tend to excel when u suffer from a panic attack while writing a paper(i.e when u dun know the ans). The professors do give marks for creativity , ya know.<br><br>Besides, why be a guardian angel when you can stay back in sch for a few more yrs, get financing from home and lead a good life?!<br>The former is just too much work.

I'll get her fire on by slapping her, then she'll pull my hair while screaming "BIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITCH!" from behind the silver masking tape.  She'll pull my hair viciously until my neck feels like snapping and tears blur my eyesight for a while.  My claws will home in on her and grab the most exposed limbs I can find.  I'll spare no mercy, no thought of the antiviolence messages drilled into me by countless schooling.  All this behind a strange shriekless moment, only the soud of body slamming and torn fabrics.  We're all covered in yellow mud, totally masking our features so that she doesn't seem like her anymore, just a mudwoman.<br><br>Meanwhile her boyfriend is watching the proceeding with passive eyes while his unblinking video cameras take our pictures in a detached but serious manner.<br><br>Then we'll lie on the muddy mat, exhausted.

I was just sharing with dear Eck and Dangerguy last night about some skeletons in my lcoset about rash things I have done in my younger times. And it was common sensical(did I spell this right?) of you to just let them take that 5 bucks, they might need that anyway, think of it as gallantry, pity, charity or whatever, just know that you did the right thing. You dun want to regret anything in future should thing not go the way you want it to.<br><br>As for Coco and Elva, I tell you what, I'll take you to the Coco concert in Sg if you can make it back to Sg during that period. ( I can't recall the exact date, but It should be after your exams.) My treat, to a glorious night. How's that? But you better go do good for your biochem(or whatever else), before you come back and talk to me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> My my, I feel so old, I am actually trying to buy Mr Mini-James Lye candy for his grades.

I would always fantastise of scoring As while studying as little as I can while heralding my inborn genius.(That of course, never happened) Of course too much procrasination always results in Fs and sub papers.
