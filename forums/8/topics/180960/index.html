            <div class='col-md body'>no. job agencies will always have a larger pool of candidates to begin with, and a faster turnaround time when it comes to finding the right candidate. this advantage is mainly useful for part-time/temporary positions.<br><br>for one, ur HR dept dun have to handle first-level interviews and stuff, and spend the whole day reviewing a large number of people who will swarm ur office and disrupt ur operations. they are hence also useful for full-time/permanent positions in this manner.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The purpose of Job agency?<br><br>As wat ^tamago^ had said, they will handle the first level of interviews and such. Moreover, job agrencies will provide all the advertisements in recuiting people for jobs in newspaper, etc etc. And also act a mini union in case of worng pay or unfair dismissal. And, Alot of TEMP or contract based jobs can be found in job agencies...I think I found more then 10 so far.<br><br>And they are some company who will only accept new employees from job agrency, kind of like filtering loh.<br><br>How the commision works?<br><br>Imagine, u wished to work in Pizza international.<br><br>First, when u go to a job agency, they will ask what's your expected salary is. For the case of a temp job. 6 dollars per hour YOU asked for.<br><br>Then, the job agrency will ask the Pizza international for a rate of 7.5 dollars per hours. Thus, they will earn the $1.5 extra, BUT , u STILL get the 6 dollar you asked for. So, thats the deal. You get what u ASKED for.<br><br>A lot of firms I worked in, will outsource their employment area in HR to these companies, save cost loh.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I used to work in the Human Resources Division as an Administrator.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I know that there are companies who will make use of job agencies for temporary or contract positions because instead of increasing their headcount to have more staff in HR to handle such recruitment issues, they would rather outsource this so that their own HR staff will be free to handle other matters and less paperwork will be generated, as well as less man hours spent.<br><br>That's just one of several reasons why Employment Agencies are not redundant.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>That's just one of several reasons why Employment Agencies are not redundant.</strong><br><br>Agree with all the postings. But I have one query to add. Even within the employment agencies there are categories. Some agency deal mainly in so called blue collar workers or part-timers or contract ppl etc.<br><br>There are some so called high-class agency that deal with vice president, director, CEO kinda. This kind are so high class that if a successful deal goes through, the company can feed their employees for at least half a year to one year. Of cuz the recruitment consultant in such high class agency muz dress and speak well.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>As to comission for contract, part timers I am not sure but for permanent post, I think it is the a percentage of the starting pay of the successful candidate that goes through. It is say the first 3 months of that candidate? Sometimes agency call the candidate personally to check ard how much they are offered in case they scared the company lie to agency about the pay and pay them lesser.<br><br>Exampe Company recruit employee A at $X but they tell the agency who recommend A to them it is at $X - 500 ? So agency scared lose out will secretly called A and check out the rate discreetly  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I know cuz I was the employee A a few times.</div>
