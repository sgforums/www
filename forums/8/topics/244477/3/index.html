            <div class='col-md body'>I think the whole article is very misleading. First it already claimed it is not to be taken as medical advise and it is nothing but ideas. Second america, canada,australia and many other countries are still using flouride water. And it has never been proven to be harmful to human before. The research cited is on rats exposed to incredible amount of flouride.<br><br><a href="http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc227.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc227.htm</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">In general, however, there has been no consistent pattern; in some of these epidemiological studies, the increased morbidity or mortality due to cancer can be attributed to the workersÂ’ exposure to substances other than fluoride.<br><br>...<br><br>The relationship between the consumption of fluoridated drinking-water and morbidity or mortality due to cancer has been examined in a large number of epidemiological studies, performed in many countries. There is no consistent evidence of an association between the consumption of controlled fluoridated drinking-water and increased morbidity or mortality due to cancer.<br><br>...<br><br>Skeletal fluorosis may develop in workers occupationally exposed to elevated levels of airborne fluoride; however, only limited new information was identified.<br><br>...<br><br>Other studies, however, including analytical epidemiological investigations, have not supported this finding. In some cases, a protective effect of fluoride on fracture has been reported.<br><br>...<br><br>Epidemiological studies show no evidence of an association between the consumption of fluoridated drinking-water by mothers and increased risk of spontaneous abortion or congenital malformation. Other epidemiological investigations of occupationally exposed workers have provided no reasonable evidence of genotoxic effects or systemic effects upon the respiratory, haematopoietic, hepatic or renal systems that may be directly attributable to fluoride exposure per se.</span><br><br>BTW, fish, tea leaves and breast milk and almost all food have flouride as well.<br><br>The reason why flouride is taken out of water is because there are some idiots who felt wronged to be given "medication" without consultation. And these european country actually resort to take flouridated salt instead to compensate the lack of flouride in their water. If this is not dumb I do not know what is dumb.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_fluoridation" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_fluoridation</a><br><br>If there is no chlorine in the water, you probably die of dysentry first.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> And the reason why people are dying of cancer more because the other sickness can be cured with the current medical knowledge.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, you are drinking CHLORIDE IONS mostly, not chlorine.<br><br>Secondly fluoride below 2ppm is harmless, above 2ppm causes mottled teeth and above 10ppm then you will see things like brittle bones etc appearing.<br><br>Fluorine is not stored in the body and helps decrease the solubility of bone and teeth and increases deposition of calcium and phosphate onto teeth and bone, protecting them from acid destruction. Excess fluoride is easily passed out and thus only in super high doses can we see the negative effects of fluoride.<br><br>Nonsensical homeopathic MLM sales techniques do disgust me alot.</div>

Anyway, the will recycle used mineral water bottles. The mineral water are normally used by guests to mix with wine or quench thirst.<br><br>Means you drink finish the bottle of water then u go home already, the SOP is to collect all the used bottles from the rooms, refill the tap water DIRECTLY without washing into the bottle again just hours before the club open for business. Once filled up again, simply put it all back to the rooms with the cap on.<br><br>No seal is ok, because most customers will never check or they will not be bothered to ask as they may feel troublesome or they may think maybe just that bottled not sealed tightly.<br><br>Only the bottle of water in the room is recycle one, normally if you request second bottle, it will be the original unopened one. In doing so, when the customer see the bottle in unsealed, you can simply say oh, it was a mistake, or the seal is just not tight for this bottle, we replace for you.<br><br>There is alot of sneaky things in food and drinks business. It's almost like magic show, alot of things done behind the curtains.<br></div>
