            <div class='col-md body'>Hello to everyone here!<br><br>It was 1 1/2 years back. There is this girl that i'm interested in. She is from a different class. And I do not<br>know her and well..of course she doesn't know me. I've intended to get to know her. And yes, I was "humchee".<br>I do not know her name. Then one day I overheard her friend calling her.<br>Yes, got her name into my head. So I decided to look up for her in the irc to see if she's there (my school channel, I asked people if they know this person)<br>She was there!!! I was excited! Finally a chance to chat with her. I did the intro and all craps..<br>I told her that I know who you are and if I could say "hi" to her when I see her in school and so she agreed.<br><br>Saw her in school and then I went up to her and let her know who I was. ok, so now she knows who I am already.<br>And then when we see each other we will just "say Hi" and then tha'ts it. Most of the time we do that. I did once went up to her<br>and asked her how is she doing all these..homework..blah blah.. normal stuffs. talk alittle while.<br>I just know her for a few weeks only and then I decided to let her know how I felt about her. This conversation took place<br>in IRC.<br><br>it was kinda force myself out to tell her. And her reply was "I think you should not have this feeling in your heart"<br>Well..well...she's not interested in me. Ok, fine. Next she said "We can be friends"<br>and I was like "Glad to hear from you"<br><br>I know it was stupid of me to tell her my feelings. Scare her off only.<br>so after this chat with her, I start to talk less to her, irc never go already..but once in a while icq her.<br>and she never never initiate a chat with me over icq, and I always initiate the chat with her.<br>But i just tell myself that there are probably some people who are like this. Or she's busy.<br>but at least she got reply me when I asked her questions. I thought maybe she just don't want to make me think that she's interested<br>in me.<br><br>i've decided to keep less contact of her for 6months then perhaps by that time I will have not bother about her already.<br>but sheesh...i made a comeback. I asked her for her handphone number. Well..she gave it willingly. and she asked for mine.<br>ok, that's nice. =p<br>it was after a few days later I decided to ask her if can chat with her on the phone. She didn't want to chat with me over the phone at first.<br>I asked her "why not?  are you afraid that it will be awkward?" and she didn't say yes or no.<br>she said that she will be logging on to icq now to chat there.<br><br>then I tell her "I won't make you feel akward"<br>She then agree but she wanted to call me instead. so I was fine with it. I gave her my home phone number<br>then we chatted..<br>It was smooth...made her laugh, talk about school work..normal stuffs.<br>and after the conversation..ops..I did not ask her for her home number.<br>well...it's been 1 1/2 years after knowing her..then now then I talk to her over the phone.<br>It's my first time chatting a girl over the phone.<br><br>SO guys, here is the big question:<br>What do you think of the chances of me being able to become her boyfriend one day?<br><br>and what are your views? I've never had a gf before....NEVER! i'm 20 this year</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chances are there, but don't confine yourself just to her. Open up your social circle and make more frn esp girls. Start talking to her more on phone and ask her out for movie or coffee just like a frn would do. Nothing special to be nervous or shy about. Be cool and natural.<br><br>You still young lar..still got ns to worry and lots of thing to stablize after NS.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think you SHOULD stick to your SLOW WARM-LUKE strategy for now as it proves to be more EFFICIENT and MEANINGFUL... Just keep up with your MOMENTUM...

From what you'd mentioned NOBODY can really know what are the CHANCES. Maybe EXCEPT her, someone she'd confined to regarding this matter...
