Most of us are just undegraduates and average facilities are sufficient.  What you need is the teaching quality and the academic standard of the examinations.  Beijing's exams are very difficult, students going in are of such high calibre that you don't really need to teach them.  Just set them in the right direction and they'll go and do the studying all by themselves, we're talking about near geniuses.  When these students come out, they are very likely to be much better than UCL graduates!  I'd even say many Beijing students are better than my colleagues.  A lot of them come to Imperial &amp; Oxbridge for postgraduate study.  They're highly competent and the most motivated student group I've seen, more intelligent than Singaporeans, and more self-disciplined than others.  I think Beijing can stay where it is, but NUS is no way near that level.</div>

But still it is not recognized at all. and ranking of universities take into account all the factors, including research level i believe.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>True.  Which is why, despite the fact that they've got the most stringent intake in the world, they're still way off from places like Oxbridge, MIT, Harvard which take similiar intake quality.  If they were also strong in things like research, they'd be world no. 1</div>

I think Times would have done better if they had just rank Unis purely by the quality of facilities and nothing else since one of the most important place in any uni, apart from the comfort of the hostel accommodation, must surely be the cafeteria! I mean after all, while at uni, if you dont spend most of your time in the cafeteria, where the heck would you spend it???<br><br>Too bad they dont rate Unis by the number and quality of pubs that are within walking distance of the campus!!

Don't give a hoot about the stupid ranking Shit. thats the problem with ppl, they love to rank everything... just pick a uni u love and go there and enjoy. I had to go to a crap JC because of ranking and I didn't enjoy it there at all. And my uni may not be in the top 100, but my flatmates are ppl who  have 4 straight As and on scholarship n stuff like that. The one next door to me even got a 1550 for SAT 1 and she wasn't even trying. If u're any good, u'd perform, no matter what ranking your uni is. If u're crap, throw u into Oxford and u're up Shit's creek without a paddle.</div>
