              <p>Actually for outgoing foreigners, Singapore is the place to be, because it is far easier to stand out in Singapore than it is back in Aus, US or UK anyway. It is much easier to progress and get credits. I believe this is so throughout ALL levels, because our students here don't ask questions, they are not creative, they are very silent and timid, they don't have zest nor are they outspoken. Thus it is very easy to stand out. Ofcourse, foreign kids are like this as well.</p>
              <p>Now as for quality, Singapore universities are good and comparable because we have good foreign lectures just like other universities have. You get good teachers and teaching methods, but ofcourse it all depends on which teacher and what course. But the fact that Singapore universities do things similar to other top universities speaks something.</p>

              <p>agree. they take our grammar standards for granted at tertiary levels. everytime ask u improve improve improve only. grammar stare at a book ownself whole day long will improve one meh. we need more interactions for this kinda things during GP/english lessons, not just drilling on how to write essays/do compres only. even at secondary levels too. where have all the compulsory grammar/vocab/speech communications/phonetics lessons gone to?</p>

              <p>Haha that's right!</p>
              <p>But i like to think Singaporeans naturally a timid and socialized people. Class rooms i have taught in involve NO QUESTIONS at all. Same thing with politicians, no question are asked of them at all, and their weird answers are still accepted. I think it's just somethin in Singaporeans. It is very easy to be a teacher or an MP here, you can get away with stuff you could never get away with elsewhere (im not talking abt sex scandals)</p>
              <p>Even the professional-types do not speak that well either in communicating their ideas. Simple things like yes can be interpreted as no, or details are left out in a planning process, only to be found out much later on, and this is 2009. Singaporeans have a long way to go.</p>
              <p>There are compulsory participation marks in university, so students try to speak up, but their quality is lacking.</p>

              <p>This is a true story and i see it all the time, and i am doing research on this; we take the same english essays from JC and secondary school, they are graded by local teachers in school and they all get borderline fail grades; we take these essays and send them to the British Council or to Oxford and they get A/B grades.. the same essay. I kid you not.  =) So something is a little bit weird.</p>

              <p>Haha that's right!</p>
              <p>But i like to think Singaporeans naturally a timid and
              socialized people. Class rooms i have taught in involve NO
              QUESTIONS at all. Same thing with politicians, no question are
              asked of them at all, and their weird answers are still accepted. I
              think it's just somethin in Singaporeans. It is very easy to be a
              teacher or an MP here, you can get away with stuff you could never
              get away with elsewhere (im not talking abt sex scandals)</p>

              <p>no wonder, they import foreigners now into singapore, as the PM said we need them. This is unfair, when the edu system made us in such a way, who to blame?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>because even our govt told its citizens to embrace foreigners and help them settle in. Becos there is no racism in sg. Cos australia got racists cos sg is pro foreigners. cos only sg treats foreigners equally with their citizens if not better.</p></div>
