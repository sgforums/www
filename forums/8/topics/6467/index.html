            <div class='col-md body'>Kat, I think it boils down to differences bet a gal &amp; guy character.<br><br>Most gals tends to be more towards being "picky", loving, gentle by nature.  They make very good leaders in an "loving environment" like motherhood, love the nation, charity, etc.  Because of their "picky-ness", they make very poor man-management.<br><br>Guys on the other hand r more "chin chai", broad-minded.  But they lack the loving caring character in them.  They makes better management toward policy, offices staffs management, etc.<br><br>Of course u do hv some gals who can be very strong minded like Margret Thatcher or vis visa.<br><br>Pls don't flame me for being sexist.

            <div class='col-md body'>yups i agree that it is more difficult for women to be leaders coz they are not easily accepted in society. even though they may be of high calibre, they may not be given the opportunity to prove themselves.<br><br>but otherwise, research has shown that women and male leaders do not differ in leadership skills. female leaders tend to be more people-oriented as they have to be accepted by the group first whereas man can be more authoritative as men are generally easier to be regarded as leaders.<br><br>thus females have to work much harder....<br><br>actually in my context of leaders,i meant more on an organisational basis...ie. in the workplace, corporates and business organisations.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>tHe BeSt aNd MosT bEaUtiFuL tHinGs iN tHe wOrLd cAnnOt bE sEEn oR tOuChEd. tHeY mUsT bE fELt wItH tHe hEaRt...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt;&gt;do women make less effective leaders than men?<br><br>First of all, the very fact that you have such a topic already tells you women are not very much accepted as leaders, generally.<br><br>Second, you must define what do you mean by "leaders". Leadership is action or position ?<br>Mother Theresa had action but not really position. Is she considered a leader ? Think about it.<br><br>Most pple still believe women and men have different priorities in their lives. Man for career, woman for family. Do you want to entrust the leadership to a woman who might later say, "sorry, my husband/children need me at home?"<br><br>Another thing is pregnancy. We cannot allow a leader to be absent for months becos she is bearing a baby.<br><br>Religion.<br>In a Muslim country, men do not like to be ruled by a woman. When Sukarno (spelling ?) became vice-president in Indonesia, there was quite a hoo-ha. Was this the reason why she did not become the President ? dunno ... dun want to comment here.<br><br>A female leader who i greatly admire is Aung San Suu Kyi. Noble peace prize winner. General Secretary of National League for Democracy of Myanmar. Released from house arrest in 1990 (?). She is a REAL fighter who believes in liberating her country from tyranny (SLORC) Want to know more about her go read the book "Voices of Hope"<br><br>Another one is Princess Diana. The one who show so much care and concern to the poor and needy. Well, Bill Clinton can pump in so much so much money into charity to help the poor and needy, but will he shake hand with an Aids patient ? Princess Diana DID.<br><br>Some leaders move the economy and millions of dollars. While others move millions of hearts. Woman leaders tend to be the latter. I think we need a balance. We need both kinds of leaders in this world. Just like we need both father and mother to grow healthily.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly, my thinking goes more or less the same with Timothy and AceDream. I do feel that female tends to be a little too sensitive, a little to detailed, and a little too grudge bearing. I must say this is the general stereotype for women. And the general belief is that when you hv an environment full of women, there will always be some ugly(and open) conflicts.<br><br>I'm not sexist btw. I dunno isit just coincidence or what, but I had 6 bosses altogether, 3 males, 3 females. I prefer all 3 males more than all 3 females.<br><br>Of course I've seen females whom I feel will be very good leaders(2 accountants in my ex-company, and my sister!).<br><br>But at the end of the day, I think there are more males than females who can be a better leader, probably becos guys tends to think of themselves as future leaders when young, and starts preparing themselves(mentally and knowledge wise) for the role of leaders. In this case, we're back to what Rinoa said, which is traditional thinking of the society.<br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming? Like asif I care.....<br><br></div>
