              <p>Santa should get off his sleigh and walk, and lay off the brandy and mince 
              pies, says an Australian study published Thursday that criticises Father 
              Christmas for being a bad role model for children.</p>
              <p>The current image of Santa Claus promotes obesity, drink-driving, speeding 
              and an unhealthy lifestyle, says a study from Australia's Monash University 
              published in the British Medical Journal.</p>
              <p>"Epidemiologically there is a correlation between countries that venerate 
              Santa Claus and those that have high levels of childhood obesity," says the 
              research.</p>
              <p>While a clear link has not been established, there "is a possibility that 
              Santa promotes a message that obesity is synonymous with cheerfulness and 
              joviality," it says.</p>
              <p>Santa should go on diet and the tradition of leaving him cookies, mince pies, 
              milk, brandy or sherry should cease, it says. Instead, he could share the 
              carrots and celery sticks often left for his reindeer.</p>
              <p>"Santa might also be encouraged to adopt a more active method to deliver toys 
              -- swapping his reindeer for a bike or simply walking or jogging," the study 
              says.</p>
              <p>It also questions his drinking saying the brandies often left for him would 
              mean that with a few billion houses to visit, he would soon be driving his 
              sleigh over the limit.</p>
              <p>Santa impersonators also have potential to spread infectious diseases: if 
              they sneeze or cough around 10 times a day, all the children who sit on their 
              laps may end up with swine flu, the researchers say.</p>
              <p>And although Santa is banned from smoking in public, images of him enjoying a 
              pipe or cigar can still be found on Christmas cards.</p>
              <p>The study also accuses Santa of promoting speeding, disregard for road rules, 
              and extreme sports such as roof surfing and chimney jumping -- although he is 
              never shown wearing a seatbelt or a helmet.</p>
              <p>Santa is one of the most famous fictional characters in the world and is even 
              more recognised in the United States than Ronald McDonald while also gaining 
              popularity in the developing world, the study says.</p>
              <p>His popularity should be used to promote health living, says the study, 
              offering a new image for Santa in slimmed-down form and on a treadmill.</p>
              <p>"We need to be aware that Santa has an ability to influence people, and 
              especially children, towards unhealthy behaviour," the researchers say.<br><br>Source: AFP<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>http://news.sg.msn.com/top-stories/article.aspx?cp-documentid=3753745<br></strong></span></p>

              <p>It is logically not possible for santa to visit billion of house in 1 night, and they are worried about speeding, wearing speedbelts and drink driving?</p>
              <p>If santa can eat all those goodies left for him and drink all that, he must be the biggest eater in the world and also not being even rounder is already a miracle. Not to mention that if a normal person put that much food into him at one go, he would have died. And they are shouting about what he eats?</p>
