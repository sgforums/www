            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Yamash!ta's gold, also referred to as the Yamash!ta treasure, is the name given to an urban legend of alleged loot stolen in Southeast Asia by Japanese forces during World War II and hidden in caves, tunnels and underground complexes in the Philippines. The number, size and value of the loot troves in the Philippines are unknown.<br><br>The "gold" reportedly included many different kinds of valuables looted from banks, depositories, temples, churches, other commercial premises, mosques, museums and private homes. It takes its name from General Tomoyuki Yamash!ta, who assumed command of Japanese forces in the Philippines in 1944.<br><br>According to various accounts, the loot was initially concentrated in Singapore, from where it was later relayed to the Philippines.[2] The Japanese hoped to ship the treasure from the Philippines to the Japanese home islands after the war ended. As the Pacific War progressed, Allied submarines and aircraft inflicted increasingly heavy losses on Japanese merchant shipping. Some ships carrying loot back to Japan were sunk.<br><br>Some historians have argued that looting was organized on a massive scale, by both yakuza gangsters such as Yoshio Kodama, and the highest levels of Japanese society, including Emperor Hirohito.[3] The Japanese government intended that loot from Southeast Asia would finance Japan's war effort. It is alleged that Hirohito appointed his brother, Prince Chichibu, to head a secret organization called Kin no yuri ( "Golden Lily" ), for this purpose.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamashita%27s_gold" rel="nofollow">source</a></blockquote>the japanese themselves shld sit in a room with four walls and ponder.. how many countless innocent lives have they brutally killed, how many women have they raped and /or killed <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> ,and the intensive damages they cause to other countries during the war <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_war_crimes" rel="nofollow">japanese war crimes</a> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
