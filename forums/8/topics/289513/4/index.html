A population who feels that its emperor is godlike and ferocious in its nature. Facing a cornered enemy is tricky as that's when they will definitely fight till the last man standing.<br><br>So instead, the first A-bomb was dropped. And since they didn't bulge, a second one as well. And perhaps, it would have continued till no japanese soil was left untouched. But thankfully it didn't come to that.<br><br>There was speculation that perhaps the A-bomb was not meant for japan but  germany. Just that the war it europe ended sooner than expected. Perhaps that was the start of america flexing its mighty muscles.<br><br>What do you mean the cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima couldn't recover from the impact? The cities now are  bustling japanese cities. No different from any japanese city in japan... except for the fact that, they have left certain part as memorial. While each year the cities have remembrance to those who died from bombs, I hope it is a remembrance of those who have died needlessly from the war on both sides. NOT from the fact they were the innocent ones being the victims of the A-bomb.<br><br>It is a sad thing the two cities are the victims of nuclear explosion, and it has to bear that scar.

At most we only hear of stories from parents or grandparents. Indeed the generation who went thru the japanese occupation do not exhibit hatredness , but forgiveness and bitterness... we'll never know. Most of it are brought to the grave. Also can't be helped if the bitterness is passed down the generation  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>So my two cents on dropping the a-bomb... yes, it was justified!

            <div class='col-md body'>In all, i think that it is very much justified. But also a little ironic in some sense. The US wants to minimize loss of lives yet still land it right smack on a city. They really should have landed it on a remote land first. If Japan still dont surrender, then land it in the cities for mass destruction.</div>
