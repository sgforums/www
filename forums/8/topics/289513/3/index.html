He did not apologised, arguing... that the bombing millions of American and Japanese lives by ending the war...</strong><br><br>why should Mr Tibbets apologise? if  the Japanese never had the huge ambition to 'swallow' america that led to the bombing of pearl habour, would the america do this to them? the rest of the world would have become Japan now!<br><br><strong>... "but i wanted him to visit Hiroshima and take a direct look at what he did as a human being" said Mr Tohei, who co-chairs the Japan Confederation of A- and H- Bomb Sufferers Organisations, who now lives in Tokyo.</strong><br><br>Is he sure only the Japanese suffers from the war? who started the war in the first place? why doesnt he visit the countries his beloved country has done damage??<br><br>they wanted others to realise their mistakes and impact done to Japan. But they themselves failed to see their own actions. So ironic!<br><br>its not that i hate Japan or what. but it is a fact they never fail to admit the war is never their fault.[/b]</blockquote>"Swallow" America? I believe this ex-pilot got it all wrong. The Japanese bomb pearl harbour to cripple America's naval fleet there so as to prevent the Americans from disrupting their plan of conquering Asia.<br><br>The Western pie was meant for its allies, the Nazi and Facist Italy.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In every war, there will be victims of casualty, innocent civilians or military. And for every war, an earlier end is better than a distant one. All he did was what needed to be done: a very very drastic action to end a very very bloody war. What is more appalling was a second bomb had to be dropped cos the first one didn't make them surrender...If the Japanese surrendered earlier, the second bomb wouldn't have hit Nagasaki, maybe that Japanese woman should consider that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Note the age of the pilot when he passed on. 92 ?! Do you think anyone can live in regret for 60 years ? Even if he wanted to his brain would have wanted him to hang himself rite? Anyway, we cant say what he did was entirely wrong. Even if he didnt do it, dont u think the US would have gotten some other guy to bomb them. I think he should be praised instead, for being mentally strong to live some 60 years without feeling anyform of repentence.

After the war, they try so hard in many ways to win the world over. This way, they need not use force to conquer the world.</div>
