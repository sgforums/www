            <div class='col-md body'>I don't blame him. He was under orders to drop the bomb; either that it'd just be another pilot who'd have to do it. Plus, it's not as if it was some mindless bombing; it definately did save Allied and Japanese lives, should they have raided the main island. If there's anyone that should feel guilty, it should the President and/or the military generals for not carefully thinking through the possibilities.<br><br>However, one has to remember that it was the Japanese who had the ambition of conquering a large part of Asia, and it was them who raged war against America in the first place. The USA had also given ample opportunities for Japan to surrender. Why not blame the Japanese leaders at that time for inflicting so much pain on their citizens with their stupid decisions?</div>
