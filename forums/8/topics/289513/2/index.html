            <div class='col-md body'>The Potsdam ultimatum<br><br>On July 26, Truman and other allied leaders issued The Potsdam Declaration outlining terms of surrender for Japan.<br><br>The atomic bomb was not mentioned in the declaration.<br><br>On July 28, Japanese papers reported that the declaration had been rejected by the Japanese government. That afternoon, Prime Minister Kantaro Suzuki declared at a press conference that the Potsdam Declaration was no more than a rehash (yakinaoshi) of the Cairo Declaration and that the government intended to ignore it (mokusatsu).<br><br>The statement was taken by both Japanese and foreign papers as a clear rejection of the declaration.<br><br>Emperor Hirohito, who was waiting for a Soviet reply to noncommittal Japanese peace feelers, made no move to change the government position.<br><br>On July 31, he made clear to Kido that the Imperial Regalia of Japan had to be defended at all costs.<br><br>In early July, on his way to Potsdam, Truman had re-examined the decision to use the bomb. In the end, Truman made the decision to drop the atomic bombs on Japan.<br><br>His stated intention in ordering the bombings was to bring about a quick resolution of the war by inflicting destruction, and instilling fear of further destruction, that was sufficient to cause Japan to surrender.<br><br><span class="small">source <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki</a></span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Cannibalism<br><br>Many written reports and testimonies collected by the Australian War Crimes Section of the Tokyo tribunal, and investigated by prosecutor William Webb (the future Judge-in-Chief), indicate that Japanese personnel in many parts of Asia and the Pacific committed acts of cannibalism against Allied prisoners of war.<br><br>In many cases this was inspired by ever-increasing Allied attacks on Japanese supply lines, and the death and illness of Japanese personnel as a result of hunger. However, according to historian Yuki Tanaka: "cannibalism was often a systematic activity conducted by whole squads and under the command of officers".<br><br>This frequently involved murder for the purpose of securing bodies.<br><br>For example, an Indian POW, Havildar Changdi Ram, testified that: "[on November 12, 1944] the Kempeitai beheaded [an Allied] pilot. I saw this from behind a tree and watched some of the Japanese cut flesh from his arms, legs, hips, buttocks and carry it off to their quarters... They cut it small pieces and fried it."<br><br>November 9, 1945. Jemadar (junior commissioned officer) Chint Singh of the Indian Army at an identification parade in New Guinea, indicating a Japanese soldier whom he claimed mistreated him while he was a prisoner of war.<br><br>Japanese forces used many Indian Army personnel captured in Malaya and Singapore as forced labour in the South West Pacific.In some cases, flesh was cut from living people<br><br>another Indian POW, Lance Naik Hatam Ali (later a citizen of Pakistan), testified that in New Guinea:<br><br>the Japanese started selecting prisoners and everyday one prisoner was taken out and killed and eaten by the soldiers. I personally saw this happen and about 100 prisoners were eaten at this place by the Japanese. The remainder of us were taken to another spot 50 miles [80 km] away where 10 prisoners died of sickness. At this place, the Japanese again started selecting prisoners to eat. Those selected were taken to a hut where their flesh was cut from their bodies while they were alive and they were thrown into a ditch where they later died.<br><br>Perhaps the most senior officer convicted of cannibalism was Lt Gen. Yoshio Tachibana, who with 11 other Japanese personnel was tried in relation to the execution of U.S. Navy airmen, and the cannibalism of at least one of them, in August 1944, on Chichi Jima, in the Bonin Islands. They were beheaded on Tachibana's orders. As military and international law did not specifically deal with cannibalism, they were tried for murder and "prevention of honorable burial". Tachibana was sentenced to death.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_war_crimes" rel="nofollow">source</a></blockquote></div>
