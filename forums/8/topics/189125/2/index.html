            <div class='col-md body'>okay when i say ministers salaries should be adjusted all hoorays......but will it solve the problems (or so-called problems)  psychologically u guys having? so what if they really freeze it if a lot of oppo wins...will the oppos stay in parliament and do full time....the rich gets richer while the poor stays...ministries should run a balance between every aspects and it is sad to see and hear no oppo or rulin pary sayin it and broadcasting it out loud over TV. with globalization, there comes an income gap..as long as it do not go to the extend of compromising the basic needs e.g meals and daily neccesities, education etc that every sgrean deserves. there are ppl who can still hang on and balance tthey monthly accounts with minor surpluses...these ppl should be contented and work harder to make more wealth for themselves (dun complain),there are those very rich, borned rich etc and richer than the ministers themselves....these we have to tax them and they better stop complaining (i am with Robin on this). our main concern are those lower income group and their offsprings..and how we can bring them up thru encouragements but not sending the signs of a welfare society here in Sg.<br><br>also be careful who u vote into the parliament</div>
