The bubble syndrome is always a great threat!

Some friends give us some money to help us out.<br><br>Our three children have just left school to work, and yet we are better off than most people in Singapore. Still I wonder how are our fellow Singaporeans coping with garmen inflated GST in almost everything, bus fares increases, news papers are now 80 cents, and all those unseen costs included in the petrol rises worked out in term of transport costs. Inflationary factors etc had slowly also make our savings in the CPF look like pennies.. Our neighbors and friends I understand are all loaded with car loans, HDB long-term payments for flats or upgrading, or even bank renovation loans, plus numerous credits form of burdens. Whose is at fault: the wise saying of Solomon is this: [b]We become servants or slaves to the ones we borrowed money from!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> </strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Would a PAP garmen could have done better especially they are only concern that the consumers must spend, spend and spend to kick the economy going on in strength!</span><br><br>And even when we are hard up for cash, they say, never mind we will give you the credit!<br><br>Would any opposition be a better one to help the people realize that we are living in hard times, and we all had to tighten our belts, and cut down on CPF as eventually it will be depleted by triple keys or no keys. Far more important is to make our cost of living, and especially our housing for our children cheaper! If the land is a People donated to Govt and hardly cost the garmen much  should a normal HDB flat be priced so high, could not the garmen capped it at say the prevailing affordable prices? The voice in the Parliament is pretty silent as there is no opposition to think or to talk. Those two in Parliament could hardly stand on their own feet and talk to a laughing group of men and women who care not for the people. We need more representations in Parliament to enact no more dirty money laws to put Singaporeans to suffer and enslaved further, however it's the people's Voice to  try to undo some of the big spending of the garmen, and made the garmen realize that <strong>social welfare </strong> is a responsibility when the public coffer and their pockets are so full and overflowing with wealth which they had used to throw away by giving to others - but hardly any for Singaporeans' needs , except election goodies and something to boast their ratings!<br><br>I Vote for opposition because I have a choice to vote,<br>I had been denied this by garmen so many walkovers!<br>And I had never vote yet, and I am about to die soon,<br>I am a sixty years old Singaporean.<br>ItÂ’s a Vote for my children and their future and for all Singaporeans!<br><br>Singaporeans like me are not STUPID!<br><br>THIS IS NOT A SPEECH BUT ASKING YOU TO RESPONSE TO WHOM U WILL VOTE AND WHY?<br><br>goto see my trip to water fall<br><a href="http://www.sgwiki.com/wiki/Main.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgwiki.com/wiki/Main.htm</a>[/b]</blockquote>hMz...the way you expressed yourself in words (Impressive English language)amazed me that you've not savored a plate of char keu Teow for a whole year....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay i have also followed a little on WP's Manifesto for this Election and regarding some concerns on GST for daily neccessities, medical fees and public transport i am with the WP.<br><br>The vote is yours and please cast it wisely. This comment is not made to support the Ruling party and not any Opposition Parties.<br><br>Here is Sg (and maybe elsewhere in the world) the rich gets richer while the poor gets poorer. There is a thin fine and fragile line between rich and poor. Some shows it all and one look you can tell. Some are very rich indeed making money and not declaring it to the IRAS. Thus they make use of this to escape tax (in any form) and demand more welfare from the Government. We will not want Sg to be a welfare society since welfare itself will send a negative signal and not all are strong enough to stand on their own after a little help out of the frying pan. There may be a considerable fraction of the population who will leech on such a previlege.<br><br>As for other things that can be avoided and do without, and somehow you get your pathetic as s into it i am sorry i will not want to comment on them. Debts that can be avoided (e.g instalments for luxury cars and silly investments that promises lucrative returns with a mix of risks involved) shall not be entertained.</div>
