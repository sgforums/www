              <p>relative make request, up to you to accept or not and decide if u want to charge interest or not also. Then, up to relative to accept your conditions if there are any.</p>
              <p>The things about relationship can be a hard one. Technically speaking, you can 'name your price' and if they don't accept, they shouldn't blame you, because they are asking for your help. Everyone has their own things to think of.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, if you value your earnings more than a relative's life, then you might want to confirm if you feel right about those priorities. Again, your decision.</p>
              <p>Maybe if u don't want to give too much and hence have to worry about interest...maybe can help by lending a smaller sum?</p>

              <p>Seriously speaking, I really dont like to lend money to people.</p>
              <p>Why?</p>
              <p>Lend money is easy, you ask money to return back is difficult. You get what I mean?</p>
              <p>Esxpecially relatives, if you want to lend them money, tell them I will charge for a interest cos if I dont lend you, I usually park my money in FD.</p>
              <p>How much you going to lend to your relativers? $50,000?</p>

              <p>i would suggest you can ask them to take loan from BANK or Old Money Lender in market.</p>
              <p>Hmm... i think they call Quick Credit. Im not here to advertise, i just heard from my friend that this credit company not bad.</p>
              <p>here's the link: <a title="Licensed Money Lender Since 2002" href="http://www.quickcredit.com.sg/">http://www.quickcredit.com.sg/</a> </p>
              <p>sometimes it is better that, you advise them to take loan from Bank or Money Lender. Because protect you and your relative to avoid any misunderstanding</p>
