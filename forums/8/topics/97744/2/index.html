            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I think it's the current situation of the society. Back then, children do not need to study, just help their parents out, but, now it's more of a "you die, I live" situation. And I think it's this that the students fear getting a B because they might lose out. Not to mention the worry of not getting a job in the future as always warned by our parents. So, well, the stress is there.</div>

SO Pls send your children to places such as childcare where the children are given opportunities to learn via hands-on experiences that can be seen as PLAY. COncepts as mentioned aboved will be learnt through them and really, the first 5 years are very important for future. What you are today is what you learnt in those first years. ANd, PLS don't send your child that is younger than 2 years of age to a infant care. SG infant care centres are just money making organisations that are not good and cannot provide quality care.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Hee... oops! talked too much!</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>About the reducing curriculum thing... actually is just a smokescreen one. The government reduce the cirriculum, the teachers will ask you to find those things online. You say give the students lesser homework but actually they are increasing the workload, just that outsiders cannot see.<br><br>Spoonfeeding no good, I know, but on top of homework, school hours from 7+ until 2+. Reach home, eat, almost 3 or for those who live quite a distance away from school, 3+ then reach home. Then still ask students to go online slowly source out the information but most of us don't do, heck them. I play on the computer can take less time than I spent sourcing information.<br><br>When we reach home, we just want to rest. Neighbourhood schools or not, the school is still competing for the ranking. Now system change not only focus on academic but also others, meaning nowadays students must become superman, everything also can.</div>
