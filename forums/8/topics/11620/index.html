BUT, not to the extent of KILLING/BEATING that person that is of a different color skin.<br>In other countries, such as certain parts of America, Indonesia, England and lots more, there were uncountable cases of Asians or Blacks being killed, just because they were of a different skin color.<br>Now think about that, and then try to realise/understand how safe Singapore is, compared to the rest of the world.<br>You can't have everything, but when you got one of the best, there's no reason to complain.<br><br>------------------<br>What is in a name?
