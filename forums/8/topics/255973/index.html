Our fundraising project is held from 26th May to 19th August, over several sessions on all weekends (Every Friday from 2pm-6pm, every Saturday from 10pm-2pm and from 2pm-6pm and every Sunday also from 10pm-2pm and from 2pm-6pm).<br><br>This project aims to raise $160,000 for the School Pocket Money Fund, which supports approximately 10,000 underprivileged primary and secondary schoolchildren every year. To do this, we are <strong>looking for volunteers </strong>to assist us with the street sales of items including teddy bears and beautiful custom-designed Post-It NotesÂ®. As such, we would greatly appreciate it if your <strong>students</strong> from your school could join us in volunteering for this cause. We are seeking 80 to 150, or any other number of students from any level, CCA or class to join us in volunteering for the School Pocket Money Fund. Upon completion of this activity, the School Pocket Money Fund will issue a letter of appreciation acknowledging the support from your schoolÂ’s students.<br><br>Inspire Â’07 would allow the students:<br>1.	A unforgettable experience and an invaluable opportunity to step beyond their comfort zones when they engage in street sales<br>2.	To develop empathy and concern for the less privileged members of our society<br>3.	To experience the spirit of volunteerism.<br><br>We invite you to discuss your school's possible participation with us by contacting Ms Tan Khee Yunn Nicolette (91380682/nicolettetan93@hotmail.com) anytime. Attached is a list of dates and times of our street sales sessions. We welcome volunteers to join us as a level, as a CCA, or even as a class. We are most willing to customise the locations, dates and duration of the sessions for the students from your school.<br><br>Our programme is also designed to support your studentÂ’s application for the National Youth Achievement Award. Additionally, to facilitate data entry of CIP information into the School Cockpit, Inspire Â’07 will immediately issue Certificates of Participation at the point of completion of the street sales session to the student stating the hours of service completed, and any other details you may require.<br><br>We look forward to working with you and we greatly appreciate all the help rendered by your school. For any additional information regarding this project, do call us at the number above. Alternately, you may email us at outreach@inspire.sg or access our website at http://inspire.sg/ for further information.<br><br>Thank you very much!<br><br>Yours sincerely,<br><br>Tan Khee Yunn Nicolette<br>Inspire Â’07 Committee<br><br></div>
