            <div class='col-md body'>I am quite open about homosexuality and I bears no discrimination about homosexual but I am afraid and worried about the behaviour and actions of some of them... Stalking people is a scary thing...<br>Even if a guy who is straight and stalk at a girl, wont the girl feels dangers and being violated?<br>It's the same cases, i can accept people being homosexual but they did better not try any cheeky actions on others to disturb them or what. Cuz being whether straight or homosexual, they have the same legal rights and the same sentence when they commit crimes, so being a homosexual doesn't gain the right of stalking people.</div>
