            <div class='col-md body'>It seems to me that we are talking about two different things with regards to this issue.

Instead of beating the shit out of somebody (albeit with fancy kung fu moves), perhaps we can try being firm and warning them instead.  It was suggested that the police be called if the person still persists - I think this is a good idea.  Most stalkers know what they are doing is wrong and do not want any trouble with the police - most of them should back off if threatened in this way.

When I was in the UK studying at Lancaster Uni, the Gay &amp; Lesbian Society there had a poster campaign to increase awareness of Gay Rights.  I liked one of the posters very much.  It read, "If you really have to be hetrosexual, please be discreet."  It makes the same point that you are making in your post - that what is normal is a matter of perspective.  I think that it is both unfair and pompous of hetrosexuals to assume that only their experiences are valid.  It pays no reverence to the humanity of people who see the world through a different set of lenses.  All such attitudes only prove is how bigoted and narrow-minded these people are!<br><br>I second your call to avoid going down to Changi Village to view the "Ah Gua" there.  It is dehumanising and cruel for people to do this.  It reminds me of a true story that was made into a movie some time back about a man who had a terrible physical deformity - the movie was called 'The Elephant Man'.  In the story, this man was shunned, laughed at and paraded in a Freak Show without any reference to how hurt he felt at being rediculed for something he had no control over.  I remember how horrified I was at how people were able to treat him so badly, until I recognised that I too had been doing much the same by being prejudiced against others who are different from me.  The joke is actually on the people who laugh at others for being different, because they actually show how weak and shallow they are.  Instead of pitying the "Ah Gua", let us give them due recognition for being courageous and bold enough to stand up to proclaim who they really are.  We don't have to be like them to celebrate their humanity!<br><br></div>

I doubt many would.  It is an affront to our humanity to have people laugh AT us, rather than WITH us.  I think it is sad to know that this group of people need to do such things to get the attention they crave (which so many of us take for granted).  I think it is not safe for us to assume that the cross-dressers enjoy what they do, even if it may seem that way - we all know that people often put on masks to hide their true feelings.  So let's not ASSUME and make an ASS out of U and ME by laughing at them and thinking that they laugh with us!<br><br>It seems that nismoS132 is a little overwhelmed by the thought of these cross-dressers that he seems to have got his knickers tied up in a knot.  It looks like he is pleading for the dignity of these cross-dressers, by quoting his friends as saying, "don't think of them as guys, think of them as gers. it's not going down to circus to see the freakshow" but then completely contradicts himself by saying that going to view them is like "going to geyland (<span style="font-style: italic;">Freudian slip?</span>) to look at hookers by the sidewalk".  (Gawking at hookers is not my idea of dignifying anybody or of having a good time.)  He then goes on to completely write them off by saying, "that doesn't mean i detest them anyless though, can't stand the sight of them, no dignity at all."  'Tis a confused world we live in, isn't it nismoS132?<br><br></div>
