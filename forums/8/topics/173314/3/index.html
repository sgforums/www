            <div class='col-md body'>The difference will be the money used. CHC used the money for church operations, some are given to support their churches in JB and other places. Part of the money goes to Mission works/charity works as well. Ren Ci used the money on patients and hospital operations. Ren Ci needs the money more then CHC cos they are helping the poor and helpless. Giving money to CHC is like 'helping them to build their kingdom' which most of the money goes to build the church.
