How u noe not true?<br><br>Besides, then how u explain the whereabouts of jesus from childhood till he enter jerusalem?</div></blockquote>How I know it's not true ah.... See the logic that I pointed out lor.<br>If they are not doing it for fame, then they do it for what?<br><br>See my earlier reply on Jesus' childhood.  The Church does have records here and there about that.<br><br>To further dispel the saying about Jesus "travel around the world" before he entered Jerusalem....<br><br>1) if he travelled when he was a kid or teenager.... Travelling is risky, whether it's during Roman time or today.  Will His parents want to risk their child's life like this?  This was not a game.  The only time they made him travel was to run away from King Herod.<br><br>2) if he travelled at a much older age.. let's say... 20 plus.  Joseph was a carpenter and later Jesus became a carpenter, should around that age (plus or minus).<br><br>So at what age should the travelling been taken place?  Note: Travelling took a long time at that time cuz of the mode of transport they used, regardless of whether the road was well connected or not.  Somemore now those soon-to-be-famous historians are saying that he went to England and lived there.  That was almost reaching the Northern part of European.<br><br>3) If he had travelled to England, that should be something significant or worth talking about.  But why didn't he mention it to anybody?  Or why didn't anybody add this part into the Gospel or any other books?  Don't tell me this is supposed to be kept secret?<br><br>The reason why his childhood was hardly or even never mentioned in most of the teachings is because that was very insignificant to His purpose of coming to the world and to His teachings.</div>
