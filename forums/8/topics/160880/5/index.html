The Church does have records here and there about that.<br><br>To further dispel the saying about Jesus "travel around the world" before he entered Jerusalem....<br><br>1) if he travelled when he was a kid or teenager.... Travelling is risky, whether it's during Roman time or today.  Will His parents want to risk their child's life like this?  This was not a game.  The only time they made him travel was to run away from King Herod.<br><br>2) if he travelled at a much older age.. let's say... 20 plus.  Joseph was a carpenter and later Jesus became a carpenter, should around that age (plus or minus).<br><br>So at what age should the travelling been taken place?  Note: Travelling took a long time at that time cuz of the mode of transport they used, regardless of whether the road was well connected or not.  Somemore now those soon-to-be-famous historians are saying that he went to England and lived there.  That was almost reaching the Northern part of European.<br><br>3) If he had travelled to England, that should be something significant or worth talking about.  But why didn't he mention it to anybody?  Or why didn't anybody add this part into the Gospel or any other books?  Don't tell me this is supposed to be kept secret?<br><br>The reason why his childhood was hardly or even never mentioned in most of the teachings is because that was very insignificant to His purpose of coming to the world and to His teachings.  </div></blockquote>This is wholly based, esp ur 3rd para, on the assumptions the bible is totally true, and written by honest men, in a way it can negate the 'unimportant' part of his teenage years, and concentrate wholly on his teachings,<br><br>Secondly, why, and prove travelling around the Roman empire is dangerous, especially when some reports mentioned he was accompanied by his uncle?
