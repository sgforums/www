              <p><br>True. It's always better to keep your nose clean.</p>
              <p>Still, you also have to count on due process *just in case* the system makes a mistake and hauls you in wrongly. Not saying miscarriages of justice are frequent. Sg has one of the best legal systems in the region. But even Sg isn't perfect and mistakes do happen once in a long, long while. =( </p>

              <p>For your kind information, based on REAL statistics, locals commit way more robberies and rapes than "bangalas" even if you generalise the proportion to equate the population differences.</p>
