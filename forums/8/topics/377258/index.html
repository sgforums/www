            <div class='col-md body'><p>I dun see how she could be reinstated. Rules are rules. But actually reinstating her is now the secondary issue. What shocks me is the number of people who actually step on others when they are down. How singaporeans (maybe not just snigaporeans in this case) love throwing in sarcasms, insults, mockery when people are down. Makes me wonder how these people would love to be treated one day when their deeds are exposed. I seriously think her accent is way funny and is embarassing but surely there is no need to attack a young person so viciously for a wrongdoing.</p></div>

              <p>I didn't even think her accent is funny....</p>
              <p>Believe it or not, I would place her English proficiency in the upper tier of Singapore's population....lots of people speak worse than her....</p>
              <p>Committing CC fraud is also a mistake, and a serious one, but come on, she was given a probation, in accordance with a law reform. The society is trying to be more forgiving and caring and gracious, so the family law court is the one handing her case, and she was given a probation so that she can reform, she is still young.</p>
              <p>Family Court......Yellow Ribbon....all these are efforts to make society more gracious, egalitarian.....inclusive....dont people always say Singapore is too stressful, superficial, materialistic, I guess now we have a choice, but the choice is the absolute wrong one, she got ridiculed, attacked, finally "forced" to "resign" (I am sure she is forced).</p>
              <p>So by doing this, instead of sending a message that Ms World Singapore is a normal human being with flaws and weaknesses just like the rest of humanity, who strive to improve herself and overcome difficulties, instead of sending a message of hope, of inspiration, of forgiveness, inclusiveness, graciousness, egalitarianism, instead of opting on an inspirational theme, some forces have opt for the superficial theme.They totally chucked her and threw her under the bus.</p>
              <p>Ris Low will always be the legitimate Ms World Singapore 2009 in my heart.</p>

              <p>In what way was it unfair and unjust?</p>
              <p>It was simply going by the books, and the boundaries set by the rules have been made clear. Her "resignation" was pretty much expected, when she overstepped those boundaries. Her performance in that video was another matter altogether, though it can be said that it is an aggravating factor.</p>
              <p>The end result of her "resignation" was OK, but the way that it was carried out was utter rubbish. I agree that all the sensationalization and personal attacks aimed at belittling her was below the belt.</p>
              <p>Being gracious means being forgiving..yes..but reinstating her seems to be quite a far shot, don't you think?</p>
              <p>Allow me to give this example:</p>
              <p>A criminal(any type of crime)has a record due to his offence, which he needs to declare to his superior at some point in time. Being forgiving as a society means embracing him as one of your kind, and accepting him as an imperfect but unique individual. It does not mean erasing the records to give him a "second chance".</p>
              <p>I strongly believe that a person who commits a crime deserves the punishment, be it caning or imprisonment. What he/she does not deserve is the "life imprisonment" given by members of the public.</p>
