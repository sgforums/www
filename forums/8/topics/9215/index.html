I was once deeply in love w tis guy n we broke off cos of a misunderstanding. He was my first loVe n i muz admit he left me w scars.Maybe its becos of e fact that i took nearly 6 yrs to forget him.. n that feeling was terrible. I wonder if anyone feel this way be4. Its like you can kiss one other person but u know at e back of ur brain its him tat you r thinking.<br>Now i have this feeling that i would suffer e same fate if i throw all my emotions, dreams n hopes on him. We tok abt it and i know how much discomfort this have caused him. I chose to be open if not blunt cos i need him to understand my fears. Now i have done my part and hopefully my bf understands my fear.<br>Should i end it becos i threw an assumption tat history may repeat? Or should i take e risk and carry on loving him despite knowing tat we may spilt up? We can neva know e future until we reach future. I really dun know wat to do. if i love him n he hurts me, im going to suffer like be4 and e thought of going thru all tat is unbearable.

            <div class='col-md body'>sacredplace,<br><br>You will have to make the decision. Whatever advise you get to go each way, it will not take away the hurt that will be present IF it goes wrong.<br><br>Like people say, don't fix it if it ain't broke. The reasons for leaving someone should be because the relationship is beyond salvation, and I have no idea what that looks like. Anything else might be remedied. If there are fears, work them out together. Don't let them be self fulfilling prophecies by chickening out.<br><br>Why try? Because both of you deserve that chance lah. Otherwise you will always be running.<br><br>I sure hope your bf is coping well to hear what you had to say.<br><br>All the best.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is a risk to every you do in life.  It's whether or not you think it's worth the risk.  Maybe the reward will be much greater than the risk itself.  Maybe staying with him in the relationship can give you many more happiness and you will be able to forget the pain.  If you don't risk you will never know the outcome and the worst part of it all, you might just regret it one day.<br><br>Being in love can do wonders to people, it can bring you to the stars and back to the pit in a mere sentense your partner may say, but you will never reach the stars if you don't risk.<br><br>Never devote yourself to the other person totally at first.  Hold your emotional until you know for sure you can trust him to take care of your fragile heart.  You did the right then to tell him what's on your mind.  Think about it, is this guy worth it? Are you not going giving him a chance if you stay in this relationship, you are also giving yourself a chance.  A chance for happiness, a chance to be love, a chance to love.<br><br>Think wisely.<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...Sting like a bee...</div>
