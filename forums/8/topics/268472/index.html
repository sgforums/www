            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Last year in the period of around September, my mom suffered a minor stroke and we admitted her to a certain hospital which I would not want to name.She recovered well and in 3 weeks, she was back to normal.<br><br>At the end of her hospital stay, the doctor, his name too I will not reveal, gave her a certain medicine which we didn't know my mom is allergic too.This caused her severe rashes and the doctor stopped it immediately.<br><br>2 weeks later, my mom had to go for a check up and collect her medicine.Once again, the doctor gave my mom the same medicine.My mom did not know it's the same medicine as she doesn't know how to check and differentiate(she's not a doctor).We asked the doctor is this medicine okay, he said yes.<br><br>Needless to say, my mom suffered severe rashes and her face bloated up.She ended up in an isolation ward.This mistake caused by the doctor had led to my mom to suffer from from a new illness.She has suffered alot and had to bear alot of hospital bills(around 7k).Luckily, my mom is working in the govt. sector, and she happens to be a 1WO, so the subsidy has helped financially.<br><br>However, we still find that the hospital has not given us a proper answer and no form of mediation has been done.This is clearly the doctor's error and my mom has to suffer for it.<br><br>We would like to file for a lawsuit soon, but due to a lack of experience, I would like to know what should we do first.We have all the medical records, photos of the my mom's face, hands before and after the medicine.We even have the letter which the doctor had prescribed the medicine after knowing my mom is allergic to it.<br><br>All help is appreciated, my mom is the sole bread winner of the family now as my father had passed away in 2005.I have a younger brother in secondary school too.<br><br>Thanks in advance.<br><br>Regards,<br>Ash</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You definitely need legal counsel. I think you have a strong case, base on the facts you have provided. If you cannot afford to engage legal counsel, you can go here:<br><br><a href="http://app.minlaw.gov.sg/lab/default.asp" rel="nofollow">http://app.minlaw.gov.sg/lab/default.asp</a><br><br><span style="color: green;"><span style="font-style: italic;">WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR LEGAL AID?<br><br>Who is eligible for legal aid?<br><br>The services of the Legal Aid Bureau are for poor Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents who are in Singapore and come within the ambit of the scheme and meet the requirements of financial Means Test.<br><br>Briefly, to qualify for legal aid,<br><br>(a) you have to be a Singapore Citizen or a Singapore Permanent Resident and is present in Singapore;<br><br>(b) you have to satisfy the Â”Means TestÂ”. Your disposable income, that is, your income for the past 12 months before the date of application for legal aid and after deducting prescribed allowances, must not exceed $10,000/-, and your disposable capital must not exceed $10,000/-; and<br><br>(c) there must be merits in your case. (The Â”Merits TestÂ” )<br><br>If you do not satisfy the Means Test but are facing hardship, the Director of Legal Aid may extend legal aid to you (subject to the requirements of the Merits Test) if:<br>1. You satisfy certain statutory provisions; and<br>2. It appears to him in his absolute discretion to be reasonable to do so to relieve hardship.</span></span><br>If you intend to hire a lawyer to file a lawsuit, you have to be aware of how it charges. It can be as of follows:<br><br>1)Hourly based. This option is usally the costliest of all. The more complicated your case, the more billable hours are needed for preparation and gathering of documents.<br><br>2)Contingency fee. This means if you lose, you don't have to pay. But take in mind that any expenses that may(almost certainly will) incur during the legal process, like experts view, document fees, court fees, etc, are all chargeble. However, if you win, your lawyer will usually take a cut from the damages awarded to you, the plaintiff. If you're lucky or your lawyer is good, she can even demand that the defendant pay your part or all of your court fees. As this option usually means you have to pay your lawyers a larger amount if you win, u should only consider this option if the lawyer is taking a bigger risk than you.<br><br>3)Fixed fee. Win or lose, you pay the stipulated amount as agreed earlier. After deciding on retaining the lawyer, she may request that you pay a deposit, or also called a retaining fee. After the case, you need only to pay the balance.<br><br>In your case, I think your lawyer will sue the doctor for malpractice. The damages that might be awarded, if you win, depends on the loss of future earnings of your mother, hospital fees incurred as a result of the doctor's negligence, and many other factors your lawyers can possibly creatively come up with.<br><br>It is most important that you can find a lawyer who is good and willing to help you all the way. There are lawyers out there who just want your money but don't give a shi<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>t about whether you win or lose.<br><br>Do not take my words for gospel, I am in no position. Just helping out as much as I can. Remember, what you pay is what you get.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Speaking from experience, the toughest challenge will be to get a doctor who will testify that the other guy screwed up.  A few years ago, my old man was given very poor treatment by the resident doctor at a nursing home, as a result of which he ended up with a huge bedsore 30cm across and 2cm deep - they ended up taking out a huge chunk of flesh.<br><br>Despite my brother-in-law being a judge, there was little we could do about it.  We tried getting a doctor to testify that the other doctor's actions consituted neglect but found that when it comes to lawsuits, the medical fraternity was a very closed shop.  I can't say I blame the doctors for being hesitant to testify - it's a very small world in the medical community, and testifying could be seen as betraying the profession.<br><br>Anyway, just be aware that you might have to look around to find a doctor willing to provide evidence or testimony on your behalf.  All the best! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly, it's not worth suing... you will probably waste more money than needed, and getting someone else to prove the negligence part... is not easy.<br><br>I've tried that before... don't wish to try again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm mixed reviews, but I'll check with SMC first.We have not spoken to the hospital about this yet, maybe see is it possible to settle for an outside of court settlement.The chief doctor had spoken to my mom, and tried to reason out, but we will speak to the people at SMC and see how we'll carry on.<br><br>The doctor is a young one, probably late 20s.Even though he's young, it doesn't gives him the right to ill treat his patients.My mom has spoken to a director at Mindef, he has such experience.He said to try to settle with hospital out of court but if it doesn't works then a lawsuit seems unavoidable.</div>
