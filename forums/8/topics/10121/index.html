            <div class='col-md body'>H6Kitty, I apologize for my personal attacks on your life.<br><br>The Madman incident, I told him to leave which is true. This is really what happened.<br>He posted what you requested him to post. So someone else said if you asked him to die, would he. I followed up by saying that if he is partial to doing favors, then would he do it if I requested for him to leave the channel.<br><br>I have never banned him, nor you from the channel, nor anyone else. And I was not the one nuking you in #sgcafe. That's the truth, if you can dig up a log of me banning you or Madman from #sgcafe, then I will gladly give up my operator status in the channel.<br><br>I have never posted what you've said to me in the forums, and this little argument involved me and you only in the first place, that is why the conversation between me and Madman took place because I did not see how he came into the equation.<br><br>Call me a person who acts saintly, critique my words in bold if you wish, but I have tried my best to pipe down, and this is my peace statement.<br><br>I would like to end this flaming war as soon as possible. Thus I now withdraw from making any comments about you on the main, forums, or talking bad behind your back from this post onwards.<br>I will not even utilize sarcasm on you, or make any references to your friends or associates that is detrimental.<br>I will also refrain from messaging you ever, as it seems that facts get twisted by themselves when I do.<br><br>Madman, telling you to leave was a mistake on my part, and I admit it. I was unable to express myself clearly and my intentions towards you. For that, I am sorry also.<br><br>That is all I have to say this time. Again I am sorry for any personal attacks, conspiracy against you, if there was any. I also pre apologize if I have inadvertently offended anyone by insulting H^Kitty or Madman, but I declare, on my side at least, the flaming stops now.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Honesty is the Worst policy when taking an exam in CME</div>

I didn't know that Perseus share the same sentiments.<br><br>I have never been so happy for such a long time til you brought joy into my life again.  I will never forget that wonderful charming smile you have which puts a glow on your face and a smile on mine too.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Your sensitive, gentlemanly and caring nature lets me feel so taken care of and secure.  It nice to feel like that as I have not been cared for for a long time.  Its nice to know that finally, there is someone who can give so much for my sake.<br><br>You have certainly earned my love too.  And you can be sure that this means that utmost efforts will be put in to make 'this' work.<br><br>Yeah...we have been through hard times.  But, I am glad that we stood by each other all this while.  I think it is difficult to find another person like you.  Its not easy to find another person who can share, understand and feel wat I feel leow.  Thank you so much for never shouting and demanding any explaination even though unpleasant things have been said about me.<br><br>I am in fact, thankful for all the people who created the obstacles as somehow, going through all of them together have made us feel even more sure about each other.  Thank you people!  You know who you are!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I am glad that I can finally tell you how I feel in the open, oldman.
