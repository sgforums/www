              <p>kalez mate, I said domestic help in maintaining the house, not to throw the kid at the maid. My gripes about having domestic help aside ( I shld let you know I am quite against having domestic help, but frankly have no choice because we are not a welfare state that provides public childcare provision- and I also gotta work as well), I think domestic help is beneficial.</p>
              <p>For instance, maids free you from the more time-consuming chores like food preparation, maintaining hygiene and cleanliness, allowing you more quality time with children. Of course, both parents must spend adequate time with the kid - can you not see that having domestic help allows you to do that?</p>
              <p>You must recognise that bringing up a kid is not a maid's job, and it isn't solely a mum's job also. What do you mean that's what you don't like about sg girls -sacrificing family for their careers? What about the father? Is it fair that it is assumed that he NEED NOT sacrifice himself for the family? I agree both must contribute to bringing up the kid but let's not point fingers at the mother only if we see a kid brought up by his maid alright?</p>

              <p>Mate, kudos to you spending quality time with your mum doing chores and bonding - I admit I did have plenty of fun talking to my mum whilst doing householdy chores as well. But my mum was a housewife, and she quit her job to take care of me - thereby eliminating the need for a maid and allowing us to be able to bond and do housework concurrently.</p>
              <p>For the modern woman, I don't see why this should be the case. My husband and I will probably get off work at 8pm and reach home around 8.30pm - you reckon either him or me will be able to do the whole "housework quality time" bonding with our kids? In our case, I would deem quality time as time spent on bringing the little ones to the zoo or to picnics and stuff, on weekends. and a maid to help me clean up the house on weekends would make it possible. Of course the maid isn't the answer - and that's because there is no problem in the family. It's just a re delegation of tasks, no biggie.</p>
              <p>The thing is, as much as I hate to admit it, the maid is a bridge for me to be able to be in employment. Because we still live in a patriarchal society that is evolving very slowly with respect to gender roles alright. If a household doesn't have a maid to mind the kids - then it ultimately becomes mom's job. So justify that  <span style="color: #ff0000;">"work or no work both parents must help to take
              care of the kids" </span></p>
              <p>and BOTH parents must help take care of the kids. In an ideal world, sure! But in reality, pray tell me, how long is paternity leave? What, a lousy three days? So who is obliged to take care of the baby? Right from the onset it is implied that caring for the kid is the mum's job - so everything just becomes mum's job, mum's responsibility, mum's fault. It should not be so.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Kalez, my bf sees the maid as a solution, as much as I hate to have domestic help - I have to agree with him. I can't leave my job and we need a dual income household for upward social mobility. Perhaps if my bf hits a higher income scale, I will be a full time housewife. But that's not because it's my rightful job you see, it's because, and I readily admit men have higher chances in the workforce than women so he will probably get to the top scale much faster. It's just matter of opportunity costs. You have no idea what costs to my career I will be taking.... just wanted to tell you that even trying to be an independent woman in this patriarchal soceity has its constraints.</p>

              <p>i totally agreed with you that in the working force, it harder for the woman. im happy that your BF see that maid is a solution</p>
              <p>I need to highlight to you, like our PM say say in a small room, dont go oversea yearly, the family will pull through with 1 income.</p>
              <p>Hear me say... it the MPand PM that make the cost of living so high... a resale flat 3 room cost 270K ...my dad use to by them at 40K... ask them why our new HDB are so XXX they are not able to ans you.... if they are able to control HDB better i think alot of family could live a better life....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>there is too many to say... I dont blame you to think as you do now.... but can i ask you if today your BF got 8K income... and you have a kid will you or will you not b at hm to be a full time housewife?</p>
              <p>i seen and know many both are high income but they just throw the job to the maid.... they could have landed and go for europe trip yearly... but the job is still the maid job(or mother-in-law) yet i seen many low income family manage to feed a family with their dad working only... Can i ask why is that so... to be frank, i use to have the same thinking as you double income better life bigger house bigger car yearly trip..... but after a four months bagpacking trip my aspect of life have change... i cant tell you whay but i just... maybe i'm nolonger looking out to the world from the island, but looking at the island from the world...</p>
              <p>haha life so funny right... Piazza all the best for you and your BF :)</p>

              so high... a resale flat 3 room cost 270K ...my
              dad use to by them at 40K... ask them why our new HDB are
              so XXX they are not able to ans you.... if they are able to control
              HDB better i think alot of family could live a better life....</p>

              <p>there is too many to say... I dont blame you to think as you do
              now.... but can i ask you if today your BF got 8K income... and you

              housewife?</p>
              <p>i seen and know many both are high income but they just throw
              the job to the maid.... they could have landed and go for europe
              trip yearly... but the job is still the maid job(or mother-in-law)
              yet i seen many low income family manage to feed a family with
              their dad working only... Can i ask why is that so... to be frank,
              i use to have the same thinking as you double income better life

              <p>Thanks Kalez! And as per your question... nope I wouldn't quit if he is earning a 8k income. Well that's due to a whole host of reasons, chief amongst them being, when we both start working we will probably already have a combined of more than 8k net already - so why have a sole income of 8k when we both can have a dual income of more than 8? Plus we not having kids yet so haha I guess some would say, I have nothing to do might as well work right? :) Secondly, I must also stress that it's not just about the income per se (caveat: below a certain limit of income), I mean, really its such a waste of my education if I quit just after a few years of working - it becomes like a "then I go all the way to Uk to study for what?" question, you know? But of course, let say if he somehow miraculously can hit like 20000k a month while I still have very young kids, then fine ok I quit because I believe in quality time with the kid also. And then I probably wont get a maid and do that whole "housework bonding" thing yeah? :):)</p>
              <p>I must agree with you on the HDB issue. I do think that prices are artificially kept high. But of course you must recognise that your dad bought his at 40k but with inflation over the generations of course you can't buy yours at 40k. I mean, my granddad bought a bungalow at 40k too in his time, but now a bungalow would fetch over 5 mil! so prices naturally will increase. I think well, there are some measures put in place to help newly weds get their homes with discounts and waivers so I think if you settle for a small flat first you can get one at say Woodlands or Punggol for less 200k? I think the HDB situation seriously needs sorting out and yeaps definitely will help plenty of families lead a comfortable life :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm glad for you your backpacking trip made you aware of how unimportant and transient material posessions are - I wonder why my trips never yield me such insights - and allowed you to reassess life. But if you are wondering why low income families can get by on dad's one income, whereas middle to upper income households need both incomes, I mean it is easy to conclude that the latter is hankering after the signfiers of status - the car, the condo, the country club membership. Not to deny there are households like that of course, but I think, material possessions aside, some households want their kids to have the best of everything. Not just material goods, but enriching holidays and stuff you know. And for these pricey things, I guess that's why they need a dual income? As for my part, I'm not so much after the material stuff as much as I want to put aside money for my children's education. I want an overseas education for them and I gotta start saving like now, haha.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I mean I guess what I'm trying to say is that there are always many reasons why individuals create different sort of households, or household spending habits etc - I guess there's no such thing as a better way of thinking about life?</p>
              <p>Good luck in life too! Let's just try to stay afloat in this crazy world, shall we? :P</p>

              <p>Actually, its not the money problem. Parents who have occupations that pays high tend to be much busier than those who recieve average/low pays.</p>
              <p>Of course they're able to hire helpers so as to free some time for them to supposedly spend with their children. But honestly, how much time can they really spare? They would be tired out by their workload and would not have the heart to spend quality time with their children. In the end, it all boils down to how the parents manage their time, rather than how much do the parents earn.</p>
              <p>About the topic of girls being educated, while I think its rather fair for them to be. It increases our workforce and do pretty much alot of good crap to our economy. </p>
              <p>However though, I find that education had made many females rather bitchy -.-</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I agree with you that teaching should be in school.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">However, if your children don’t understand a single thing in school, you may want to employ a tutor for your kids. Therefore, you will need to spend money on your children. I am not saying that spending money on your children is a bad thing. But, if women are educated, they will be able to coach your children. So, why not save the money instead of employing a tutor?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">You mentioned that women should stay at home to cook, raise children and to do house chores. But, do you know that the world is changing? Now, even men are helping women with house chores and the kids. So, I disagree with what you have said about women staying at home to cook, raise children and to do house chores. Women can have the same rights as what men have too.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Women should be educated.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The first reason is what I have mentioned above, which is they can educate their children. I will not further elaborate as it is stated above.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Secondly, women can help to share the family’s burden. If the family is not coping well financially, especially due to the current economy downturn, don’t you think women can also do their part by contributing to the family during such situations? Therefore, this shows that women MUST be educated so that they contribute to the society and family effectively. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Lastly, educated women can help Singapore grow. The workforce in Singapore is shrinking due to the aging population. Thus, educated women can play a part to the workforce. You mentioned that Singapore can always attract foreign talent from the other countries. Do you think these foreign talents will stay in Singapore forever? Foreign talents are willing to come to Singapore because of the attractive packages Singapore offers. These foreign talents will not stay long in Singapore as they will soon find somewhere else that offers them better compensation and benefits.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I totally disagree with what you have said about women staying at home. Educated women can contribute to the society and family in several ways. They can help educate their children, share the family’s burden during economic crisis and also play a part in the Singapore’s workforce. Hence, women should be educated.</span></p>

              am not saying that spending money on your children is a bad thing.
              But, if women are educated, they will be able to coach your
              children. So, why not save the money instead of employing a
              tutor?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">You mentioned that women should stay at
              home to cook, raise children and to do house chores. But, do you
              know that the world is changing? Now, even men are helping women
              with house chores and the kids. So, I disagree with what you have
              said about women staying at home to cook, raise children and to do
              house chores. Women can have the same rights as what men have
              too.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Women should be educated.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The first reason is what I have mentioned
              above, which is they can educate their children. I will not further
              elaborate as it is stated above.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Secondly, women can help to share the
              family’s burden. If the family is not coping well financially,
              especially due to the current economy downturn, don’t you think
              women can also do their part by contributing to the family during
              such situations? Therefore, this shows that women MUST be educated
              so that they contribute to the society and family
              effectively.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Lastly, educated women can help Singapore
              grow. The workforce in Singapore is shrinking due to the aging
              population. Thus, educated women can play a part to the workforce.
              You mentioned that Singapore can always attract foreign talent from
              the other countries. Do you think these foreign talents will stay
              in Singapore forever? Foreign talents are willing to come to
              Singapore because of the attractive packages Singapore offers.
              These foreign talents will not stay long in Singapore as they will
              soon find somewhere else that offers them better compensation and
              benefits.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I totally disagree with what you have said
              about women staying at home. Educated women can contribute to the
              society and family in several ways. They can help educate their
              children, share the family’s burden during economic crisis and also
              play a part in the Singapore’s workforce. Hence, women should be
              educated.</span></p>

              <p>About the 500... I must say that the quality of the average
              Russian soldier is well below that of the average German one, in

              <p>The females in the Russian army during the Second World War
              proved their worth on the battlefield. Educate a few divisions of
              women on warfare, train them, and equip them well, and they can
              provide results in war. The highest scoring female sniper ever (who
              was Russian) achieved 309 confirmed kills, including an enemy
              sniper who had a score well over 500 (snipers) before his end.</p>
              <p>Point: Educate female human beings and they can produce
