              <p>His military life, i dunno what to say la.. But his social life is definitely one big phailure, with that kind of old thinking...</p>

              <p><br>Haha..I understand what you mean about the quality of debate. But it is no excuse not to challenge it when the opportunity present itself, anywhere in any media. The only way for evil to win is for good persons to do nothing.</p>
              <p><br>I will immodestly claim that i start out with the noblest of intentions, to change stubborn minds and clear misconceptions where i see it, to show a better path to progress, but i will unreservedly admit that perhaps in time, i , an equally flawed human, will falter, succumbed to all that is impure, become corrupted and crumble before temptation and fail humanity.</p>
              <p><br>But the good thing of living in a progressive society is that when one such as i fail, another would stand in my place. This had been how our race had progressed since time began.</p>
              <p><br>We must not fail those who came before us, and who spared us the horror of the mistakes they made in the past, of wars and destruction that almost wiped out civilisation.</p>
              <p><br>Our forefathers had been kept stupid by imperialist masters, and denied education so as not to comprehend or act responsibly for freedom, but now we this generations have access to such luxury, provided by our hardworking ancestors who set aside their income to build schools and funded education.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Their hopes is that we may build a better and matured society than they had lived, not only for us, but for our future generations as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus it is our responsibility that we leave a better future for our next generations - sons, daughters, nephews, cousins, friends and their children.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is something that is bigger than ourselves and just making money alone, and it is the future we will create for others as our past had created for us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A future that i hope will not be too late in the making, in face of natural calamities that will soon engulf us. No calamity can wipe out humanity and a remnant will remain, and it is my hope that they will bring the best of our legacy to rebuild a better new world.</p>

              <p>I disagree with everything you said. The homophobic "true man or
              gay" statement aside, I think you should not be putting Phorum Noob
              down just because he called for women to do national service.</p>
              <p>As a woman, I think if we were to demand for equality between
              the sexes, then Singapore women should also face the obligations
              that come with it. We cannot have our cake and eat it. We can't
              declare ourselves as fiercely independent women and then demand our
              husbands/boyfriends to be at our beck and call, pay for our
              everything etc. Have some sense for christ sakes. We cannot claim
              to want gender equality without extending this equality to all
              spheres. Equal pay, equal opportunities but I'm still a
              damsel-in-distress and need a guy to pay for my everything? Give
              your man a break once in a while! Seriously girls!</p>
              <p>As for service to the nation, maybe we can argue that being on
              the frontline is not the best place for a woman to show hew best
              capabilities. That is true. But there are many areas in which we
              can service the nation. Community service, administrative personell
              and hey, the more gung ho amongst us can even become officers. I
              don't understand how we can call for equality and then shy away
              from civic responsibilities by saying</p>
              <p>"Why SAF soldier cannot fire and aim correctly ar?? must need
              women snipers ar??"</p>
              <p>Don't be so daft. And plus, if we serve out national service,
              then there is no more damned reason for wage differentials between
              men and women. Is that what we are always complaining about? 
              I don't deny the society is still largely gender biased. Want to
              change this mindset? Then prove yourself equal or even better to
              the tasks.</p>
              <p>Stop appealing to a man's ego or masculine side to shun the
              tasks that women should take on, if we are to be held in the same
              regard.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Demanding for a guy to be a "real man" instead of being free to
              be who he really is, is just like demanding women to stay in the
              kitchen and obey his man."</p>
              <p>Phorum Noob, you got the real idea. By calling on you to be a
              real man, angel7030 is subscribing to pre conceived gendered roles.
              By calling on you to be a real man, she is assuming women to
              playing the other role - the weak and domestic hapless lady in the
              kitchen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Exactly proof of what I have been thinking lately. The only
              impediment to gender equality is perhaps women themselves.</p>

              <p>I agree. Also a lot of kids are allowed to anyhow run around outside and scream but their parents do not do anything or even at least try to control them. Like nowadays it seem there are a growing number of parents who don't care as much for their kids as parents used to?</p>

              <p>I am a guy.</p>
              <p>I strongly agree on woman getting more education!</p>
              <p>I mean real education!Woman in Singapore can be very highly educated...</p>
              <p>But most of them only thinks naive.They dont really think hard when comes to a lot of issue.Put too much emotion on the true work.</p>
              <p>For example,teaching ur own children should be puting forth example by using urself.not sending them to tution centre.The real meaning of education has failed in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Now u wan to put woman at home and teach ur children next time to be bimbo???</p>
