              <p>As seeing how you struggle to piece together a cogent argument for any of the questions posted, I don't think you started this thread for a serious discussion, rather this is just a platform for you to give free rein for your bigotry. So pardon me if I deem trying to debate sensibly with you is a waste of my time. I'm a woman excelling academically here, so I think my existence alone proves you wrong. Also, I see both marriage and kids in my near future, further rendering your "women should not be educated because they should spend time rearing kids" theory wrong. If I were ever to give up my career for my kids, it will be my choice, not because it's my rightful role or my correct place in society. </p>
              <p>You are quite free to have any opinion of women you want. Just so long as there's more of me to prove you quite wrong, and that you never hold high enough office to come up with sexist policies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Best of luck in life, dear.</p>

              <p>Relax, Meat Pao (nice name btw). Don't you think taking the time to report him to the army is a waste of time. Frankly, even berating him has its opportunity costs. He has his freedom to voice his opinions, just as long as people are smart enough to brush them aside with as much notice we would render to a buzzing fly.</p>
              <p>Smile and enjoy the day instead!</p>

              <p>that is rubbish!</p>
              <p>women should only stay at home and do domestic tasks only if their husbands are famous influential men in the society- like directors, managers, ceo- these ppl who earn more than five figure sums and not some inept blue collar worker.</p>
              <p>anyway why should women do housework? there are maids or nannies to hire...</p>

              <p>That is such an old fashion thinking. Guys don't have to all be expected to be big and mean like a savage animals anymore. I really hate people who act tough and macho just because they are afraid to deviate from the social code of western machismo. That expectation is sexist. Besides there are many non-combantant sai-kang positions in the army that any women can take what.</p>
              <p>Sissy? what sissy? Like your attitude is so agressive, maybe I could call you a macho manly girl?</p>
              <p>Demanding for a guy to be a "real man" instead of being free to be who he really is, is just like demanding women to stay in the kitchen and obey his man.</p>
              <p>Women demand fairness and I most certainly would agree. If guys have to waste their life in army dealing with those useless regular bastards.Then girls should too, they are just as capable as us guys so why should they escape National Slavery? Even some of the weaker guys have to join NS as clarks, but fitter girls don't. That's not sexual equality.</p>
              <p>Not during war-time girls can still waste their time and get paid peanuts  as  non-combact medics what.</p>

              <p>I disagree with everything you said. The homophobic "true man or gay" statement aside, I think you should not be putting Phorum Noob down just because he called for women to do national service.</p>
              <p>As a woman, I think if we were to demand for equality between the sexes, then Singapore women should also face the obligations that come with it. We cannot have our cake and eat it. We can't declare ourselves as fiercely independent women and then demand our husbands/boyfriends to be at our beck and call, pay for our everything etc. Have some sense for christ sakes. We cannot claim to want gender equality without extending this equality to all spheres. Equal pay, equal opportunities but I'm still a damsel-in-distress and need a guy to pay for my everything? Give your man a break once in a while! Seriously girls!</p>
              <p>As for service to the nation, maybe we can argue that being on the frontline is not the best place for a woman to show hew best capabilities. That is true. But there are many areas in which we can service the nation. Community service, administrative personell and hey, the more gung ho amongst us can even become officers.

              <p>Don't be so daft. And plus, if we serve out national service, then there is no more damned reason for wage differentials between men and women. Is that what we are always complaining about?  I don't deny the society is still largely gender biased. Want to change this mindset? Then prove yourself equal or even better to the tasks.</p>
