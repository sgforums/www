            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by FBI:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: green;">here's another story which i won a PDA in a magazine writing..<br><br>here it goes:<br><br>A True love story of mine..<br><br>I was in the sec 3, ard like half a year i felt tat i have a liking for this particular gal in ma class. I confess to her but got rejected of course because she is attached. I dunno why i still did it but i think i really cannot control my liking for her as she is such a cute person. I always told my frens in the past that i won't fall for her for sure and stuff like that but in the end i still did. DOn ask me, i dunno why too. BTW her name is called "E".<br><br>During lantern festival, a bunch of friends including E and me will b playing candles and stuff beside a big drain. When i reached the destination, i found out that her phone was dropped accidentally into the drain. Luckily the drain is kinda dry. As i still have a liking for E i immediately rush to the front where there is this unstable ladder linking to the drain. I went along with a friend. We rushed all the way in the drain frm the ladder to the part where her phone was. ANyway the drain was abt 2 storey high. When i gotten it i rushed back to the ladder, i was expecting a thanks frm her the moment i came up but the only thing she asked is abt the condition of her phone. I was quite disappointed actually. But later on when i reach home she sent us a sms thanking us. Now that really makes me delighted.<br><br>I went to a diff class frm E next year. BUt i admit that i still have a liking for abit. Towards the end of the year, me and her started to get better in terms of friendship because of pool outings and stuff. During a break after a N level exam, i saw my best friend playing with her. For dunno why i felt a sense of jealousy and agony. When i went home and relflect on it, then i realised that i still have a liking for her.<br><br>So i starts to sort of woo her again this time. I will talk with her on phone and MSN messenger. And During a N level MAths exam, she mentioned that she is tired and stuff and will slp and wake up at 4am to study. But she also mentioned that she is not sure if she will wake up or not. SO i didn't slept for the whole night for the fear that i won't b able to give her the morning wake up call. I messaged her at 4 but no replies. SO i guess that she is slping. The next day after exam she msged me that she cannot wake up and stuff. SO we have some good conversation with sms(s)<br><br>THen our friendship became better and better each day. We would encourage each other to study hard and stuff. THis really motivated me in studying. THen she told me that she wants to see me going up the stage taking prize because of good results and i promised her that. SHe is the motivation for my N level exams. DUring the exams i would purposely draw the word "E" on my hand to remind myself to strive my v best for the exams. Everday man, without fail. And when i am doing the exams, i keep having thoughts of the conversation with her and stuff. SOmetimes i will jus stare in the space for a few mins. SOme papers i really feel like giving up, but when i saw the "E" word, it motivates me again. Slowly i start to let my friends know abt it. On a particular night, i confess to her again. She didn't answer it but we still remain as friends like the past. Then after a few days of my confession, one of my friends told me that he wants to woo her to. So we agreed to have a competition over it.<br><br>After the exams, the competition is still on. THen i found out that sometimes she would really replied me v slowly. So i asked her wassup and she told me she is playing this game called "Maple Story". So in order to get close to her, i play this game too. But later i found out she is much mroe high level then me. SO i trained daily trying v hard to catch up with her. But it's pointless, she talks with the friends in that game more then me.<br><br>After a week, she is angry with me over something. SHe is mad at me because during a BBQ at a friend house, i treat my close friend (female) better then her. THat's wat she thougt. BUt in fact no, when E asked for the food she wanted, i bbq all and gave to her. Accomodating to watever she needs. Well i think she jus didn't realized it. SO to get vindicated i bought 3 roses and walk frm all the way frm my  house to her house. AS it's my bro bday on that day too, i need to rush between 2 palces. SO i ran all the way. She didn't replied to any of my msg and calls. SO i knock on the door and her lil bro opend it. I borrowed a pen frm him and write some stuff on a card. THis is wat i wrote " Hey E Sorry for making u angry with me i am really sorry. But me and her are really close friends only and i really treat u better then her, i hope u can forgive me. 3 roses: I like u". And later on when i am back home, she replied to my message and we still got back to the usual friendship.<br><br>But i can sense that she is still a lil bit mad with me because when we are in a conversation she would suddenly mention " U go talk to her la, since u so good with her help her do this and that", and stuff like that ya. Doesn't really matter as long as she isn't mad. Her bday is coming on Nov 28. My friend and i have ideas to impress her during the chalet. We had planned to blindfold her on the chalet day and take her to beach where we had set up fireworks that  formed a love shape. And when we light up all of em, my friend will remove the blindfold and i will b kneeling down with flowers and asking for her hand. Yup that's wat we planned.<br><br>We were v happy after we had pllanned all this. BUt after a few days the sad news came. Her friends told us that she won't b going for the chalet and all our efforts went down the drain. That's my present for her actually but since she decided not to go for the chalet then i don know wat to give for her either. And other then that, my friend told me that she has patched with her bf. So it's double sadness. TOo sad to even go for her bday.. I stay at home and cried. SHe asked me why didn;t i attend it and i lied to her that i am sick. I am v sad for the next few weeks.<br><br>Until then.. i Kept the most impt messages in my phone, MSN chat logs in my com. I admit i still have some feelings for her but since she already patched with her guy then i can only wish her happiness. I stopped messaging her because it's no use and the more i do the more unhappy i will become.<br><br>A few days ago my former sec sch called me abt taking some prize in my sch because of my N level results, i am happy of course because i can really let her see me going up the stage taking prize. And i had kept my promise to her.<br><br>E, i thank you for being the motivation for my N level and thank u for the wonderful friendship. U are a v nice person to me and in my heart u are always the best. All the best for your O and good luck! I will kept my promise for u and study hard and go poly and UNI.<br></span></div></blockquote>wah piang eh.. u damn good at making people cry lah..

Quite touching to know that there's someone whom cares and is at my level of things, so started chatting. She gave me confidence and motivation, and when the school term started, I told her that I like her. That was when she was in Sec.4 and me doing my retain year. She was everything that a guy can ask for, sweet, but alittle chor lor at times.<br><br>After her O'lvls, she's didn't enroll in JC, so had quite a fair bit of time to work before Poly starts.

She's typical of any girl, acts like a lion when with the bf, but is afraid of outsiders. Her boss whom eventually became sorta like her "god-ma" is a promiscuous 30+ yr old, whom owns a shop at PS selling crystal accessories. While doing one of those pushcart roadshows at Bugis Junction, she got to know of this guy selling kids stuff, and she fell for him. I found out that she cheated on me as she accidentally sent a sms meant for him to me instead. Of course I was ragging, I confronted her and she cried, I forgave her as I believed she didn't expect it too.<br><br>During my first year in Poly, we broke up as she's always comparing me to her coursemate's rich boyfriends whom can take them on holidays to places like Japan and so on. I was frankly pissed as whatever I have till date, I've worked hard for it 110%. I've always told her this "Though I can never promise never to make you cry, I promise I will make you laugh". But she wants the material things in life too much...how could an 18year old afford a 2wk trip to Japan and LV merchandise?  We patched back early last year, after CNY. We got back as her project model was stolen and she was near break down. I gave her a hand, lending her my digicam, laptop, taking cab to town to purchase materials she need just to help her. When she went for internship, she fell for another guy. As she uses my laptop often, sometimes my MSN signs in straight to her account.I found out about this guy because he messaged me thinking I was her. I was enraged...fool me once,shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. So i played him, and read her emails and found out everything. I confronted both her and that guy, and her reason for not telling people that she's attached is because we patched back. She thinks that its not acceptable for her to patch back with someone from the past.<br><br>Eventually I got to know the guy whom she fell for during her internship and we chatted abit. He was shocked to find out the things that she did. Anyway, the ex is presently with "Brad Pitt" who works in the shop next to her old shop at PS.Call me bitter, but she still comes to me for help with her projects which I flatly turn down. Because I see no reason as to why doesn't she ask her boyfriend to help her, as I'm from her past. She chose to give me up for someone her "fairy god-ma" has introduced...someone whom is 22, and makes less then 2k a month. How to live like a taitai in the future?<br><br>Nevertheless, I'm over the sad phase, am in the healing phase now and am seeing different girls on a non-committal basis, freeing up my time and allowing me to do what I've never done before.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tycokid89:</div><div class="quote_body">no more ppl sharing how they start a relationship le?</div></blockquote>well... i have one. Anyway, it's very long. so bear with it eh..<br><br>It was the brand new year. And I retained. Due to change of subject combi. Felt lost in my new class. Suddenly, I felt so old. One year of JC can really change people. Anyway, my life became more focused on after school rather than in school. And in school, you can call me the lone ranger. A man in his world. During that time, I'm still sore from my past 2 relationships. Both of them dumped me for other guys. Maybe, I'm just not good enough. So, I have no intention of being with any girl back then and they are just pleasure for the eyes. Anyway, during the second intake, there are a few girls which caught my eye. And ,especially one of them,N, I find her cute in her own ways. So, while in school, I always admire these girls.<br><br>Even so, I still have a wide range of outside friends, mostly girls. And I got really close to one of them. It's like we will ,without fail, chat in MSN till we sleep. On the surface, we're just friends. And we have go out together on dates several time. I find this gal ,A, amusing and she never fails to make me happy. But in my heart, it was N who had found a place there.<br><br>Anyway, as time flies, I get even closer to A. As for N, I still lack the courage to talk to her. When in school, she never knew I existed. Even if we bumped into one another in the canteen, she will like immediately turn around and walk away. After half a year, I had memorized the breaks that we share in common which I used those time to wash eye while studying. I feel like I wanna be with her but instead, I'm getting closer with another gal. Naturally, soon enough, I've given up hope on N. And kinda propose to A to be my gf. A said she will think about it for a few days as it will require some commitments.<br><br>One fine day, my lucky day perhaps, me and 3 of my mates were playing pool in Jurong East when I received an SMS. A had accepted me as her bf. I was like happy of course. After pool, we went to a coffee shop to eat and chit-chat. I knew that one of my friend ,Z, is a good friend of N's friend. And Z was SMS-ing with N's friend at the moment. Turned out that N's friend spilled the bean about N liking me. And Z told me about it. Cos he knew I had liked N before. Never before in my life, I felt happy and sad at the same time. Happy because the girl of my dream actually liked me!! And sad because I don't know what to do. I'm still skeptical about it cos if she like me, why is she cold to me?<br><br>So, Z and N's friend kinda explain it all to me that N is shy about it and only her trusted friends know about it. Now, I'm in a dilemma. Before I knew it, that night, A add N in Friendster cos A knows I like N but A doesn't know N likes me. And N msged me why A added her to her list. Cos, I'm the only link between both. I just say it's for fun. From there, we chatted with one another. Which progressed to MSN soon enough. Before I knew it, we went out on our first date. Z and N's friend were supposed to be there as well. Supposedly group outing. But it's just me and the two gals that day. Technically, I just had a girlfriend already. But, I had already told A about it. She understand that I still have the hots for N. I told her to let things flow and I will know which one is the right one for me when the time comes.<br><br>True to my gut feeling, N and me can really click very well though our interests clash. She's like the pinky gal interested in Neoprints and pop music while I'm the punk guy interested in soccer and underground music. But, there's another problem. There's a guy wooing N as well. And for N, she may already be with him if she didn't know I like her a lot. Turns out to be a messy love square. As for A, I had told her that I'm really confused about my feelings. One gal is the gal of my dream and another is one that I had courted for 3 months.<br><br>After a week of mess trying to think, me and N decided to be together. The guy who was wooing N was angry that she chose to be with me. Cos she barely knows me that well as compared to him. At least N had told that guy beforehand that she like a guy in her school which is me. As for A, she was sad to hear my decision. I know all these sound so unromantic. But, I brought N out on a few dates to 'woo' her even though we are attached already.<br><br>The first week when we were together was rough cos the guy asked N to give him a chance and he tried to brainwash me out of N's head. As for A, she is still clingy to me and cries whenever we are on the phone. I agreed to meet A one last time and we ended up doing something else. It's mild but I knew I'm wrong to accept that cos I might just give her false hope. As for N, she also went out with the guy one last time. And the guy bloody tried to kiss her on the lips and only managed one on the cheeks. And what's with trying to hold her hand when he knows that she's with me already. And N admitted allowing the guy to hug her and at the same time his hands underneath her clothes??? Thank God it was just the stomach area. Though I hate that, I have to swallow what I wanna scold at her cos A kinda told N about what we did, hoping that N break up with me.<br><br>Thankfully, N forgave me on that. And I also forgave N for not standing up to her rights, which let the guy's hand roam so freely. After almost 1 and a half year, that guy no longer contact N and was last heard to be with another gal. And A had been in two other relationships and we remain as net/phone friends even though she tried to bastard me and I had let her down. As for Z and the other gal, it turns out that the gal like Z but Z is not committed into relationships. And now, that same gal is attached to my good friend, F1. When before that, my other good friend, F2, used to like that gal. Betrayal of friends?? I doubt so. Cos now, all of us live happily ever after including me and my gf. All I can say is that fate brought us together. And really, it's a small world out there. If you ever saw 2 couples and a guy in town before, high chance it's us. lol... For those who believe in fate, here's one happy-ending story.</div>
