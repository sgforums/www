All my exact sentiments.<br><br>In fact, i ever got his incident stated in point 1). i.e. very interestingly, its my Graphics card, not latches properly, so that when it heats up, there is apparently some expansion due to heat, and the connection comes loose. This then causes my processor to restart,etc and surprisely when it cooled, i can start my computer again. This can also occur for the PSU.<br><br>PSU, some possibility, like if you buy those lousy brand PSU which gives unreliable wattage and can die off fast one. So after some time of running like 1yr or so, PSU may become unstable, sometimes when you start using some programs or rendering graphics, power may not be enough or wat and cause autostart.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
