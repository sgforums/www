            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for those taking time to read this post. I think I should just type out my whole situation now instead of posting it parts by parts last time. Hope u all reading this do not mind k.<br><br>I am currently 17 and this girl that I like is 17 too. We study in the same school but in different classes. I got to know this girl from my friend who is an ex-classmate of her. I got her handphone no. and I sms her admiting I like her. So she knows I like her. After which we started to sms each other frequently. Most of the time would be me starting the conversation first. She would sms me sometimes too. She would sms me msgs like telling me to think of her, if I miss her I can call her. We would smile to each other and say hi when we see eachother in school. We would meet each other during her break on wednesday.<br><br>I too talk to her on the phone, the longest for 2 hours. I thought I stood a chance with her. But such things are hard to say. I tried to ask her out but she said she wanted her friend to come along. She would ask me questions like why I liked her, whether I would go chase after another girl who looks like her and agrees to go out with me, unlike her. I took up courage to ask her to be with me but she rejected me. She wanted me to stay in contact with her. I do not mind so I still kept in contact with her as I still liked her.<br><br>I do not call her or sms her as frequently now. But we still keep in touch. She would always ask me for help in her school work although we are not in the same class. She would still sms me sometimes. She is a very nice and hardworking girl and I seemed to notice that her friends are mostly girls. She is always afraid that people will talk about us. the exams are coming and i know she will be busy preparing for her exams so i intend to ask her out after the exams or shouldn't I??<br><br>What do u guys think?? Still got chance for me?? Or should I give her up totally??</div>
