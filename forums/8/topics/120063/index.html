Maybe the stigma is no longer as bad as in the past but Singaporeans are still a critical lot. This can add to the mental and emotional stress the soon-to-be mother is going through especially if she does not have the support of the father or her parents and friends leading to them committing irrational acts out of desperation.<br><br>The sad thing is that at the same time there are many couples trying hard to have a baby but they can't. Maybe there could be a match for these unwed mothers and couples who want to adopt a baby badly so that in a way the situation is taken care of.<br></div>

People tend to label these people as s|uts, stupid, naive, etc...<br><br>When things go wrong, people like to point fingers too soon, without looking at the whole icident subjectively.<br><br>Perhaps in western countries, where there' less social stigma but more support for such young pple, there're fewer cases of infanticide. But of course, there'll be some who argue that it gives young people the impression that it's ok to go and have irresponsible sex. There're two sides of the coins I guess.<br><br>What my mum said might just mirror most people's thinking: that this girl by becoming pregnant and unwed mum had ruined her whole life. If society puts some a heavy sentence on those who have done wrong (by becoming pregnant before marriage I mean), of course here'll be a lot of cases of infanticide/abandoned babies.<br><br>Do not be too quick to point fingers at young people who do wrong. I believe society and adults have a bigger part to play that they did<strong> NOT </strong>play well, hence leading to such unfornate and sad incidents.</div>
