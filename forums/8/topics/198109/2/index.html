            <div class='col-md body'>Sounds like a vascular anomaly that ruptured...cerebral aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations in the brain are rare abnormalities of blood vessels in the brain. When they rupture, the mortality is very high. Thankfully, they are rare but occasionally seen associated with conditions like polycystic kidney disease and Marfan's syndrome. Quite a number of victims tend to be very young though. The typical story is a young person who wakes up with a sudden terrible headache and lose consciousness soon after. The prognosis is very poor once the vessel has ruptured.<br><br>The difficulty with diagnosis is because these conditions tend to be silent until they rupture. The only way to diagnose them is a brain scan and angiography may be required in some cases in addition.<br><br>Some cases give a 'warning bleed' before full rupture and the only symptom is headache, especially associated with neck stiffness. However, everyone gets headache from time to time and it is not logical to scan everyone with a headache. Not only is the cost high but there are risks with the procedure as well. Rarely, some patients die from an allergic reaction to the dye used for the scan. So doctors must not bow to pressure from the ignorant public and simply scan everyone with a headache. You will kill more people that way than save the very few with this rare condition.<br><br>The management is correct in this case. Give painkillers and see if the headache goes away. If the pain is persistent as it appears to be in this case, make an appointment to see a neurologist. There is nothing in the story that indicates a dangerous vascular malformation, which is, after all, rare. Unfortunately the young man happens to be one of the very few with this condition. Had he presented with an epileptic fit, he would have had the scan immediately but no, he only had the common headache.<br><br>A non-urgent appointment to see a neurologist for persistent headache in two weeks is very reasonable. In the UK, you would be lucky to see one in 3 months' time.<br><br></div>

And I suggest next time, don't bank on SGH or whatever H to to get to root of your medical emergencies. Identify the symptoms first through one of those 24Hour clinics, from there, get specific referal and diagnosys from the doctor then go into NUH A&amp;E for immediate attention.<br><br>I'm disgusted by SGH's level of efficiency. In my opnion, NEVER rely on government hospital to be expedient in an emergency if you come into their A&amp;E in one piece and NOT dripping blood and pieces. First get pre-diagnosed by 24Hr clinic doctor, then go and demand immediate attention. If they cannot render emergency care or insists on delaying, tell them you will report to Police as a public member. If they act tough and stubborn tell them you will now go elsewhere but will proceed to lodge a Police report.<br><br>I think they are more concerned about their internal redtapes than people who come in needing medical attention.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Read today's article by Chua Mui Hoong. Apparently this patient had slurred speech as well as severe headache..in that case, the doctor in question should have admitted him for further investigation. Lots of people get heaches, but slurred speech is a sign of neurological deficits and indicates something far more serious.<br><br>Guess the doctor is not very experienced..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ah.. again. garhmen not willing to spend $$$ on healthcare.<br>yaya... we heard about EU and US tax are high. But take a example across the straits. their tax rate are quite similiar as here.<br><br>Hospital there are lousy and old but they charge cheaply so that even poor ppl will have medical treatment... reason? government is subsidies almost all the cost of salary medical personnel and medication &amp; equipment. GH is to provide healthcare to citizen and never to make $$$ or even achieve break even.<br><br>Over here? yeah nice and beautiful hospital "world standard" but the price is also "very nice/world standard" which those who are really poor can just wait and die.</div>
