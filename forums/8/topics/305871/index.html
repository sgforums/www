              <p>I admit I'm stealing $90 from my Dad, but before you say anything, please read the whole story first.</p>
              <p>Some time ago, I had my hair styled to make myself look more feminine. Unfortunately my Dad throws a fit when he takes a look at me, as he can't bare to have me look like a girl (I'm transsexual, remember?), and thus he orders me to go to the barber and cut my hair, or he'll throw me out onto the streets. Woohoo, $80 down the drain, plus another $10 for the f*cking dumb barber cut.</p>
              <p>I have never ever stolen any money from my parents until now, but I only plan to take $90, nothing more, nothing less. It's sort of a refund from my Dad, for the money that I had lost simply because he doesn't accept me for who I am. *sigh* so what do your think of this act of stealing?</p>

                      and cut my hair, or he'll throw me out onto the streets. Woohoo,
                      $80 down the drain, plus another $10 for the f*cking dumb barber
                      cut.</p>
              <p>I have never ever stolen any money from my parents until now,
                      but I only plan to take $90, nothing more, nothing less. It's sort
                      of a refund from my Dad, for the money that I had lost simply
                      because he doesn't accept me for who I am. *sigh* so what do your
                      think of this act of stealing?</p>

              <p>Frankly based on your post, you seem to think your dad is a bit of an ass. No comments on that.</p>
              <p>The only reason why I would encourage you to think twice about taking the 90 bucks is because you won't stop there.</p>
              <p>After you take the 90 bucks and nothing happens, you get lucky, sh*t knows you'll try your luck again some day down the road when you need the money again.</p>
              <p>The cycle repeats. You get more daring. Over time you're in danger of running this into a habit. It's like picking up smoking. It's the same thing. It's a shit hole.</p>
              <p>I know the hair is very important because most of us spend hundreds of dollars on them. Shoes too. And cigarettes are very important to me. But damn don't start stealing from anybody. Don't do it not for them, but for yourself.</p>
              <p>Just my two cents worth.</p>

              <p>Never.  If I wanted something, I'll ask for it.  Mom's pretty generous but if she says no, I'll just sulk and mope around the house until she tak boleh tahan and finally gives in!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>
