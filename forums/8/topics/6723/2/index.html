So far, the furthest I had experienced was that when I felt very bad when I dunno what is happening to the person I am concerned about. Such as when she go back late, and I dunno if she is safe.. I will be anxious.<br><br>Anyway.. how could you judge your feeling for someone? By your gut feeling? By your actions?</div>

Last but not least, sacrifice what I have for him.<br><br>As all should know that true love is when u still can say "I love U." even when the person is on the verge of death. At the point when your partner is going to leave you eternally, you know that the most part of you have gone with him. And the only thing that perserve u on to live alone is your kids, and to see your kids being successful and to see your grandchildren calling you "Grandma".....<br><br>For one thing, I know that if I ever find him...I will give EVERYTHING ,my heart and soul...till then<br><br>Angel in the darkness...<br><br>------------------<br>Writing is a weapon that is more powerful than a man's fist.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa,<br>How would you feel when you feel you can love the person with all your heart, to give up everything for the person, to do whatever you can to make the person happy. Basically, you love the person to the core. And yet the person doesn't return the love in a similar way. Would you be disappointed or would you be more positive, as in not everyone can show their love that well, and you just accept the person for what they are.<br><br>In fact, would you feel that you can be blinded by love that you can accept the person no matter how bad they may be or having flaws in their personalities.<br><br>I feel that I am the type who will go all out for love if I feel that the person is the one I want. I will not hold back anything to show my concern and my affection. To fail or to be rejected would not deter me from giving up.. only the feeling of not being appreciated and taken for granted by the person would make me reconsider. It doesn't matter who she hang out with, all that matters is at the end of the day, I am the only person that exist in her heart.<br><br>How I wish I can relate this to someone. BTW, how would you feel if someone tell you their true feeling.. how much they love you and such, when the person is not your love one.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like I said I have not tried loving someone so deep to tell the person how I feel...so I dunno how I will feel but I guessed for me..I will only confess if I think the feeling is mutual...if not I think my love or like for him will fade as I knew it will come to no good end.<br><br>I dunno how much a person loves or like me when he tell me his feelings cos I am not him but all I know is that it is painful to wait for the person to say yes...when the person is unsure...and I feel guilty for wasting a guy's youth on me...but I cannot do anything but to convince I am not the one for him...<br><br>There is only one me and I can't give it to all the guys who liked me...so only I can choose one....but he has not yet appeared.<br><br>To say you love someone is easy, but what if the person you love brings u nothing but pain and suffering? Love have to be mutual to be called love...no use only one is always the giver and the respondent simply dun care...I always feel that right from the start...there is someone for everyone...and there is no hurry to find...once there time has come for him/her to reveal...everything will just fall in place...effortlessly.<br><br>Dun fall in love becos of lonliness or for the sake of being in love.<br><br>------------------<br>Writing is a weapon that is more powerful than a man's fist.</div>
