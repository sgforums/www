            <div class='col-md body'>Rejection is part and parcel of life. The person might reject you once, but I believe that if you truly like the person and persist, you might be able to see some light at the end. To me.. I rather be rejected the 1st time, then I put in more efforts.. and hopefully will work out in the end. This would be more challenging and more sweeter. If things come so easily, I might not treasure it as much.<br><br>So naturally, I will not go for someone who is keen on me.. unless I got feeling for the person.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There's always someone for someone in the world, guess the right time has not arrived, that's why we got all the 'he like me i like u but she dun like me' kinda thing.<br><br>However, everything we go through is a valueable lesson, just that some times its a very high price to pay.<br><br>Just wait, and eventually there will be one 'who likes u and u like him/her'.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with Luf, trust me, love is something you have to find for yourself, being deluded into thinking that the one you love loves you back is very painful, I know. Just break it to him, b4 its too late. Life is not THAT short, the right one will come, in time...</div>
