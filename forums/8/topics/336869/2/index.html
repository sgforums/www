              <p>Energy has no color. humans give it color because thats what we see. A tree is not a t-r-e-e. its just what we call it.</p>

              <p>you might not be versed in philosophy. but i am. the whole idea of color has to doÂ with criticisms of empirical knowledge. ideas such as john locke's theories on primary and secondary properties. colors are human creations, secondary properties that are not 'real'</p>

              <p>you might not be versed in philosophy. but i am. the whole idea of color has to doÂ with criticisms of empirical knowledge. ideas such as john locke's theories on primary and secondary properties. colors are human creations, secondary properties that are not 'real'</p>
