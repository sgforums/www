To gain fame &amp; fortune? Maybe make the world a better place? Or perhaps to love?<br><br>In this materialistic society of ours, many of us will probably have to shelve our dreams to eke out a living and fulfill life's numerous responsibilities (filial piety, marriage, parenthood...), and later lament about not having done it in our past when we're old and grey.

            <div class='col-md body'>*sniffs sniffs* Think this question will lead to a religion discussion  :p but oh well, for me, my existence here is to find out why I am here (confusing -sighz-)(this answer is a neutral answer, not from a religious aspect). A tough question that u have put up there, but yet, I think a lot of people are asking the same Qn. Dreams and responsibilities, another tough choice to be made. Sometimes, we need to sacrifice our dreams just to fulfill the responsibilities u stated above.. so, my best advice is .. get a balance outta them. Get some, give some. There is no such thing as you take all and give nothing.. (at least that is for me)<br><br>------------------<br>"When you looked into my eyes, and you said goodbye, could you see my tears?

            <div class='col-md body'>to tell e truth, i agree with rainboy. no religious meaning behind this.  :p *smilez* well, i believe, since we don't know the meaning of life, we have to find out. everyone has different meanings to life....one doesn't need to know e answer overnight.....more often than not, most pple onli realise the true meaning of life when they've lost e chance of grasping hold of it, n making his/her life more meaningful, by living life e way he/she should.<br><br>live the kind of life u wan, and not e kind tt other pple wans. be willing to take risks n do watever u like. don't care bout wat other pple think bout u, juz go ahead n do wat u wan n tink u shud do. after all it's UR life. no one has n can control it except u n u urself. lastly, do not live to regret.......treasure everything tt u have while u still can. do not wait till u've lost it, den realise tt it means e world to u........   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>like wat they always say,"juz my 2 cents worth." :wink:<br><br>[This message has been edited by t|rEd (edited 31 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm another posting. if you search for the meaning of life, make sure you don't spend too much time looking for the answer. A lot of people spent too much time in knowing what it means, why, and for who. And in the end they realised that they live for the ones they love... but yet, it's too late. TReasure your time, cherish all the people around you, your family, your friends, and the closest ones to you, while you are searching for the meaning of your life. And one day, when you feel you have found the answer, you will know how important they are in your life. Just a piece of thoughts from a guy who spent too much time in searching meaning of life, and now is left with a little time to understand that he has found it. Good luck for you all.. for those who are Christians, He will always be with you, For Muslims, Live your life with Qur'an, embrace your life with the Code Allah has set. For Buddhist, Buddha has shown you the paths to real life, ehipassiko! For others and free thinkers, believe in what you have believed, and live your life meaningful.<br><br>------------------<br>"When you looked into my eyes, and you said goodbye, could you see my tears?
