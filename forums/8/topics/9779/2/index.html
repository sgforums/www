            <div class='col-md body'>Had a weird dream.....<br>In this dream, I'm some sorta electrician, and this female classmate of mine had a power failure kinda thing like around 3 am in the morning.<br><br>So there I was, fixing each and every power switch in the building, and so, to test the system, I turned on each and every light in the building.<br><br>Then for some reason, her colleagues scolded me when I turned on some of the lights, saying I shouldn't do that, etc etc. From that part of the dream, I got the impression that the building has areas which are haunted. (Though how office buildings get haunted, is beyond me.....)<br><br>Anyway, my classmate and I walked into this room, and I turned on the lights. Then all of a sudden, the doors closed, and the curtains started attacking me. My classmate ran to a corner of the room, and kept on shouting "Don't like that leh !!! Its not funny !!! Stop it !!!", and I was like, in a panic.....<br><br>In the end, I got pissed, and started shouting things like "Nabei !! Very fun is it ??? Come lah !!! Got guts, one on one !!!" (Though how I'm going to one on one with a ghost is beyond me either.....)<br><br>Then somehow, the ghost appear, and started smiling, and apologizing. So outta interest, I asked him what's keeping him around. Then he says he wants to "help other people". Then I replied, got this kinda reason one ah ??? Then he says yah, then waves, then disappears.<br><br>Then I woke up. Weird dream....... wonder what's the interpretation ?</div>
