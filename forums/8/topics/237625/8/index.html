Of course I not stupid not to convince that chat buddy to report police. I did, but the person still stubborn enough to think that the girl is real and so are her photos. So there's nothing much I can do. Besides the scammer is so rude when you trying to prove she is a fake one, so what else besides scolding him?<br><br>Keep quiet and shut up is not a way to stop crimes like this. We need to inform people of such scams since there are still kind souls in this Earth that think the world is beautiful.<br><br>Bank account number , IP address, phone numbers are still not enough to nab down this scammer lor... They can always get other people to open account for them, get hi-cards for them by means of money and they can go surf internet cafes as well.<br><br>There is another scammer that has been cheating for several years already, still also never get caught at all and her account has been there for so long. It is only recently then the fellow cancelled the account and open a new one.<br><br> hi guys,23f here in need of fast cash.willing to meet u for sex.time will be now.my charges will be $100 for 2 hours. place will be at my house at woodlands.i stay alone. there is 2 rules.1:transfer money to me before meeting.2: condoms a must.Contact number will be given( if u are the choosen one.),i`m 164,47kg,the rules will not be changed.if u dun agree.bye pic at http://pinkladytan.multiply.com/photos/album/1<br><br>I agree that it is silly to let the scammer know of this forum link. but I not the one who did it. I just merely provide what I have of the scammer to brazen, hopefully can help him a bit.<br><br>If people like brazen don't even wish to report to police, then there is nothing we all can do.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>People, I believe the TS has already been punished enough for his gullibility without having everyone condemning him here.... I believe $450 is not a very paltry sum for most if not all of us.<br><br>To brazen: I'm sorry, but I don't believe there's anything you can really do about it. Take it as a lesson learnt, albeit an expensive one.<br><br>And let this be a lesson to us all as well: lend money only to those whom you know and trust well, and even then, only with amounts that you can afford to lose easily.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think you are too stupid to lend money to that girl, you can't get back your money only if you call the police. The police can track the girl from her IP address.There are always some people who like to trick those stupid people, i once got a email from a girl she say she is lonely and ask me to company her, then she give me her MSN so we chat. She ask me to be her bf i was thinking something is wrong we just met a day only she wanted me to be a bf, then after asking her more things she finally say she got a bf and he is flying to london for a business trip and don't know whether he will come back or not so she feel lonely she want to find a bf. but she still can't forget her ex-bf so how can i be with her i was smart to test her out if not i will be trick by her and hurt myself too. There was another time that one day i was walking on street (i forgotten which place) a women came to me and say she just came from china (i can tell she is from china judging from her ascent) and use out her money and her family is sending her money soon so can i borrow her $100 cna give her my contact no and she will call me when she got the money. i didn't believe her and walk her then i hide on a corner and saw that she continue asking other people for money this kind of trick i see to much already.</div>
