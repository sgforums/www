            <div class='col-md body'>i would solemnly recommend everyone not to angst the fraud any longer. don't talk to her just to scold her.<br><br>this is very stupid for 2 minute worth of excitement and in fact will help the criminal by warning that everyone is onto her. you think you very smart, is it? what the hell are you trying to prove?<br><br>now she is very careful and will likely drop this "identity" for another, or simply go underground.<br><br>if you want to help, convince the victims to gather evidence and make a police report. otherwise, shut up and don't do anything. bloody no common sense. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
