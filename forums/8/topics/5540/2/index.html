You should know that I haven't had a bf before. Doesn't really matter. I'm happy having lots of good guy friends around, including you. That doesn't make me less of a woman you know? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">Haha....<br>Life is funny..and different for everyone..some start having bfs or gfs real young...maybe they like to follow the trend. For me, i follow my heart and my feelings. That is most important. Do not care about what others think. It's my life. I'm contented with what I have got even though I haven't been in any relationship.<br>I'm not entirely against any sort of relationships, just that you don't have to 'force' this sort of thing to happen. Let nature takes its course. When u find 'the one', you'll be much happier <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Smile coz there's nothing worth frowning about <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Holy Shit!! Am I the only attached guy replying???<br><br>Yep, I am attached, to a special girl for about 1 year, 4 months and 25 days...but both of us feel as if we've known each other for ages...there are even a lot of times that we do similar things in the day, and at night when we talk on the phone, we find out that the other party also did the same thing!! Damn preternatural till it scares both of us, I can tell you!!<br><br>I would define 'Attached' as in my case...we are already planning to get married. We are very comfortable with each other, she's graduating next June, me one year later.We've even talked about names for our kids and worrying about their education!! If that's not called 'Attached' with a capital A, then I don't know what is. Key word is commitment.<br><br>In my 23 years, I had a lot of chances to 'chase skirts', but I guess I held back because I wanted to be sure that it is love and not just infatuation where I get tired of being with her all the time and then break up causing heartaches to both of us. I guess it's how you actually feel about the other person, then the word 'Attached' becomes clearly defined to you.<br><br>BTW, my girlfriend's 21.<br><br>Cheers...</div>

Hope to see more posts from you soon  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>And congrats to demonsbane, Wish you have an everlasting union  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Generally, I'm pretty happy now as things are unattached without a gf. but its just sometimes on cold nights returning home alone after work that you really do miss having a little companionship with you at that moment.<br><br>Loneliness makes you sucumb easily to such thoughts that you should go find a gf. Morever, being at 22, I guess I have missed out on the chance to experience the kinda sweet love you would have loved to experience when you were say, 16. The kinda carefree and innocent love that was oh so sweet  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The thought of looking for a gf just for the sake of it is shallow I agree, but sometimes, damn! The loneliness is just too much to bear.<br><br>To all those that are unattached, well, I guess we'll all stick it through together.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Why?

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimez, I thinks it's better being a bastard, &amp; not think so much, not so guilt-ridden. Nice guyz finish last, fact of life. It's like we're always taken for granted, we always give other people priority  but are generally unappreciated, such is the nature of man. *bummer* Don't U people say some +ve stuff of its not true, there're appreciative people around, true, but they're few &amp; far between. like, my buddy, waits for a girl for 1 1/2 years, pretends he doesn't care, but he does. How I wish he could just forget her, because I know he doesn't mean so much to her. But I just don't want to spoil his projected perfect image of her. Guess he knows the truth, but still living in his dream. Truth is, few guyz have the self control. I've tried, but as a weak-minded fool, I succumb to temptation, &amp; am now stuck in a relationship because of a drunk foolish night, that I will regret for a long time. The nice guy kicks in again, she's a nice girl, so, I just can't dump her like that, don't want to hurt her. So the point is, either not do anything stupid, or be a bastard, although I think the latter is more fun.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How do u wanna be attached ? Physically, emotionally or mentally ? Love doesn't come at birth and neither do u bring it at death, so wat's the point. Single is not too bad either, it's just a matter of getting use to seeing couples all around when u are alone. Fret not, there are plenty of us around. Being attached doesn't make u all the more happier than ur single days, it cld be more painful sometimes. So enjoy while u can !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As I have said...reality is so shattering disappointing. Hey, Eck, u are 22, and I think u are still much a young dude. Don't really have worry abt it. As they have said, time will come, fate will come also. I know how u feel, I'm not much younger than u, I'm 27. And I think there are a whole bunch of lone souls who are older than us, searching to be an item.<br><br>Yeh right, always told myself, not to worry, if my dream one is worth waiting for, then I wouldn't mind spending my time to wait. However when I saw lovers acting intimately in the public, I just couldn't seem overcome this kind of loneliness...<br><br>been rejected and duped for many times...hurt, but not really going to give up...(no, not me!)<br>Guess 3 reasons that sum up that I'm still unattached:<br>1. looks like a chubby care bear than a charming &amp; dashing prince.<br><br>2. Insensitive like a piece of log?<br><br>3. a lonewolf (ha!)<br><br>However, it's never too late...never always believe in fate....never always believe in whatever crap"let nature takes its course"...If u found her, go get it...<br><br>cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>WAh...so many replies..<br><br>Same as many of the others whom replied, no i hvnt had a "official" stead before, and yeah, there are the times that i really regret and feel damn desperate...<br><br>Recently just turned 19, start to realise more that my own desperate feelings are more a result of teenage hormones, as well as a mixture of a need for a lifelong companion and soulmate...<br><br>Been real close once i think, but nothing came out of it due to plenty of reasons, and at couple of other times i kinda sense the gal would be ok if i actively chased her, though she doesnt really "like" me, personally in retropect, i feel that i AM definetly much better off without starting any of those relationships though for a time i used to feel desperate and cursed myself for not being daring enough...<br><br>Truth is, now i look back on my past and realise that i wasnt emotionally equiped to handle a serious relationship, and neither are pple who go into a relationship at an early age just for the experience...cant rem whoever said this in an earlier post, but i agree with him that i've probably learnt more abt relationships than i might if i had exercised any of the prior options available to me.<br><br>Times when my hormones are dormant seem in much greater supply after i hit 19, and in these times of lucidity, i realise that i do NOT really need a grlfrd now, even it would be nice to find someone whom u could share yr deepest dreams and life aspirations with, suffer woe and experience joy together with, cos we have our FRIENDS, cos minus the physical intimacy, thats what our partners are!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One more for the unattached till now. I'm a bit older than the oldest person who posted in this thread, but believe me, thats not something that I'm proud of.<br><br>No, its not because I'm too picky. Its just that I don't fall for people easily. The once that I did, wah..... head over heels big time. But didn't happen.<br><br>So, I hope this makes someone feel better.
