            <div class='col-md body'>Does age really matter?<br><br>EcK, you are only 22 years old, don't worry. You will have your time.<br><br>How do you define attached? Having a gf/bf just for fun or for serious relationship?<br><br>I am saying this because after 3-4 relationships, I became kind of confuse what attached means. Going steady, hold hands when walking together, kiss, have sex, does it mean that your are attached after doing all the mentioned stuffs (or maybe some of them)?<br><br>Somehow I think that the bond that comes with the "attached" nowadays is getting weaker and weaker. People come people go, commitment seems to be a word that could only be found in dictionary. Yes, you may argue that there are still many couples living happily and ever. But who know what lies behind them? Those are the dark sides you will never see if you are not in his/her shoes. Look at the number of divorse case in Singapore, don't they prove something?<br><br>If attached is to qualify for detached, I would rather choose not to, but who knows, when the right person appear, I might still give it a try. Life is a matter of gambling, right?<br><br>So Eck, don't worry, you will have your time.<br></div>

The third? She hinted me directly, but I flatly rejected her, why? I didn't like her looks. Yes, I know I'm a bastard, I admit I go for looks more than character, and I know I'll soon learn not to do so, but I was young and naive back then ..</div>

Till today, I still feel that we have quite a way to go before we can totally understand each other.<br><br>All I can say is that there is no point being attached if you do not understand her at all and she does not understand you at all.<br><br>Always remember this: nobody is perfect; all of us have certain weaknesses in us.

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess that cos you had so many gals that to a certain extent, the concept of being "attached" has become numb to you. Many a time we go thru life with partners of the opposite sex without really appreciating their qualities, without forming that special bond, where you meet someone that you could just spend all eternity with. Call me a romantic, but I still believe in those old fashioned romances and courtships. However these are incresingly diffcult to ever find, cos of the way our society revolves and evolves. Gone are a lot of old fashioned traditions and here to stay are the modern qualities in which society has so forcefully pushed on us.<br><br>Just years ago, meeting your life partner on the internet was unfathomable but today its become more than a reality.<br><br>So the point is that if you need to be "attached" then you must open yourself up to feel "attached".<br><br>Key word here : "COMMITMENT"<br><br>[This message has been edited by DangerGuy (edited 27 October 1999).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by DangerGuy (edited 27 October 1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, thanks Danger. I've now got an idea what attached is all about.<br><br>It seems like nowadays attached is not all about commitment already. I've had that feeling before some time ago. I must agree and admit, it's ervery hard to find it nowadays but i guess it's just time. It takes two to clap so i think the thinking of commitment is still around just that maybe one is ready but the other isn't.<br><br>I was thinking, it had something to do with trust too. Don't some others think so ?<br><br>Let's all hope everyone can find their commitments and partners commited to them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dunno if its a good thing or bad.....most of my realationship with females have been rather platonic. I usually get close enuff to them for them to confide their deepest secrets, fears and thoughts, and they tell me I have a good listening ear and all. But why always do they always always just wanna stop at friends *sigh*<br><br>The only time I even got a gal to agree to be my gf, was one I met on the IRC. But the bloody thing lasted only a week. Which is why at times, I'm quite skeptical about internet relationships.<br><br>_________________________<br>If not me, then who else?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br>Well you can count me into the "I've not had a SO for all these XX years of my life" crowd. But hell, being single has meant a lot to me. Here's a bit of personal stuff for you all since i'm (generally) anonymous and all that (forget about blackmail  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">). I'd go as far as to say that i've fallen for someone... that was way back in 1994. Yeah, waaaaay back. She's a good friend of mine, but I haven't had so much as the chance to get a date with her shadow, if you know what I mean. She's attached, and for that reason, I don't dare breathe a word about how I feel - it would only bring her trouble.<br><br>But hey, I know there's a good side to all that. Far from being skeptical about relationships and "that thang called <span style="font-style: italic;">love</span>" I think i've learnt more about it these 5 years than I probably would have with a 1000 girlfriends. I'm a really dismissive and jovial guy and I know that nothing will keep me sad for more than a week because I never let it, except for this. I guess it's the balance that I need to keep me from going over the edge from excessive happiness  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">. The tear in my eye, the thorn in my heart and the glass at my feet. It's that precious bit of suffering that God's given to me so I can grow, much more than if i'd enjoyed life.<br><br>But most of all, it's a hope, and that's what I live for. Maybe nothing will turn out like what I have in mind, but there WILL be a happy ending. So until the day that hope dies, I'm still looking forward to a happy ending.<br><br>And so should all of you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Love never fails."</span><br><strong>Grail</strong><br></div>
