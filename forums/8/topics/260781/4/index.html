Psychology is a rather tough course to get in. If you do go JC, your General Paper grade has to be at least B4, minimum. But for a safe bet, A1. Is your english good?<br><br>For psychology, out of the whole cohort, only some get Honours. Only honour students can do Masters. THEN, you can practice psychology. Unless you don't plan to be a psychologist per se, but use your degree for another occupation.<br><br>I have a friend who's going on scholarship from MOE to study Psychology in University of Manchester. She took Lit, Econs, History, and Maths. AAAB + A1 for GP.  Her friend got AABB. He's also going on scholarship to UK to study psych. Bond is 6 years. For 3 years study. However, their masters will prob be sponsered too, cos you need a Masters in order to practice.<br><br>That said, if you get a grade like that, you can actually try for law. =P<br><br>I'll be honest. 14 points is not fantastic. It's L1R5, right? HOWEVER, you can still do it if you study hard for your A's. Go to a good arts JC that is with a higher entry score, like CJC. Their arts, is power! What performing arts are you in?</div>

Dun be like me, dragon year oso die die must choose JC now cant enter uni cuz too many people includin the poly one oso rush in.<br><br>But tell you the truth, if you get above 16 for L1R5 dun go JC unless you got enough bonus points to deduct from your L1R5 that enables you to get into better JCs.<br><br>JC can go Uni, poly also can go uni, poly got advance standing some more, and even if you did not manage to enter uni once you obtain your diploma you still have your diploma cert and its more useful in the workforce that an A levels cert. And when you get a job, you can earn the money you need for you universities and try again while working.<br><br>A levels is die die must go university one. And if you dont, you will have to go overseas or private university. Worst come to worse you might have to go take up a diploma course which you have given up taking years ago. If you are not an academic person, you should go poly.  You should only go Junior College only if you are certain you will be able get good results and only if you know your general knowledge and English is good.<br><br>Even if you get all As but you fail your General Paper, you're done for. No need to go university le. While you can choose your subjects in Poly, choose your subjects there. When you go to the university, unless you are one of the top students, the university literally chooses your course for you instead of you choosing the course of oyur choice. Just like the girl who got all 4As and even Distinction for 2 of her 'S' papers for her subjects and C5 for gp(an average grade) she couldnt get into her dream course of Law, neither could she get into Medicine.  Another girl got AAB(Very good result) couldnt even get into accountancy, and she only got her 5th choice out of 8 choices in her choices... She could go UK and do law, but banks wont allow her to borrow money... See? It depends whether you are lucky or not to get the choices you want. You might not get into the course you want.</div>
