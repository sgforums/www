At the end of the day, at least you'll hold a paper of 'power'.<br><br>Besides, you can't be very sure psychology is your 'calling' at this point of time, right?

            <div class='col-md body'>I think u shld go poly<br>Firstly, if u embark on the jc route, u haf to make damn sure that ur a lvl result is gd enough to secure u a place in university and in the psychology course<br>however if u a lvl result is not gd enough, u dun haf any qualification to back u up alrdy<br><br>On the other hand, there is a new psychology course introduced juz last year at ngee ann poly. U may choose to take up diploma course there. And i guess wif a psy diploma it shld be easier for u if u wanna go to uni and take up the same course. even if u can't, u still haf a psy dip.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So it all depends on what course you want to pursue. If you want to pursue arts related courses, no use going to JC... go poly and head to uni from there. But if you want to pursue Science related courses like Law or Medicine, Business or whatever, its better  to enter JC and get a really good result.<br><br>If you arent sure of what you want to take up as a career, then go JC and think it over while cheonging on your subjects to get a good result. Then after that you will have plenty of time to think about what you want to take up. Even if you cant get into university you still can get into a diploma course from there. Unless you want to waste the two years and get a poor result, you better cheong if you enter JC. JC is not for slacking people who are not geniouses. Not like JC where an average grade can get you into a JC(not the best lah) university do not accept average grade students. If you are average, you are subjected to be "chosen" by the courses instead of you choosing what you want to study, as i have mentioned earlier. You have to get straight As if you want to enter the course of your choice, if not you'll be subjected to availability. Even if you get straight A's and even have distinction in S papers and outstanding CCA and Community service results, and a B4 in GP, and didnt pass the interview, (If you want courses like law and medicine) you're out of the game... But if you want to enter psychology, its best you choose the course you're best at in JC and get good grades for your gp as well and you have quite a high chance in entering that if you go poly.</div>
