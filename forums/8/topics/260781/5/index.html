Dun be like me, dragon year oso die die must choose JC now cant enter uni cuz too many people includin the poly one oso rush in.<br><br>But tell you the truth, if you get above 16 for L1R5 dun go JC unless you got enough bonus points to deduct from your L1R5 that enables you to get into better JCs.<br><br>JC can go Uni, poly also can go uni, poly got advance standing some more, and even if you did not manage to enter uni once you obtain your diploma you still have your diploma cert and its more useful in the workforce that an A levels cert. And when you get a job, you can earn the money you need for you universities and try again while working.<br><br>A levels is die die must go university one. And if you dont, you will have to go overseas or private university. Worst come to worse you might have to go take up a diploma course which you have given up taking years ago. If you are not an academic person, you should go poly.  You should only go Junior College only if you are certain you will be able get good results and only if you know your general knowledge and English is good.<br><br>Even if you get all As but you fail your General Paper, you're done for. No need to go university le. While you can choose your subjects in Poly, choose your subjects there. When you go to the university, unless you are one of the top students, the university literally chooses your course for you instead of you choosing the course of oyur choice. Just like the girl who got all 4As and even Distinction for 2 of her 'S' papers for her subjects and C5 for gp(an average grade) she couldnt get into her dream course of Law, neither could she get into Medicine.  Another girl got AAB(Very good result) couldnt even get into accountancy, and she only got her 5th choice out of 8 choices in her choices... She could go UK and do law, but banks wont allow her to borrow money... See? It depends whether you are lucky or not to get the choices you want. You might not get into the course you want.</div></blockquote>My friend got AABB B4 for GP, no S papers, got into this year medicine  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  i think its partly also because she attached herself to a hospital in the months after A's.<br><br>I heard there's a student who got BBC, got into law, because during the hols she has attached herself to every major law firm in SG, including Lee and Lee.</div>

And when you get a job, you can earn the money you need for you universities and try again while working.<br><br>A levels is die die must go university one. And if you dont, you will have to go overseas or private university. Worst come to worse you might have to go take up a diploma course which you have given up taking years ago. If you are not an academic person, you should go poly.  You should only go Junior College only if you are certain you will be able get good results and only if you know your general knowledge and English is good.<br><br>Even if you get all As but you fail your General Paper, you're done for. No need to go university le. While you can choose your subjects in Poly, choose your subjects there. When you go to the university, unless you are one of the top students, the university literally chooses your course for you instead of you choosing the course of oyur choice. Just like the girl who got all 4As and even Distinction for 2 of her 'S' papers for her subjects and C5 for gp(an average grade) she couldnt get into her dream course of Law, neither could she get into Medicine.  Another girl got AAB(Very good result) couldnt even get into accountancy, and she only got her 5th choice out of 8 choices in her choices... She could go UK and do law, but banks wont allow her to borrow money... See? It depends whether you are lucky or not to get the choices you want. You might not get into the course you want.</div></blockquote>To get into law, not only must you get As &amp; Bs but GP min. must be B3.<br>Medicine is equally tough- someone I know got straight As &amp; "S' papers but Chinese got C6 also cannot get in.<br>Even in poly- some popular courses like Business. Life Sc, Sports Sc. got high entry points. One of my frens cannot get in, end up doing Computing.<br>Whether jc or poly- nowadays very competitive &amp; also a lot of places taken up by  foreigners!</div>

What performing arts are you in?<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>im in choir, sounds not that impressive huh...<br><br></div></blockquote>Regarding GP, let me put it this way, to get into NUS FASS they see your A level sub grades, but to see which course you go into, they see your GP and (if have) interview. First year in nus fass you take common subjects with everybody else in NUS. 2nd year on then you specialise, so even if you dont do too well at A levels, but do fantastic in 1st year, you may still get in psychology.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Regarding the degrees,<br><br>Bachelor Degree is the most basic degree you take in uni. For psych, it's 3 years. If you get a Bachelor Degree with HONOURS, you can study an extra year to get your Masters. For other subjects like sciences, etc, if you dont get honours you can still do Masters but only after 2 years working experience. However, for psych, you HAVE to get honours in order to do your Masters. They don't accept people without honours.<br><br>To be a practicing psychologist, you need Masters. So, if you want to practice, you have to get honours. However, if you plan to use the psych degree to go into another occupation, like doing business, or human resource, etc, then of course don't need larh. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Choir is okay.. CCA grades and "impressiveness" depends on what competitions you took part in, etc. Have you taken part in many? To get into competitive degrees like Psych, Medicine, Law, etc.. you have to be all-rounded.<br><br>Think of it this way, if I'm the interviewer, this student comes to me with AAA , no CCA, another is AAB, with outstanding CCA record like winning at nationals, or going overseas for community service, etc. Who do you think the interviewer will pick? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
