              <p>I find it puzzling as to how it could have happened.</p>
              <p>According to the press, he had stopped his car behind the 2 vehicles which were involved in the accident and was thought to be walking from lane no. 2 of the expressway, to check on the passengers who were already on the road shoulder.</p>
              <p>You would think that almost immediately after the accident plus the time taken for the passengers of the bus to walk across to the road shoulder, that a jam would have formed and traffic would be passing by slowly on lanes 1, 3 &amp; 4 of the expressway. How is it possible then, for the taxi to be able to travel at such fast speed on lane 3, knocking him off 20 metres away.</p>
              <p>I sure hope he recovers soon.</p>

              <p>Karma does not relate to possible helping, but never got to help because his life was cut short by a car accident.  It usually means something deeper and deeds done prior to any such ending of a life.</p>
              <p>Fate might be the better word.</p>
              <p>Motorcyclists, being on the street day in day out.  Feels the danger better then anyone else that has never used their skin to wrap around a metal tank.  We might also tend to feel that life is more fleeting then most.</p>
              <p>So yes.  Do cherish your life and other peoples.  Do not drive/speed recklessly in your car and do consider that there is others besides you that will be more happier if you treat them nice.</p>

              <p>I think he made the wrong move; if he want to help, he should just stopped on the road shoulder and not on the road.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By doing so, he is also creating road hazards for other drivers behind him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes the expressway is fast and dangerous. But since he got out from the driver's side, he should be able to see the traffic behind him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Which made me wonder why he chose to cross the road... Did he NOT see the taxi??? As a fellow driver, he should know crossing the road in expressway is a no no and he still do it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And now, he is in this stake, he cant really blame anyone but himself. Yes he might be trying to help, but he made the wrong move.</p>
