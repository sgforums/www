He lost his way after his colleague dropped him off in a cab in Zion Road, near his Kim Seng Walk apartment.<br><br>Yesterday, his lawyer, Ms Julia Yeo, said her client had an unblemished record and was of good character.<br><br>He had turned the Singapore branch of his company around, taking it from a $1.75 million loss-making venture in 1999 to a $1 million profit-making one last year.<br><br>She said Miyakoshi would lose his job and would have to return home in disgrace if he was jailed.<br><br>Chief Justice Yong said two weeks was a 'very low' sentence, but mused if Miyakoshi knew what he was doing.<br><br>'He was dead drunk,' he said, to which the deputy public prosecutor said that that could not be an excuse.<br><br>Chief Justice Yong then added: 'He didn't know what he was doing.'<br><br>He allowed the appeal and imposed the maximum fine.[/url]</div>
