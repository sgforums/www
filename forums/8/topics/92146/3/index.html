            <div class='col-md body'>Definitely when I was way wee younger.  But I started hating asking myself these two friggin' words 'What if...?'  Because one 'what if' leads to two, and then four, and then eight.  I got better things to do than ask those questions, mate.  Humans hate rejection (or public speaking to be more exact) more than death.  That would imply that if you were at a funeral, you'd rather be in the casket than be giving the eulogy (ref: Jerry Seinfeld).<br><br>But on the side, I did take action with one woman and it did work out.  Cool aye?  Nope.  I regretted it 'cause after we got together, she became a freakin' psycho!  Mental!  I'm talkin' biaaaaaaatch crazy!<br><br>Bring it on!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yea. It would be much better to tell her, then get rejected, then to leave it hanging.<br><br>For me i can't stand having an issue unresolved, especially when it comes to affairs of the heart, which affects me like dengue fever.<br><br>Maybe i should quote ... "Its much better to have done something and let her know, then not to do anything and regret everyday!"<br><br>Which reminds me of .. "Its better to have love and lost, than not to have loved at all~"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Pri 6<br>I was propably too young and I know that guy comes from rich family and never liked me, plus he openly make it known he liked another girl but he change subject of admiration every half year. So why make like despo and shame myself. He asked me to make her jewellery. I flat refuse but that's the least I could do.<br><br>Sec 1-2<br>Well, we had eyes for each other but then he already had a girl and she's the girl guides assistant lead and she has the ability to make my life difficult in the group. So I siam. No point getting myself in bad situation over some guy. But I had fun in guides and later was the quarter mistress and drill commander. I am good at starting fires and cooking stuff...<br><br>Sec 4<br>Transfer school. Had this class mate who was like me, had a parent/relative as school employee and have every teacher treat you funny. But I know its just that we take comfort in that knowledge and understanding of our common situation and I appreciate that he treats me kindly as he would other girls. But know that it can never be. Left it at that. Never tot much about it except that wonder if he fulfilled his dream. He wanted to be a lawyer.<br><br>JC<br>Full of jerks. I took my revenge on them years later. Of course by then they could not recognise me... That's the biggest irony of all.<br><br>NUS<br>Even more full of Jerks and this time they are immature nerds (think Stepford) who play too much violent computer games (back then its wolfenstein, rott). No one worth any attention. The guys are so eager to have a free ride on your project group or afraid you free ride on them. Most are quite shallow and childish. Most fail to qualify (Pes E) for real NS and 90% are admin clerks in NS. Guys at this time only go for the females who are just boobs and airheads and they would volunteer time to personally tutor them. Of course some of these girls are also into causal relationships and also would not mind becoming some escot for $ just to be driven around and such. But it got really messy, very oriented towards getting material stuff or that special advantage over other girls.. like some compeition. Call me a romantic but I do not like to participate in transactions where I have to sell myself in any manner or cheapen myself just for shallow things. I think my year was particularly bad cause i see the new batch was much better people.<br><br>Work work work.<br>That's then I had my revenge<br>That's when some malay guy also wanted to date me<br>That's also when I realise I have this appeal to Indian guys<br>That's when I also learn some guys like to depend on women and use them<br>That's when I met perverts and sickos who openly ask to have a casual relationship with them when they are obviously already married/dating/whatever<br>That's also when some Kuniang guy could not make up his mind and drop me and now he's had a string of failed relationships... Thank God I was not a statistic!<br>That's also when I ventured out of my line and meet people outside and that's the best thing anyone can do for themselves.<br><br>People are funny. But always most important is to make more friends and meet more people.<br><br></div>
