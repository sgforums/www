            <div class='col-md body'>I think I know what you're talking about. This rock thing in Singapore... it's not so strong to the extent you call it a culture. I believe it's just portion of them and it would be the same group of people participating everytime if there are gigs or competitions etc.<br><br>Some are probably driven by passion while some likes the attention. I've heard people saying they feel very shiok on stage... haha. Maybe that's what keeps them going.<br><br>During the Singapore Street Festival, there were some bands covering JRock like Dir en Grey, X Japan, L'arc~en~ciel, Glay, Due le Quartz and sometimes doing originals. Sylvester Sim was from a band (L'zefier) which did a bit of L'arc~en~ciel. I think they have a website. Can email them or something regarding ur questions.<br><br>There are other bands too which are pretty good, like LGF - they do originals - (http://lgf.loversoul.com/)..... and many more but I don't know if they have websites. If you're free u can go to Esplanade during weekends and maybe interview some of the bands there or something. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think like what someone posted there is a difference between rock and metal. How to do classification? Based on music they played? AFAIK there are a thriving local rock scene going on be it Chinese or English songs they played. I admire a local chinese rock band called Luan4 Tang3. Cool.<br><br>Last time Big-O magazine organise the competition and when buy magazine get a free CD of sampling of their songs. I do admire them (bands) but it tend to be meshing soft rock with rock with metal  into an album. Read the album sleeves you can contact those band members using mail postage. Tat time no email adress <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> Address like Bishan, Bukit Batok etc sounds so singaporeanish.<br><br>I believe most of them are now old liao since I now also quite old. Wonder if they still pursue those passion they used to have in their teens?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Any comment about this issue would be greatly appreciated.</div></blockquote>Actually rock music has been very popular in Singapore since the days of Jimi Hendrix, Rolling Stone and Led Zepplin etc. The reason why this rock movement is getting more noticable is because of our goverment's effort to create more outdoors venue for band performances. in the old days, the only public live preformance in Singapore is the Hungry Ghost Gei Tai. While today, we have Youth Park, Substation, Esplanade, and many music festival.<br><br>Beside that, music (MP3) and musical instrument are just getting cheaper these days and to learn to play music, it is as easy and cheap as buying an instrument and download materials from the internet.<br><br>Why kids like rock? Because Rock is always associate with being Rebellious, and it has a very cool image amoung teenager.<br><br>Minus the image thingy, music is universal langauage which help to bring people from of all colors, race and religion together.<br><br>Honestly speaking, there might be more band competition these days, but I would say that the quality of the bands are much better in the old days. You dont get to find many 3 chords music in the 70s and 80s right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
