            <div class='col-md body'>Well lord nuclear, in all frankness, i could only suggest that you should really think hard and decide what you want to do now that you realise that your peers are way ahead of you in building a life for themselves.<br><br>Would you want to take the same paths that they have chosen ? A diploma course ? A career with cisco or the army ? Is the path that you have taken something that you believe that is worth all the trouble and worth your energy ? Would you become a stronger, smarter and more experienced person out of this ?<br><br>I was preparing to plan out for my life, ever since i went into a polytechnic course i didn't like. And i even decided that even if i failed my course (Use your 'O' levels as a stepping stone) , i would use my 'O' levels as a stepping stone and build my life from there and perhaps go back to poly to take another course i want.<br><br>The good thing is that i graduated from my course and i am now destressing myself and enjoying the small beautiful details of life.<br><br>Lord nuclear, i hope that you would find your own inspiration to build your life and make good of all the experiences that you had and will come across. Remember as long as you live and breathe, you would always stand a chance.</div>
