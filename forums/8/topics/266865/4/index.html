We can have money forever by using our brain but what can a china gal do? Sell her body until 80 years old....ha....when they are old they are expire. There are hated word written to me because they are from China. I don't blame them, is not easy to be born in a dirty country and hold a dirty nationalilty. They are dieing to be married to singapore and be singaporean. Why?   because they despised themselves too. Too many cases...... I am quiting sgforum.
