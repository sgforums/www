              <p>Hi, I'm currently taking a Diploma in Banking &amp; Finance. Like I mentioned in the title, I wish to become a private banker as i enjoy seeing people's networth grow due to the help they recieve from me. And also the job pays very well.</p>
              <p>My question is, is an accounting certification important to become a private banker? Everytime i read the papers I look at the qualification requirements, most of the time banks prefer a degree in accounting or ACCA or a relevant degree. I find accounting rather boring and I do not wish have a degree in accountancy. Would having a Degree in Banking &amp; Finance offered by UOL also enable me to become a private banker?</p>
              <p>Or put it in another way, what qualifications should i have to become a private banker.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thx</p>

              <p>My GPA not really fantastic, 3.2 only. Final year student le, it can't really go much higher than the current 3.2. Poly students getting into local uni is not easy. Prefer UOL over RMIT for SimGe as it is more recognised.</p>
              <p>Just wondering if i keep doing my degree and masters all in banking &amp; finance, will i be able to become a private banker?</p>

              <p>With a GOOD poly dip, u can be selected to do MBA Fin with one of the private centres eg Kaplan or MDIS.</p>
              <p>Otherwise sign up with IBF for their double Diploma courses (Bkg/Finance) &amp; (Investments). With these added dips, u can do any Finance Masters</p>

              <p>a first good and well recognized degree in banking/ finance is preferred than jumping straight to Masters.</p>
              <p>if u can't make it thru NUS or NTU, UOL could be the next best alternative but not necessarily so subject to the demands of the financial market. If u look good and possess a so-so commercial aust degree, u may get in as pte banker where a lot rests on your people skills than an analyst role that stresses a lot more on research and financial analytical skills - preferably a CFA. </p>

              <p>Oh i see. Thanks. I am more towards wealth management, wealth advisory, relationship management that line since i prefer interacting with people. I don't really like to do analysis etc.</p>
              <p>Any tips to improve on networking? I can only think of being a corporate banker, then slowly move up towards private banking as i know more and more high net worth people.</p>

              <p>I was thinking the same, not balancing their books which is why I was puzzled why banks always put in newspaper degree in accountancy or ACCA or equivalent. I doubt any bank would find a local diploma qualification sufficient though. Diploma is only touch and go. You need a degree to study more in depth i think</p>

              <p>when you say private banker do you mean relationship manager?</p>
              <p>RMs are personal bankers to clients and get a commission when the client puts money/uses the banks services/invests (ie. forex, derivatives, stocks, etc) on top of his basic pay</p>
              <p>i heard many RMs start from an entry position (somehow many start in citibank) and work their way up.</p>
              <p>their breakthrough is when they get some valuable high net worth clients then they just tend to their clients whims and needs and its smooth sailing from then on.</p>
              <p>the term banker is too ambiguous nowadays. anybody working in a bank as a call center support staff can label himself a banker, technically speaking.</p>

              <p>A degree is necessary in the entry level to a good banking career only when you're looking at positions like systems analysts, investment analysts, admin, customer service, call centre etc.</p>
              <p>If you want to do sales, then a dip would suffice for a start. Network or not is secondary because the bank will train you and give you the leads. Some of these leads can be pretty good depending on your drive and performance.</p>
