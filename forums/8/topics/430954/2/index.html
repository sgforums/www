              <p>Hi, from what i understand from my friends, it is best not to start as an assistant to a RM or private banker.. becos you will only be doing admin stuff and not the real job of a private banker. and you will have to wait until your boss (private banker) to retire to takeover his portfolio.  i would suggest you get another position in the bank (maybe corporate banking side?) to get a few years of experience and to build up your social network before changing to  private banking..</p>
              <p>education wise, i dont think you need a masters, just a good degree in banking &amp; finance would be good enough to get you hired in a bank first.. (preferably from a reputable university)</p>

              <p>general deg will suffice. usually u can't just join any institution to be a private banker. usually join as financial consultant or RM. If u can show a very good record, then some banks will ask u to head the branch sales, or u can request to go into premier or private banking.</p>
              <p>another route is a deg in finance/banking. join the private banking sector as an assistant to private bankers. from there see if there are opportunities.</p>
              <p>Usually bankers dun stay with a bank for long. once they get the track record, they "jump" to other banks and or finance companies.</p>
              <p>and yes, bankers earn alot. networking is key.</p>

You need some connection to get in as long as you are not from the local uni.  Actually i dun get it why people cares so much abt whether UOL more recognise than RMIT. coz in the end. people just lump the 2 foreign school as SIM. Furthermore, most RMIT students have working experiences given their part time status. So is it your UOL cert sure get better pay (with no Working experiences) or RMIT Cert (with working experience) Get better pay?

              <p>To be practising financial banker/consultants, you must have clear a certain range of CMFAS papers under the authority of MAS. Having a diploma should be sufficient to qualify for the exams. Even you have a MBA, w/o this certification you are not allowed to trade (correct me if I am wrong)</p>
              <p>A banker needs alot of network, connections to cross sell &amp; advise. Market is very competitive. Many enter but only a handful made it. It is a stressful lifestyle. Can you wake up 3am in the midst of your sleep to handle a nuisance call from one of your client? Will you do grocery shopping to provide the extra mile for your clients? These are not jokes but true events that I had seen from my peers. No rest/off, even on MC to hv to be on call. many a time, it is always the fairer sex that made it.</p>
              <p>You hv to be the top 5% in sales to survive becoz in event of any layoff, sales personnel (ie banker) are the first to go. The training is tough. For ex, UOB personnel banker training has a few stages and at each stage many were chopped off. Even if you are a degree/MBA holder, as long as u do not generate sales regular, offyou go.</p>

              <p>Yes. You need some connection to get in as long as you are
              not from the local uni.  Actually i dun get it why people
              cares so much abt whether UOL more recognise than RMIT. coz in the
              end. people just lump the 2 foreign school as SIM.
              Furthermore, most RMIT students have working experiences
              given their part time status. So is it your UOL cert sure get
              better pay (with no Working experiences) or RMIT Cert (with
              working experience) Get better pay? I dont see any differences as
              it is very much depending on your own ability.</p>

              <p>Both UOL &amp; RMIT offer part time degree through SIM Global education. UOL are more preferred as they are 100% exam based degree. RMIT degree is 50% project 50% exams. I plan to work full time and take night classes after NS. </p>

              <p>To be practising financial banker/consultants, you must have
              clear a certain range of CMFAS papers under the authority of MAS.
              Having a diploma should be sufficient to qualify for the exams.
              Even you have a MBA, w/o this certification you are not allowed to
              trade (correct me if I am wrong)</p>
              <p>A banker needs alot of network, connections to cross sell &amp;
              advise. Market is very competitive. Many enter but only a handful
              made it. It is a stressful lifestyle. Can you wake up 3am in the
              midst of your sleep to handle a nuisance call from one of your
              client? Will you do grocery shopping to provide the extra mile for
              your clients? These are not jokes but true events that I had seen

              <p>Hi, I'm currently taking a Diploma in Banking &amp; Finance.
              Like I mentioned in the title, I wish to become a private banker as
              i enjoy seeing people's networth grow due to the help they recieve
              from me. And also the job pays very well.</p>
              <p>My question is, is an accounting certification important to
              become a private banker? Everytime i read the papers I look at the
              qualification requirements, most of the time banks prefer a degree
              in accounting or ACCA or a relevant degree. I find accounting
              rather boring and I do not wish have a degree in accountancy. Would
              having a Degree in Banking &amp; Finance offered by UOL also enable
              me to become a private banker?</p>
              <p>Or put it in another way, what qualifications should i have to
              become a private banker.</p>

              <p>I always look at job titles with a little apprehension.  It is best to know the job description.  I did not mention personal banker, only private banker.</p>
              <p>However, if you borrow money from me, I am your personal banker.  If you don't pay back I will certainly be very personal with you.</p>
