So tht would mean that pata would actually be the lead guitarist, but most of the attention would be on hide... for obvious reasons. hmmm... wonder how pata felt? but i do agree that hide was definitely better than curt cobain... he was really a musical influence. His solo songs have so much variety, not to mention his english albums with ZILCH. Anyone who disses hide is dissing a genius... and should be killed violently for blasphemy.</div>
