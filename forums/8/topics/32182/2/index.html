Have you seen anyone who play the drums like Yoshiki? This guy is a true musical genious.<br>They dun look homo. In music, all that counts is talent and the passion for music and X JAPAN has lots of it, more than lots of British bands who are obviously overrated such as Beatles, Oasis and Queen. U still have a lot to learn, boy.<br><br>U think Van Halen and Black Sabbath are noise band?? My ass!  They are legends!<br><br>Lastly, I feel that both british and american musicians has its own fair share of gem and garbage.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin are the great great grandfathers of heavy metal and their musical style has influenced numerous number of heavy rock/metal bands around the world. I think X'Japan is no exception. After having a chance to listen to one of their song by our sgforums DJ, I conclude their music are heavily influenced by the US. Just like HK bands like Beyond and I do not deny the true fact.<br><br>If you think a lot of people will come to the funeral of the death of a band member, same too to Beyond Wang Jia Ju when he died. In fact a lot of heavy rock/metal band members died have great number of people mourning the death of a great musician.<br><br>English Pop wise I think Beatles is invincible in this aspect.
