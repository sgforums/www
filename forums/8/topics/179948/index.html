            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes I think the government are just replying for the sake of replying.<br><br>This isn't the first time they reply but not really replying sincerely, look at what the person wrote Feb 20, and look at the reply below on Feb 25,<br><br><strong>SINCE the beginning of the year, the Government has organised various mock terror attacks to gauge and improve Singapore's readiness to cope with such catastrophes.<br><br>However, as a senior security supervisor on a worksite in the western part of Singapore, my experience when a bomb was discovered on our worksite makes me wonder if we are ready to face the threat of terrorism.<br><br>Last Thursday, at about 4.30pm, a bomb (probably a World War II relic) was discovered on our worksite. The police were notified five minutes later and a corporal from Queenstown Police Station arrived on the scene. It was more than 45 minutes later, at 5.18pm, that an officer from police explosives team confirmed it was a bomb. By then, the area had been cordoned off.<br><br>At 6.25pm, a police assistant superintendent, who was the investigating officer, arrived but there was still no sign of the bomb disposal unit. At 7.45pm, a lone second lieutenant from the unit arrived but was unable to remove or dispose of the bomb.<br><br>Finally, at about 8pm, a unit from the explosives ordnance department arrived. At 8.18pm, a search dog was brought to locate other possible bombs. Only at 9pm was the bomb safely removed from the scene.<br><br>I am disappointed by the slow response time of the bomb disposal unit. Why did it take them nearly three hours to arrive after the bomb was confirmed at 5.18pm? What if the bomb had exploded in those three hours?<br><br>I understand the bomb disposal unit needs to follow certain standard operating procedures but does it really need to take three hours?<br><br>It is fortunate the bomb was found at the edge of the worksite. Had it been on the worksite itself, it would not only have posed a greater risk to workers but also have resulted in considerable economic loss because of the time the bomb disposal unit took to arrive.<br><br>If we are so slow to act on a single bomb threat, how can we cope with a terror attack on even the smallest scale?<br><br>I hope this is an isolated incident that does not reflect on the overall operational readiness of the bomb disposal unit.<br><br>Neo Poh Goon</strong><br><br><strong>WE REFER to Mr Neo Poh Goon's letter 'Bomb squad slow to respond to threat' (ST, Feb 20).<br><br>We would like to assure him that the Singapore Armed Forces and the Police treat all cases of explosives and ordnance seriously and we work closely to deal with them.<br><br>When the Police receive a call on suspected explosive devices, our officers will be dispatched immediately to the site to ensure public safety by throwing a cordon around the object and order an evacuation, if necessary.<br><br>The officers will inform SAF's Explosives and Ordnance Disposal unit to dispose of the item after identifying the object.<br><br>There are different levels of responses in such cases depending on the risk level.<br><br>In this case, if the threat to public safety was high, the team would have been activated immediately. But the object was a World War II three-inch round which did not contain any high explosives.<br><br>The SAF's teams are well-organised to react to contingencies. Such an approach is necessary at a time when there is a heightened threat of terrorist attacks.<br><br>We want to assure the public that both the SAF and Police are well-prepared and committed to ensuring their safety at all times.<br><br>Col Benedict Lim<br>Director, Public Affairs<br>Ministry of Defence<br><br>Audrey Ang<br>Assistant Director, Media Relations<br>Singapore Police Force</strong></div>

When the police receive a call of suspected explosive devices, our officers will be immediately dispatched to the site to ensure public safety by throwing a cordon around the object and if necessary, conduct evacuation. The officers, after identifying the ordnance, will inform SAF's Explosives and Ordnance Disposal (EOD) unit to dispose of the item.<br><br>There are different levels of response in such situations depending on the assessed level of risk. In this case, had it been determined that the threat to public safety was high, the EOD team would have been activated immediately. However, it was determined that the object was a World War II three-inch round which did not contain any high explosives. The SAF's EOD teams are organised such that they can react to a range of contingencies, including concurrent threat situations. Such tiered capabilities are necessary in the present climate of a heightened threat of terrorist attacks. We thank Mr Neo for his feedback and want to assure the public that both the SAF and the police are well prepared and committed to ensuring their safety at all times.<br><br>Col Benedict Lim,Director Public Affairs,Ministry of Defence, and Ms Audrey Ang, Assistant Director Media Relations,Singapore Police Force</div>

Singapore Post should not use the renovation of their facilities as an excuse to increase the rent.<br><br>When my staff asked the post office why the sudden increase in the rent, the reply was that it was to give us better service. What sort of better service?<br><br>Anyone who rents a post office box knows that it is just to receive mail. There is no attendant to service us at the mail boxes. Besides, the space at the newly-renovated Serangoon Central Post Office boxes is cramped compared with the pre-renovation facility.<br><br>To add insult to injury, the post office stated in its letter that if we did not wish to renew it, just inform it by letter.<br><br>Singapore Post should value the fact that it has a monopoly over our mail services, so it should try to give customers value for money in its services and not hold customers hostage by increasing charges arbitrarily.<br><br>You can be sure I will switch my mail service to another if there is an alternative. Frankly, I miss the old government-run post office services. Though they were not sophisticated, I was satisfied with their services.<br><br>Lin Zen Wen </strong><br><br><strong>SingPost boxes' rent based on location<br><br>I REFER to 'Why sharp rise in rent for post boxes' by Mr Lin Zen Wen (ST, March 3).<br><br>Despite the increasing costs to provide this service, SingPost has not revised the rental rates for the last five years. Before the impending revision, subscribers were charged a flat rate based on two categories, namely CBD/HDB town centres and other areas.<br><br>In this revision, we addressed this pricing anomaly to reflect better the cost of offering this service, restructuring the rental rates according to demand and usage (individual or corporate). Corporate subscribers pay an additional $50 per year.<br><br>Mr Lin used to pay $126 per year before the revision and not $95 as he stated. To help our subscribers, we have offered those who renew their rentals for longer periods discounts of up to 15 per cent.<br><br>Subscribers may review the location of their boxes and consider applying for those in lower demand areas where rentals are lower. They can call SingPost at 68456224/5/6 to seek assistance.<br><br>Tay Poh Choo<br>Vice-President (Corporate Communications &amp; Customer Service)<br>Singapore Post </strong></div>
