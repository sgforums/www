That's what we did in the Bahamas," executive development director Ian Douglas told reporters after picking up the documents.<br><br>"We turned around occupancy rates, we brought tourists to the Bahamas and that's what we like to try and do for Singapore as well."<br><br>The tourism board said the Sentosa integrated resort, of which the casino will be a part, will occupy 49 hectares (121 acres) to provide some 343,000 square metres (3.69 million square feet) of gross floor area.<br><br>"It will be a world-class tropical resort that offers the whole family a fun and memorable leisure experience," the board said in a statement.<br><br>Apart from the casino, it will include hotels, spas, dining and retail outlets and corporate meeting facilities.<br><br>US casino developer Eighth Wonder, which is teaming up with high-end hotel operator Starwood for the project, also expects to invest more than one billion US dollars if its wins the licence. It will be the company's first outing in Southeast Asia.<br><br>"We are here to make a major commitment in Singapore and our plan is to be here and use this as probably our home base," Eighth Wonder chairman Mark Advent told reporters.<br><br>Harrah's Entertainment, which has tabled a bid with local outfit Keppel Land for the Marina Bay project, has also indicated interest for the Sentosa site with the same partner.<br><br>Singapore last year lifted a ban on casino gambling in a bid to spruce up its staid image and attract more tourists. It then announced plans for two integrated resorts in the city-state.<br><br>The three other bidders for Marina Bay are Malaysia's Genting International, Las Vegas Sands and MGM Mirage. - AFP/ir<br></div>
