              <p>Ang Mo wins in their language, both written and spoken. afterall we are speaking their language. how about telling them to speak and write in chinese, we win of course.</p>
              <p>besides language, how about thinking creatively and critically? this I am afraid Ang Mo wins, because we are brought up in a system, no thanks to the PAPIST policies and education.</p>
              <p>what about competency levels? I think locals shade it better than Ang Mo, because ang mo is good in thinking and speaking, but not in this area. furthermore, local can take stress much better than ang mo, because guys are army trained and ang mo no need serve in the army in their home country.</p>

              <p>Your talking about Chinese vs ang moh?? sounds like man.. This is the problem with asians(Chinese,Japs n Koreans) and esp Singaporeans.. They see the white man as gold.. When i was in aus i seen lots of this esp asian girls sucking it up to them and always being made a fool of and being riducled. You eat food just like them.</p>
              <p>Go to a backpacker in tasmania, And see who is the 1st manager there, Its a Singaporean indian dude who just finnished his studies there and was working there at the backpacker for 6months b4 returning back to Singapore. He was the king there and all this rowdy backpackers/residents would not think twice of making him angry cos if you do, he will lash out at you immediatly, He got hired cos he had the brains,balls to control the rowdy backpackers and was a problem solver and hardworker with no b/s attidude. He was hired instead of a ang-moh. I was introduced to him thru a Local aussie while i was on a company tour. Made me proud of being a Singaporean, when i was told of this. He is a young chap btw around 25 or 26, Just finished his degree there.</p>
