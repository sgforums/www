              <p>Two word: make up...</p>
              <p>True that there are natural Taiwanese babes, but for those who aren't they know how to make themselves look pretty with make up and clothes.</p>
              <p>Just search around for before and after pictures like from Wo Cai (guess guess guess), when they have the topics that involved the girls wiping their make up off their face...you will be shocked</p>
              <p>And yes, I like Taiwan girls too.</p>

              <p>I was in Taiwan for military training. I was in Kao Shiung. I can say that one of the beauties of the Taiwanese gals is that their expectation are not as high as SG gals. SG gals want rich, handsome &amp; romantic but they just want boys who treats them well. Maybe Kao Shiung is not as globalised as Taipei so the people are there are more conservative.</p>
              <p>Generally the people there are also more gracious &amp; courteous. You see people automatically giving up their seats to the elderly &amp; keeping to one side of the escalator. The gals there also speak with a soft &amp; gentle tone which really hit my soft spot. The downside - I heard from my friends that generally Taiwanese girls are very possessive &amp; attention seeking. Which may affect your social life.</p>
              <p>It depends what type of guy you are. I'm the homely type of guy. Not a party animal. I don't mind a possessive wife if she treats me well.</p>

              <p>I was in Taiwan for military training. I was in Kao Shiung. I can say that one of the beauties of the Taiwanese gals is that their expectation are not as high as SG gals. SG gals want rich, handsome &amp; romantic but they just want boys who treats them well. Maybe Kao Shiung is not as globalised as Taipei so the people are there are more conservative.</p>
              <p>Generally the people there are also more gracious &amp; courteous. You see people automatically giving up their seats to the elderly &amp; keeping to one side of the escalator. The gals there also speak with a soft &amp; gentle tone which really hit my soft spot. The downside - I heard from my friends that generally Taiwanese girls are very possessive &amp; attention seeking. Which may affect your social life.</p>
              <p>It depends what type of guy you are. I'm the homely type of guy. Not a party animal. I don't mind a possessive wife if she treats me well.</p>

              <p>A TV programme from HOng KOng has done a check on Taiwanese and Hongkees.   Both countries like Singapore have both the females and males giving negative feedback about the opposite sex in their countries.    Both genders are looking out of the countries to get wives.</p>
              <p>By the way, friends who live in Taiwan for a period of time said that the taiwanese gals on the streets look very plain and very few are good looking.  Those good looking ones are the artistes.   The taiwanese men also said the same about it.</p>

              <p>Easy going or not easy going, is another matter.</p>
              <p>That is connected to the environment, cant do much about it.</p>
              <p>Singapore is a high-density metropolitan city, so everybody is hard up and is materialistic.</p>
              <p>This is different with Taiwan or Malaysia, because there are some areas or regions where they are not so obsessed with materialism.</p>
              <p>If some people come from outlaying areas or small towns, usually they will be friendlier and less materialistic.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, sad to say, there is no more such region.</p>
              <p>Unless maybe Pulau Ubin.</p>

              <p>We taiwanese are from Fujian and southern china provinces, we are actually same same like most singaporean chinese which majority are also from Fujian and southern china provinces.</p>
              <p>I agreed that we, taiwanese girl are more traditional in a sense that we still take our male counterpart as higher in term of society is concern, therefore we are taught to be more ladylike with our male counterpart, unlike most of my Singapore galfrens here, whom most are stuck up and never respect the male dominancy, and as time goes by, Sg gals become Queen and talk with a kind of arrogancy in them, they also tends to be more unlady like and more rough in a sense.</p>
              <p>For looks, actually, my taiwanese aunt told me,  in the earlier stage we are not much different from singapore chinese gals, but because we were occupied and colonised by Japanese for about 50 years, and within that japanese colonisation, the Koreans who are also under Japanese colonisation mingled around with our population, it end up our later generation like me, looking prettier and abit chinese, abit korean and a bit japanese.</p>
