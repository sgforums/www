Imagine they are only 17. its legal age but its just impossible to keep the baby cos you needa go school.<br>so its up to the couple's choice.<br>but condom very expensive???????? just use it everytime. its a 90% wun-kenna-pregnant choice.<br>anyway abortion very expensive? how much? see if you are a student where to find such money since at teen age you wun dare to tell your parents. i think the parents also wun like the idea of the girl having a child at young age. schooling education and certs are so important<br>life is tt practical loh.</div>

Of course, I'm sure this forum would be filled with people cursing and swearing.<br><br>However when we decide to kill babies, many of them who are developed enough to feel pain and who already have a beating heart and recordable brainwaves, we write it off as "choice".<br><br>The only difference between the premature infants in the ICU and the aborted infants is the fact that one has been born, and one has not been.<br><br>If we can take abortion to it's logical limit, why don't we kill unwanted babies after they are born anyway? After all, what's the big difference between the inside and outside of the womb? As a matter of fact, many babies are aborted during a stage of development where they can actually survive if they had been born, though a tad bit premature!<br><br>Partical-birth abortion is prehaps the most discusting and hedious of all abortion procedures... The baby is ready to be born, and they yank it out breech position, crush it's skull and suck it's brains out. This is the very same baby if you remove from the womb via cesserian, would survive prefectly well...<br><br>If you can't keep the baby, at least have to consideration and common courtesy to give him/her up for adoption. Why go through a process which will end up damaging you physically and emotionally for no good end anyway?<br><br>Abortion is a viable or humane "choice"? Think again.</div>

It was MSS's choice to declare that there were no US troops in Badhdad.

A choice of whose ease of making is out of sync with it's physical, moral and emotional implications?

He didn't even make much of a choice, but mearly talked himself into justifying the action he was going to take.

The anything, the problem seems to be with people like you are to say the least, psyopathic on fufilling their own goals, the world is your oyster so to say. The quintessential delusion that you can do anything you want as long as you can get away with it that blinds you from the simple and obvious truth; that you are becoming more and more like the lupine, animalistic animal that is a slave to the chemical precursors in your mind that signal the onset of emotion and desire, designed specifically to overwhelm logic, and reason, and most importantly, your conscience.<br><br>Ergo, it is in your intuitive extension of your reptlian brain to disguise the inevitability of implications on your worldview, that it is obviously fundamentally flawed, thus creating the otherwise contradictory systemic anomaly that if left unaddressed, will constitute an escalating probability of personal disaster in the not too distant future.<br><br>Henceforth, while it remains a burden to sedulously avoid the issue, it is not unexpected, and thus not beyond a measure of control. Which has led you, inexorably, here in an attempt to curb the inevitability of the destiny your current path brings you to. That the replication of your source views might some how spread the processing burdern over a larger area, delaying the inevitable and allowing you to carry forth with your current iterations unabated. While this solution functions, it is obviously wanting in the long run, when the cause and effect of this method starts to pile up to a grim cost.<br><br>Your views are a work of art, flawless, sublime. A triumph that will only be exceeded only by their eventual monumental failure, signs of which are already making themself apparent.<br><br></div>
