              <p>I know... Also read on sg.yahoo.com's news and saw that Kim Jong Il actually sent condolences... And also mentioned that it was due to the current President Lee Myung Bak's political motivation that caused Roh to commit suicide. Well of coz he would say that, there is no denying that Kim was closer to Roh then to Lee...</p>

              <p>the north korean did kill south koreans who are anti-commie isn't it...but i agree on the part where no rape and no pillage. normally rape is a by-product of war but north koreans make it a point no to rape their own women unlike the soviets...fyi, soviet troops raped their female compatriots liberated from german prison camps..</p>
