My hair stands and at the moment, i lost all my courage to move nor scream. After a few min when everything come to a complete stop, i quickly wake up my 'buddy' who is sleeping on top of me (double-decker bed) ...... i ask him if he felt anything, and no doubt, of cos he didn't.<br><br>This incident took place last yr, in 1999. And for the next few weeks after this incident, i carried my tailsman to sleep, and eventually, manage to change my bed. Oh yah, by the way, forgot to mention that this place is actually near to cemetaries of cos.<br><br>By the way, any1 believes in ghosts? I believe ever since i was a young boy......<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting thread. Say, I'm about undergo my BMT in Tekong soon, you know... tekong...<br>Should I ask my mom to help me get some amulets or sorts?<br><br>Btw anyone knows about stories or true accounts on what goes on in some of those old bungalows? (i dont know the location, I pass by them before in my dad's car; those single bungalows hiding in those deserted areas) eg. cults?<br><br>Anyone living in teban gardens or pandan gardens? There is a no-longer-used railway track there, which my friend told me that it leads to buona vista. Around the track are just farms and vegatation. There is a tunnel, and i've been there before a few times all during the day. Its not very scary except an altar in the middle. Its not one of those 'di zhu gong' or chinese deity altars, and they do look spooky.<br><br>That place, be careful though, cos I've personally seen parangs being stashed there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Far East shopping centre really gives me the creeps!!! Its super deserted (but i've only been there once), and when i was there that time, i think its the 4th or 5th storey, there was lady having a hair cut outside. Nothing really scary, but when me and my friend have already went 4-5 storeys seeing very few or nobody at all (although some of the shops are lit, most of them are maid agencies), this hair cut scene really gave us goosebumps! Heh I tried to scare my friend even more by telling him, mebbe it was a spectral scene, re-enacted after it happened a few years ago. hehe</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to huggable:<br><br>&gt; Subject:Â  Fw: Mdm Wong's - HAUNTED??<br><br>&gt; &gt; &gt;to all regulars at Mdm Wong's<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;*hee hee..*<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;The following story is complied with no exaggeration from the words<br>of<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;mouth of my friend's parents staying around River Valley Road.<br>Extent<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;of truth yet to be confirmed:<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Along the now Mohd Sultan Rd lived a rich Chinese family during the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;pre-war period. During the Japanese Occupation, the stretch of<br>houses<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;along the road was seized by the Japanese soldiers and was used as<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;their bunks, since the Japanese had set up a check-point at the<br>&gt; junction<br>&gt; &gt; of<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;the roads. Their house, in particular, being the last house along<br>that<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;road then, was used as a mortuary to the victims of massacre<br>happened<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;at the River Valley Road area.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;After WWII, a rice merchant bought over the house and his mistress<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;shifted in, since it was near to his office around Singapore River<br>and<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;their rendezvous would be made convenient. Two days later, the<br>&gt; mistress<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;was found dead with eyes wide-opened and white foams around her<br>mouth.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;No signs of human inflicted or self-inflicted injuries were found<br>and<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;no trace of forced entry into the house. Police suggested no foul<br>&gt; play.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Her death was recorded as a result of acute heart attack although<br>&gt; &gt; doctors<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;were not able to determine the cause of death. This also marked the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;downfall of the rice merchant. His partner in business bought over<br>&gt; this<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;house and his whole family shifted in. A month later, the partner<br>and<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;his family decided to shift out of the house and wished they had<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;nothing to do with it any longer. It was said that eerie noises were<br>&gt; &gt; heard<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;around the house every single night after mid-night throughout their<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;entire one-month stay. Of which included weeping of women, noises<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;produced by sudden shifting of furniture, cries of human, male or<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;female, as if their tongues were being forcefully pulled up etc.<br>What<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;was more intolerable was that stench that smelled like dead rats,<br>&gt; which<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;filled the entire house before every daybreak. He sold the house to<br>&gt; his<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;friend, who were also in the rice business, at a very cheap price<br>but<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;by goodwill also made known to his friend that the house was<br>haunted.<br>&gt; &gt; The<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;friend bought the house, noted that it was haunted, decided to use<br>it<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;as a rice warehouse. Coincidentally, for the first 2 consecutive<br>years<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;thereafter on the Lunar Seventh Month, deaths occurred. One coolie<br>&gt; died<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;of instant death as two 50kg rice sacks fell upon him. Another dead<br>as<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;a fellow coolie had the rice-sack hook punctured through across his<br>&gt; body<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;from his back by accident. Rumors described the coolie's deed as<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;being possessed. Moreover, many sighted headless souls floating<br>about<br>&gt; &gt; the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;ceilings. After these accounts, the towkay decided that no works be<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;done around the warehouse for the entire Seventh Month thereon. When<br>&gt; &gt; rice<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;business stopped around Singapore River in the 80's, the warehouse<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;changed hands several times and for almost a decade, it had not been<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;occupied until Mdm Wong took over. The warehouse was deliberately<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;converted to a pub because the owner thought that with crowds of<br>human<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;occupying the place every night will hopefully ward away evil<br>spirits<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;for good. Besides, any eerie noises will be well covered by the loud<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;music and human voices.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Anyone ever felt that Mdm Wong's has something not in the right<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;place, or something of eerie nature/feelings? The ceilings? The<br>&gt; toilets?<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;The<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;backyard?<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Anyone who carries a mobile phone would have noticed that reception<br>is<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;impossible at Mdm Wong's. Ever wonder why? Leave this to your<br>&gt; &gt; imagination.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;When you wish to make a call there. Please, do not walk out to the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;backyard of Mdm Wong's (near and accessible via the male toilet) and<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;climb up the twisted stairs to improve your reception. Because you<br>may<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;not like what you will see, especially during the Lunar Seventh<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Month.......<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thought I'd share what I knew about BMTC School II Nee Soon Camp -- which shouldn't be a problem now to the new recruits since Tekong's gonna be their home from now on  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>My PC told me this story about Leopard Company, particularly Platoon 3 which was facing the SOC field. During lunchtime on his first day as a recruit he forgot to fall in with his mug and so was reprimanded by the sergeant who subsequently told him to get the mug from his bunk. He sprinted up the stairs to the third storey and as he was walking towards his bunk on the far end, suddenly the door of one of the bunks along the same corridor swung open violently. When he peeked into the window he saw nothing. It couldn't be the wind since the back door was closed shut and there wasn't even a gale at that time. His sergeant was already ejecting his lung power from downstairs so he just scampered back to his bunk without  investigating further. But as he left and locked his bunk, he saw that the front doors to the other bunk that was opened less than a minute ago was tightly shut with a lock placed on it. And as he sprinted down the corridor, his eyes couldn't resist peering into the bunk again, and he saw it -- a figure of a girl in red sitting on one of the bedposts.<br><br>The White House is another haunted spot. There's this story about these two guys doing their patrolling duty around the area in the wee hours of the morning. After reaching the summit of the hill with torchlights turned on they found the checkpoint. One of them recorded the time of their arrival while the other went over to the vending machine to get both of them a drink. To do so, he had to pass by a Female toilet. As he was about to leave the machine, he saw something coming out of the toilet. It must have been something horrible for he died of shock on the very spot. His other friend went berserk.<br><br>Tekong surely has a kaleidoscope of ghost stories and I guess most of them have already been documented. But there's one story which many may not have heard of -- there's supposed to be this place in Tekong which has a black stone column -- can't exactly remember what it's like and exactly where but I'm sure it's near some lake which in turn is near to the rubber plantation.  Groups of officers supposedly lost their way while "topoing" the ground around the stone, even with updated maps and compasses. They'd end up moving in circles around it. There's a similar story involving the inhospitable jungle around Lakaun SAF Camp in Brunei where supposedly a group of soldiers went missing for weeks when they thought they were lost for only a couple of hours.<br><br>Anyway it seems like with BMTC and Sispec crammed in Tekong, that island would be too populated to incur any more ghost stories  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
