            <div class='col-md body'>Not much to do about the topic but just my two cents.<br><br>Just a few years ago, our Gp teacher made us do some project. Our group members, being the oh so brave people that they are, went to do a project about dark religions (up to now, I still do not understand what this has to do with the project)<br><br>Anyway, they took a video cam and shot all the creepiest places that they could think about, different cemeteries, spots where supposedly there was suicides, and other wierd spots. When the whole project was done, I was spooked out, the film was quite creepy. How on earth did they have the guts to film this late at night.<br><br>Anyway, this has nothing to do with that horrible show blair witch project. They made it in 96 mind you. Anyway, I take my hats off to these guys for being so downright brave<br><br>ok nuff rant</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok guys, have u all heard of Tengah Airbase before?? it had been under Brit, then Jap, later Brit, follow by Malaysia then finally S'pore rule, but thats beside the point.<br>Point is, i was sent there after my BMT to some ulu unit in some godforsaken land.Every morning i had to wake up at unearthly hours to travel there and the whole journey took me close to an hour. Yes, i was allowed to book out every night cos i m still a trainee.<br>The story begans only when i finished my course and began to do duty in my spooky unit.<br><br>If Tengah Airbase was deserted, my unit even far more so, cos it's located deep inside the airbase.My unit consist of 3 blocks of single storey buildings...courtesy of the Brits. Rather old and spooky place if u ask me, i got an evil forebrooding when i first step into the building with my alibaba bag. My unit was a sub-branch that was "banished" to this outland cos it's not impt...don't ask me why, internal politics i guess. My Dept head is a female captain who under some pretext will never be in her office...if so, only for a few hours before she runs off to some places on some "offical" biz. My 2ic is one old encik who actually underwent his course(the one i took when i first came in)under the Brits, so u guys can imagine how old he is.The rest of the organistion consist of my immediate head(a Nusaf)and my older collegues.<br><br>The first day i started my duty, i was filled with trepidation. My collegue refuses to answer some of my question when i understudy him and make me all the more scared of my coming duty.The day ended in a flash and soon, everybody is leaving the building. Tan, my collegue whom i understudy, wrap his hand around my shoulders and said,"hey hata, relax lah. What century we lived in, where got ghost one hahahaha" However, i saw his laughter was not sincere and that something is definitely wrong with my duty area. My immediate head give me a long look before he walk out and remind me to give him a call if anything crop up.<br><br>Soon, the light begans to get dimmer as the sun set over the west. One thing abt S'pore's airbase is that most of the time, all the streetlamps are shut off due to operational security. As it is, all my surronding areas became darker and darker as night creeps in and it's no joke to said that i can't even see my fingers if i was to step out of my buildings and stretch them out. The only available light was from my duty corner. i retired to my corner at around 8 plus when i finished my dinner at the cookhouse a distance away. Dare not even took a bath...that place is eerie enough to give me constipation whenever i do my biz.I was reading my book quietly when shits happened. The building kenna blackout! I was so damn strung up that i actually screamed. Soon, i began to cool down and search for my emergency lamp in the darkness. Found it and lit it up. Next on the to do list is to give my superior a call abt the blackout and guess what, the line is dead! Now i m totally spooked. No way m i going out in the dark armed with just a lamp and trekked thru the base to the nearby R.P.outpost. Thus, the next best alternative is to stay put and wait for morning to arrive...<br><br>I slept not soon after and during 2 plus (i checked my watch)there was some noise at the door that awaken me from my slumber. i saw a shadow from the silt at the bottom of the door as the moonlight was up and my eyes sufficently "adjusted" to the dark to take in all the details.The door handle was being turned slowly as the same time and it was the rusty creaky sound that woke me. I grabbed my baton(kindly supplied by my collegue Tan), dash to the door,open it and was abt to wallop the hell out of the intruder or joker when i stop dead in my track. There was nobody there...nothing but total darkess. I felt a slight chill running down my back and straight into my spine.<br><br>I closed the door immediately and run to the bed and camp there until morning.Morning finally arrived and i rushed out of the duty corner and sat down at the front door of my office, waiting for my collegues to turn up and tell them what happened.<br><br>I saw Tan first, arriving in his motorbike, and i began to burp out all that happen last night. He looked at me sceptically and said that i was dreaming."fuck u" i shouted, "that was no dream ok, LANCE CPL TAN!!" my voice dripping with anger. "yeah lah, whatever u say, private...down go tidy up the duty corner before we get fucked my encik" he replied sardonically. However, i know he believed what happened, just that for some reasons that i can't fanthom, he refuses to be drawn into the topic. After that, i felt more silly telling my head, 2ic and the rest of them what happened to me last night. I mean, cmon, who's going to believe me right...even u chaps reading this finds it hard to swallow too right???<br><br>Anyway, i can't get posted out anywhere nor can i refused to do duty also, this is after all the SAF, nobody has ever "keng" out of duty because he saw a ghost. I DID get some amulet from my mum and things were peaceful after that. Never did get to stay there long enough to see what might have happened as our dept. shifted put of there after a month.<br>Last i heard, the place was renovated to house some technicians from some squadon.<br><br>cheers<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Spooky Old Holland Rd is no more.  I decided to check it out one saturday.  And the place is now transformed.  Most (90%) of the jungle surrounding the road is cut down.  So now there is a HUGE field, size of about 3 soccer fields, fenced up, apparently they're going to built something there soon. but I did not see the sign of the developer.  On the periphery of the huge field there are new houses so rather large &amp; elegant (dunno how much people spend on such things) as well as the boxy obiang looking bungalows.<br><br>I was amazed how large the tract of jungle actually was...but now even the old temple don't look very scary...</div>
