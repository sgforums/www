            <div class='col-md body'>I was once in a train and overheard a Malay fella talking loudly to his caucasian tourist friends, telling them that the Singapore govt is just like the former South African govt, racist and favoring the Chinese over the darker-skinned Melayus.<br>I fel tlike going up  and telling him that if he hates Singapore so much then maybe he shud move to Malaysia and join his melayu gang. Where the govt is not 'racist'!<br>Anywayz, the reason that the fool is talking bad abt Singapore govt and yet refusing to move, is becos he knows that the govt is doing a goood job and he has a good life, currency, pay and home here. If he moved to M'sia, the standard of life will not be as good. Talk big only that fella.<br>Same for that idiot who runs the fateha website, talk so much abt Singapore govt being racist and yet choosing to be a Singapore citizen! he loves money and comfort too, and he has lived his whole life eating off the spoils of our blessed singapore economy, which the govt has led through the worst crisises in S.E. Asia, and the world, and now he wants to talk all this crap?<br>If he hates it so much, he should bolster his statements by moving off and stop feeding off our 'racist' profits!!!!<br>Signed: A really Pissed off HitSquad<br><br>------------------<br>God made this world with laws, such as that of gravity, the disobedience of which will lead to serious consequences. Similarly He made the world with moral/spiritual laws as well, such as that the disobedience of which will prove eternally costly. Therefore, let the God who so loved the world that He gave us His only begotten son, Jesus Christ, heal your hurts in the way that He knows best. While it may not be in your ways, trust that He who made you and I, knows the best way, His way.

            <div class='col-md body'>But the FACT is we ARE SOMETHINGS RACIST!!!<br><br>Just look that this post and many others in the forum. Admit it lah, there are many Singapore Chinese that are RACIST!!!<br><br>Okay......maybe not all but some....esp the older generations<br><br>We chinese don't feel it maybe it's bcoz we are the MAJORITY!!!<br><br>When I was overseas studying I encounter many ugly racist incident. The swearing, spitting, bad cust service and fingering....etc.<br><br>I complain these acts to my S'porean frenz and guess what.... One of them, an Indian, said he's used to it cause in SG he got the same treatment sometimes.....ok, not as bad as the spitting or fingering but he does get occasional swearing and mistreatment in shops, especially from Ah ma and Ah Gong and naughty kids.<br><br>I think all these incident that happen is a WAKE UP CALL for all of us!!!<br><br>But the fact that the Gov ....I agree with you ppl, how many country in the world gives better treatment to the minorities and don't regard them as 2nd-class citizens (Equal chance of getting a job,edu,car,etc??) Only a handful.<br><br>I really wonder what those people who hated SG to the core at are thinking... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>There a saying: you won't know how lucky you are and what you have.....until you LOST THEM ALL!!<br><br>Let's us be sensible and watch our words at these sensitive times. Hope SGforums will not have any nonsensical postings regarding the race/religeon issue..........<br><br>Moderators, I know I'm not in a position to tell you this but, I hope you keep a look out on all these stuff posted.<br><br>If you are a foreigner itching to creating trouble in this forum and disrupt our society, I suggest to you that it'll be more constructive to think of better ways to improve your country than to wreck and create a riot in other country.</div>
