              <p>they said we got a blaming culture in our society, now i believe it.</p>

              <p><br>As said, this is a global crisis, nobody wanted it to be this way,  I quote you, my dear Uncle, a BBC interview by Mr Head with our PM, your best friend.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>PM Lee:</strong> I think it's the most severe since the war.</p>
              <p>We've had ups and down before, but this one is not only much sharper and deeper but, I think, qualitatively different because it's a worldwide problem... It's not just a cyclical recession but a financial crisis of the whole global financial system.</p>
              <p><strong>Mr Head:</strong> Your government has taken a number of unprecedented measures, a huge $20 billion stimulus package, dipping into your reserves for the first time... Are these measures enough, you think, to compensate for the impact of this crisis?</p>
              <p><strong>PM Lee:</strong> They will help us to reduce unemployment, reduce job losses... they will help companies to remain viable.</p>
              <p>But we must understand that what we can do is to buffer the impact. You must wait for the storm to pass.</p>
              <p><strong>Mr Head:</strong> Do you think this region has been too complacent about its dependence on Western markets in the past?</p>
              <p><strong>PM Lee:</strong> We've had no choice. I mean, the whole world is plugged in as one globalised world. Consumption, the markets are in America. India and China have been growing rapidly and their markets have been growing rapidly.</p>
              <p>But on the world scale, they are still very small, and maybe one-third, one-tenth of the American and European markets put together.</p>
              <p><strong>Mr Head:</strong> But has there been a failure to focus on developing domestic markets in the Asia-Pacific region, among your neighbours...?</p>
              <p><strong>PM Lee:</strong> I think big domestic markets, if you're looking at it, will be China and India. The way to develop the markets will be to raise their standards of living, then they have the money to consume.</p>
              <p><strong>Mr Head:</strong> Looking here at Singapore, what can I understand from you about the huge paper losses that have been made in the two big sovereign wealth funds here, in Temasek and GIC, because on paper, they've done very badly over the last year.</p>
              <p><strong>PM Lee:</strong> Well, the value of the portfolios have gone down... 20, 25 per cent... everyone has taken a hit, whether you are Harvard, Yale, Stanford or the Norwegians.</p>
              <p>If you're in the markets, you have to ride the ups and downs.</p>
              <p><strong>Mr Head:</strong> Your own family has been quite involved in these funds. Your wife, until recently, ran Temask. Your father's deeply involved in GIC.</p>
              <p>Is there a risk that when the news is bad, as it has been over the past year for these funds, that people will tend to blame your family rather than look at the institutions?</p>
              <p><strong>PM Lee:</strong> I think the way you put it is not the way things work in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Minister Mentor is chairman of GIC not because he's my father... it's because he's the best man for the job and he has been chairman since he was prime minister.</p>
              <p>And Ho Ching is CEO of Temasek not because she's my wife but because the chairman of Temasek, who is Mr Dhanabalan, and the board decided that they wanted to appoint her as CEO.</p>
              <p>And they are there as long as they are effective, performing, and if they don't perform well, they have to take up consequences.</p>
              <p><strong>Mr Head:</strong> I think you are talking about perception, and perception is important in politics.</p>
              <p>In difficult times like this, do you think that, in retrospect, it might have been better for your family just to have a lower profile?</p>
              <p><strong>PM Lee:</strong> (Laughs) Life would be much easier for me if the Minister Mentor is not my father and Ho Ching is not my wife.</p>
              <p>But they are there... this is the way Singapore has worked. I think Singaporeans have understood that this is how the system works, and they will render judgment when elections come.</p>

              <p>Thing is, if we don't about others, starting from us first, then who will care about us in return? Out of 10 persons, perhaps only 3 will be appreciative and return help within their ability, the rest will self centredly take things for granted.</p>
              <p>However, just 3 person who care about you makes a hell lotta of difference, at times between life and death. We are all one race, the human race - white or black, young or old, beautiful or ugly, rich or poor - underneath it all, we bled the same.</p>
              <p>At times like these, I feel we as a society has failed. We stopped caring. The girl's parents had failed. Her friends who did not see the warning signs or do not recognise them had failed. We on the outside had not done to protect our young by legislation and grassroots organised penetrations.</p>
              <p>We - you and I - had failed. The girl...was...only...a...child.....</p>

              <p><br>Doctors, nurses, social worker and military soldiers belong to noble proffessions that care, regardless of who rules. They are not arrested. Nobility - the laying down of one's life for others - is not born but bred, and something which anyone, be him a roadsweeper or a Prime Minister, can aspire to it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When politics comes into the picture, it cheapens nobility, for only ambitious men dares take on the task to lead others. Leading others is no simple thing, for one faces moral dilemmas perpetually - to sacrifice the few so that the many may live or sacrifice the many so that the few may live.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is no easy task, for it is impossible to please everyone. Those who lead nobly either would fail immediately by their heart or be burden by guilt when they meet with moral dilemmas. Politics are no easy tasks, and whomever rules in Singapore, they have my deepest respect.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While the rulers cannot help everyone, they had done what they could to help the majority. And it is up to us individuals to do what we can for the needy minority and the fallen members in our society. Surely in Singapore, one needs not ask the ruler for permission to donate a dollar or lend your ears or shoulders to the less unfortunate, do we?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our country is ruled by laws, and such laws are proposed and agreed upon by the majority of our society. To challenge our laws is to challenge society. There is no need to run afoul of laws if we truly want to help. We have parliament representatives to assist us to change laws if necessary, if it is sound for the majority. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus, if anyone who has the ambition to change the laws of the land to assist society, he/she is welcome to be legally elected. But to create chaos, strife, hate and suspicions will only destroy our society. Is it necessary? Must the majority's peace be sacrificed on the alter of ambitious men serving only a minority?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I guess further discussion will only drift away from the topic by TS. It is with utter sadness that there is nothing more that i can do for our late Eunice Chew, but there are still thousands other like her, facing problems. It is my hope more may have compassion and help. Compassion needs no majestic ambitions. A listening ear and a new direction opened up is often good enough.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Peace.</p>

A cleaner made the sordid discovery just before 9 pm on Wednesday.
              </span></p><p> </p>
              Close-circuit television footage from the terminal was being reviewed to trace the person who dumped the fair-skinned baby, who had his umbilical cord still attached.
              <p> </p>
              It is believed that drops of blood were found in a toilet near one of the terminal's gates.
              <p> </p>
              The airport management has also been asked to check if any of the staff had shown signs of pregnancy.
              <p> </p>
              It is the second case of a newborn being dumped in Singapore this month, the paper said.
              <p> </p>
              Nurasyikin Mohamed Ismail, 23, was arrested for dumping her newborn in a housing estate earlier this month. She was charged with concealing the birth of her child by secretly disposing of the body.<p></p>
