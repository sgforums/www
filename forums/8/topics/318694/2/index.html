              <p>this is truely disgusting...</p>
              <p>so many people already died in the disaster and then this kind of people come and calculate this and calculate that... it digusts me. i wonder if this kind of people knows how to even shed tears anot.</p>
              <p>imagine a member of your family pass away tragically and a 'fortune teller' or 'fengshui master' comes by and 'calculate' all kinds of rubbish to you. won't you get pissed?</p>
              <p>so people please do not let all this kind of rubbish bother you. it goes where it should belong, to the trash bin. if it's a time to mourn and grieve we should express it. not adding fuel to the fire like 'see i told you it'll happen garbage'.</p>

              <p>That is not prediction.</p>
              <p>I had had my future told to me in 1997 in <strong>great detail</strong>. The dream that I was to have, Megawati becoming president(it was still Soeharto then in 1997), the plot that befell me, the things that I was going to think, etc. I mean it was told like it had already happened. Every detail of what was being told came to pass  in 2002, except one, the girl which I fell in love with was supposed to be dead. This I do not know whether has yet happened. I even do not know her name.</p>
              <p> The prediction was coming from a Catholic Monastery in Indonesia. The fullfilment was in Singapore in 2002. At the time the prophecy was told I was still in my highschool. I came to do my tertiary education in Singapore in 1998. I ended up not having finished my study in your island and has refused to go back. I needed only 1 more subject to graduate. As long as tyranny lives I will never set foot on your island.</p>
              <p>My future being told as if they were the past.</p>

              <p>Predictions of future? Sure...not only it is possible, it's what we are doing every single minute of our lives....but there is a thin line between wild psychic prediction versus knowledge-based, logical deductions/forecasts - I'm not entirely clear here...</p>
              <p>We forecast oil production, crops harvests, weather patterns, plate tectonic movements, constellation activities, etc...whatever you see on Discovery Channel, there are specialists in the field studying it.</p>
              <p>No one can tell exactly when, what, how, things will happen but these pros will have tonnes of figures to back their claims....</p>
              <p>The sad thing is, you can raise a warning, but will the authority take preventive measures? Maybe la, after tens of thousands were killed...it's not easy to move the entire city just as a precaution right??</p>
              <p>Sometimes we humans are just wretches....</p>
              <p>On the side note, I am so very curious to find out more about the åœ°éœ‡é›². Anyone here got any myths, studies, insights to it?</p>

Jesus prophecy in the bible is <br>worthwhile for us to read.<br><br>during the end times, you have to be very careful, and look for 7 signs.<br><br>1. False prophets who claimed to be Christ.<br><br>a. 19th Century, Joseph Smith, Jr. (December 23, 1805 – June 27, 1844) was the American religious figure who founded the <br>Latter Day Saint movement, also known as Mormonism. Every year there are 33000 new members.<br><br>b. Charles Taze Russell (February 16, 1852 – October 31, 1916), also known as Pastor Russell, was a Protestant evangelist <br>from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA and founder of the Bible Student movement.<br>Founder of Jehovah's Witnesses.<br><br>c. Sun Myung Moon (born January 6, 1920) is the founder and leader of the world-wide Unification Church and of the larger <br>Unification Movement which owns, operates or subsidizes many organizations involved in political, cultural, mass-media, and <br>other activities. One of the best known of these is the Washington Times newspaper. Moon has said he is the Second Coming of <br>Christ, the "Savior", "returning Lord", and "True Parent".<br><br>d. James Warren "Jim" Jones (May 13, 1931 – November 18, 1978) was the American founder of the Peoples Temple, which became <br>synonymous with group suicide after the November 18, 1978 mass murder-suicide in their isolated agricultural intentional <br>community called Jonestown, located in Guyana, South America. Over 900 people died from cyanide poisoning or gunshot wounds. <br>To the extent the actions in Jonestown were viewed as a mass suicide, it is one of the largest such mass suicides in history, <br>perhaps the largest in over 1,900 years and the largest mass suicide of United States citizens.<br><br>Now who is the modern False prophets? Someone said he is Li Hongzhi (Chinese: æ�Žæ´ªå¿—; pinyin: LÇ� Hóngzhì) (born in Gongzhuling <br>city, Jilin, China) is the founder of Falun Gong (or Falun Dafa), a system of "mind-body cultivation" related to the qigong <br>tradition. 100 million follower.<br><br>Another is the female Christ appeared in China, one HK Christian was abducted to Shangdong was surrounded by female believers <br>of the female Christ and tempted sexually. In the end, the HK Christian was brained washed and lost his faith.<br><br>There are many false prophets in modern times and they are very active in reaching out and destroying people's lives.<br><br>2. Wars and rumours of wars.<br><br>a. 1st World War<br><br>b. 2nd World War - death toll is 54 million, Poland 6 million Jews.<br><br>c. if all of the nuclear weapons were to detonate, every man will die 100 times.<br><br>d. biological weapons could wipe out the earth.<br><br>3. Hunger and starvation<br><br>a. etc. Eithopia, Sudan, Somlia, Rwanda.<br><br>b. 4 million died of hunger every year.<br><br>c. wars, human population explosion and natural disasters and food health problems caused worldwide hunger.<br><br>d. current food production levels could feed 10 billions, but why 1/3 of population are still going hungry? because of wide <br>income disparities. Majority are poor, only a small minority are very rich. 1/5 population are living in poverty and are mal<br>-nourished. 3/5 of the world population do not have sanitary facility. 1.3 billion population are surviving on US$1/- per <br>day. 1/3 of the population cannot survive until 40 years of age. people are wasting food nowadays, if you see the restaurants <br>many food are uneaten and wasted.<br><br>4. Earthquakes everywhere.<br><br>a. Every years the rate of earthquakes are increasing rate.<br><br>1st-7th century. Big Earthquakes occurred more than 10 times.<br>8th-10th century. more than 30 times.<br>11th century. more than 50 times.<br>19th century - 2000 times.<br>20th century - 10000 times.<br><br>21th century - countless.<br><br>b. almost every year Big Earthquakes happened frequently during the entry 20th century.<br>1915 Italy<br>1917 Central America<br>1919 Italy<br>1920 Mexico, China<br>1923 Iran, Japan<br>1931 New Zealand, Central America<br><br>Death Toll for these earthquakes 340,000<br><br>1920 Gansu 180,000 dead<br>1923 Japan Kwantong 150,00 dead<br>1976 TangShan estimated 651,000 dead<br><br>Death toll highest in China earthquakes. 800,000 dead max.<br><br>2004 Earthquake and Tsunami - 200,000 dead.<br><br>These are the beginning of "birth pains".<br><br>5. The persecution of Christians.<br><br>a. Americans Christians are being persecuted, during the class, some professors (e.g. Standford) allows meditation in class. <br>But do not allow students to read the bible in class. They will be ostracized if they do that.<br><br>b. In China, many Christians are being persecuted for their faith. Many are tutored and jailed.<br><br><br>6. Many illegals things happening, people's heart are indifferent (cold).<br><br>a. In the US, every year there are 3.7 million credit cards being stolen. be very careful of your letter boxes. many stole <br>information from your letterboxes and ID theft. <br><br>b. Increasing no. of commercial crimes.<br><br>c. Increasing no. of divorces. In China, 1981, there are about 120,000 couples filed for divorce. In 1994, there are about 6 <br>million couples filed for divorce.<br><br>d. In the US, the people filing for divorces exceeded no. of people filing for marriages.<br><br>e. Man's increasing self centeredness is the caused of people's heart getting indifferent (colder).<br><br>f. There is a marriage of a person and a mirror, because it is the marriage of oneself. because one love oneself so much that <br> she didn't even consider many suitors in the audience.<br><br>g. In the Guinness book of record, there is someone who married 29 times. Who did he married?? Someone who had married 28 <br>times!! what is the reason for their divorce? his son said my dad saw his wife eating on bed. Another time, he divorced her <br>ex-wife because she used his special toothpaste.<br><br>So you can see, man's is getting more indifferent (cold) to others. If more and more people are like this, the world will get <br>worse and worse.<br><br>7. In the end, the Gospel must be spread across the world, and reach to every corners of the world. Jesus will then arrive.<br><br>a. There are 6.5 billions people in the world. Only 2 billions are Christians. 2/3 are still non-believers. There are more <br>work to be done.<br><br>If Jesus comes tonight? Are you prepared to go? What can you do? <br><br>1 Peter 4:7-10<br><br> 7The end of all things is near. Therefore be clear minded and self-controlled so that you can pray. 8Above all, love each <br>other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins. 9Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling. 10Each one <br>should use whatever gift he has received to serve others, faithfully administering God's grace in its various forms.<br><br>Let's all pray for Sichuan and Myanmar, cry with them, donate money or help them with whatever talents we have and we can. Give hope to those who needs hope!</p></div>
