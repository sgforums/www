              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: large;">China's 7.9 Earthquake predicted by Juseleeno (Jucelino) Nobulega Da Roose?</span><span style="color: #000000;"> Some of his predictions for 2008 include:<br><br>â—Ž 2008<br>â—� successful development of effective drugs for treatment of AIDS disease and Dengue fever <br>â—� </span><span style="color: #000000;">18 of July: 8.1 earthquake in Philippines; thousands of people dead.<br>â—� </span><span style="color: #000000;">Sept: terrorist attacks at the New York Empire State Building<br>â—� </span><span style="color: #000000;">13 of Sept:
              Super-strong 9.1 earthquake in China; epicenter in Nanning and Hainan
              Island; also results in over 30 meters of tsunami costing millions of
              lives; likely to devastate Japan as well.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Editor's note:
              12th of May and 13th of Sept are only a few months apart; at least he
              got the year correct but the magnitude of the destruction has been
              scaled down. Or could it mean that there will be another more
              devastating earthquake in Sept in China? It is mentioned on a forum
              in Jan 2008 that although this huge 9.1 earthquake happens after the
              Olympics ends in August 2008, there will be a series of relatively
              'smaller' earthquakes occurring in China before this huge earthquake.
              This suggests that the recent 7.9 mag Sichuan earthquake is only one of
              those 'smaller' earthquakes which precede the mega 9.1 mag earthquake
              in Sept 2008. Scary thought isn't it? Only time can tell... </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Unusual 'Earthquake Clouds' reportedly observed in Shandong on 9th of May, more than 1400 km away from the epicenter of the 7.9 mag Sichuan earthquake. What are earthquake clouds?</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; color: #000000;">Editor's note:
              Mr. Juseleeno Nobulega Da Roose is a Brazilian, born in 1960, 47 years
              of age and currently a vocational school teacher. He can accurately
              predict future events with unbelievable precision (including the year,
              month and day and has made attempts to systematically document his
              predictions everytime he wakes up from his 'prophetic dreams'. If the
              prediction concerns an ordinary individual, he will simply write a
              letter to warn him or her. If the prediction concerns a large number of
              people (or an important individual) and can have serious repercussions
              such that it warrants serious attention, he will send letters to
              the concerned agencies, governments, etc. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">He
              mentioned that he began to have visions of future events in his dreams
              when he was still a child of nine years in 1969. Such dreams came
              naturally to him. He predictions are known to be unusually accurate. An
              outstanding example is afforded by his prediction of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.
              He had sent a letter to the Indian Ambassador in Brazil to warn of the
              event eight years before it actually occurred in 1996. It was stated in
              the letter that "he predicted an 8.9 mag earthquake will occurr on
              December 26, 2004 in Indonesia's Aceh. Indonesia and India will be
              devastated by a tsunami 10 meters high. Similar letters were also sent
              to the Thai, Phillipino, Indonesian embassies in Brazil. Ample proofs
              are provided by the time stamps on the letters. Unfortunately,
              appropriate actions were not taken by the authorities. Predictions
              (especially those that arise from prophetic dreams) are almost always
              treated with a high level of suspicion and skepticism since they lie in
              the realm of pseudoscience. However, there is still so much that
              science cannot explain. See for example the </span><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">double-slit paradox</span><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;"> in quantum physics. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">Mr
              Juseleeno made known his predictions in the hope that people will take
              heed of his warnings so that these disasters can be averted. (From the
              Buddhist point of view, awareness of such
              predictions can have a subconscious influence on the course of future
              events. Our physical environment is intimately connected to not only
              our actions but even to our thoughts). He hopes there will be a major change in mindsets of people in the time period leading up to 2008. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">Both Juseleeno and John Croino
              (another well-known but elusive prophet) predicted major seismic
              activities and climatic changes in the years after 2007. John Croino
              mentioned:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">          
              "Then from mid-2007, the shock of events and disasters will increase
              month by month, worse storms, more violent seismic activity, bizarre
              and terrifying ominous events that seem to foretell of some great
              change brewing. Most people will not truly realise even a hint of bad
              it will become  until late 2008. Every year from 2007 until 2014, will
              be increasingly nightmarish, with the peak period being 2012-2014. The
              sky will be dark in those places for long enough to truly frighten
              people and damage crop yields."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; color: #000000;">Note that Juseleeno also
              predicted unusually dark and gloomy skies over large parts of theearth
              starting from 2012. The parallels between the two sets of prophecies
              are simply too overwhelming. </span></p>

              <p>ok i would like to add on to fifteen post</p>
              <p>as u can see i am into feng shui(chinese way of looking at energy flow)</p>
              <p>but i am not a master in feng shui </p>
              <p>reamember last year 2007 alot of water happenings like our swimmers drown in the boat compertation,those mini water tonado started to appear in singapore waters?,many people drowning in condo pools?</p>
              <p>bascially in 2007 the water element is overflowing task too much water element for the year</p>
              <p>ok for 2008 whats there to expect?</p>
              <p>LOTS OF LAND HORROR not jokeing! and many will relate to nature</p>
              <p>bascially there is 8 slots in the year chart</p>
              <p>but this year(2008) wood and earth took 7 slots out of 8</p>
              <p>so how to see a good year in the chart?</p>
              <p>a good year should consist of all element not over powering each other</p>
              <p>like fire,water,wood,metal,earth</p>
              <p>at this very moment ask yourself how many land horrors have u read in the news?</p>
              <p>mrt disturps?,massive earthquakes?,car accidents increaseing?,many tree falls at the start of the year?,rice shortage?,etc</p>
              <p>about china earthquake it was one of those big one and personally i think thats only the preview of whats worst to come</p>
              <p>theres also lots of other problem for 2008 like economic problem (inflation),unstable stock market</p>
              <p>there will be politcal instablity and a few more problems</p>
              <p>about 2009 i cant say much about it yet as i have not seen the 2009 year chart</p>
              <p>NOTE:i am not a master of feng shui i just happen to study alittle about it and have basic knowledge on it and there are also other charts and calander that affect us</p>
              <p>like the luner calander(chinese)</p>
              <p>the sol(solar)(english) calander</p>
              <p>the sketch of the spring ox(out look of the year)</p>
              <p>flying star chart(the location of different energy flows from different directions)</p>
              <p>and many other charts...</p>
              <p>do note that english do have their way of seeing this type of stuff and the good part is that THEY ALL MATCH EACH OTHER is just how you look at it and understand it</p>
              <p>ok about 2012-2013</p>
              <p>base on what i have been reading,studying about the planet X thingy</p>
              <p>i don't know if i should belive or not but from whats been happening, it seems that its really coming</p>
              <p>be happy that its not going to hit earth(unlike a metor) but base on the info i got, massive gravity change will affect nature task what to expect is pole shifts,massive waves,crazy volcano explosion (it may also trigger the gigantic volcano located at the yellow stone park,USA),etc etc etc</p>
              <p>in other words... what i personally belive that the increaseing number of natural disasters and the increaseing strength of it is due to the gravity pull of planet X affecting earth and its going to be the strongest in 2012-2013(ask me personally to know more)  </p>
              <p>anyway time to intro myself</p>
              <p>i am max,17(born in 1991)</p>
              <p>studying</p>
              <p>And besides studying for O levels(sec5,private candinate) i been studying,rescearching,exploreing,reading up many stuff for a good 5 years and will go on with it</p>
