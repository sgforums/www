              <p>April 17 (Bloomberg) -- The world's largest shopping center looks almost deserted on a recent afternoon. While schoolchildren ride the sidewinder and roller coaster, there are few shoppers and fewer tenants at South China Mall in central Dongguan, a city of 6 million north of Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>``They did this mall all wrong,'' says Stephen Liu, a Hong Kong businessman visiting clients in Dongguan who came by to see the place for himself. ``They never found out if there were enough people to fill it. All the Chinese in this town are factory workers, they can't afford to shop here.''</p>
