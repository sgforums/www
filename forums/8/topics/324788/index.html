              <p>eh people</p>
              <p>for the pass few weeks i have noticed and heard of crazy singaporens</p>
              <p>1)mad man from toa payoh</p>
              <p>story from my sis(2-3 weeks ago)</p>
              <p>An X-commando ,31(i think) who carries a knife in toa payoh interchange and ends up cutting everything and anything like the event items,tents,etc etc etc at around midnight (3am-5am)</p>
              <p>if u approach him, he will point his knife at your throat then question you</p>
              <p>my sis called the police and this is what the responds was like</p>
              <p>"we know who aready"</p>
              <p>then they send 2 police man down but this 2 policeman also never do anything and just follow that mad guy (i think they also scared)</p>
              <p>my sis left that area around 4.40am (at macdonals)</p>
              <p>2) crazy aunty in ang mo kio</p>
              <p>story from my uncle and aunty (who stay near that area)</p>
              <p>i was told that this crazy aunty would ask u for a small donation like (10-cents)</p>
              <p>but thats not the crazy part</p>
              <p>the crazy part is that once u give her the $, she will just scoop all your food from your plate into a plastic bag and feed it to the stray cats</p>
              <p>3) MY personal experience (about 1 month ago)</p>
              <p>was out with a close friend of mine at city hall (the underpass city link)</p>
              <p>was walking along when suddenly his MAD man dress in white shirt and shorts just started shouting just right behind me(7m away)( i was like, HOLY SHIT WTF IS HAPPENING)</p>
              <p>lolz my friend faster started to pull me away(she'scared) and we go on walking (knowing that the mad man was just like 10-20m away from us)</p>
              <p>then that guy was also walking on the same way and he would stop once awhile to scold and shout at anything and to anyone</p>
              <p>from people to advertisment to the walls,etc etc etc</p>
              <p>and i also dunno what he saying</p>
              <p>its not hokkian,english,chinese but sounds like some weird words coming out from his mouth</p>
              <p>and he did that all the way till i detoured to thai express and after that i dunno what happen to him</p>
              <p>but along the way the security guard who was patrolling the linkway never stop him and just quickly walk away</p>
              <p>anyone of u have any of this experience? DO SHARE YOUR STORY as i have shared mine</p>

              <p>well, last weekend,I went to the AMK market opposite the bishan gardens, near to AMK south swimming pool. There is a pitiful man who is wearing white long sleeve shirt. I can tell he is deranged by his look and the clothes he is wearing.</p>
              <p>I don't think he is harmful except for his loud cries.</p>

              <p>IN my neighbourhood, there is this mad woman (ever admitted to IMH) asked for money for food.    See her feeding cats, buy food feeding cats..    No $$$ to eat still feed the cats.   The cats are better off than her for there are others who come by regularly feeding the cats.   She talks to the cats as if talking to human beings.  </p>
              <p>She also touts for business - prostituting :   $20</p>
              <p>REally sad case.</p>

              <p>I remember last time during my NS time I always take bus 38 at Tanah Merah interchange go back home.</p>
              <p>There was this guy, if you took the bus around 7.30pm like that, there would be a guy with  headphones talking very loudly to himself. Anything that came out from his mouth was just gibberish. If anyone attempted to sit near him, he would shout at them. Once there was a mak cik wanting to sit on the seat near him he just shouted at her and asked her to go and die.</p>
              <p>Yup, thats my experience.</p>

              <p>AMK got alot of weird people one..</p>
              <p>Last last time, there's a woman with big tumour on her neck and she's mentally unstable. If those living in AMK, I'm sure you all will know her. But recently never saw her already.</p>
              <p>Anyway, me and my friends were sitting at this one table at a hawker centre, just nice to occupy all the seats. When one of my friends got up to buy food, suddenly she just came and sit down with us. We were freaked out. She didn't even say a word and sat down looking at us. And there were plenty of other seats around.</p>
              <p>We moved to another table and she continued to move to another table with a group of people. We were thinking maybe she's afraid of loneliness.</p>
