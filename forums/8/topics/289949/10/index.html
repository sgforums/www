The phrase coined came from a mathematician (Ian Stewart) dealing in chaos theory who has no understanding of meteorology and weather systems.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Stewart_%28mathematician%29" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-style: italic;">Ian Stewart was born in 1945 in England. While in the sixth form at school, Stewart came to the attention of the mathematics teacher. The teacher had Stewart sit mock A-level examinations without any preparation along with the upper-sixth students; Stewart placed first in the examination. This teacher arranged for Stewart to be admitted to Cambridge on a scholarship to Churchill College, where he obtained a BA in Mathematics. Stewart then went to the University of Warwick for his PhD, on completion of which he was offered an academic position. He is now <strong>Professor of Mathematics at the University of Warwick. He is one of the world's most famous mathematicians, with significant contributions to catastrophe theory.</strong></span></a><br><br><a href="http://www.imho.com/grae/chaos/chaos.html" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-style: italic;">"The flapping of a single butterfly's wing today produces a tiny change in the state of the atmosphere. Over a period of time, what the atmosphere actually does diverges from what it would have done. So, in a month's time, a tornado that would have devastated the Indonesian coast doesn't happen. Or maybe one that wasn't going to happen, does." (Ian Stewart, Does God Play Dice? <strong>The Mathematics of Chaos</strong>, pg. 141)</span></a><br><br><a href="http://www.energizer.com/learning/weatherbeat/proj_howWork.asp" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-style: italic;">Here's how a recipe for a tornado might go:<br>In the sky, mix warm, moist air with cooler, drier air. Because it's less dense, the warm air rises and passes through the cool air. The rising warm air creates what's called an updraft. Air that's higher in the sky starts to cool off and sinks, causing a downdraft.</span></a><br><br><a href="http://www.pa.msu.edu/sciencet/ask_st/093092.html" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-style: italic;">For a tornado to start, two air masses must meet, a lower one containing warm, humid air and a higher one containing cool, dry air.<br><br>During thunderstorms, unstable humid warm air moves upward and is stopped by a thin layer of cool dry air.  This thin layer act like a cap on the warm air below it causing pressure and energy to build as more humid sir rises.<br><br>When the cap gives way under the pressure of rising warm air, it releases a huge amount of energy in the form of an upward moving air mass.  Air currents move in from all sides to replace the rising warm air and some times form a tornado.  Usually, this does not happen.  Wind at high altitudes plays an important role in determining whether a tornado develops.  Depending on conditions, these winds can intensify the sudden upward air flow and create the vortex of wind that is a tornado.<br><br>Tornadoes can happen anywhere in the world.  However, due to certain conditions, the Midwestern United States is where they happen most frequently.<br><br>In this region, the two major air masses necessary to start a tornado meet: dry cool polar air from Canada and humid warm air from the Gulf of Mexico.  An average tornado lasts only 10 minutes and travels up to 10 to 12 kilometers.</span></a><br><br>You can have a million wind tunnel fans blowing (not just butterfly flapping), but if there are no cold air (downdraft) and warm air (updraft), you will never get a tornado, just end up with lots of wind.<br><br>You are entitled to your own opinion, I can't force you to accept anything.</div>

[1]<br><br>This informal understanding suffices in everyday usage, however the philosophical analysis of causality or causation has proved exceedingly difficult. The work of philosophers to understand causality and how best to characterize it <strong>extends over millennium.</strong> In the western philosophical tradition explicit discussion stretches back at least as far as Aristotle, and the topic <strong>remains a staple in contemporary philosophy journals.</strong> Though cause and effect are most often held to relate events, other candidates include processes, properties, variables, facts, and states of affairs; which of these comprise the correct causal relata, and how best to characterize the nature of the relationship between them, has as yet no universally accepted answer, and remains under discussion.</blockquote>Note the bold parts.<br><br>"In the western philosophical tradition explicit discussion stretches back at least as far as Aristotle"<br><br>In Eastern philosophical tradition, it goes back even further...
