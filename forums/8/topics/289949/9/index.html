It is under the study of Emergence.<br><br>You can't possibly tell the fact that each discrete brain cell can congregate together and give the property of consciousness.<br><br>Likewise a single air molecule on its own can't tell you that it has a property of transmitting sound, but you do "see" sound transmitted through air molecules in the atmosphere.<br><br>Study of termite or ant alone do not tell you anything about how they will behave when they are together in a group, they do not exhibit the property that they will band together and form an organized colony capable of sustaining itself with great efficiency. But we see it as an emergent property.<br><br>Thus, study of emergence lor. Isn't that what you are asking?<br><br>"An example to consider in detail is an ant colony. The queen does not give direct orders and does not tell the ants what to do. Instead, each ant reacts to stimuli in the form of chemical scent from larvae, other ants, intruders, food and build up of waste, and leaves behind a chemical trail, which, in turn, provides a stimulus to other ants. Here each ant is an autonomous unit that reacts depending only on its local environment and the genetically encoded rules for its variety of ant. Despite the lack of centralized decision making, ant colonies exhibit complex behavior and have even been able to demonstrate the ability to solve geometric problems. For example, colonies routinely find the maximum distance from all colony entrances to dispose of dead bodies."<br><br>- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence<br><br>Learned it before in my year 1 module wor, somewhat associated with Chaos theory as well.<br></div>

It is under the study of Emergence.<br><br>You can't possibly tell the fact that each discrete brain cell can congregate together and give the property of consciousness.<br><br>Likewise a single air molecule on its own can't tell you that it has a property of transmitting sound, but you do "see" sound transmitted through air molecules in the atmosphere.<br><br>Study of termite or ant alone do not tell you anything about how they will behave when they are together in a group, they do not exhibit the property that they will band together and form an organized colony capable of sustaining itself with great efficiency. But we see it as an emergent property.<br><br>Thus, study of emergence lor. Isn't that what you are asking?<br><br>"An example to consider in detail is an ant colony. The queen does not give direct orders and does not tell the ants what to do. Instead, each ant reacts to stimuli in the form of chemical scent from larvae, other ants, intruders, food and build up of waste, and leaves behind a chemical trail, which, in turn, provides a stimulus to other ants. Here each ant is an autonomous unit that reacts depending only on its local environment and the genetically encoded rules for its variety of ant. Despite the lack of centralized decision making, ant colonies exhibit complex behavior and have even been able to demonstrate the ability to solve geometric problems. For example, colonies routinely find the maximum distance from all colony entrances to dispose of dead bodies."<br><br>- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence<br><br>Learned it before in my year 1 module wor, somewhat associated with Chaos theory as well. </div></blockquote>While you were typing this, I asked you what the formal name of the course is... it is not "Study of Emergence", what is it?<br><br>about the HPoC, there are people that think there is a "missing ingredient"... and the Buddhists will say something like UNIVERSAL CONSCIOUSNESS that infuses the brain.... and the other religions will say SOUL or SPIRIT.<br><br>Even some non religious people think that there is something missing... like "gravity" or "space" or "time" and think of the HPoC in those terms as a hard problem discovering the "missing ingredient".<br><br>People that go with consciousness as an Emergent or emergent property are mainly materialists and consider that there is no HPoC in that there is nothing missing....</div>
