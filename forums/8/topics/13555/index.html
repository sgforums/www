If you ppl love to preach so much, why not go out to the street and preach? Why not go out and help mankind? see to their needs rather than just do empty talks?<br><br>you ppl are just like, when a poor child is so starving to death approaching you....you never give them food, you just use your mouth to say, the hunger will be gone the hunger will be gone. Does the problem really gone?<br><br>do your preaching here in forum only cause ppl to add in fire and more insults on christianity. you should know better.<br><br>I saw so many posts asking for advices and helps...but how come you helpful christians never post anything to help them? I never see your helpfulness in all that forum.<br><br>A tree, whether its good or bad, can be judged by its fruits...good tree will bear good fruit, but no matter how bad is a tree...they can only bear bad fruit, they are rotting from beneath....whether you are good or bad or trying to stir trouble...God knows best...<br><br>Be practical.<br><br>to other ppl in the forum: what this pretense christians said DOES NOT represent all christians point of view.

There was no answer.<br><br>"Finally a Christian man on the team said, 'You know, one time I was in Sunday School, and they talked about the sun standing still.' While they didn't believe him, they didn't have an answer either, so they said, 'Show us.'  "He got a Bible and went to the book of Joshua where they found a pretty ridiculous statement for any one with 'common sense.'  There they found the Lord saying to Joshua, 'Fear them not, I have delivered them into thy hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.' "Joshua was concerned because he was surrounded by the enemy, and if darkness fell, they would overpower them. So Joshua asked the Lord to make the sun stand still! That's right...'The sun stood still and the moon stayed and lasted not to go down about a whole day!' (Joshua 10:12-13)  "The astronauts and scientists said, 'There is the missing day!'<br><br>They checked the computers going back into the time it was written and found it was close but not close enough. The elapsed time that was missing back in Joshua's day was 23 hours and 20 minutes... not a whole day. "They read the Bible, and there it was 'about (approximately) a day.' These little words in the Bible are important, but they were still in trouble because if you cannot account for 40 minutes, you'll still be in trouble 1,000 years from now.  Forty minutes had to be found because it can be multiplied many times over in orbits.<br><br>"As the Christian employee thought about it, he remembered somewhere in the Bible where it said the sun went BACKWARDS. The scientists told him he was out of his mind, but they got out the Book and read these words in 2 Kings that told of the following story: Hezekiah, on his death bed, was visited by the prophet Isaiah who told him that he was not going to die.  Hezekiah asked for a sign as proof. Isaiah said 'Do you want the sun to go ahead 10 degrees?' Hezekiah said, 'It is nothing for the sun to go ahead 10 degrees, but let the shadow return backward 10 degrees.'  Isaiah spoke to the Lord, and the Lord brought the shadow ten degrees BACKWARD! "Ten degrees is exactly 40 minutes!<br><br>Twenty-three hours and 20 minutes in Joshua, plus 40 minutes in Second Kings make the missing day in the universe!" Isn't it amazing?

Hezekiah asked for a sign as proof. Isaiah said 'Do you want the sun to go ahead 10 degrees?' Hezekiah said, 'It is nothing for the sun to go ahead 10 degrees, but let the shadow return backward 10 degrees.'  Isaiah spoke to the Lord, and the Lord brought the shadow ten degrees BACKWARD! "Ten degrees is exactly 40 minutes!<br><br>Twenty-three hours and 20 minutes in Joshua, plus 40 minutes in Second Kings make the missing day in the universe!" Isn't it amazing? References: Joshua 10:8 and 12,13 and 2 Kings 20:9-11.<br><br>Forward this to as many people who you believe would think this is equally as cool. Never be afraid to try something new.
