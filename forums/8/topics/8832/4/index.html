            <div class='col-md body'>Dear colette,<br><br>Just like what i discussed with the old geezer from below, having those idiotic blondes with kiddy arrows around will only doomed your chances with the letter L. In fact, given my recent essay on espionage, i began to suspect that they might be moles or double agents in the employ of the old geezer from below.<br><br>Idiots and devious old man aside, don't you think you might need the service of a spin doctor? Someone who will image you into a less hostile, mean spirited, yandao hungry fox and potentially neurotic woman. Not necessary that you are all that but it would helps to project a more demure image. After all, I DO know what pacman have in mind.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>cheerio<br>hata-san<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by colette:</div><div class="quote_body">dear Hata-san,<br><br>you're assigned one or two or even more when you're born and you fire them at your own risk. maybe that's why i've no luck with cute pacman here even though i've worn my heart on my sleeve. heck, it's more than just on my sleeve, i've ripped it out and laid it bare for his inspection and yet he flees. *sighs*<br><br>colette getting sad</div></blockquote>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim<br><br>[This message has been edited by Mr Hata-san (edited 31 August 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Semi-demented and insane? My dear friend, there is absolutely no need to denigrate into such depths.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Colette,<br><br>Another tough question. I don't know how to answer that appropriately.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Of course some people know what I'm looking for. No need to name names. But, then, I have a thing for pony tails. mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Pony tails, hhoorhhorrrrrr...............<br><br>Mr Hata-san,<br><br>You sound better. I guess too much "I'm so sorry"s might not be that useful, so instead, I'll share with you one favourite move of mine.<br><br>1) Identify anyone that you fancy.<br>2) Wait somewhere where she will pass by e.g. outside of the lecture theatre after class.<br>3) When she walks by, call out her name to catch her attention.<br>4) Hold out your hand to take hers.<br>5) Pull her firmly (but don't dislocate her shoulder) towards you, preferbly spinning her into your arms.<br>6) Hold her by the waist bending her slightly backwards.<br>7) Lean close and look deeply into her eyes, then say something enticing like "I want you"<br><br>After that what you do is none of my business.<br><br>Some notes though.<br><br>Practice your gaze. At that close distance she won't be able to see any part of your face other than your eyes, so you'll have to convey everything through your eyes. Make sure they SMILE and ELECTRIFY. Practice in front of a mirror, stick Coco or Elva or Buffy's or &lt;insert favourite celebrity&gt; on the mirror and imagine you are looking into her/ his eyes.<br><br>In addition, warm up. Its one thing to firmly hold someone in your arms in a dashing bold move. Its another to collapse in a miserable heap on them as your back gives way because you didn't do enough warm up.<br><br>P.S. Tell me whether it works. I NEED to know.</div>
