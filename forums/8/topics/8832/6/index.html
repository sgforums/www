            <div class='col-md body'>Agreed! CouldnÂ’t have been truer. This is one massive game in which both sexes take part. Is it wrong for man to regard woman as playthings? Is it wrong for woman to consider rich and hunky looking guys? The answer is no and we deal as best as we could in this situation. There is always agendas hidden behind every one of us and morality doesnÂ’t play a part anymore. Sparks going off and going off again is so common but isnÂ’t doesnÂ’t that make the game more interesting?

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, james~,<br><br>I think that there is a different paradigm for people to be together as compare to the past.
