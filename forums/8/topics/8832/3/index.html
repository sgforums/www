            <div class='col-md body'>At long last...D-Day has arrived. As I slowly wind up my essay in my PC, I began to journey towards my date with destiny. I slumber towards the bathroom, knowing that any actions I take now will have consequences on my results later. I took a slow and hot bath, washing my lethargic feelings away. Slowly, I can feel my spirit raising. With that part of cleansing over, I stepped out of the shower and entered into my messy room. Books and notes piles across my bed and a lonely picture from my table top smile knowingly at me. I put the picture down and mumble, not today darling, I need all my energy and you know I canÂ’t do that when you smile this way at me.<br><br>The wardrobe open and my weapons laid at attention, ironed out nicely the night before. I selected a grey tattooed T-shirt and a pair of dark green soft pants, slipping them on. Moving on towards my cologne drawer, I choose my favourite, RalphÂ’s Safari. After all, I am going hunting today. Next come the accessories, my lucky death head ring and the corresponding brown chain the woman in the picture bought for me. I put on my glasses and check myself in the mirror. Yes, I am all ready. Time to head for the boat and the subsequent journey to the beach. I am all tensed up and canÂ’t wait for the day to pass up. Yes, it is that nerve wrecking.<br><br>Failure or Success? That will remains to be seen until 1800 30th of August. God, I pray for success and the courage to see me through this endeavour. Destiny, here I comes!<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just came back from the beach. Totally exhausted and mentally strained. One word, it was an unquestionable failure from the start of the operation to the end, unquestionable. My shirt is drenched with cold sweat and I smell of failure. I can hardly sit straight as I switched on my PC. The picture at my table top seems to laugh at me, and ending with, oh dearie, how did I ever ended up with you? Please my darling, I am too tired to argue with you and if only we hadnÂ’t ended with me talking to your picture instead of youÂ…ah, no point talking about it anyway. I am a loser<br><br>The sky was dark when the operation commence. I purposely entered the lecture hall late, so that I have a pretext of sitting next to her. This is the day when anything that can go wrong did go wrong for me. She was not around in the room and the whole class was looking at me as if I had just made a grand entrance. The lecturer even asked me if I need a red carpet treatment and if not, get my ass to the nearest chair and stop disrupting his lesson!<br><br>She was later than me and happened to sit in front of, to the left of me. Throughout the lecture, I was thanking my lucky stars, what a perfect view and OPS post to conduct my recon. I think she noticed it, because she looked up and brush her hair back so sensually that I nearly fall of my chair. The lecturer though I was showing appreciation of his finer points and dry humour.<br><br>I thought and I thought. What to do, how to approach. And finally, the lesson ended. I worked my way against the flow, trying to reach her whenÂ…she lifted her file and there, staring straight at me was a neoprint picture of her and a guy, smiling radiantly at me. My God, my spirit and morale collapse like I have been fed with German GPMG and stick grenade. She just brushes by me while I look ashen ahead at empty space. Â“Hi,Â” I mumble, Â“I canÂ’t help but notice you andÂ….Â” To a cold cold space.<br><br>So much for all the planning and debate over this question. The war has ended even before the battle has begun. I picked up battle weary bag and headed for home. What can I say or do? Nothing. I walked in silence towards the bus stop, waiting for the bus to take me home. As I was about to board the bus, I saw her rushing towards me. Hope springs eternal and I was about to open my mouth and greet herÂ…when the guy in the neoprint appeared behind her and hurried her on. I shut my mouth and board the bus. The well is getting empty real soon and I will soon thirst for hope.<br><br>The bus was real packed and I thought to myself, is this how I am going to answer to myself? Is this how I am going to give up the good fight? NO! She and her lovely dovey neoprint guy was standing in front of me (again) and was chatting happily away. Goddamm, I can even hear their conversation as I am typing away, toiling like a death bell. Last chance, the only chance I will haveÂ…I stared at her and she looked back. I smiledÂ…and she looked away, yawning as she does so. The guys beside ad behind her looked at me, dreading that they have lured the attention of a gay. My smile freezesÂ…and crumbles in despair.<br><br>The rest of the journey was pure hell. I swore to myself that would be the last time I am so thoroughly humiliated! I swear, on my gravest honour, so help me God!<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

Especially since everyone who knows you knows that you are such a pleasant dude to hang around with and it really is her loss that she doesn't know you. And from how you describe the boyfriend was looking at you, bah, could tell he was a loser anyway, afraid that you might come about and be a serious threat to him. Not to worry, join the club, there is nothing wrong with being a swinging bachelor yah??? One of these days, maybe we should go to some pubs and try to get picked up by gals yah?? Hahahaha, so much for role reversal. And in the meanwhile, we can simply lament about where all the nice gals have gone to.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dearest tet,<br><br>Still remember the time I stalked you out in the first BBQ organised by the forum? I was riding by in a bicycle, hoping to catch a glimpse of the one they called pretty tet. And God, in all his infinite wisdom, smiled on his poor sheep and I was lucky to catch you there at the pit, with your hat and your two pony tail. To say I was mesmerised is an understatement. Too bad you didnÂ’t catch a guy tumbling over his yellow bicycle and attracting the unfriendly attention of a German Sherperd.<br><br>From hence on, there exist a Â“stalkerÂ” by the name of hata-san. I look through every one of your posting and tried very hard to gain your attention. I had never tried so hard to catch the attention of a girl before, but I know this is no ordinary star. This is someone special and blessed is the man who can have her. And I strive to be that man. People had called my on line identity combative and psychotic but I donÂ’t care. I am, after all, seeking to capture the eyes of a particular individual. From the Singlish thread to the Veiny Arms thread, I pursue you with a vengeance. My keyboard knows no rest whenever you appeared.<br><br>And my efforts paid off. From annoyance, you began to reciprocate my attentions with a coy attitude, playing me like you would with an ardent suitor. I can ask for no more, This is more than enough for me. With that, email is the next thing we went through. I can still remember that you hate to spend time writing and insist we ICQ. Which again pleased me no end. That was the month my phone bills sky rocked higher than Space Challenger.<br><br>It took me close to 2 months just to have your contact number. You kept on asking me to those outings but I desist. I donÂ’t want to know how the rest looks like nor do I want to widen my social circle. All I want is to meet you and you alone. From keyboards to ear piece, we have indeed come a long way. My heart soars when you finally agree to a single date with me. So happy in fact, I wrote it out to share my joys with the fourmites. Happier still, was when I noticed how much you enjoyed my company.<br><br>And came the horrible news when I called you more than a few weeks back. Â“hata-san!Â” you shrieked,Â” You wouldnÂ’t believed what I did today!Â” Â“WhatÂ” I laughed back, Â“whatÂ’s so exciting my little kitten?Â” Â“ I just went ROM today with him!Â” You squealed with excitement and happiness.<br><br>I have no wish to go beyond what had happened that day. Suffice to say it was a very difficult week for me. I know you love to see me write, and woo you with my keyboards. There was times when I would write to you everyday, ignoring my essays and arguing with my brother over the usage of the PC. All this ended with that phone call.<br><br>Thanks for the encouragement and hug my dear little kitten. What is that gal in my class compared to you? Absolutely nothing and just somebody to while my time away now that you are happily married.<br><br>Â“When I fall in love, It will be forever,<br>Or I will never fall in love, againÂ”<br><br>Your love,<br>Forever,<br>Hata-san<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Serious? Please don't be dear friend. I have often been accused of being too serious at times. Think nothing of the gal in my class. If she is meant to be mine, it will be period. All this hassling and pontificating, all amounted to nothing much. She is just there to fill a vacuum in my heart and after today, i have absolutely no qualms about having a fling with her. Yes, I can be a bastard too. And why not, since the Cupid forsaken me, i shall do likewise to him too   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>My attention's guy? He is nothing compared to me. He doesn't write with a mean pen, looks uglier than me and i bet i have a bigger below than he does!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Jokes aside, there is really nothing much i can do about that. I have my diginity too, so i refused to even look at the gal in my class anymore. What's the big deal about her anyway? hehehe. Anyway, there is only one time i lower my dignity to the pits... i bent down on my knees to beg a gal...yes, it was that pathetic, and wept in front of her. Oh well, that was all in the past now. Of course, if crying can bring her back, i would willingly do it again.   :p<br><br>Sigh, i can hear my ancestors weeping in heaven, God bless their poor soul. I am sorry Ah Kong, i know i have let you down but hey, SNAGs are the in thing now, not the kind of pattern that Ah Ma used to like.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>I will be persistence pacman...but only to a gal...and to her only.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by pacman:</div><div class="quote_body">Mr Hata-san,<br><br>I was going to follow my last post with a more serious post but thought the better of it since I wanted to at least sound optimistic.
