An unknowing twitch of her eyes might be a signal, or it might just be dust in the eyes.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hahaha, Hata-san, so how was your attempt??? Sighzzz...... u r rite. Tet is a beauty, and so is Sparkle, but getting tips from them is nothing wrong. Ladies with such exquisite tastes can't possible give any wrong advises rite???<br><br>Hehehe, by the way, I think the "shy" image suits u. "Hello, may I know the time? Blah blah blah......ah damn, I just wanna know u, can we meet sometime??? Arghh, I am blushing" And walk off..... hehehehe..... where did I see this scenario from?? Hmm..... hahahaha<br><br>Hey Hata-san, must tell me ur success story ok???

            <div class='col-md body'>Well... I think you should just pluck up your courage and just approach her...<br>Try to get yourself seated next to her for your lecture (not too much colgne pls.. dun want to suffocate her do you ?) say hi then wait and see how her response is.. if she replies, then you can casually say sometthing like I have beening seeing you in lectures but i dun believe i noe your name.. mines' Hana- san.. What's urs ? I think if you are on the right track you will get a reply.. else if she dun even give you a look... better sit else where.. if you got through the introduction then just casually say/ comment on something abt the holiday breaks coming.. ask her about her plans for the holiday and then... ask if she wants to join you for your activites... but this too take some courage.. Good luck...</div>
