At that close distance she won't be able to see any part of your face other than your eyes, so you'll have to convey everything through your eyes. Make sure they SMILE and ELECTRIFY. Practice in front of a mirror, stick Coco or Elva or Buffy's or &lt;insert favourite celebrity&gt; on the mirror and imagine you are looking into her/ his eyes.<br><br>In addition, warm up. Its one thing to firmly hold someone in your arms in a dashing bold move. Its another to collapse in a miserable heap on them as your back gives way because you didn't do enough warm up.<br><br>P.S.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Array,<br><br>Thanks for the prep talk, deeply appreciated it. Yes, why should the task of chatting up a girl be so difficult? What's wrong with making more friends and getting to know pretty girls?<br><br>Problem is, most pretty girls don't subscrible to this attitude shown by us guys. More often than not, they tends to view men who don't have much in terms of looks at they would at flies when they are eating. Unavoidable but that doesn't mean they will show any courtesy to them. If not for the bloodshed that will blemish their silky hands, they will happily and willingly swat it. Cold stare is something primarily associated with pretty woman and one look can stop a red hot testosterone charged bull to to a sick piece of beef.<br><br>My ego and male pride has taken countless blows and dents to make much difference now but i will be damm if she takes me for a fool and return my smile with a bored yawn. I am just as big a loser as you r in getting girls and as for getting her...let's just say she has taken a backseat in my mind now. As moose mentioned, there are bigger fishes in the ocean to fry.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>cheerio<br>hata-san<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Array:</div><div class="quote_body">Mr. Hata San,<br><br>1)don't give a shit about what are u gonna say to her.<br>2)don't care what will she think if u move like that or this, or talk like that or this.<br><br>importanct things is that u sit close enough to be able to talk to her. say whatever topic comes in your mind at that time. don't worry if u are not confident, girls like boys when they know that he is nervous cos of them. cos u only feel nervous when u like somebody &amp; girls can see that very quickly.<br><br>make as much conversation as u can not worrying what it's about, make sure u smile &amp; make her smile.<br><br>i am the biggest looser in getting girls.<br>so not sure if my advise are gonna work. but do take the risk of trying them.<br><br>good luck. the whole team who have written so much for us is here to encourage u. u are gonna get her for sure.<br><br></div></blockquote>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>
