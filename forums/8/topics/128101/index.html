I can only see this person's nose and mouth, how mysterious is that??! lets all go and masturbate or something"<br><br>there you go, just follow the above steps and you will have thousands of retards just like you visiting your blog everyday. and what the Fuck is a blog anyways? who came up with it? as far as I know, it is some kinda of online diary thing. but the last time I checked, a diary is supposed to be private, no? why would anyone write a diary to let others see? thats just retarded. and what do bloggers do everyday anyways, read other people's blogs?? cool, maybe sometime in the future every blog in the world would consist of this article:<br>"wow today was a good day!!
