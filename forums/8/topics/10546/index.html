And just as life itself<br>is a gift that comes and goes in<br>its own time, so too, the coming<br>of love must be taken as an<br>unfathomable gift that cannot be<br>questioned in its ways.<br><br>Sometimes, hopefully at least once<br>in your life - the gift of love<br>will come to you in full flower,<br>and you will take hold of it and<br>celebrate it in all inexpressible<br>beauty. This is the dream we all<br>share.  More often, it will come<br>and take hold of you, celebrate<br>you for a brief moment, then<br>move on.<br><br>When this happens to young people,<br>they too often try to grasp the<br>love and hold it to them, refusing<br>to see that it is a gift that is<br>freely given and a gift that just<br>as freely, moves away.  When they<br>fall out of love, or the person<br>they love feels the spirit of love<br>leaving, they try desperately to<br>reclaim the love that is lost<br>rather than accepting the gift<br>for what it was, then moving on.<br><br>They want answers where there<br>are no answers.  They want to<br>know what is wrong in them that<br>makes the other person no longer<br>love them, or they try to get<br>their lover to change, thinking<br>that if some small things were<br>different, love would bloom again.<br>They blame their circumstances and<br>say that if they go far away and<br>start a new life together, their<br>love will grow.  They try anything<br>to give meaning to what has happened.<br><br>But there is no meaning beyond the<br>love itself, and until they accept<br>its own mysterious ways, they live<br>in a sea of misery.<br><br>You need to know this about love,<br>and to accept it.<br><br>You need to treat what it brings<br>you with kindness.<br><br>If you find yourself in love with<br>someone who does not love you, be<br>gentle with yourself.  There is<br>nothing wrong with you. Love just<br>didn't choose to rest in the other<br>person's heart.<br><br>If you find someone else in love<br>with you and you don't love him,<br>feel honored that love came and<br>called at your door, but gently<br>refuse the gift you cannot return.<br>Do not take advantage; do not cause<br>pain.<br><br>How you deal with love is how you<br>deal with you, and all our hearts<br>feel the same pains and joys, even<br>if our lives and ways are different.<br>If you fall in love with another,<br>and he falls in love with you, and t<br>hen love chooses to leave, do not<br>try to reclaim it or to assess blame.<br><br>Let it go.<br><br>There is a reason and there is a<br>meaning. You will know in time.<br>Remember that you don't choose love.<br>Love chooses you.  All you can really<br>do is accept it for all its mystery<br>when it comes into your life. Feel<br>the way it fills you to overflowing,<br>then reach out and give it away.<br><br>Give it back to the person who<br>brought it alive in you.<br><br>Give it to others who deem it poor<br>in spirit.<br><br>Give it to the world around you<br>in anyway you can.<br><br>There is where many lovers go wrong.<br>Having been so long without love,<br>they understand love only as a need.<br><br>They see their hearts as empty<br>places that will be filled by love,<br>and they begin to look at love as<br>something that flows to them rather<br>than from them.<br><br>The first blush of new love is<br>filled to overflowing, but as their<br>love cools, they revert to seeing<br>their love as a need.  They cease<br>to be someone who generates love and<br>instead become someone who seeks love.<br>They forget that the secret of love<br>is that it is a gift, and that it can<br>be made to grow only by giving it away.<br><br>Remember this and keep it to your<br>heart.<br><br>Love has its own time, its own<br>seasons and its own reason for<br>coming and going.<br><br>You cannot bribe it or coerce it,<br>or reason it into staying.  You<br>can only embrace it when it arrives<br>and give it away when it comes to you.<br><br>But if it chooses to leave from<br>your heart or from the heart of your<br>lover, there is nothing you can do and<br>there is nothing you should do.  Love<br>always has been and always will be a mystery.  Be glad that it came to<br>live for a moment in your life.<br><br>IF YOU KEEP YOUR HEART OPEN IT WILL COME<br><br>*********************************************</div>
