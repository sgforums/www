            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Sorry to learn of your plight.  I've had the experience of living alone.  And I always like to give the bad news first 'cos it gives a happier ending, so here goes....<br><br>CONS<br><br>- Lots of hidden costs from the time you move in (eg. eating utensils, cooking gas, utilities, SCV, property tax, TV/radio licence, etc etc.  Thousands!).  Curtains are a killer, cost-wise!  There are costs you've never heard of, like fire insurance, etc.<br><br>- Lots of stupid things to take care of (eg. water pipe leaking, aircon leaking, fridge goes kapoot, heavy rain with strong winds blows rain water in through the windows even when closed, toilet flush stops working, light bulbs start blowing, etc).<br><br>- Forget about having lots of free weekend time.  You have to clean house, wash/iron clothes, etc etc.<br><br>- You become a slave to your job because of the mortgage.  You'll never say "no" to any customer or boss again!<br><br>- Registered letter come also no one collect.  Wanna get someone to come and repair damaged things, or wanna move in new TV or furniture also must take leave because no one else is around to help.<br><br>- Sometimes a bit lonely.<br><br>- Sooner or later, you'll feel that the place would be more lively if there was someone to share with.<br><br>PROS<br><br>- A sense of belonging, something major to call your very own.<br><br>- No one complains when you don't do the dishes.  Just leave them in the sink and wash them when you want to use them next!<br><br>- Can save on clothes because can walk around naked.  But if you are deep frying food, watch out for those hot flying oil droplets!  Believe me, they hurt like hell if you kenah on the wrong place.<br><br>- Can make as much noise as you want (unless you have kaypoh neighbours, which can be hell).<br><br>- Almost absolute freedom!!  Which also almost corrupts absolutely....<br><br>- Can lock yourself in the toilet, sit on the toilet bowl (or lie in the tub), take hours and read a whole novel and no one will complain or knock on your door.<br><br>- If you are sharing your apartment with another, you can chase him/her out when you're not happy with the person.  You are the owner after all.<br><br>There's six of each for you, fair enough....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>yea, my biggest issue is cost or the rent and running the house and such. Everything you have to pay, clean, clear by yourself.<br>I nailed most things down to a routine.<br>You are on your own and don't expect people to take care of you and don't expect people to be kind, even if you are renting from people who you know, relatives of and kind of relationship. Its always about $. Don't go around and expect tenants to be nice and take care of you. Don't go and make enemies with existing tenants (my colleague got kicked out of her rented place by the existing main tenant and got a police report lodge that she stole), and be clean especially in public shared areas.<br><br>I do have a spare room and its quite a big room but because this place i rent has no landlord, its higher in terms of costs. And I am extremely particular about being disturbed or having to clean up after people. ie its subjected to my approval if I would allow anyone in. In the last 2 tenants I had, I've gone through hell. The Cheena brought her whoring affairs home. The malaysian girl stole, broke sinks, threw tantrums, dirtied the place, keep to odd hours, kick up much fuss, complain a lot, lied to landlady, introduced mosquito into the house, chalked up bills and denied everything and even refused to pay and she's such a evil bit.ch who always make herself out to be the victim that we singaporeans bully her. (Good riddance!) After these experiences of being nice to tenants, I am not sure about future tenants although I still tried to be nice when they left and I had to clean up after these people each time. But, I concluded  there are weird, nasty and bad people really. I didn't want landlady cause some of them are really dishonest people trying to get more rent than market rate, others thinks badly of local people staying on their own (stygma) and lastly some are plain overbearing nosy and oppressive. I had them all.<br><br></div>

Its best that you have some bunch of savings and income to fall back on.<br><br>The first time you move out will be shocking in many ways.<br><br>For me, I just did it. Overnight. Another long story, in a similar thread as yours but more drastic.<br><br>I didn't look back and now, I do not want to give up whatever I have achieve now. I am glad to move out.<br><br></div>
