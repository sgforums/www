INT.   RAIN SHELTER   - LATE NOON                                        2.<br><br>A bunch of people are gathered here to escape the rain. Tension and fear is high among them. Some are crying, some are praying, the mood weighs heavily upon them.<br><br>MAN 1<br>(breathing heavily)<br>Heh... heh... heh.... finally... heh... managed.... heh... to make it..... heh..... heh.....<br><br>WOMAN 1<br>Why did it have to rain now?! Why?!<br><br>MAN 2<br>At least we're safe now, don't worry my child, Daddy will protect you.<br><br>The folks try to comfort one another.<br><br>A lone man appears, hurried, shouting.<br><br>H'<br>Xueli!!! Where are you?! Xueli!!! Answer me!!!<br><br>H's runs around the shelter, searching frantically for his fianceÃ¨.<br><br>H'<br>No!!! Is she still outside?! I must save her! Xueli!!!<br><br>H' runs towards the doors, a few men charge forward and stop him.<br><br>Blocker 1<br>Don't be crazy!<br><br>Blocker 2<br>It's too late, it's gotten her now!<br><br>Blocker 3<br>Don't throw away your life so meaninglessly!<br><br>H'<br>No!!! Xueli!!!! Let me go! I must ind her!! (struggles to break free)<br><br>The 3 men hold him tighter as a few more gather round. A female voice is heard, screaming in pain.<br><br>FEMALE VOICE<br>"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....."<br><br>The scream fades off slowly, silence follows as the people try to listen for more sounds. It is so silent, heartbeats can be heard.<br><br>H' falls to his knees.<br><br>H'<br>No.... why?! Why.... Why wouldn't you let me save her? Why?! (cries) Xueli.....<br><br>No one answers him, nor has the courage to face him, they all remain silent as they watch him weep.<br><br>3.   EXT.   INFRONT OF AN ALLEYWAY   -   NIGHT		        3.<br><br>A female body is found dismembered, bloody splattered all over, there are signs that it has been eaten. A crowd gathers round.<br><br>H'<br>Xueli...(cries)<br><br>H's falls to his knees, his whole body goes limp from sorrow. Some try to console him, but to no avail. H' isn't able to respond to anyone.<br><br>4.   INT.   H'S HOUSE   -   NIGHT				        4.<br><br>H' seats  in a chair facing the window, staring blankly into the dark clouds as it begins to rain again. Behind him, the TV is tuned into the news.<br><br>NEWSCASTER<br>A lady's body was found earlier near an alley off Merchant Street. Cause of death is still unknown, many believe it is the Rain Demon. The guards have yet to establish the identity of the woman but a man at the scene claims it is his fianceÃ¨. Other casaulties were also found throughout the city... (fades off)<br><br>H'<br>Xueli.... (looks into a photo of the couple)<br><br>Tears run down his cheeks, his teeth biting hard. Mixed emotions of sorrow and anger can be seen in his eyes. He looks out the window again as a bolt of lightning flashes.<br><br>H'<br>It rains again...<br><br>Thunder.<br><br>H'<br>I'm sorry.<br><br>5.   EXT.   ROOFTOP OF A BUILDING   -   NIGHT          	        5.<br><br>A shadowy figure stands atop the roof, basking in all the glory of the rain.<br><br>SHADOW<br>Hahahahaha! Ahhahahahahahaha! Ahhahahahahahahahahaha! (he spreads his hands out as if to collect the rain).<br><br>Footsteps are heard below, a faint female voice gasping for breathe. The shadow looks down, his eyes narrowed.<br><br>SHADOW<br>Grrrrr (bents down) Another.... (smiles).<br><br>The shadow jumps off the rooftop with astounding speed. Screams are heard, sounds of ripping and tearing can be heard. And then, silence.<br><br>6.   INT.   ELDER'S CHAMBER   -   NOON			        6.<br><br>The townsfolk have gathered in the chamber of the elders, asking for action against this unknown menace.<br><br>ELDER 1<br>The mysterious rain has been going on for the past 5 months, sad to say, we've not been able to traced the source of this anomaly. But please rest assure that we shall not rest till we uncover this mystery of the rain demon.<br><br>ELDER 2<br>For now, we hope the townsfolk will be understanding and cooperative. We've taken steps to build more shelters all over the city so you can take cover as soon as possible. Though we do not understand why the demon doesn't enter buildings, but we will use this to our advantage to keep the people safe!<br><br>MAN 1<br>But this is getting out of hand! The rain comes as and when it wishes, the weather reports have been all but useless now! Are we to be subject to this random freak of nature? What of the monster? When can we be safe? Many people have left, and many more are!<br><br>MAN 2<br>Soon this place will turn into a ghost town! Can't you do something about this?<br><br>Man 3<br>What of the elite guards? Have all their training been in vain? Are they so useless against a mere demon? What have happened to the legends of the Royal Elites that charge into demon nests to rid mankind of even the vilest of creatures?<br><br>The crowd rallies behind him.<br><br>MAN 2<br>The next time it rains, send the guards out, we must stop this menace once and for all!<br><br>ELDER 1<br>But due to the random nature of the occurence, we don't even know when or where the monster will appear, we have placed a few guards on patrol, but it's been for naught! Unless we can pinpoint exactly where the demon will strike next, we're just punching in the dark!<br><br>MAN 1<br>Having a few guards on patrol is better than having no one on patrol at all. Isn't the purpose of their patrol for our safety? Are we suppose to resign to fate and let this demon do as he wishes?<br><br>MAN 3<br>I say we take the matter into our own hands, and stop this beast before it destroys our home!<br><br>The crowd rallies once more. And this moment, the skys churn, and thunder roars once again. The townsfolk stuck outside the building rush in, scrambling for the safety of a building.<br><br>A faint figure stands outside the premises. It's eyes glow red, causing the folks to panic.<br><br>MAN 2<br>Guards! Where are the guards!<br><br>ELDER 3<br>Guards! Send out the guards! Capture and slay this monstrosity!<br><br>As though like clockwork, sounds of hundreds of men marching forward in their heavl steel armour can be heard. Through the paned windows of the building, silhouettes of the town's heroes are seen in throngs, heading out of the building to take on the lone beast.<br><br>7.   EXT.   OUTSIDE ELDER'S CHAMBER    -   NOON                      7.<br><br>GUARD CAPTAIN<br>Ready your swords! First line, charge! (lifts up his sword and points towards the demon.)<br><br>GUARDS<br>Chaaaarrrrrrge!<br><br>As the guards charge forward, the demon smiles, his eyes glow even more. He jumps into the sky, and seems to hover there for a few moments. And then he dives into the crowd.<br><br>8.   INT.   INSIDE ELDER'S CHAMBER    -   NOON                          8.<br><br>The townsfolk watch in terror as the screams of the guards resonate throughout the building, through the tinted windows, shadows of men being thrown several stories high can be seen. The walls shake as bodies of the men are thrown violently onto the buildings, their blood is sprayed on the windows.<br><br>As more of the guards die, the rain grows heavier and heavier till it sounds as though rocks were being thrown onto the buildings. The people look up as though the roof would give way at any moment. Several knee down and pray for mercy, others start crying and wailing, it seems as though all hope is lost.<br><br>Finally the screams stop, and the rain returns back to it's pitter patter. Hours pass by but the folks remain cowering in fear in the chamber. No one dares to step out, no even go near the walls. Suddenly, something knocks on the door. Many people scream, the knocking gets louder, gradually turning into banging.<br><br>The doors give way, revealing a bloodied H', standing among some corpses.<br><br>H'<br>It's over.<br><br>The people stare wide-eyed at H', as they heave a sigh of relief, H' steps aside and the gruesome sight is viewed by all. The scene is so upsetting that several faint on the spot, others throw up, women scream.<br><br>The entire court was filled with blood, bodys and body parts were strewn all over, the rain falls, but the blood isn't washed away. The demon is no where to be seen, only the terror it has left behind.<br><br>9.   EXT.   CITY STREET   -   NIGHT                                                   9.<br><br>An entire stretch of street is littered with dismembered bodies, blood soaks the raining streets. Huge crowds gather around the police line, looking at the carnage that has happened. At a corner are some paramedics attending to survivors, rushing them off into the ambulances. A few journalists are at the scene, reporting into handheld cameras.<br><br>REPORTER 1<br>This is the 5th in a series of massacres that has taken place in this city. Like in previous cases, the bodies have all been dismembered, the entire streets sprayed with their blood. A few survivors were found but are in critical condition, they're being rushed to the nearest hospitals for immediately treatment.<br><br>REPORTER 2<br>The police commissioner is at the scene, but declines to be interviewed nor give any comments. Some eye witnesses claim they saw a gang of people just suddenly attacking everyone in the area out of no reason. But other rumors have it that this was done not by a gang, but by a single person, a demon of some sort.<br><br>At the back of  the crowds is a lone figure, unlike the others, he is observing, not gawking. His eyes run through the area, the noise of the crowd falls deaf on his ears, his only concern is for the scene. As some of the people disperse, the figure's face is revealed. It is H'.<br><br>H' turns around and leaves the area. He looks towards the sky, and speeds up his footsteps.<br><br>He keeps walking till a voice calls out to him.<br><br>RAIN DEMON<br>Why do you keep running away?<br><br>H' looks around, searching for the source of the voice<br><br>H'<br>(shouts)<br>Stop followine me!<br><br>RAIN DEMON<br>Accept who you are, what you're becoming.<br><br>H'<br>Have you not destroyed enough of my life? My home, my family, my friends, my love. you destroyed everything.<br><br>The owner of the voice walks out of the shadows and grabs H' by the shoulders. It is the rain demon, but in his human form.<br><br>RAIN DEMON<br>I've given you a new lease of life!<br><br>H'<br>No...<br><br>RAIN DEMON<br>Can't you see how wonderful it is? The things we can do, the powers we possess!! Why do you resist?!<br><br>H'<br>I don't want to be a monster... (pushes RAIN DEMON away) I will not be like you! (swings a punch at RAIN DEMON) I will not be a monster! (swings another punch at RAIN DEMON)<br><br>RAIN DEMON<br>(grabs H's fist) Fool! You can't resist it, no one can, no one will!!<br><br>The clouds above gather and it starts raining. RAIN DEMON starts to change into his demon form.<br><br>RAIN DEMON<br>ABRACE IT!<br><br>RAIN DEMON raises his hand above H's head and spreads out his palm. A pressure is directed down, forcing H' his knees, he screams out in pain as he starts transforming. Red bonds shoot out from his spine, tearing his clothes into shreads and start wrapping around H' forming a new layer of skin all over him, his hands turn into claws, his muslces bulge with renewed verocity.<br><br>H' blinks, then looks up at his master through his new eyes, he lets out a bloody curling roar, as though crying for the lost of his humanity, but also celebrating his new gained power.<br><br>RAIN DEMON laughs gleefully as his new creation.<br><br>RAIN DEMON<br>Come, my son. Let me show you the way of life.<br><br>Together, they jump into the sky and crash down violently onto the roof of a building, immediately after they jump towards another building, the force of their legs causing the ceilings of the buildingds to collapse, 1 after another, they travel till they reach a sky scraper and crash into the glass panels.<br><br>RAIN DEMON<br>(in mid air)<br>Tonite, we feast!<br><br>10.   INT.   H'S APARTMENT   -   EARLY MORNING                     10.<br><br>H's awakes as the early sun shines into his room. His body aches all over, he holds his head and moans. He slowly throws his legs of his bed to get up, only to have his legs step onto multiple shards of glass.<br><br>The pain jolts him from his sleep and he jumps up to see that his home is in ruin. A path of blood leads to the door. He turns around to look out the window and sees the entire city desecrated. Bodies lie in the open, police, firefighters, medics, nurses running around frantically trying to find survivors.</div>
