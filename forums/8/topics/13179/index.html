That guy will not be affected by gal B dressing and behaviour as his mind is set on gal A. Knowing that gal A is attached, that guy still persist on going after her proves that there is a certain level of liking that already existed to drive him to do so.</div>

Oh,n im taller n thinner den her but she is alrite size.She does sumtimes try 2 flirt with tt guy 2.However,he always flirts with me &amp; im very confused with the signals he is sending out.There r most probably 2 possibiltoes :either he's just fooling ard or he likes me.<br><br>So i wanna know how 2 tell or how 2 see the hints a guy drops...on whether he likes you or not.Coz sumtimes guys r quite hard 2 understand also.<br><br>BTW, i tink i've a crush on this guy but im already attached.....am i straying away or is tis quite normal as long as i dun do ne tin bad???<br><br></div></blockquote>Sigh....your case is really a complicated one. Actually the whole problem lies with you. You are straying away, face the fact. Ask yourself is your current relationship with your bf stable? I had asked b4. Is he the likely destinated guy you will like to spent your life with? If your relationship is stable, you can just ignore that stupid guy's flirting act.<br><br>Now i'm going to touch on that guy which you only provide vague info on him. 1stly, I donno how the rest think of that guy. But personally, as a sincere guy, i will NEVER NEVER tackle and flirt with a girl who is attached to someone else but max only to the extent of making great frn with her if i really like her. If the guy know the fact that you are attached and still carry on flirting with you. I really think either he got a serious problem in his head or he is really a playboy. 2ndly, i donno what you are seeing in this guy. Is he a better option to your current bf to be your destination or is it just because he is better looking than your current bf? Think carefully, look last only for a moment. It's the char, atitude and thought that matters. Think carefully, is he going to be a better destination for you? Is he mature enuff to think about future or is he just a good for nothing ah-beng on the street trying to seek out sex and fun?<br><br></div>
