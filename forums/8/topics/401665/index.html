              <p>Hi Bros and Sis of sgforums<br> <br> I got approached by a lady today for an iphone deal. She said that is a 
              very common kind of money earning for students like me. The iphone deal 
              is that i go and sign a new line for iphone, she pays for everything and
               gives me 300-350$. Then after 3 months, she terminates the line and pay
               for the phone bill and termination fee.<br> <br> I`m puzzled. Firstly, the cost of the termination fee, bills and cash 
              she paid already is more than what the iphone can sell. However, the 
              lady told me that she would make a profit if she exports the iphones 
              overseas. <br> <br> That leaves me pondering. 3 months phone bill + termination fee and 
              stuff + 300$ for me. The amount of money is already more than what you 
              can sell an iphone for. On top of that, she told me she would be paid 
              500$ for every successful iphone deal. Do the sums and the amount is 
              close to $2000. <br> <br> And if she exports, there is the export fee too. Where on earth would an
               iphone sell for more than 2000$ sgd? Maybe there is, but I don`t know.<br> <br> So my question is, is this a scam or what? Any fellow forumers have any 
              opinions or views or experience regarding this?</p>

              <p><br>You are an idiot truely. This type of scam is outdated. the line is under your name so depend on the plan probleably the phoe cost is already tagged and paid for inside the expensive plan. once you sign under your name the phone bill come to you under your name and you have to pay for it. she get the iphone and sell it, definately can get back the 300-350 she pay you outfront. The rrest on what every successful deal just bluff you 1. once she get the phone she will be nowhere in sight.</p>

              <p>Lets do some simple math using singtel shop:</p>
              <p>To get the 32gb iphone 3gs at $0, you have to sign a new iflexi premium plan at $205 per month for 24 months. Cutting out all those small admin and termination fees to make it simple.</p>
              <p>First 3 months bill adds up to 205 x 3 = $615, outstanding 21 months of 205 x 21 = $4305.</p>

              <p>Hi Bros and Sis of sgforums<br><br>I got approached by a lady today for an iphone deal. She said that is a very common kind of money earning for students like me. The iphone deal is that i go and sign a new line for iphone, she pays for everything and gives me 300-350$. Then after 3 months, she terminates the line and pay for the phone bill and termination fee.<br><br>I`m puzzled. Firstly, the cost of the termination fee, bills and cash she paid already is more than what the iphone can sell. However, the lady told me that she would make a profit if she exports the iphones overseas.<br><br>That leaves me pondering. 3 months phone bill + termination fee and stuff + 300$ for me. The amount of money is already more than what you can sell an iphone for. On top of that, she told me she would be paid 500$ for every successful iphone deal. Do the sums and the amount is close to $2000.<br><br>And if she exports, there is the export fee too. Where on earth would an iphone sell for more than 2000$ sgd? Maybe there is, but I don`t know.<br><br>So my question is, is this a scam or what? Any fellow forumers have any opinions or views or experience regarding this?</p>
