            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.ilovetheworld.co.uk/images/terminator2.t1000.jpg"><br><br>U think T1000 is impossible? The robot which can change shape in<br>Terminator  2. Think again. What was considered science fiction 50 years ago are reality now. T1000 is frigteningly possible through the use of DNA and molecular electronics<br><br>molecular transistors which can integrate into substances that are flexibe in nature like mercury and water can produce a "robot or computer" with the ability to process calculations! u will be able to see liquids or mercury changing shape, moving and able to think like robots and computers .<br><br>The ability of DNA to transfer electrons through the center of the double helix has been established by recent experiments. As biologists figure out what this means for medicine, nanoscientists are using DNA to assemble nanoelectronic devices. Several methods are available for using DNA a nanomechanical control system. The latest research into the mechanical properties movement of DNA is discussed with references, in particular, in vivo implications of supercoiling as an ionic switch.<br><br>Numerous molecules that can function as molecular scale wires [11], switches [12], transistors [13], and much more [7] have been characterized both by molecular simulations [14] and experiments [15]. Most of these molecular components have already been synthesized and characterized with traditional chemical methods, thus providing a supply of components that can be mass produced on the order of Avagadro's number (1 mole = 6*1023 molecules). So, you might ask: why do our computers still have only millions of transistors per chip? Major obstacles keeping molecular electronics from being feasible today can be divided into two categories: integration and interfacing.<br><br>Integration of the components involves molecular assembly, also known as supramolecular chemistry. Rather than patterning two dimensional semiconductor surfaces with doped regions, as is currently staple in silicon-based microelectronics, molecular electronics would have to assemble discrete molecular components into functional circuitry. Although tools such as scanning probe microscopy have demonstrated the possibility of manipulating single molecules, parallel methods of integration such as self-assembly and directed assembly are more promising aproaches [16]. While traditional chemistry and current methods of self-assembly result in imperfect circuitry [17], improvements in nanoscale chemistry are rapidly advancing [18].<br><br>Interfacing involves reading and writing to the molecular electronic devices. Being so small, there must be a way for us to communicate with the device by writing our input and reading the output. There are numerous methods that might be used for interfacing molecular electronic devices with our current microtechnology. Optical methods for interfacing seem to be one of the more promising aproaches. For instance, Martini et. al. [19] has demonstrated that electron transfer reactions can be controlled with femtosecond laser pulses. With lasers being one of the more coherent tools for reading and writing, optical interfacing may provide a convenient method for interacting with quantum devices [20].<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Researchers at Hewlett-Packard Co. have patented a potential breakthrough in their quest to develop computer circuits made of individual molecules.<br><br>Hewlett-Packard hopes to refine the process to create microchips as powerful as the next generation of silicon-based chips -- but 1,000 times smaller and less expensive.<br><br>That advance and others in the burgeoning field of nanotechnology could make computers small enough to be worn, embedded in materials or even injected into the bloodstream to serve as diagnostic sensors.<br><br>Computers are run by silicon chips crammed with millions of transistors that turn on and off extremely quickly. Because of the physical limitations of silicon, there is only so much room to add transistors, so there is believed to be a limit to how much silicon chips can be improved.<br><br>Scientists at Hewlett-Packard and other labs have proved that parts of some molecules can be made to swing open or shut, making the molecules themselves switches.<br><br>Such molecular-scale switches can be connected with chemical "wires" that are just six to 10 atoms wide, according to Hewlett-Packard researchers Stan Williams and Phil Kuekes and scientists at UCLA. They also have found a way to make the molecular systems run, even with the imperfections found in nature.<br><br>Researchers have been struggling to find an efficient way to connect such microscopic systems to larger integrated circuits that operate computers. One possible solution developed by Williams and Kuekes was awarded a patent this month.<br><br>The Hewlett-Packard researchers developed a chemical process and computer program that create some order to the molecular system and allow it to be mapped like a city grid. That would let the brains of a computer know where information is being stored.<br><br>Molecular computing researchers from Yale University and Rice University -- who, like the HP-UCLA team are partially funded by the military's Defense Advanced Research Project Agency -- have come up with a different solution to the same problem. Kuekes believes Hewlett-Packard's method is simpler.<br><br>"We think it's sort of the only serious solution so far that's manufacturable," Kuekes said Tuesday. "If this is to become a commercially viable technology, we have to be able to do this on a mass-production basis."<br><br>Rice chemistry professor James M. Tour called the Hewlett-Packard process "an interesting approach" and "another piece in the puzzle."<br><br>"They've mapped it out, which is important," said Tour, a co-founder of Molecular Electronics Corp., which plans to use developments in molecular computing. "But there's still some missing pieces that need to be filled in."</div>

"It's significant that we have moved from the incoherence we had in the solution state, and have progressed from molecules that behaved like pedestrians walking in a shopping mall to molecules that march like a united, well-trained army. Where molecules were previously swimming around incoherently in solution, now we see coherent molecular motion in a solid-state device. The molecules have the ability to recognize one another and line up in an efficient manner."</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>A molecular computer will enable us to do things we cannot even imagine now."</strong></blockquote><a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2000/08/000825082459.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2000/08/000825082459.htm</a></div>
