            <div class='col-md body'>Ok,was going through the past few days papers(didnt really had time to read until today)when I came across this letter.<br><br><strong>Nasty messages on T-shirts<br><br>I WAS offended by the messages printed on T-shirts worn by two young men in the Bugis Junction area two weeks ago.<br><br>One message in bold lettering said: 'I am surrounded by idiots.'<br><br>The other message was a large picture showing the 'third finger'.<br><br>The men moved around with their girlfriends among the crowds with an air of nonchalance.<br><br>Such a scenario must surely be deemed an infringement of the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act by the police because offensive messages were being flashed prominently by the wearers.<br><br>Woo Seng Hong</strong><br><br>Sounds like some self-righteous wannabe...Clearly this guy either has a bloody thin skin- or he's living in the past. People have the right to wear it and people who don't like it can either wear sunglasses and ignore it or at most(and if they know who's the guy who wore it) advice that person not to wear it.But you can't use the law to clamp down on it. It's absurb and unduly harsh. Not to mention stupidly retarded...<br><br>He must be 1 of those who call 999 about the white elephants cutting posted at the MRT.This kind of ppl has nothing to do and complain at the slighest things in life. The next thing he is going to complain about his neighbours hanging G-string on the pole and he could see them and give him an erection which is offensive.<br><br>By the way,the fellow obviously never been to cineleisure where there r stalls selling such t-shirts.</div>

There was one scene where Wolverine showed the 'third finger' to Cyclops with his claws.<br><br>Since the movie was shown at prime time (7.30 - 9.30pm), virtually everyone could see it! This is an outrage! Such a scene must also be an 'infringement of the Entertainments and Meetings Act' because an offensive gesture was shown on national TV!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> </div></blockquote>Why didn't they Mosiac the Finger if it was deemed to be Offensive ? They can also mosaic the bloody wounds and injuries in shows . The rate the show less violent and offensive.<br><br>Ultimately we can Mosiac News which show the copyrights of other TV stations.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
