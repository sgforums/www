              <p>Yes, if you are looking for a girl friend, fling or affairs, looks is important.  But if you are looking for a wife, looks is just a bonus, not a must.  I read from article in china paper few months ago about the advantages of marrying a ugly wife and it makes so much sense.</p>
              <p>I used to have gorgeous beautiful girl friends with body you can die for.  But it's not worth it.  Because they think they are of top quality, they are very demanding.  Meanwhile, the marginal utility of visual or sensual pleasure continues to decline.  After a few months, you will find that no matter how good looking a girl is, you just get used to the looks and it became just another normal face.</p>
              <p>It is like paying a higher and higher maintenance fees for something is the declining in value.  Sounds like a BMW to me.</p>
              <p>For guys, focus on the values of the woman. Moral standard is very important as well as family values.</p>
              <p>For girls, don't just focus on your looks.  One of my friend picked her wife because she has very nicely maintained toe nails.  He told me if a girl bothers and cares even down to her toe nails, you can be sure that she can maintain you and the family well.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>that's really being nice as  a brother. i mean it's pretty hard to find such person who is so sweet to his brother. but honestly speaking, how do u expect to help ur bro the find a gf thru net? that's really very risky.... =) though i'm sure there are some great people online, but i think it's better for him to look for his own and probably, he can get to know better girls outta, maybe in his workplace or so?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>u didnt even state details of ur bro and expect what kinda response? haha... anyway, good luck though. :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i'm sure if he's really that good, there'll be loads of girls queuing for him, so no worries, ya? =) cheers to that! and good luck to him too! Take care!</p>

              <p>No lah, pedicure not counted. it is not self-maintained. it's a minus point for girl because that means high maintenance fees.  why spend money and paint cartoons on your nails.  What we want to see is clean (no dark thing on the sides), nicely trim and polished self maintained nails.</p>

              <p>When a woman becomes a wife, they will tend to sacrifice alot for their family. They become your maid, your cook, your mother and someone who will share your financial burden. So in turn of value sense, we are more than there and is actually much underappreciated ok?</p>
