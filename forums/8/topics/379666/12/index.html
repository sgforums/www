              <p>Judges are no longer the old people that you think they are.</p>
              <p>Your assuming and what some plenty of ignorant folks have assumed.....is still part of your imagination, which you probably wont want it different.</p>
              <p>But life is such.  That when you push people beyond, then you better take the responsibility for it.</p>
              <p>And this time. Its pushed, and responsibility is being pushed back to the party.</p>

              <p>Bet that with the coming computer age such as forums etc etc...no sooner than later, there will be a court for forum, facebook,etc etc matters. I am not joking, that time, i may have to buy mee rebus for the judge.</p>

              <p>My intentions I can list it out now.  I want to see who she really is.  What she looks like, and how she deals with real people when its her turn to face up with what I levelled on her.</p>
              <p>Friends in cyberspace?  I am sorry to suggest that Ms Wong aka fanta g/f's pm tells me that she was cautioned against telling me her real name because I will turn out to be some scum after I have identified myself with my real name and photograph.</p>
              <p>Maybe you can also pm fireng for my real name and picture and conduct your searches. Because I do not hide, and I am pissed off with creeps that crossed me.</p>
