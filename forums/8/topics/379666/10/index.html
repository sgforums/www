              <p><br>My understanding, is that boys will be boys.  And I did categorise it as a prank or attempts at getting the little boys horny desires worked out.</p>
              <p>All I got was her pm telling me stories about how much you boys were threatening her in exchange for sex thru blackmail methods.</p>
              <p>And I always sided on the girls side, so I told her how to make sure you boys are stopped, properly punished for your crimes.</p>
              <p>And she turned around, to prevent to be victimised, when I ask for proper answers to my questions.</p>
              <p>Then she just keep harrassing and flaming you boys and various others on the forum.  While acting out her sweet innocent persona to the others.  Thats where I can't stay for.  So I have been digging out all her little lies and has been confronting her outright.  Including insulting her because I believe what I typed about her is a fact.</p>
              <p>So now since she went and lose control and say things who reflected her true self and upbringing.  I want to see who and what she really is made of.</p>
