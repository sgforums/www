In a dictatorship, the people work for the dictator.<br><br>But in most cases, goverments work for the greater good of the State, with the mandate of the people. So people generally vote for parties that represents their idea of what is best for the state (and their own private interest) and live by the authority of the government, until they decide to vote it out of office in the next election.</div>

What is this serial number for? This serial number denotes that you have made a charity by voting. If you have not done so- then you will face a lot of problems in the society...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess that sometimes when the government makes an unpopular decision, people will say that the government is being a dictator.<br><br>It is impossible to please everyone, and since Singapore is a small country, it's easier to implement certain policies without much difficulties. Try banning chewing gum in the States, I think the nest day, the White House will become a more colourful building.<br><br>The government has a hard time trying to balance things, maybe it's because things have been don in this manner, so just follow. When they stop giving incentives, people will complain and say the government not helping them. If incentives are given, then people will say that the government is not letting the people think for themselves. Personally, I prefer the government do less. At least, this will force the people to be more independent. However, people with independent thinking will create havoc for the government, so, in order to not be in this situation, the government implement a 'win-win' strategy, maybe more win for them than for us.<br><br>Either you have a free mind and a chaotic nation or a follow-the-leader mindset and a peaceful nation, well, the choice is up to you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"Either you have a free mind and a chaotic nation or a follow-the-leader mindset and a peaceful nation, well, the choice is up to you."<br><br>lonewolfe, are you absolutely certain that those are the only viable options? Is a genuine civil society that unattainable? Must the cost necessarily be in the form of increased crime rates, riots, social unrest and neighbourhoods reduced to filthy slums (to borrow a notorious word used by the PAP in the last GE)? Is it necessary that the local press be censored, for example, to ensure peace? Do the so-called "foreign agendas" actually exist in the paranoid form our leaders speak about? Our government polemicises this issue - Peace VS Chaos, juxtaposing safe and clean Singapore with the scruffy-looking United States. Whether that argument is valid or not, the choice is up to you. Personally, it's a great excuse for extreme political harshness. There are other countries in the world that are able to accomplish, to various extents, what Singaporeans here can only dream of.<br><br>A thinking, participatory citizenry cannot appear by mere implementation of government policy. Our courtesy campaigns hardly got us anywhere, and its goals aren't anywhere as lofty as this. The entire top-down, autocratic style of leadership must be seriously reevaluated and, if necessary, scrapped.</div>
