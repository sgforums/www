              <p>SEOUL - SOUTH Koreans mourned the loss of a 600-year-old building
              designated as the nation's top cultural landmark, which collapsed in
              ruins early on Monday after catching fire.</p>
              <p>Police said they are investigating whether arson sparked the
              blaze at the Namdaemun gate in the heart of Seoul, one of the few
              historic structures to have survived the 20th century Japanese
              occupation and Korean War.</p>
              <p>'People must feel hurt by the fire,' president-elect Lee
              Myung-Bak, a former city mayor, said after touring the site. 'This is a
              symbolic place that people want to visit whenever they come to Seoul.'</p>
              <p>Cheon Ho-Seon, spokesman for current President Roh Moo-Hyun, expressed grief at the 'indescribably regrettable' blaze.</p>
              <p>'It was our heritage, more significant and more symbolic than any other cultural asset,' he said.</p>
              <p>Ordinary Koreans inspecting the sooty and charred debris also expressed grief.</p>
              <p> 'It is heartbreaking,' said Kim Duk-Il, 40, a visitor from the southern
              city of Daegu, wiping away tears. 'The gate had endured 600 years,' he
              told AFP. 'It remained OK even during the Korean War. I still cannot
              believe this. Our pride has fallen down.'</p>
              <p>The ornate two-storey building on a stone base, the city's
              oldest wooden structure, caught fire on Sunday evening. Scores of
              firefighters battling the blaze believed it was under control late on
              Sunday but it flared up again.</p>
              <p>Yonhap news agency said a taxi driver who reported the fire
              told investigators he saw a man in his 50s climb the stairs to the gate
              shortly before the blaze started.</p>
              <p>A police forensic team was on Monday sifting through debris
              at the site, which was surrounded by scaffolding and a screen.</p>
              <p>'Police have not drawn a conclusion yet - whether there was a
              short-circuit, arson or an accidental fire,' Kim Yong-Su, captain of
              the Namdaemun police station, told reporters.</p>
              <p>'Police are still investigating this with all possibilities in mind.'</p>
              <p>He said three witnesses reported a suspected arsonist but they were giving 'confusing' testimony.</p>
              <p>The gate, a major tourist attraction, was originally
              constructed in 1398. It was rebuilt in 1447 and has since been
              frequently renovated. Some pillars dated back to the original
              structure, a rarity in Seoul.</p>
              <p>Japanese colonialists razed several historic buildings during
              their harsh 1910-45 rule and much of the city was destroyed during the
              1950-53 Korean War.</p>
              <p>'It's devastating: the pride of the nation has collapsed.
              It's so bad this kind of thing happened on the first weekday of the
              Lunar New Year,' Kim Cheol-su, 55, told Yonhap.</p>
              <p>The agency quoted firefighters as saying the Cultural
              Heritage Administration had asked them to tackle the blaze cautiously,
              meaning they could not quickly break into the area where the blaze
              started.</p>
              <p>The landmark, surrounded by modern office buildings, is officially named Sungnyemun or 'Gate of exalted ceremonies'.</p>
              <p>It was the southern gate in the walls that surrounded Seoul
              during the Chosun Dynasty of 1392-1910. It is adjacent to Namdaemun
              market, a centuries-old market popular with locals and tourists alike.</p>
              <p>The Cultural Heritage Administration forecast a long and costly restoration.</p>
              <p>'Experts estimate that it will take two to three years to
              rebuild its architecture and cost some 20 billion won (S$29.8
              million),' Shim Dong-Jun of the historic architecture division told
              AFP.</p>
              <p>'It's like losing a family member,' said Kim Jae-Bun, who has
              run a drug store nearby for 30 years. 'I never imagined it would burn
              down so helplessly.' -- AFP</p>
