Apparently, PhD holders are very much in demand for these 2 industries. My lecturer told us that poly grads qualify as "test tube cleaners", while degree holders only qualify as "lab assistants" in these kind of industries. Only PhD holders allowed to do research.<br><br>If u get a PhD in Biz, quite useless.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Phd. do not need experience. Just need a professor who is willing to take you in. Also, need university administration not to block the application, which is not a problem usually if it is recommended by professor.<br><br>Master in Singapore usually require at last a 2nd upper honours degree in relevant subject for research type. Then it is up to you. For classroom type, usually alot easier. Just need to check with the relevant university that there is a course available and apply for it. And hope you have the minimum qualification for it. MBA may need experience for prestigious universities, since you can expect VPs and senior managers or even CEOs among your classmates.<br><br>As for the use, it can differ alot. From totally useless to being a requirement for some jobs. At the extreme, it can even hurt your employment opportunity. So, there is no single answer.</div>

So whats stated below might be useful if you are considering an engineering PhD...<br><br>I think its feasible to have a PhDs in Singapore since its moving into a research based economy.<br><br>As for the salary range, it depends on what kind of area you are working in...but generally it may be ard the range of say 3500-5000 starting? I'm not sure about MSc though...could be a couple of hundred dollars more than a first class honours degree....<br><br>In general, DO NOT go into a PhD programme just for the sake of money. You'll find that the time spent in doing a PhD might not be reflected in your pay. I have seen some of my colleagues suffering here. Most important is that you love doing research and love creating knowledge. If you dislike doing research, most probably you might have a real hard time in your 3-5yrs PhD programme.<br><br>To qualify for a PhD in Sg, its preferable to have a 2nd upper degree (I'm not sure if they do take in 2nd lower) and a supervisor to take you in. Of course work experience do count though I'm not sure if some supervisors prefer fresh grads or industry-experienced postgrads.<br><br>You could write your own research proposal or look at each prospective supervisor's website. Emailing them to discuss about your aims and objectives might also be a good idea.<br><br>A PhD programme work both ways: you need a good supervisor who is willing to support your work while your supervisor needs good student.<br><br>If you are unsure, you might consider doing a full-time MSc first which I personally think its worth it. MSc program will give you a good foundation which you may use in your PhD work. Generally, MSc graduates have an easier life in their PhD programme.<br><br>I hope that helps a wee bit...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
