First you have to state the interest in the product and its adv/effectiveness. During the interview, you could also ask qns regarding abt the possible weakness.<br>This type of project i have done umpteen times in poly</div>

Perhaps you can do voluntary stuff for them. Check out whether they are going to have any promotions or roadshows kind of events.  Then offer to help out for free.  I have come across students offering that to local leisure attractions to do their projects.</div>

In that sense you could prove to be of certain help to them... CONVINCE THEM... You'll need to be doing ALOT of that in your future careers....<br><br>And I believe. It's always MORE CHALLENGING and MEANINGFUL to pick a product which is not so popular to market.. Afterall.. That's what 'marketing' is all about yeah?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
