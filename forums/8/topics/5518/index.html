            <div class='col-md body'>I wouldn't leave and migrate to another nation if you want my opinion on your post. Although Singapore is a small country and places of interest start to run out because we have lived all our life here, due to the size of our little state it is easily managable too. That means crime rate is low. With such law abidding citizens in Singapore, why choose to go somewhere else where trouble occurs ever so frequent?<br>The education system in Singapore is too quite a success unlike certain other nations which i won't mention country names have a major failure education system. Yes, the tension between nations in our Asia region is rather tense and our relationships with Malaysia still isn't that good at the moment and they stopped selling water to us, and we will probably collaspe if no one trades with our nation because we rely heavily on foreign trade and exchange. That is no reason to start abandoning the country either.<br><br>Once we have decided to migrate and step into a alien nation we would have to start almost everything from scratch again and it will be a slow process. I can't stand the lonliness of being in foreign nation all alone. You can say that i resist changes quite alot in all senses.<br><br>To conclude...<br>Nope, I would not migrate even if i have the finance support &lt;g&gt;</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes I would migrate..<br><br>Many whould think that its is unwise to do so with our "safe" (read controlled) enviroment. But after being ovrseas for sometime. I have seen the good and bad of living in another country.<br><br>There is nothing wrong with Singapore except that I feel that the govt control the people. The country is controlled by fear. Fear of speaking out your opinion.<br><br>Also without natural resources soon Singapore will be nothing but a major financial hub. Where i feel only the smartest will survive with a comfortable earning level.<br>This is what worries me for the future generations. Can they take the stress?<br><br>Sure Singapore is safe with strict gun controls and all. But guns are not the only thing that kills. Cars do that too.<br><br>And finally open spaces. Yes its is nice to have big open spaces for the weekends.<br><br>This is just my opinion. I am sure some will feel like I do and others will not. To those that feel that I do. I wish you all the best and hope you fulfill your dreams.</div>
