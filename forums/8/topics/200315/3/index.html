            <div class='col-md body'>Well, everyone if poly and uni life is tough , wait till you move into the working society. Poly is project based which is very much preparing you for your time in university or ya working life outside. You have to learn to work with all kinds of people , the responsible and lazy ones , the clever and the slow ones. Do not expect to survive alone in the society. You will more likely die alone.<br><br>JC is no way easier than Poly. In yr1 , you gotta make sure you pass your exams to promote. In yr2 , you gona do well enough to make sure you get to a decent course in uni.<br><br>After which, your time in Uni will be a totally different experience as compared to JC or Poly life though I agree that poly makes that transition much smoother. So , do try to adjust to life in poly or else you might struggle in the working society.</div>
