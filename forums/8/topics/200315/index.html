It may not be easy and stress sure will abound, but that doesn't mean other education areas are less stress. As some said here, JC is also taxing and so is ITE. Even private studies are not spared.<br><br>You think working with ppl sucks, but note that when you go to work, you WILL work with ppl all the time, whether you like it or not and I do not even want to mention NS. There are far worse things imaginable awaiting young ignorant males with all the politics, tai chis, etc, etc.<br><br>Perhaps the course you study is a pretty big rush. Shooting you with endless projects and such. <strong>If you have difficulty, consult the lecturers there</strong>. You do not pay the $$$ for nothing. And if you have personal issues that affect your performance, consult the councellors there too.<br><br>Remember, you are not alone in this sh*t. Many are in this sh*t with you too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>alterdesire u jus have to deal with it until u are numb when it comes to stress, it helps u manage better next time be it poly or working or NS. Suck it all up, stay up all night to do, when u hand it up u will feel extremely happy and satisfies and most of all proud of urself.<br><br>I once slept 3 hrs every night for a week to finish my assignment, its very unhealthy actually but its the kind of mindset that i have grownt o have. I had tremendrous suicidal stress during my sec 3 years, i learn from there and now i can manage better.</div>

I just donÂ’t know what to do now, Sometimes I donÂ’t go to school because I already cannot finish my old work and am not ready to take on new ones. I feel like quitting poly and going to JC or something. At least there ur academic performers doesnÂ’t depend on 3 or 4 other ppl. I donÂ’t even have time to sit and watch TV anymore. What should I do? How can I handle all this? Need answers from ppl who have successfully gone through all this?</div></blockquote>Woah...<br><br>Guess u must be in year 1. I think u already have a misunderstanding in the first place...<br><br>Poly life = fun? that was 5yrs ago, when I was still in year 1. I went to play pool during breaks, never did my tutorials, skipped lectures, etc etc... I played throughout year 1 and paid a high price for it during yr 2 onwards.<br><br>This is the 2nd time I'm re-enterring Poly for re-training. This time, I have become smarter, working hard right from the beginning.<br><br>Life is not that bad afterall, if u work hard and do everything on the ball.<br><br>1) DO NOT pile up your work like what u have done now.<br>2) Weekends, and the breaks in between lectures are good times for u to finish your work.<br>3) NEVER skip lectures and tutorials, tips are often given out during lectures, and tutorial are to clear out doubts.<br>3) FORGET about TV programs, u'll have plenty of time for them during your holidays.<br><br>Having projects are just helping u to pass the module, if ur grp had score well for the project, u will have have so much stress during ur final paper.<br><br>When u are out in the real world, u'll have to work with all kinds of ppl with all "different attitudes" as well. Why not take this chance to train urself to work with such ppl?<br><br>The more u avoid working wif the ppl u dun like, the more often u will have to work wif them eventually.<br><br>Remember there is no free lunch in this world.<br><br>Work hard and keep a positive attitude. 3 years will be a breeze, and the time u finish poly, u will miss these 3 years.</div>
