If you know how to enjoy life, of course it will be slacked and fun. The reverse is true.<br><br>There are a lot of activities in poly to de-stress. Even if you have no wish to join, go out with your friends, have a good game of soccer, LAN, etc to de-stress. After that, then continue with your work.<br><br>To lessen your stress, try reading up before your lectures and tutorials. If you can understand certain parts well, it will save you time of asking your lecturers. Spend this extra time on your projects or asking about the parts which you don't understand.<br><br>As for working in groups, this is part of life. You've got to adapt. When you stepped into the working world, you will work with even more people with even more varied personalities. To handle them, ask yourself this question: Are you a leader or a follower or somewhere in between? If you are leader, try not to lead for most of the projects, to lessen your burden. If you are a follower, don't keep quiet all the time. Voice out your displeasure if you really can't cope. Compensate for that once you have more or less finished your stuffs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually it all have to depends on how you look at it.<br><br>I'm currently a year 3 student, and doing my final year project (FYP).<br><br>It completely suck big time when the most important project so far in ur life is working with pple who are COMPLETELY UNCOMMITTED!! When you are the leader, it makes things even worst..<br><br>Imagine this guy that needs to come up with a maximum 15 page report. And he gave you 3 pages. Yeah, its true that it is still valid. But hey, a suicide alternative? Are you supposed to finish his part of the project?<br><br>Thats not all. You arranged a meeting with client and sent this guy there (because that guy requested i do the arrangement). And in the end, because he overslept, you get so much remarks and ur group gets so much "reputation".<br><br>How are you supposed to score with such group members? Honestly?<br><br>No solo, or the whole group fail the entire FYP.<br><br>I say, it all have to depend on your luck, how the grouping of project goes.<br><br>Yet another is when you offended this guy who has so much influence that has the power to isolate you out of the whole group. That sucks even more than you can ever imagine. It would have been like, eating alone, studying alone. And any other people have their own group of friends.<br><br>----------------------<br><br>Generally, the project has to depends on your luck. It's much more flexible and relax. But perhaps TOO flexible for things like isloation, boyclotting to take place.<br><br>I came from express stream in secondary school. I believe if you maintain your discipline, poly shouldn't be too much of a problem. Poly don't really give you the atmosphere to study, so you need to have a certain amount of determination..</div>

All the 3 years that I have spend there is the most precious that I ever had. Even now in NS I missed the days in poly. All the project works are bits and pieces lessons that teaches teamwork, attitude and social communication. If u r giving up so easier now just because u couldn't work with some ppl then how do u face your future working in a company with ur colleagues. Dun tell me u r gonna switch job if someone u meet during ur work is a jerk.<br><br>Workload is poly is much lighter as compared to JC. When I attended my first 3 mths, I could hardly even think abt play. Tats y I went over to poly. I think the key problem should be time management.<br><br>Here are some keys to my survival in poly<br>- Choose ur group mates wisely<br>- Do tutorials ahead of time<br>- Dun think ur lecture notes is gonna save u, abuse the library<br>- Get to know ur lecturers, they provide good source of info</div>
