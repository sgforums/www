            <div class='col-md body'>I been through 2 yrs of JC and 3 yrs of Poly.<br><br>I think Poly is much better than JC.<br><br>In JC, you have to wear uniform, squeeze for bus early in the morning, must be in proper attire everytime, tonnes n tonnes of tutorials, more tests and exams to handle, holidays you don't get to enjoy as you are struggling to mug for exams and tests, and there are mountains of homework to do as well. Hardly no life at all.<br><br>Oh yah, JCs have projects as well. Much tougher than poly projects I feel as you need to do lots of typing and powerpoints for presentations. There are PE lessons as well. Imagine going under hot sun to jog then come back for lessons in proper school uniforms again. There isn't much time for entertainment daily as you are tired out after doing your tutorials and stuff.<br><br>As for poly, of cos there are tutorials and projects as well of course. But then tutorials are managable if you did the small bits everyday, and not accumulated them at last minute. Some of my friends liked to copy answers to hand up, then some don't even bother to turn up for lessons or lectures.<br><br>Personally, I think, those who don't bother to turn up are just escapists and kind of stupid as well. You pay so much money to go poly just to skip lessons? Somemore, have to buy MC to escape, worth it or not?<br><br>In poly, is true you get to meet more kinds of people, as compared to Jc. JC students the most scary ones are those who always do tutorials, do past year exam papers, and do universitiy exam papers as well one. Those kind can freak you up when you study with them. They got tutions somemore, for your information.<br><br>As for poly, you get to meet slackers and people who are lost sheep. They have no ideas what to do, no motivations and skip lessons all the times. But still you get to meet some good ones, where they are serious in learning but also good in chatting. During year one, I get to meet some of them and we always do tutorials during our long break times and gossip here and there.<br><br>We also share our learnings together, encourage each other and help each other in projects. Good and sad part is we don't get to be together after one semester as our timetables will be different ones, but then we do get the chance at the same times to meet new people. Good also if you don't get to see people you hate lah. Haha.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Poly life can be relaxing and smooth when you have good timetable, with proper breaks and stuff. But could be hell also if your lessons all fall in wrong timings.<br><br>Confirm will get one or two times bad timings lah, like 8 am for lab work, then it means 6 am to wake up.<br><br>But then you still get to go home earlier compared to JC or ITE. Sometimes, 2 to 3 hours you go home liao. Song Bo?<br><br>As timetable change each semester, so don't worry if you have bad time for once.<br><br>Jc timetable don't have much changes, only more makeup lessons only after school!<br><br>They arrange like 4 pm stay back for extra lessons and don't forget you have to stay back after school for project meetings as well. Then somemore you need at least 1 CCA!<br><br>Poly hard part is meeting for projects lah as especially when your group members all have different time slots. But then it is time management matter and poly you don't really need CCA points unless you want to go Uni lor.<br><br></div>
