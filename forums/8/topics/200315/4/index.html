            <div class='col-md body'>To me school life is never stress. You say JC stress? All my JC friends enjoy their 2 years in JC. I even see my friends go out and play sometimes. They don't really keep on study and study. Seriously.. It depends how you plan your time. Poly can be stress if you really wanna chiong to the top. Imagine Doing 10++ project for 7 module within 4 months. But i still enjoy those good old days. If you cannot even handle stress in JC or Poly. What happen when you go NS? I think you will commit suicide straight away. So just try your best.</div>

However, now that I am actually in it. It is anything but fun to me .<br><br>I have never been so stressed in my life before. There so many projects to do but at the same time I must also do tutorials and study for common test. I just canÂ’t seem to handle them all. The worst of worst is that I need to work in groups. Working with ppl just sucks big time and it just adds another big bag of stress onto me, each one have their own personality..<br><br>I just donÂ’t know what to do now, Sometimes I donÂ’t go to school because I already cannot finish my old work and am not ready to take on new ones. I feel like quitting poly and going to JC or something. At least there ur academic performers doesnÂ’t depend on 3 or 4 other ppl. I donÂ’t even have time to sit and watch TV anymore. What should I do? How can I handle all this? Need answers from ppl who have successfully gone through all this?</div></blockquote>lol im exactly the same scenario as u roflmao</div>
