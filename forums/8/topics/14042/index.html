            <div class='col-md body'>1) Tudong Issue, they make noise. Muslims killed in Indian cities riots, no sound at all, not a whimper.<br><br>2) Water issue, although it was already a contract, they chose to change it. Now, they want the demolition of causeway and land reclaimation to be included in the water issue asserting that we are unfair. So we say, ok, destroy causeway and build bridge, then what happens? Ships go to their port and not ours. Many PSA people become unemployed, our economy suffers thru lost of business. Then they say our reclaimation disrupts their livelihood. Then as if their actions against us do not disrupt ours?<br><br>3) So they raise water price although it was already in contract but they chose to ignore it. So now 3 sen. next 8 rinngit? That is 267 times price hike. So today we pay $50 per household for water, how many can afford to pay $50x267= $13350 for water per month? Sure, most costs are not in water itself but in filtreation and infrastructure already paid for. So assuming we only pay 10 times more, that will be $50x10= $500 per month for water alone.<br><br>So they want us to give our business away to  their ports. So they know that we will give way because we need their water no matter how high the cost to survive.<br><br>3) When Sg people go Johore to spend money, they say we gif them inflation and we are arrogant. When financial crisis 4 years ago and sg people cannot afford to spend there, they said we lousy neighbours and kiasu.<br><br>Can Sg survive with these type of neighbours?<br><br>If not for the fact that we have a strong SAF, we early early kena makan by them or Indonesia already. Therefore, national service is proven to be a very good deterrent.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> DuH<br><br>------------------<br>yeah yeah yeah, boogie woogie spit it out at <a href="http://www.my77thstreet.com" rel="nofollow">www.my77thstreet.com</a><br><br>[This message has been edited by blurblop (edited 15 March 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>size does matter i suppose.<br><br>after all, s'pore was part of malaysia once. So naturally if they could, they will make s'pore part of them one day, then they can seize our global market position.<br><br>In politics, ppl always chio chio u coz u have soomething they want. In this case, we have a PSA that they wanna topple. So naturally anything that may "affect" their pelapas port will give them reason to make some noise. LAnd reclamation on our side of the border notwithstanding.<br><br>Their own malay community was condemned by Dr M for being lazy and behind the times. They could have become a competitive port based on their own merit. All they needed was a committed and hardworking people. As it is, even the ethnic chinese in M'sia are restricted from excelling too far ahead of their fellow malays.<br><br>In fact let me deviate a little.<br><br>Back when the merger was still in place, LKY tried to rally the ppl behind PAP using a Malaysian Malaysia policy. His aim of meritocracy was shot down by UMNO coz they knew in a straight fight, the ethnic chinese population would approve of that idea. Hence, working in the best interest of the Malay community, they waged a campaign that would woo the predominant malays to vote in their favour.<br><br>It worked and s'pore separated. But what is the result now? They have become more petty, less innovative and frequently resort to bullyboy tactics to stamp their "authority".<br><br>What is the underlying reason for raising the price of water? They know we are looking into desalination as a way out, hence now is the time to prepare a new contract with an absurb price for water b4 we loose this dependency.<br><br>And what will happen to all their excess water then? They have water in abundance to support their population. Why haggle over a price when they know they are the only practical source for us at the moment?<br><br>The answer is simple. To do business, one has to be mercenary. There is no such thing as frens at the negotiation table. In their position, they can throw a package on the table and we have little or no bargaining power. Hence, all they need to do is play up their media to apply extra pressure on us, and that will pretty much cut off our manoeuvrability at negotiation.<br><br>A hush hush deal would have been amicable for both sides. Thus its rather sad that the media had to become involved.<br><br>[This message has been edited by BillyBong (edited 15 March 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hm...seriously, frm Singapore's point of view, Malaysia is indeed a bully. but come to think of it, Singapore is oso trying to exlpoit M'sia by selling treated water at a high price back to Msia. frm this, we can see tt if singapore was in msia shoes and msia was singapore...singapore would most probably had done the same..</div>

If fact, Johore ordered more treated water from sg than what was contracted. If it is high, why they order double and not build their own retreatment plant?<br><br>Here's why. We are selling them at a loss. The treatment cost is more than the sale price and yet we sell them more than what was contracted. Why? We give face mah at our loss mah. Who pays for the losses? Your tax, GST, high petrol and high cost of living. You are affected although you do not know why, ain't it?<br><br>Our Ministry had released the figures on the costs of water<br><br>treatment before. Check it out.<br><br>What about they want us to demolish the Causeway so that ships can go to their ports instead of ours? PSA is one of our country's main income earner. It provide jobs not only for their employees, but generate employment and businesses for thousands others. For example, the suppliers for logistics to ships, sailors coming on shore to spend thus contributing to jobs in the tourist industry, ship building industries, petroleum industries, construction industries, suppliers of steel and labour...the list goes on and on....<br><br>I recognise that competition is business. But do we have to cut off our legs to give to our neigbours so he can hve three legs and we only have one?<br><br>Do we have to give way to them under duress or worse, at gun point? Not an extreme example as the threat of cutting off water is as good as at gunpoint as both also kills. Only that gun kills you. Without water, our whole country perish.<br><br>Just think, if we buy our water so much more expensive and lose our port at the same time, can our country survive? What about all the factories that need water? They pay more right? So they must factor in their costs for the extra payment isn't it? So goods produced in SG will be expensive and who will buy our products? Then what about inflation?<br><br>How can we survive as the main power of our economy is trading. How to trade when no one buys as our product is expensive?<br><br>The Malaysians want us dead, that is why.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> DuH<br><br>------------------<br>yeah yeah yeah, boogie woogie spit it out at <a href="http://www.my77thstreet.com" rel="nofollow">www.my77thstreet.com</a></div>
