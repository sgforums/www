Depending on what games you want to play, you may not want a Intel processor. A AMD Sempron processor works as well.<br><br>To answer question 1, you can add RAM. If you are unsure, you can ask the sales technicians to help out. Or simply take the upgrade offers (like Dell, offer you upgrade this, upgrade that).<br><br>For question 2, all laptops have at least one USB port. Just buy a mouse that uses USB port and connect can already. Nowadays laptops don't come with PS/2 Serial Port, so make sure you don't buy the wrong one, or you have to use the black space (it is called touchpad).<br><br>Question 3: I won't recommend brands, but laptops that are using Intel processors have longer battery life.<br><br>Question 4: If the hotel has wireless infrastructure, just register with the hotel to use their wireless network. If it doesn't have, it usually have some ports for you to connect to the Internet. Check with the hotel, you can email the hotel or ask around, like your friends who have been to the hotel.<br><br>Yahoo is a good site to find old and in good conditions laptop.<br><br>If you want to play games like RPG, I recommend you to get a desktop replacement. Their processors are usually Intel with HT Technology or Intel Celeron or Intel Celeron D.</div>
