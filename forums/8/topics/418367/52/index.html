              <p>Office Boy Turns Sushi Chef</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The story behind home-grown restaurant group The Akashi Group is, in some ways, a tale of brotherhood.</p>
              <p>In 1995, a 'raw as sashimi' Mervin Goh joined his older brothers 
                  Sam and Don to start a Japanese eatery in the basement of Tanglin 
                  Shopping Centre.</p>
              <p>Brash and attention-seeking, the then 23-year-old knew nothing 
                  about Japanese cuisine and even less about what he was going to do with 
                  his future. But Sam felt a life in a Japanese kitchen might help his 
                  youngest sibling find his moorings.</p>
              <p>Barely months into his job at the newly opened Akashi, the 
                  headstrong young man was ready to call it quits. Yelled at by 
                  co-workers, made to do grunt work such as chopping daikon (Japanese 
                  radish) and suffering cuts from his own clumsy knifework, he hated being
                   a cook.</p>
              <p>'I was so fed up, I threw the knife down and walked out in a 
                  huff. I told Sam I wasn't going to do this anymore and that I was going 
                  home,' recalls MrMervin Goh, now 38.</p>
              <p>His elder brother took him aside and talked to him. He asked Mr Goh if he wanted to 'eat the sweet or the sour part first'.</p>
              <p>'You're young and you have the energy. Why don't you take the sour part first?' Sam reasoned.</p>
              <p>With that, the younger Mr Goh calmed down. Suddenly, everything made a lot of sense.</p>
              <p>Looking back on the incident, he says: 'It would have been easier
                   to have walked away. If he had not made me a chef, I don't know what 
                  else I would have done.'</p>
              <p>In the years since, as chef and co-owner of a growing string of 
                  eateries, he has tasted the sour, bitter and spicy tang of life, and is 
                  now starting to savour the sweet.</p>
              <p><strong>Growing empire</strong></p>
              <p>These days, the chef-restaurateur is the co-director of a 
                  multi-million-dollar business. Running the Akashi Group with his three 
                  older siblings - brothers Sam, 49, and Don, 47; and sister Eleana, 48 - 
                  he is the company's de facto spokesman and possibly its friendly face.</p>
              <p>Each sibling has a 25 per cent stake in the business, which is expected to have a turnover of at least $50 million next year.</p>
              <p>That one Akashi restaurant in Tanglin Shopping Centre has spawned a mini- empire, which will cover 20 eateries next year.</p>
              <p>Two more Akashi Japanese Restaurants have opened in Paragon and 
                  VivoCity. The Tanglin outlet relocated in 2008 to Orchard Parade Hotel, a
                   stone's throw away.</p>
              <p>Other ventures include Japanese grill restaurant Akanoya 
                  Robatayaki in Orchard Parade Hotel; bistro White Dog Cafe in VivoCity; 
                  two shabu shabu outlets Akashabu in Kallang Leisure Park and Funan 
                  Centre; and five branches of Grandma's, which serves local favourites.</p>
              <p>The 'newest baby', Freshness Burger, opened its first outlet here at nex mall in Serangoon Central last month.</p>
              <p>A second outlet of the Japanese made-to-order burger chain opened
                   at Century Square in Tampines last Friday. A third will open at The 
                  Central in Eu Tong Sen Street next month.</p>
              <p>Next year, the group will open another White Dog Cafe at nex, 
                  three more Freshness Burger joints and a second Akanoya Robatayaki at 
                  Marina Bay Sands.</p>
              <p>Sitting in Grandma's at Paragon, MrGoh is laidback in a slightly 
                  rumpled way, in a long-sleeve shirt left untucked into blue jeans. He 
                  seems to know all his waitstaff by name, and takes swigs from a bottle 
                  of water, saying that we can do away with glasses.</p>
              <p>To say that he is like a big boss would be inaccurate: He is more like a big brother, at home in his domain.</p>
              <p>Married for 10 years to bank relationship 
                  manager-turned-housewife Tan Wee Lynn, 35, he has two sons - Christian, 
                  six, and Zachary, two.</p>
              <p>The group's aggressive expansion over the last two years has left him little time for his family, he says.</p>
              <p>His wife says he is 'too lenient' a dad, making her look 'like 
                  the bad guy': He always gives in to the kids, extends their playtime and
                   lets them play games on his iPhone.</p>
              <p>With a guilty-as-charged laugh, he replies: 'I'm always at work 
                  and if I were to get angry with them, I might lose them completely. We 
                  play different roles - one of us has to look bad.'</p>
              <p>He drives a four-year-old Audi and goes on holiday with his 
                  extended family at least once a year, usually during Chinese New Year. 
                  Destinations have included Hokkaido, Australia, Bali and Phuket.</p>
              <p>Not bad for a boy who grew up in a one-bedroom HDB flat in Balam 
                  Road in Aljunied, and had his first taste of sushi after he enlisted for
                   national service.</p>
              <p>He did not think the sushi was 'special or delicate' back then, and treated it like another rice or noodle dish.</p>
              <p>His mother, Madam Mary Koh, used to run a canteen stall at Nan 
                  Chiau High School, and his late father Goh Nu Nu did not hold a stable 
                  job.</p>
              <p>When he was eight years old, his parents divorced. His mum 
                  remarried in his teenage years, and he is close to his stepfather Tan 
                  Kim Leng, a retired sailor.</p>
              <p>Though his family was poor, he says, he never felt deprived. 
                  Being the youngest, his siblings showered him with presents and 
                  protected him from the harshness of a broken home.</p>
              <p>He says much of the group's present success can be attributed to the close relationship shared by the four siblings.</p>
              <p>They have few disagreements and there is little rivalry among 
                  them. Differences are always settled by talking things over. Mr Goh 
                  says: 'Our love for one another always prevails.'</p>
              <p>The family is so close, they live next door to one another, in 
                  three townhouses in the Bukit Timah area. His mother and stepfather live
                   with his sister's family.</p>
              <p>Mr Goh did not always have his eyes set on carving fish and shaping sushi.</p>
              <p>'I thought about being a professional footballer or joining 
                  Singapore Airlines as a flight steward,' says the avid Tottenham Hotspur
                   fan, who represented the Singapore Cricket Club in the National 
                  Football League during his late teens.</p>
              <p>As a boy in the 1980s, he would head to the National Stadium to 
                  catch football matches. The enterprising kid would get in for free by 
                  offering to help vendors sell drinks and curry puffs. But reality kicked
                   in after he finished national service.</p>
              <p>Graduating from Changkat Changi Secondary School with an O-level 
                  certificate, he was not sure what he wanted to do with his life. Books 
                  was never his forte, though he enjoyed going to school and joking 
                  around.</p>
              <p>By then, Sam and Don had already spent a decade working in 
                  well-known Japanese restaurants of the day, such as Unkai at the former 
                  ANA hotel, Keyaki at Pan Pacific Singapore and the then popular 
                  now-defunct teppanyaki restaurant Kuroeka in Liang Court.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Mr Goh was still trying to figure out what he wanted to do.</p>
              <p>His first job, at 21, was at brokerage house Phillip Securities 
                  in 1993, which involved menial tasks of clipping documents together and 
                  delivering them to nearby buildings, for $6 an hour.</p>
              <p>It was there that he met his future wife. Ms Tan was working 
                  part-time as an administrative assistant while waiting to enter the 
                  Nanyang Technological University of Singapore to study accountancy.</p>
              <p>She says: 'We found that we could communicate. He had only O levels but he was very sincere and down to earth.'</p>
              <p>After a year at the firm, he decided to answer an advertisement 
                  for Vitagen salesmen. But, to his horror, his new job entailed being a 
                  door-to-door salesman in HDB estates.</p>
              <p>He says: 'I was thrown into the job and I was shocked. Door-to-door? So malu (Malay for shameful), leh.'</p>
              <p>He took two weeks to sell his first packet of Vitagen. 'I would 
                  count myself lucky if customers slammed their door in my face - at least
                   I get to see their faces. Others didn't even bother opening the door,' 
                  he recalls with a chuckle.</p>
              <p>The tenacious salesman carried a backpack with 30 packets of the 
                  health drink and knocked on an average of 200 doors a day. Although he 
                  earned less than $1,500 a month, he says he was happy then.</p>
              <p>More importantly, the job helped build up his confidence level. 
                  'If you can be a door-to-door salesman, you can probably do anything,' 
                  he says.</p>
              <p>He persevered for nine months in 1994 before starting Akashi with his siblings the following year.</p>
              <p>Those months of knocking have unconsciously shaped the way he treats the group's 300 employees.</p>
              <p>'It was an honest job that taught me not to look down on anyone. 
                  Everyone is trying to make a living. It doesn't matter what job you 
                  hold.'</p>
              <p><strong>From diners to friends</strong></p>
              <p>He is no longer a salesman but some of his effortless charm, likely from those days, has remained.</p>
              <p>These days, you can find Mr Goh, dressed in white chef garb, 
                  comfortably stationed behind the sushi bar at Akashi at Orchard Parade 
                  Hotel.</p>
              <p>He is usually busy making sushi and is often seen chatting with 
                  diners, many of whom have become his friends over the restaurant's 
                  15-year history.</p>
              <p>Mr David Ong, 47, is a regular customer who has been dining at Akashi since it opened in 1995.</p>
              <p>Calling Akashi his 'second home', the executive director of 
                  financial services company AIA eats there two or three times a week when
                   he is not travelling. His kids, aged 13 and 18, refer to MrGoh as 
                  'Uncle Mervin'.</p>
              <p>The two men have travelled to Japan together four times in the last four years.</p>
              <p>Says Mr Ong: 'Akashi has a family feel to it. It is where you can be yourself.'</p>
              <p>The friendly, unpretentious restaurant chain boasts customers such as top businessmen and well-groomed bankers.</p>
              <p>But things were not always rosy for the Gohs, especially when 
                  they first started out. The first Akashi was set up with a start-up 
                  capital of $150,000 - a gift from their mother and stepfather.</p>
              <p>A Japanese restaurant run by Singaporeans was quite the anomaly 
                  back when the Japanese dining scene was dominated by chefs parachuted in
                   from Japan.</p>
              <p>On the perception that Japanese food prepared by local chefs was 
                  not as authentic, Mr Goh says: 'We could not argue that we were 
                  Japanese. People would come in and say, 'Hey, you are not Japanese', and
                   we accepted that.'</p>
              <p>They channelled their energy into preparing quality food and 
                  offering fresh ingredients, and it paid off. But 15 years on, Mr Goh 
                  does not think he is enjoying the proverbial 'sweet life', yet.</p>
              <p>Sweetness, he says, will be when he retires and gets to spend more time with his mother, wife and kids.</p>
              <p>Until then, the tart, vinegary world of sushi and the restaurant business awaits his attention.</p>
