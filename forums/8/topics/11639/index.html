            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone,<br><br>Many people told me that the first step into the working world after graduation is not easy.  Usually, the first few years are really tough as one tries to juggle all aspects of life.<br><br>Well, most of us are used to living comfortably at home, without needing to worry about not having enough to eat, not secured enough to keep a roof over our heads or for some, they donÂ’t even have to worry about buying their next branded Â‘something somethingÂ’.  And here we are, fresh from school and starting on our first permanent full-time job.<br><br>We are suddenly overwhelmed by many responsibilities that we have to shoulder.  Some of us received letters, telling us to commerce on the return of loans.  Oh yeah, for me, I have conveniently forgotten that I have taken a loan to pay off my tertiary studies.  We have parents who decided that its time for us to handle our own expenses such as mobile phones, car petrol, other transport expenses and even food expenses.<br><br>First job?  For those casual and active people like me, I donÂ’t even own a piece of proper office attire.  I remembered borrowing money from mum to get some office wear to tide me over the first month before I got my first pay check.  HehehahhaaaÂ….. so in the end, first pay check is to pay off whatever that is owed and nothing much remains after deducting all the other expenses.<br><br>Besides the financial aspect of life, we also have to cope with Â‘building our futureÂ’.  Not all fresh graduates know exactly what they want to do for their careers.  Oh well, we have to sit and think and think and think about what do we really want to do for a living.  Many worries such as not earning enough, job too boring for us or work environment not conducive enough, started to surface one after another.  Many started calling up friends to talk about their options and some flip newspapers everyday to spot an opportunity to Â‘switch shipÂ’.<br><br>Oh well, the above are some of the stresses one faces when he takes his first step into the Singapore working world.  ThatÂ’s when most of us start to reflect a lot and some even plunged into solitude in order to think things through.  Some get regular mood swings.  Oh yes, I have to admit that some will lose control and vent their frustrations on their love ones and thus, causing strain in their relationships.  It is really dependent on whether their love ones are willing to walk through all these difficulties with them.    However, we must not forget love ones are also human beings and due to the strain caused, there might be some damage done.  Here is when I start hearing stories about couples who start to fight like mad though they have been peaceful for a few years.<br><br>I guess at this point, we have to start getting organized and prioritized all that we need to do.  First, with the limited starting salary, we do up a budget per month so that we donÂ’t get sued for not being able to pay the loans.  Second, we start to take time off to think about what we really want to do for a career.  This process may take years!  Third, we need to seek the understanding of our love ones who will probably get the Â‘whipÂ’ of our frustrations and stress.  Fourth, we need to try not falling into the pitfall of isolating ourselves from the rest of the friends and only sit at home or office to think ourselves crazy.<br><br>Personally, I have started on the first item.  I managed to come up with a budget and also planned for my retirement (So early?  No woahÂ…Â…starting early is always good and I am not getting younger!).  I am looking into the second item now.  And as for the third item, I have yet to admit that I feel frustrated and stressed to my love ones.  Maybe one day, I will talk to them about it, but, given the Â‘machoÂ’ image (which I am still trying to shed off), I will probably just assume that they will find out somehow.  Meanwhile, I will have to live with the fights when everyone is frustrated at the same time.  I probably canÂ’t start on the fourth item since the items that precedes are still not settled yet.<br><br>I started reflecting a lot.  Every life experiences of all that I know are learning processes for me.  After hearing all the life stories, I always feel something.  Its either envy or warm-hearted or inspired or reminded of something.  I have to apologise to those people whom I overloaded with my after-thoughts about all the life experiences I heard so far.  Probably I yak about my after-thoughts so much that I forget that sometimes, the person I am talking to may not be interested in listening afterall.  HhehehehaaÂ…Â… people have their bad times too and I seems to catch them at that point and irritate them further.  Hey, if you know who you are, I sincerely apologise.<br><br>HehehhaaaaaÂ….. sorry to put you all through this but I was feeling bored and was too lazy to call all the people on my phonebook, only to get rejected in the end.  Additionally, I canÂ’t sleep and I just feel like putting some of my thoughts into words loh.  I just wanted to try and post something really reflective and long. Will the response patterns be the same as when I first came into the forums?  Or will it end up chucked somewhere on page 30000000?  Will it turned into some joke?  Will it turned into some discussion of non-related stuff?  That I will have to seeÂ…Â…Â…<br><br>For those who know me, thanks for remember me and for still keeping in contact despite my Â‘MIAÂ’ tendencies.  For those who donÂ’t know me, Â‘Hi There!!!!!!!Â’  For those who are still students, please treasure your freedom (if you have any) and school life Â‘while stocks lastÂ’!<br><br>Life is short, so live it to the fullest!  Never procrastinate as time waits for no one!  Do not do anything which you know you will definitely regret later!  You canÂ’t wear other peopleÂ’s shoes as they may be of different sizes!<br><br>[This message has been edited by TinDonGal (edited 12 May 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, it pays to be focussed even when you are still studying, maybe it's kiasuism at work, but to at least alleviate some of the pitfalls that you have mentioned, preparation even earlier that graduation is much better. For me, being in Engineering, it tends to narrow down the scope of what I CAN do after I graduate. True, it is only the start of my second year next sem, but already I am faced with choices of streaming into whatever specialty I'm going into. Of which, for those who don't know yet, I'll be going into Electrical and Computer Engineering. Haha, so of cos I'll be more or less in that scope of work.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyway, my point is that you gotta prepare much much earlier than just after graduation.
