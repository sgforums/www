            <div class='col-md body'>Found this in my mailbox...3/27/99<br><br>Toilet Humour<br><br>THE SHIT LIST<br>Bathroom Humour at its finest:<br><br>THE GHOST SHIT<br>The kind where you feel shit come out, see shit on the toilet paper, but<br>there's no shit in the bowl.<br><br>THE CLEAN SHIT<br>The kind where you feel shit come out, see shit in the bowl, but there's<br>no shit on the toilet paper.<br><br>THE WET SHIT<br>You wipe your ass fifty times and it still feels "unwiped". So you end<br>up putting toilet paper between your ass and our underwear so you don't<br>ruin them with those dreadful skid marks.<br><br>THE SECOND WAVE SHIT<br>This shit happens when you've finished, your pants are up to your knees,<br>and you suddenly realise you have to shit some more.<br><br>THE BRAIN HEMORRAHAGE THROUGH YOUR NOSE SHIT<br>Also known as "Pop a Vein in your Forehead Shit". You have to strain so<br>much to get it out that you turn purple and practically have a stroke.<br><br>THE CORN SHIT<br>No explanation necessary.<br><br>THE LINCOLN LOG SHIT<br>The kind of shit that's so enormous you are afraid to flush it down<br>without first breaking it up into little pieces with the toilet brush.<br><br>THE NOTORIUS DRINKER SHIT<br>The kind of shit you have the morning after a long night of drinking.<br>Its most noticeable trait is the tread mark left on the bottom of the<br>toilet bowl after you flush.<br><br>THE "GEE, I REALLY WISH I COULD SHIT" SHIT-<br>The kind where you want to shit, but even after straining your guts out,<br>all you can do is sit on the toilet, cramped and farting.<br><br>THE WET CHEEKS SHIT<br>Also known as the "Power Dump". That's the kind that comes out of your<br>ass so fast that your butt cheeks get splashed with the toilet water.<br><br>THE LIQUID SHIT<br>That's the kind where yellowish-brown liquid shoots out of your butt,<br>splashes all over the side of the toilet bowl and, at the same time,<br>chronically burns your tender poop-chute.<br><br>THE MEXICAN FOOD SHIT<br>A class all its own.<br><br>THE CROWD PLEASER<br>This shit is so intriguing in size and/or appearance that you have to<br>show it to someone before flushing.<br><br>THE MOOD ENHANCER<br>This shit occurs after a lengthy period of constipation, thereby<br>allowing you to be your old self again.<br><br>THE RITUAL<br>This shit occurs at the same time each day and is accomplished with the<br>aid of a newspaper.<br><br>THE GUINESS BOOK OF RECORDS SHIT<br>A shit so noteworthy it should be recorded for future generations.<br><br>THE AFTERSHOCK SHIT<br>This shit has an odour so powerful than anyone entering the vicinity<br>within the next 7 hours is affected does.<br><br>THE "HONEYMOON'S OVER" SHIT<br>This is any shit created in the presence of another person.<br><br>THE GROANER<br>A shit so huge it cannot exit without vocal assistance.<br><br>THE FLOATER<br>Characterised by its "floatability", this shit has been known to<br>resurface after many flushing.<br><br>THE RANGER<br>A shit which refuses to let go. It is usually necessary to engage in a<br>rocking or bouncing motion, but quite often the only solution is to push<br>it away with a small piece of toilet paper.<br><br>THE PHANTOM SHIT<br>This appears in the toilet mysteriously and no one will admit to putting<br>it there.<br><br>THE PEEK-A-BOO SHIT<br>Now you see it, now you don't. This shit is playing games with you.<br>Requires patience and muscle control.<br><br>THE BOMBSHELL<br>A shit that comes as a complete surprise at a time that is either<br>inappropriate to shit (i.e. during lovemaking or a root canal) or you<br>are nowhere near shitting facilities.<br><br>THE SNAKE CHARMER<br>A long skinny shit that has managed to coil itself into a frightening<br>position - usually harmless.<br><br>THE OLYMPIC SHIT<br>This shit occurs exactly one hour prior to the start of any competitive<br>event in which you are entered and bears a close resemblance to the<br>Drinker's Shit.<br><br>THE BACK-TO-NATURE SHIT<br>This shit may be of any variety but is always deposited either in the<br>woods or while hiding behind the passenger side of your car.<br><br>THE PEBBLES-FROM-HEAVEN SHIT<br>An adorable collection of small turds in a cluster, often a gift from<br>God when you actually CAN'T shit.<br><br>PREMEDITATED SHIT<br>Laxative induced. Doesn't count.<br><br>SHITZOPHERENIA<br>Fear of shitting - can be fatal!<br><br>ENERGIZER Vs DURACELL SHIT<br>Also known as a "Still Going" shit.<br><br>THE POWER DUMP SHIT<br>The kind that comes out so fast, you barely get your pants down when<br>you're done.<br><br>THE LIQUID PLUMBER SHIT<br>This kind of shit is so big it plugs up the toilet and it overflows all<br>over the floor. (You should have followed the advice from the Lincoln<br>Log Shit.)<br><br>THE SPINAL TAP SHIT<br>The kind of shit that hurts so much coming out, you'd swear it's got to<br>be coming out sideways.<br><br>THE "I THINK I'M GIVING BIRTH THROUGH MY ASSHOLE" SHIT<br>Similar to the Lincoln Log and The Spincal Tap Shits. The shape and size<br>of the turd resembles a tall boy beer can. Vacuous air space remains in<br>the rectum for some time afterwards.<br><br>THE PORRIDGE SHIT<br>The type that comes out like toothpaste, and just keeps on coming. You<br>have two choices: (a) flush and keep going, or (b) risk it piling up to<br>your butt while you sit there helpless.<br><br>THE "I'M GOING TO CHEW MY FOOD BETTER" SHIT<br>When the bag of Dorritos you ate last night lacerates the insides of<br>your rectum on the way out in the morning.<br><br>THE "I THINK I'M TURNING INTO A BUNNY" SHIT<br>When you drop lots of cute, little round ones that look like marbles and<br>make tiny splashing sounds when they hit the water.<br><br>THE "WHAT THE HELL DIED IN HERE?" SHIT<br>Also sometimes referred to as The Toxic Dump. Of course you don't warn<br>anyone of the poisonous bathroom odour. Instead, you stand innocently<br>near the door and enjoy the show as they run out gagging and gasping for<br>air.<br><br>THE "I JUST KNOW THERE'S A TURD STILL DANGLING THERE" SHIT<br>Where you just sit there patiently and wait for the last cling-on to<br>drop off because if you wipe now, it's going to smear all over the<br>place.<br><br></div>
