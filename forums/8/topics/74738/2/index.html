            <div class='col-md body'>Listen carefully.<br>Don't judge them.<br>you were never in their shoes.<br><br>In my mom's situation,<br>She has many rights to deny the old man the money. (though she dutifully still support her.)<br><br>The old man scalded my mom during work. My mom didn't bear a grudge. and the old man remarked stupidly about my mom. My grandma heard it and scolded the old man for being careless. My dad didnt say anything. He barged my dad and complaint.<br><br>My dad was furious and ignored the old man who banged at the door when he requested him to open the door. The old man has the keys. The old man, in his self-righteous belief, screamed and yelled and took back everything that was needed in the stall for the marketplace bizness and said he'll sever ties with my mother.<br><br>Even so, my mom dutifully gives him the money and the old man, instead of spending on food, gambled and struggled to make ends meet. My mom scolded the old man for being wasteful.<br><br>My mom worked since 14 and gave up schooling at sec 2 when the old man asked her to stop. And since then she had been working all the way till now. If she had been able to pursue her studies (she was the top few students), she might have been working class... instead of being thrown into the pain and struggles of working in a stall early in the morning 4 am.<br><br>when I was young, my grandparents did not take care of me. Everything was left to my brothers who were 5,6 year old older to tend after me. My mom and dad had to work to make ends meet. I mean, how many people would leave a baby under the care of a 5 year old unless they can't afford and do anything about it.<br><br>Think about my 2 brothers then. When my mom just gave birth to my second elder brother. She carried two babies, with a big bag to hospital alone for checkups. My grandparents? where are they?<br><br>So please do not pass judgement. Every home has their stories. (Jia jia you ben nan nian de jing.)</div>
