              <p>depending on which shop you go to there may be a big difference in standards. there are optical shops which can provide better eyechecks than hospitals others i've seen or heard about don't even know what they're doing.</p>
              <p>if its the same article i'm thinking about the results showed unschooled opticians to do even better than highly educated optometrist.</p>
              <p>depending on the area usually they like your face the shop might not charge you if not will charge 10-30++ depending on who's checking. optom usually charge 30. just ask nicely. if making glasses usually don't charge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>you can also choose to go to an eye clinic to pay the amount stated by fireice. then most probably unless you're a big fuck you'll get either an optom or a nurse to test for you. judging by the fact you're posting here i think you can only expect that liao. unlikely the doctor come out to test for you.</p>
              <p>if its just eyesight something must be wrong if you need eyedrops before an eyetest.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>by right the procedues for the eyetest should be the same no matter where you go unless your eyes so special, as a person who wear glasses you comfirm can feel it if the tester trying to be funny.</p>

              <p>can just ask, should be don't mind writing down for you if you're their customer unless you go in want free eyecheck to go other place to do. but still depends on the shop lah, most i see before quite ok if you want the degree. but you're talking about the manual check right?</p>
              <p>eh? price wise hard to say leh, if you're talking about neighbourhood area it depends on how thick your skin is and your bargaining skills haha.</p>
              <p>one of my friends told me he got his glasses(1.67index, his degree quite high) in boon lay for only $60++ . he told me he just go in and straight away say, "i want the cheapest" after that bargain all the way until the uncle give up.</p>
              <p>my mom got her bi focals for only 28 in ang mo kio after saying the same thing haha</p>
              <p>but if you're looking at lenses alone whats your degree? what type of lenses do you need?</p>

              <p>can just ask, should be don't mind writing down for you if you're their customer unless you go in want free eyecheck to go other place to do. but still depends on the shop lah, most i see before quite ok if you want the degree. but you're talking about the manual check right?</p>
              <p>eh? price wise hard to say leh, if you're talking about neighbourhood area it depends on how thick your skin is and your bargaining skills haha.</p>
              <p>one of my friends told me he got his glasses(1.67index, his degree quite high) in boon lay for only $60++ . he told me he just go in and straight away say, "i want the cheapest" after that bargain all the way until the uncle give up.</p>
              <p>my mom got her bi focals for only 28 in ang mo kio after saying the same thing haha</p>
              <p>but if you're looking at lenses alone whats your degree? what type of lenses do you need?</p>

              <p><br>actually i dun mind paying around 10 bucks for the eyecheck, but i think that most shops will still be unhappy if u just go for eyecheck and not buying anything from them. and yup, i do need the degree and other factors for making specs such as astigmatism, etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>$60 is the whole set or just the lenses only???</p>

              <p>it depends on the shop or should i say the mood of the people in the shop. there are shops which are willing to do free tests and give the prescription.if you're willing to pay for the eyecheck i believe you're entitled to the prescription. just ask before doing anything. if shop not busy you pay 15-20 bucks for test also is business to them, not reason to turn you down. but make sure you go for manual test not they use computer zap 2 time charge you 20 bucks.</p>
              <p>haha and one sneaky way i've seen before was to go in and ask random questions about your eyes then once friendly liao you start saying your eyes uncomfortable wonder if got any problem, if the guy nice maybe offer to check for you and after that ask if can keep the prescription.</p>
              <p>he told me 60 for the whole set, i thought the price was superb. i see the same stuff(lens only) going for 100-200++ in jurong point</p>
              <p>but the uncle told him all is MIC one so can do the price.</p>
