            <div class='col-md body'>I think the focus is drifting...<br><br>What I mean by half-dead is that well, the most serious case I can think of is coma, and anything close to that... probably totally paralyzed and unable to take care of yourself (i.e unable to control your body actions and reactions, requiring full medical attention, etc...)<br><br>Having cancer is not closed to half-dead... at least you can still feel pain, and you can relieve your pain by taking drugs.<br><br>Indeed, being alive is a valuable gift from God... but then, what if you're barely alive, or you dun even feel alive?<br><br>Well, if I'm filthy rich and I have the money to throw away on life-support machine, FINE! But if I'm just from an average family who have some cash stashed away for a minor rainy day, I would rather opt to end my miserable half-life than waste it (and money) away on operating the life-support machine.<br>Personally (It's my own opinion, and I dun care what you think, even if you like to call me a coward... oh whatever...), I find it very selfish to put my loved ones through the agony of seeing me suffer, half-dead, barely alive, AND since I'm going to die sooner or later, why waste their hard-earned money? What if afterall the trouble, you die (anyway) and your family members have to work very hard to pay the huge amount of hospital charges incurred by me while trying to hold on to whatever life I had? Isn't it very selfish of me to put my family through the hardship even after I've died? Really, I'll rather pass away in peace and let them continue on with their life... maybe hopefully they will remember me with fond memories?<br>Anyway, if there's really a heaven, I'll choose that rather than earth  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Maybe yes, maybe no<br>I kind of liked it your way<br>How you shyly placed your eyes on me<br>Oh, did you ever know?<br>That I had mine on you</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi,<br>to choose to die when i am seriously ill? yes, i tink i would. lethal injection sounds like one sound way i tink.<br><br>i am pro-euthanasia (n pro-abortion) in certain situations. i tink the argument that "life is precious" or "we should not play god" arguments do not hold water. i mean no offense to anyone with opposing opinions. my concern is: if a person is so seriously ill, in pain and almost sure to die, is it not more miserable to keep him/ her alive? and if he/ she opts to die in a sound/ logical mind, y hold the person back? if a human being has the power to give life, y does he/ she not have the right to choose death?<br><br>of course, there r serious implications involved if we r to legalised euthanasia. as helen argued in 'the practice', once it is legalised, there is much room for abuse.<br><br>the tanglin halt case is a sad one. the judge must have had a tough time passing the sentence.<br>dante</div>
