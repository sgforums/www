            <div class='col-md body'>Well, there was once in my life when I almost died because the operation for my acute appendicitus was delayed for twelve hours. Why? Three young hotshot motorcyclists were sent to the operating theatre one after another in a series of separate accidents, I found out later. Those twelve hours of pain that I had to endure, I will never forget it. It was as if someone was stabbing me repeatedly over and over again in the same spot. The surgeon later told me that I was pretty lucky, because my appendix was on the verge of bursting. Had it burst, I would be dead.<br><br>After a year, I seriously injured my right knee during BMT, and I was unable to walk for almost six months. It'll take even up to a year to recover fully.<br><br>What I learnt from these experiences? Life is simply too precious to throw away just because things aren't going your way. It is not only the body that suffers, but the mind as well. The mind suffers much more than the body. Of course, those who have not suffered will never know. When I told some of my friends how painful my appendicitus was, some of them smirked and said that I had a low tolerance for pain. Have they been through it? They will never know, and will never understand.<br><br>They are people also who make fun of me during the time that I was on crutches. They ask me if I felt any pain in my knee, and when I said no, they said I was just pretending to be injured. Have they been through it? Indeed, they will never know, and will never understand.<br><br>Yes, I have contemplated ending my life just to ease the suffering of my mind. But in the end, my will to live held out. In both cases of course, I was not half-dead. But I do know what pain and suffering is, and unfortunately I have nothing but comtempt for those who have not suffered but yet wish to end their lives. You talk about the cost of keeping a half-dead person alive, and about him being a burden to the family. Only those who have never suffered, will never know, and therefore will never understand, how precious life really is. You talk about letting your plug be pulled in order to save your family the cost and suffering. I dare to say this, only those with have not suffered, will never know, and therefore will never understand, only such people can speak so callously.<br><br>It's just too bad that people don't treasure the fact that they are alive and well, and in one piece. But like I said, and I will say it again, since they have not suffered, they will not know, and therefore will never understand.</div>
