            <div class='col-md body'>I have a few personal experiences with people like them. There are two choices you can make, first will be the  way and another will be the  which Bontakun has already mentioned. Below will be a guide for Brainless "Hero"<br><br> Build<br><span style="font-style: italic;">A build good to use when you have many backings, or you wish to look glamorous. This is a build where people dub Early Game to semi Mid Game. Until late game when your opponents farmed enough and have a bigger backing, you can decide to leave game or remake.</span><br><br><strong>Situations that come upon you when you take this build</strong> :<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Single you, many them</span> : Refrain from taking last hit (giving smart replies) and refrain from harassing them (like above, but in a more serious tone). Finish what you have to do at that certain place and leave. If you choose to take any last hit or harass them, you will get nuked and have your head pawned.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Many you, single enemy</span> : This situation seldom come by, if you have the chance, and you wish to follow this build, do what you want. Harass them all you want and farm as much as you can. But be forewarned that usually, their allies will reach in a very short time and usually will cut your retreat route. Make sure you're ready for it.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Many you, many them</span> : In such a major battle, what I suggest is to take it to a different and less compact place. (Public alerts police and you and their group and taunt at the nearest NPC) Make sure your teammate has sufficient guts to back you up when the fight comes. Also, alert them that if the situation goes too far, and the offering of God is not with you, retreat is a good idea.<br><br><strong>Items</strong><br>1) Any hot drink (Good for situation 2 and 3.) Deals moderate damage, good for harassment, allows you to have a opening on your opponent to land a good blow(s).<br><br>2)Keys (Good for all situation) Deals quite a punch if used properly, remember not to lose it. Con is that if the enemy grabs it and twist it in a certain manner, your hand will be at risk.<br><br>3)Handphone (Good for situation 1 and 3) Calls for backup (if you have them in the first place). Quite handy when you're losing.<br><br>4)Penknife (Good for situation 3) Deals a high damage. Remember the consequences of using it. Try to use this in a less obvious way. It's good not to let your enemy know that you have such a weapon or they will nuke and disable you first.<br><br>5)Parang (Good for situation 3) Deals massive damage. Attracts lots of attention. Drops upon death/injury/disabled. Have major negative buff after the battle. Use only when the situation is very grave.<br><br><strong>Skills</strong><br>1) Slap    <span style="font-style: italic;">Good for harassing opponent heroes. Deals little damage, creates a moderate amount of threat.</span><br><br>2) Scold vulgarities <span style="font-style: italic;">Good for harassing opponent heroes. Deals no damage, creates a high amount of threat. Increases enemy damage by 10%/level but decreases their armor by 10%/level.<br><br>3) Uppercut [i]Deals a moderate amount of damage. Deals 20% more damage when the opponent is blocking their face.</span><br><br>4)  <strong>Teh their lampa</strong> <span style="font-style: italic;">Deals a high amount of damage, disable their movement for 2 seconds. Decreases their armor by 30%. Creates a high amount of threat among their heroes, increasing their damage, lowering the armor slightly. Increases the damage of nearby allies.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Side notes/advices</span><br>1) Make sure your allies have sufficient intelligence to have the mana to use the skills at the right time.<br><br>2)Make sure your friends buy balls at shop level 1 to make sure they can back you up.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Author's note</strong></span><br>I suggest you not to use this build. This build is tested by friends only and I find them useless and has too many cons.<br><br>Guess I have to stop on my DotA soon..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
