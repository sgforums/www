I concur with with Bontakun said; if those pai kias knock into you, abuse you verbally or even slap you. Just bear with it and bail out of the situation. If an apology may appease them or even resolve the problem, then go ahead. Sorry when said to people like them doesn't cost you a cent or more anyway.<br><br>Pertaining to the Hougang point problem, there is a much simpler solution. Since you already know there's a bunch of gangsters there, just avoid that area unless there is an absolute need to go.<br><br>Last but not least, however if the situation is immediate and that madman is armed with a parang...

I think she not good looking leh."<br><br>Then usually <span style="color: red;">the friend who happenes to be a cb</span> will go tell the paikia "eh strado say ur gf ugly leh."<br><br>Dunno on purpose or what. But watever it is, after you ask them why they sabo you, they will act innocent and say that wasnt their intention.

Then all the ppl in sch, for a sense of security will back the paikia up mutually, even if they got no prob wit u, they will still scold u for the sake of scolding with lame comments like "u think u very shuai ar?"<br><br>But let social factors speak for this people. nowadays, all the ppl who ever pulled that trick on me before are still the same, you see them still hanging out at the same area doing the same thing with the same kind of people even after so many years.<br><br>And then I also realized they cannot get any good gfs. Its either those innocent act cute lian, or some not so good looking but act fierce lian.

Bruise or serious injury, you suffer, your parents suffer, they suffer too. Why? They will be charged with VCH to attempted murder. Or some other things which I do not know.<br><br>Which is why avoidance is the best of all. They diao let them diao. They will learn one day that such actions will never bring them any good stuffs.
