              <p>Yi Shi Jie is COPYING J Rock style....see too much Luna Sea PV???</p>
              <p>I felt Da Feng Chui should have won.Everything is there.</p>
              <p>Tu Zi singing not very good, but i felt their song arrangement is quite interesting, not like the rest of the bands, which i felt made them stand out more. But commercial appeal is totally not there. Maybe they will try marketing them as a local sodagreen.</p>
              <p>Agree that next time decision should be based on judges ONLY. So what if a band win based on supporters votes, but is not marketable? The record company got another problem, ie how to change the band sound into something that's good enough to shove down everyone's throats. Then the artist have to compromise due to contract, leading to what people call "sell out".</p>
              <p>Anyway i felt this years bands are mostly all wannabes.</p>

              <p>sanyue this band sounds very pub-ish, those u listen in pub, dont really like her voice, but their music is good.</p>
              <p>ethereal not copying la, they like jrock too much so they also wanna be like them lor... another form lol.<br><br>i agree on Hellraiza's point on rabbit.<br><br>this yr's superband is really crap, even if dont compare to the first season, look at snoopy and lucify performing at the studio ytd, they rock the audience out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>100% judges only, if the band they choose out is talented blahblahblah, if nobody supports them also no point leh, cos have to depend on the public to buy their albums and such. i think 50 50 would be okay.</p>

              <p>Singapore public don't like, can always market them overseas....so many local artistes gain fame in taiwan before the damn local public can accept them...sometimes i think singaporeans are really cows....animals with herd mentality.</p>
              <p>San Yue....see whether Dennis Foo will 'kio' them to perform at Dragonfly lor. Very likely i feel. They got the "say" to perform to the Dragonfly crowd.</p>
              <p>Ethereal outfit is a near-exact replica of what Ryuichi wore during one concert...</p>
              <p>As for snoopy/lucify....yeah heavy riffs, i like, but he is not singing at all, don't know what monkey gibberish that fella is spouting...to enjoy something like that, i don't know man...</p>

              <p>Carpy show. 100% vote goes to the people... den wat's the point of having judges to give comment and advise in the show. No matter how good the judges praise a team or condemn a team. Their comment will never be taken into consideration as the Champ will emerged if he's loaded. So what if you are popular but you have no talent?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the talented may not be as popular as the most talented.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SG should take a look at Taiwan (XGDD) Those who are in are those with talent..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The number rule will never change.</p>
              <p>Talent follow by popular and not popular come with talent. You may be able to buy popularity but you may never buy talent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So I never saport SG sing contest..</p>
