            <div class='col-md body'>Turned away... ...for wearing jeans<br>By Tan May Pin<br><br>WHILE planes thundered above, a storm brewed on the ground at the Changi Exhibition Centre.<br><br>More than 50 people were turned away from the Asian Aerospace 2004 yesterday, mostly for wearing jeans.<br><br>They were puzzled and upset. And they ended up watching the aerial display from outside the fences before leaving.<br><br>Police had to be called in to placate at least one angry overseas visitor.<br><br>What made things worse for some was what they saw as the organisers' double standards.<br><br>One of them, Mr Dennis Loe, 35, said: 'What exactly do they mean by proper attire? Anyway, everyone should be treated the same. I saw people inside with jeans.'<br><br>Mr Anthony Lee, 35, who works in the air force, was also turned away. He said: 'They didn't let me and my friend in but they let this Caucasian man wearing a round-neck T-shirt, bermudas and track shoes in.'<br><br>Mr Edwin Tan felt this was unfair. 'We weren't informed what proper attire meant. I saw some people inside with jeans but the guard couldn't provide a proper explanation why,' he said.<br><br>One man said he was turned away because he in track shoes.<br><br>Organiser Reed Exhibitions' president, Mr Ed Ng, said the trade invite had stated that they reserved the right to refuse entry to visitors who were not in proper business attire.<br><br>'This is an air show of high quality and international reputation. As such we have to play in the league of international air shows. The traditional attire is a suit and tie.<br><br>'But if we can verify that a person is here to conduct business, then we would let the person in.<br><br>'For example, if Mr Tony Fernandes (AirAsia head) came in his jeans, we would have let him in because that's what he normally works in.<br><br>'The whole issue isn't about the jeans, but whether people were here to do business. If they were not, then we encourage them to come back during the weekend.'<br><br>The show is only open to the public then.<br><br>Another rule that led to confusion: The need for checks on passports or NRIC checks.<br><br>Mr Ng said that the trade invite mentioned explicitly that visitors had to bring along their passport or NRIC for security checks.<br><br>For one trade visitor, this led to a double-whammy. Not only did he not bring his passport, his wife was in jeans.<br><br>And in Mr Soren Lax case, it ended with the police being called.<br><br>Mr Lax, 54, and his wife, Ms Dinawati, flew in from Jakarta on Tuesday morning to attend the show.<br><br>He arrived at the show at 10am yesterday and bought two tickets costing $100.<br><br>But his wife was not allowed in as she was in jeans.<br><br>HERE TO MEET BUSINESS PARTNERS<br><br>Said Mr Lax, who owns Indonesian air charter company Kura Kura Aviation: 'The man at the door said she was not in proper business attire.<br><br>'I spent a long time explaining to him that my wife was the director of our company and we wanted to meet our business partners.<br><br>'But he kept saying: 'Sorry, sorry I cannot let you in'.<br><br>Mrs Lax then returned to her Orchard Road hotel after getting a refund for her $50 ticket.<br><br>Mr Lax queued to register and waited half an hour for his turn. When he reached he counter, he was told that he needed to produce his passport, which he had unfortunately left at the hotel.<br><br>'I wanted to explode. I saw many ads in flying magazines but none said that you couldn't wear jeans and that you must bring your passport,' said Mr Lax.<br><br>Mr Lax is originally from Sweden and has lived in Indonesia since 1991. He had been invited to the show via e-mail by a business contact and therefore, did not have a trade invite.<br><br>As Mr Lax was about to leave, Reed's president, Mr Ed Ng, approached him and found out that his wife had been rejected because of her attire.<br><br>'When he found out that we were here on business, he wanted me to call my business partners inside the hall to verify our identities, and my wife would then be able to go in.' said Mr Lax mockingly.<br><br>While Mr Lax was speaking to this reporter, Mr Ng approached Mr Lax again and asked for his passport or some other identification.<br><br>Mr Lax refused but later showed us his Indonesian driver's licence.<br><br>'I didn't want to show him because I had decided that I wasn't going to the show any more,' said<br>Mr Lax.<br><br>Mr Ng then called two policemen over. They asked Mr Lax to follow them into a room for questioning.<br><br>He refused.<br><br>When asked, Mr Ng said that he got the policemen involved because Mr Lax refused to give him his particulars when asked.<br><br>'He was also causing a commotion,' Mr Ng added.<br><br>He nonetheless said that as organisers, they were 'not perfect' and improvements could be made.<br><br>'Immediately after the show today, we arranged several levels of briefings for our contractors and managers,' he added.<br><br>But Mr Lax, who is leaving tonight and does not intend to go to the show today, wasn't convinced.<br><br>He said: 'I feel sad that all this happened. I like Singapore and come here five or six times year and this is the first time I have complained.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Free tickets to make up<br><br>SOME of those who were turned away yesterday were given free tickets for the public show during the weekend.<br><br>Mr Ng said they gave out about 50 tickets yesterday.<br><br>'We felt bad as they had taken the effort to come all the way,' he said.<br><br>A couple and their grandchild who had been turned away got free tickets too.<br><br>'I spoke to them in Mandarin and explained the situation. They were very understanding,' said Mr Ng.<br><br>'In fact, the woman said that she had another grandchild and asked for an additional ticket, so we gave her four tickets.'<br><br>And it seemed to work.<br><br>A bunch of men, who were originally peeved at not being allowed into the show, were pacified by the free tickets.<br><br>~Article from the Newpaper, Singapore<br><br><span style="color: red;">Does anyone find the approach of these organisers familiar?<br><br>Initial they are<br><br>a. High-handed, inflexible coupled with the "we're right and you're wrong" attitude.<br><br>Then when visitors question their definition of proper attire, they<br><br>b.  sow confusion among the waiting lines<br><br>c. set double standards,<br><br>d.  their organising president attempts to shift his "goalposts" in his feeble mitigations.<br><br>e. Rope in the police when they can't handle the crowd professionally<br><br>And lastly, when all else has failed, they<br><br>f. offer freebies and extra tickets.<br><br>Why i might not even be surprised if the organising committee was set up by Temask holdings...</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thats what happened to me yesterday. Though i was a bit different. WAs jus thinking of watching the aerial display outside and snap pics but when i heard a couple that they have a spare trade ticket, i decided to give it a try. They agreed to bring me in. But the security guard barred me from entering cos i was wearing jeans.<br>If i am not wrong, one of the partners of the show is Singapore Technologies, a Tamasek company.</div>
