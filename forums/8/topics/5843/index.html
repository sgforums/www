            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, it is absolutely possible, though the chances of finding one that match are rare. The best bet is from the patient's immediate family. But when I say it's possible, I mean transplant as in a total transplant, not a partial one. If a person has a partially damaged liver, it's possible to resect ( cut away ) the damaged part and the liver will regenerate again. ( as much as half the liver can be removed ) But if you're thinking of cutting a small part of someone's liver and passing it to another person, I'm not so sure as to whether it's gonna fully develop into a functional organ in the recepient, although in the case of the donor, the liver will regenerate completely.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The chances of a patient accepting part of a liver from a stranger ( eg an unrelated friend ) is something like one in thousands. A liver consists of 2 lobes. It is possible, and it has been done before, to remove one lobe from the donor and give it to the recipient. If everything goes well, in both the donor and the recipient, they'll develop the corresponding other half of the liver in as short as one month.<br>As for the requirements, blood tests are a must of course. But there're many other things to test for, to assess the chances of a tissue rejection. Tests have to be carried out to confirm this. One thing to note though : A significant risk is involved in the donor as well during transplantation. This is because many of the blood vessels have to be resewn, and complications can occur. But there's still hope. As long as there's hope, there's a cure.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>rainboy :<br><br>That'll depend on what stage the cancer is at. If it is in a very initial stage, where only a small part of the liver is affected, partial resection can be done to remove part of the liver, and the liver will regenerate in a matter of months. A full recovery is possible.<br>However, if the cancer is detected too late, where metastasis has taken place, ie the cancer has spread, especially to nearby organs like the pancreas, then chances of recovery become very very slim, even with a transplant. The pancreas and liver are very very important. So it pays to take good care of them.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br>liver transplant is possible among living pple. And it has been carried out in Singapore. There was this little boy who had liver failure and his mother donated a part of her liver to her son. I'm not sure how large the donated organ was...I think it should be 1/4.<br>However, I'm not sure whether liver transplant will be suitable for liver cancer because, like what badboy said, it depends on what stage the cancer is in.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, to clarify your misconception, there's only one liver in each of us.  =)  So there's not much of a choice really, unlike the kidneys where there're two of them.<br>Anyway, the latter part of your question, if the cancer has spread to other organs more commonly the pancreas, I guess exploratory surgery has to be done, where the surgeons just "go in" and see if there's anything they can do. I know it sounds rather bad, but at least it's kinda better than nothing if you know what I mean. And I hate to say this, but people who recover fully from any form of cancer, usually do so because the cancer was detected in an early stage and has not spread to another other organ. So complications are minimized. But once metastasis ( spreading ) has occurred, I think at the present moment, you just have to be hopeful. But well, always believe in a cure!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmmmm I can only suggest a things like, such as perhaps the cancer is not as widespread as it was thought, and that it only affects a limited region of the organ, such that resection looks promising. But I'd say that exploratory surgery is done usually as a last ditch effort, hoping that actually looking at the "inside" may provide some unthought of solution that may just do the trick. You never know, anything can happen. BTW, just wondering why the sudden interest in this topic, if you don't mind?  =)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah Shervon you're right, the patient's gotta be on a whole list of drugs to treat the symptoms of tissue rejection.  =)  Anyway, about chemotherapy, it's a rather subjective thing. It DOES kill cancer cells, but it kills normal cells too. So you've gotta think again before that's undertaken. Personally ( I repeat, PERSONALLY ), I'm not for chemotherapy, because I think it's bad to put the patient through additional pain on top of the suffering he or she is bearing from the cancer itself, not to mention the hair loss.  However, if the cancer is mild, chemotherapy may be yet useful. But I honestly wouldn't think it's suitable for advanced cancer.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>p53 is a tumor suppressor gene which I doubt is being used as a therapy for cancer. In normal people like us, we have the p53 protein in us as a result of expression of the p53 gene. In essence, this protein prevents the abnormal, uncontrolled division of our body cells ( ie cancer ). It is when this p53 gene is suppressed that cancer becomes likely to form. However, there're many other tumour-suppressor gene other than the p53 gene. Keep your fingers crossed, breakthroughs in gene therapy are likely in the VERY near future.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, to be really frank about this, if I were to have advanced cancer, I'd rather enjoy my last days in peace rather than put myself through the agony of chemo, knowing that it may actually be doing more harm to me than benefit, since if I'm in the advanced stage, the radiation would have to be quite strong. But well, this is the ethical issue we're talking about here. So I guess the patient should have a right to decide. =)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually if you want my opinion, I'd say a transplant is the ONLY hope if the patient is in the final stage. There're waiting lists in hospitals abroad where patients are classified according to their stage of the disease. Patients who have as short as 7 days to live are given priority for transplants. However, the point is, a transplant is not a definite cure. It'll prolong the life of the patient for varying periods. But look at it from the bright side, at least the patient will have quality time left, even though it is limited.<br><br>I'm not for chemotherapy because I think that it lowers the quality of life of the patient, without providing significant aid to the patient.<br><br>As for gene therapy, it's an up-and-coming field.</div>
