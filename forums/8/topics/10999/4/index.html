I know my hand will shoot out immediately for something to hold on to, definitely not FI's thick waist  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>And if dunhave anything to hold on to, i'll quickly check the direction i'm falling towards and look for a place to place my palm to stop my fall lor. Touching a girl is a definite no-no. She'll prob fall also or kenna bruised by me mah... No meh?
