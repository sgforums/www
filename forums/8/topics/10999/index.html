Might not really be related but just telling this because it happened on a bus too....<br>This afternoon I was on the bus (rear)... Sitting on the last row... My leg is somehow up and bended at the knees kinda position and stepping on a little space between the seats in front... (The row of seats faced side..)<br>Then this girl wearing a 'beautiful' wrapped around skirt came up the bus and sat in front of me.... I wasn't really noticing her UNTIL I realised what I was doing... I actually STEPPED onto the 'string' she used to tie the wrapped around on her skirt... So you can imagine what could have happened if (a)She tied it not too tight (b) She get down the bus before me (c) None of us have noticed it....<br>SHUCKS..... "Oops!! I think I DID it AGAIN...??"<br><br>------------------<br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It could be depending on where the guy was standing.. maybe the pole full of hands liao? and he reallie has got nothing to hold on to? and.. if you're about to fall.. you would be desperate to hold onto something mah.. then will usually just reach out and whatever you grab onto.. but.. uh.. if u grab other people.. shd at least smile smile and say sorry mah.. if not too embarassing one.. the person should be able to understand your situation(as he/she shd also be in that.) and forgive you one lar..<br><br>anyway.. lol.. i was laughing at Nelstar's post.

            <div class='col-md body'>HA HA HA, I also kana before long time ago! Very stupid sia, I tell you'll about it.<br><br>It happened at the main bus-stop outside Temasek Polytechnic. There was this rather fat Malay lady who was talking to her companion very loudly. She was gesticulating and waving her arms about, and I happened to standing by her side.<br><br>She was waving her arms about, and then suddenly she flung out one of her arms too hard, and it hit me across my stomach. What did she do? She immediately turned towards me and with a furious look on the face shouted, "AYY!!!"<br><br>Now, where was the sense in that? She had hit me, and then she shouted at me as though I had hit her! Wah super LAN eh!!! What did I do? I super LAN LAN, I also shouted back, "AYY!!!"<br><br>Then she looked really shocked and stunned. That really made my day man, that look on her fat face. Finally she got the cock sense to realise that it was her fault for flinging her arms about, not me for standing there! Anyway, you know lah, this kind of people confirm will not apologise, so she went on as before lah. After all, she already lose face right? HA HA HA!!!<br></div>
