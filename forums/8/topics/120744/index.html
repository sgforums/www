            <div class='col-md body'>from gebtle rock :<br><br>"life is funny lor.....<br><br>For girls: They can hug each other.....can eat from the same plate......kiss each others' cheeks (the ones on the face hor?), etc etc. And no one says they are lesbians. And they can even compliment each other's boobs and its normal.<br><br>For guys: In NS, we shower together naked.....we can drink from the same can of beer....etc etc. But when we share a cake from the same plate, its strange. And if a guy compliments another guy's dick, its bloody frightening!<br><br>And sometimes even the same activity can be intepreted more than one way. When two fully-clothed guys hug each other in public, its gay. But when two sweaty half naked guys hug each other in the boxing ring after a fight, its seen as macho-friendly-gentlemanly. "<br><br>tats society where always talk abt equalty, woman scream rape n there are excessive investigation,<br>men report any sexual abuse n its looked on as shenanijans or suspicions.<br><br>yah the table just less then a palm away ,n one of them looked at us when making chivalrous remark,<br>then they follow n ordered a cake also !<br><br>Not tat we don't realy admired females (we love them!! n the local news/articles seem always slanted to their view- )<br>we need 2have the share of behaviours that are not sterotyping anymore<br><br></div>
