My class witnessed the kitten struggle desperately in the mouth of the dog and finally the dog drop it.<br><br>It looked like the kitten's spine is crashed. It lie on the floor, trembles for a few second and then dead. We went up to it and saw its pupils nearly poping out, and it has got a very horrified look, so errie that none of us took a picture. Then as we walk away, the dog returned again and again and bite on it, as if making sure all its bones are broken and its intestines messed up.<br><br>If you were there, will you stop the dog, or will you let nature has its way?</div></blockquote>When its a family cat, it mean that it is the property of human.

            <div class='col-md body'>Some have posted, "It's nature, don't interfere"; others advocate an interventionist approach. Both make valid points.<br><br>However, in this particular case, there's not much of a choice. By the time you realize what's going on, the dog has already maimed the kitten beyond any chance of survival. No point chasing away the dog or interfering, when the kitten is already as good as dead. The kitten wouldn't be able to survive a big dog's bite.<br><br>So there's no point in attacking, chasing away, or even killing (as some suggested) the dog. It won't bring back the kitten or help the situation. There's no guarantee that the dog will (or wont) do this again, so you can't confidently choose any particular course of action.<br><br>In any situation, it's important to act out of cosmoethics, see how you can best help everyone involved. And not act out of anger or revenge. In this particular case scenario, most probably there's nothing much else for any person around to do, other than to wish the soul of the kitten well (animals have souls too, you know this right?).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's not too shocking actually... it's only shocking because we are city dwellers and don't really get to see much of these actions.<br><br>Dogs are predators by nature, and they are well equipped to kill. They are also territorial and hence will had an instinct to be hostile to anything that it deems to be infringing on it's turf. In this case the dog might not have intended to eat the kitten at all, but was simply a rather antisocial individual with little tolerance for any other critter crossing its area.<br><br>There are some reasons for this kind of behaviour, larger predators have long been known to kill smaller ones to remove competition from the food chain. Lions have a long standing habit of killing smaller predators (Heynas, Cheetahs) and even each other at times. Wolves often go out of their way to kill Coyotes, even taking the effort to engage in very long chases. Dog have been known to maul and kill smaller dogs of their own kind.<br><br>While we can train a dog to be nice by taming it, we must know that if left to its own devices most dogs might end up being hostile to any smaller animal that it views as killable. After all we bred dogs from wolfs, and in every dog there is still a wolf waiting to come out.<br><br>But hey, if you do tame a dog enough, they actually make pretty good friends with cats. Some owners have both animals and they are said to get along quite well.</div>
