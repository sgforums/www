This is because of the trend where English was introduced worldwide, including Japanese.<br><br>More and more words are used as Katagana when the word was not originated from Japanese. For example, Japanese wouldnt know about Singapore in the past and therefore they didn't hav a name for it. Later the name Shingaporu in katagana is used.<br><br>Although even many of the japanese themselves didn't hav much knowledge in kanji if they're not educated or highly educated, it is still expected of them to know basic words such as "Neko" which is written as "1Mao"(Cat) in Chinese.</div>
