              <p>first of all, crap.</p>
              <p>went to Home-Fix and spent S$33.90 on a cordless light-duty drill, only to find out that it can only do very light drilling on soft wood and that it's main purpose is an electric screwdriver. knn.</p>
              <p>any, i've a question.....say, if i've a piece of 10.5 cm by 10.5 cm ceramic tile (something like your small home wall tile), and i drill a 1 cm hole in the middle of it, will the tile crack?</p>
              <p>from what i see, ceramic is structurally different from wood or metal, in that if you drill in the center of wood or metal, the material won't crack, but for ceramic tiles, i think if we drill in the middle, there'll be cracks around the hole, even if the whole thing doesn't shatter to bits?</p>
              <p>pls advise.</p>
              <p>depending on situation, i'll go to Home-Fix again to buy a real drill this time.</p>
              <p>serious only.</p>

              <p>depends on your ceramic too.</p>
              <p>If its those glass like ceramics, they will crack and break.</p>
              <p>Try drilling only onto the side/seams of the tiles.  And make sure you practically plaster the tiles where you are drilling with lots of those (Whats its called, scotch tape?) tapes before you drill.</p>

              <p>Your best bet would be to acquire a diamond-tipped bit specially designed for drilling through ceramic tiles. You could get by with a less expensive carbide-tipped masonry drill bit, but it will dull quicker.</p>
              <p>You'll also need a variable speed drill. Use the slowest possible speed to prevent excessive heat build-up (have a cup of water handy and dip the bit into it occasionally to cool it down while you're drilling).</p>
              <p>Getting the hole started is the trickiest part--the bit will likely skate around the surface of the tile and scratch it up. To prevent this, stick a piece of duct tape on the tile, mark the location of the hole, and drill <em>through</em> the tape.</p>
              <p>Do no apply excessive pressure as you're drilling, as you risk cracking the tile. Go slow and let the tip of the bit do the work for you.</p>

              <p>I have been using my BOSCH - GBH 2-24 DSR - 620 w for many years &amp; it's still serving me well.</p>
              <p>What you have described is on the mark except few users will use a diamond coated drill bit &amp; as u said a carbide tipped one will usually be effective for he job. </p>
              <p>I will add that the type of wall/floor tiles will make drilling easy or tricky i.e. for light duty ordinary tiles it will be a breeze but for heavy duty homogenous ties (either polished or matt) it will be a little tricky.</p>

              <p>It's a very small job &amp; I doubt any contractor will do it - &amp; if anyone does, likely u will be charged for a price which is not worth paying for eg $30 - $50 ?.</p>
              <p>Realistically u should get a friend or friends' friend to do for u &amp; it should be free! - it's actually so easy to do it!.</p>

              <p>lol.....it's not those "already-on-the-wall" kind of tile.</p>
              <p>if it is, then drilling would be so simple since it has concrete
              to hold it in place and it's a lot  firmer and thicker than
              the tile by itself. :-D</p>

              <p>Alamak! all along most of us thought that the tile is firmly cemented on the floor/wall and in this case I think it's very, very unlikely that the tile wont crack/break when being drilled.</p>

              <p>yeah, switched from wood to ceramic, because i don't like the feel of the wood on the finished product.</p>
              <p>ceramic tiles (especially those "shiny" glazed ones) look very good.</p>
              <p>now, apparently, ceramic is not very realistic due to the drilling problem and i'm looking at blank tile coasters.</p>
              <p>if anyone knows where to find those blank tile coasters for me to print my own graphics on, pls let me know.</p>
              <p>i need something (a solid body) for my clock.</p>

              <p>Coaster? the thing that put under cup that thing?</p>
              <p>Exact Size of that mighy be abit hard to find...mostly is sell 1 big piece, then cut/saw into shape...</p>
              <p>*Actually ceramic is easy to drill,no need g-clamp de..place on a piece of wood, step on it(wear shoe) then slowely drill it...You can use those special drill bits but imo,no need de, jus slowely do it, slowely applying pressure.</p>
              <p>*Now, see u want shiny surface.You can also get a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">piece of metal sheet</span>,get it polished to super shiny,this time use metal will be easier to drill liao..</p>
              <p>How are u gonna print pics onto a hard piece of thing ?You use airbrush or stickers?How u print onto it?Share share lea..or the blank tile coaster is not the coaster i said for put under cup de???</p>
