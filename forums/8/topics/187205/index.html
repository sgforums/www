Hence go and find out..more lah..Managed to find out more from the web, It stated something like that..interesting. Allow me to quote<br><br><strong>The 12 Animals Representing Years</strong><br>The mouse, or rat, is the first in the circle of 12 animals representing years. The others, chronologically, are the ox, the tiger, the rabbit, the dragon, the snake, the horse, the goat, the monkey, the rooster, the dog and the pig.<br><br>A popular legend says that a certain god ordered all the animals to pay him a visit on New YearÂ’s Day, that is, the first day of the first lunar month. He said he would give the first 12 animals to come the title <strong>Â“King of the Animal WorldÂ” </strong>and let each hold the title for one year.<br><br><strong>When the ox heard of the GodÂ’s decree, he said to himself: Â“ItÂ’s a long journey to visit that God. I ainÂ’t a fast traveler and IÂ’d better start early.Â” So he set out on the eve of the Lunar New Year. The mouse heard the ox and jumped onto his back, without being noticed. The ox, sweating all over, was so glad to be the first to arrive at the GodÂ’s place. But just as he was about to express his New Year greetings to the God, the mouse jumped down over the oxÂ’s head and became the first to kowtow to the God. So he was appointed the first King of the Animals and consequently, the first of the 12 animals to designate years. Then the 12 winners happened to be those mentioned above.</strong><br><br>A more authentic explanation says, the Earthly Branches are divided into two categories: Yin and Yang. Each of them is paired with an animal of the same Â“genderÂ”. The gender of the animal is determined by the number of a specific part of its body. Odd numbers are Yang and even numbers are Yin. The tiger, the dragon, the monkey and the dog, all have five toes on each foot or paw, and the horse has one hoof. So we know they are Yang animals. The cloven-hoofed species such as the ox, the goat, and the pig fall into the Yin category because their hoofs are divided into two parts. The rooster is also Yin since it has four toes on each foot. The rabbit has two upper lips and the snake has a two-point forked tongue. So they are Yin, too. The mouse had been a problem. It has four toes on each fore leg and five on each hind leg. It has both Yin and Yang qualifies and there seemed to be no place to put it. Fortunately, the first of the Earthly Branches, Zi , can be considered both Yin and Yang. The Branches were also used to designate days and hours, and when symbolizing the hours, this branch covers a period from eleven in the evening to one oÂ’clock in the morning. PM is Yin and AM is Yang. So the mouse goes together with this first branch. It is this double-gender feature, a kind of split personality, you might say, that makes the little mouse the leader among his colleagues.<br><br>Now you may be wondering why there is no Year of the Cat, especially since cats have been popular as pets for thousands of years in China as well as in many other countries. Well, in the legend, the Cat failed to be chosen because he was a day late getting to the GodÂ’s place. The mouse had played a trick on him. He lied to the Cat, telling him the wrong date for the competition. The Cat was not pleased and has hated the Mouse ever since.<br><br>Mouse was the victor then <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> So what I say more.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> Be happy to be named as mouse, cause you are the winner..cat is no even inside <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br></div>
