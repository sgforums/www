            <div class='col-md body'>It's the design school located at Beach Road. I heard it's fashion design course is really good and I'm quite interested in it. Has anyone studied there before? How is the course/environment like? Or are there like, other better fashion design courses available elsewhere?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yay for my first post! Okay, whatever.<br><br>I did some research about two years back when I wanted to enter a design school, and I collected some opinions and went for the open houses and all that, maybe it'll be of some help to you. Uhm, since you're interested in fashion, I'll just mention Lasalle-SIA, Temasek Poly, Raffles Design, and NAFA.<br><br>Lasalle-SIA: Pretty good private institute. Graduates are very well trained after they're course ends. Pretty okay fees (if you're considering that). Good standard of education, methinks.<br><br>Raffles Design: Er, I got rather bad reviews about this school, and er, I don't want to bash the school but yeah. I heard that they're gold diggers. 'Nuff said.<br><br>NAFA: The standard here isn't that good apparently, but it covers a wide scope of courses.<br><br>TP: I'm in this school yar, but not in fashion. I love the environment here, maybe because it's not a private school, so the people are really crazy and stuff. Standard's quite high though.<br><br>Er, if you're from the schools that I mentioned and you don't like what I said, I'm sorry k? These are just some of the things I heard when I was choosing a school to go to. And I don't mean all the people in the school are terrible when I say something negative. Don't take it to heart. ^_^<br><br>Hope that helped!</div>
