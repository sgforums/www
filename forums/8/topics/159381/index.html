            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Chitra</strong> - Late 80s singer who made the switch to ARR's camp. She was a favourite of ARR in the early 90s and one of the best modern well known female  singers in the industry. Her voice is simply magical...Well pronounced in high and low tones..She goes well with  all songs  and paricularly songs of a grand nature  which are rich in orchestration. In short, she's a perfect voice.Sung dozens of songs<br>She is nowhere to be seen now...She lost her voice in a freak  accident in the late 90s. ARR had not used her for quite sometime<br><br><strong>Anuradha Sriram</strong> - Another good early mid 90s singer of ARR who had a brief sensation and stardom for a while.. has a sweet, yet strong voice that fits both in South Indian music and North Indian music....Seldom seen now but still singing.....<br><br><strong>Sujatha</strong> - A low profile singer of ARR who uses her sparingly to sing  solo songs in the early to mid 90s to sing some decent but not so well received songs...Now she had stopped singing for ARR long time ago but doing so minimally with other composers... great youthful voice  best desribed as muted and soft<br><br><strong>Harini</strong> - Mid 90s singer who had a youthful child voice and a brief run of popularity. Her singing has a silky constant mid range sound  quality well suited for synthesised music ...She had MIA  from the scene the last few years.. Not heard her in an ARR song for quite a while<br><br>3. <strong>Sadhna Sargam</strong> - She comes and go, and then comes again. She was a hit with ARR for a brief period in the millenium, with a strong, English type voice having a haunting and depressing attribute . I think nowadays, we donâ€™t hear it from her that much.<br><br>4. <strong>Anupama</strong> - She was responsible for some of ARR's greatest pop songs in the early 90s But makes the least appearance. When she does it becomes a hit...With a sexy mature voice....Her novelty had worn out now and probably retired from the scene<br><br>5.<strong>Kavitha Krishnamoorthy</strong>- Originally a very popular hindi singer but her voice is used quite commonly by ARR for fast paced Hindi songs of his...She does not sing in a fantastic manner in tamil due to her pronounciation problem of the language. ARR had stopped using her in tamil after the 90s<br><br>6 .<strong>Chinmayee</strong> - A new unofficial star in the making. Appearing out of nowhere  , She first sung for ARR in 2003..Relatively unknown and keeping a low profile  Very few  songs on her plate now but her voice is of divine  with High tonal quality but soft nature at the required times ..best described as elemental with a "flat" aesthethic feel which also happened to be the recent ARR trend of sound recording.. A singer yet to either showcase her full abilities or fade away in time<br><br>Lesser known singers<br><br><strong>Carolene</strong> - Chinese singer who sang only one ARR song in 93 in a tamil movie. Nothing is known about her and no records of her song works. She sings with an asian oriental accent with a strong muticultural appeal.<br><br><strong>Jolin Tsai</strong> - Chinese singner who sang in ARR's first chinese soundtrack Warriors of Heaven and Earth. Well known in the chinese music industry. Her voice is best described as trendy and new age<br><br>Nice day.</div>
