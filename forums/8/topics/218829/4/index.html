            <div class='col-md body'>Another story abt a dog and the owner.<br><br>Biki: Dog with a Purpose<br>Submitted By: Bonnie Compton Hanson<br><br>When my father walked in the front door, cradling a tiny tan ball of fluff in his arms, all six of us kids squealed with delight.<br><br>Â“Daddy!Â” cried my little sister Judy. Â“Is that a teddy bear?Â” While the rest of us begged, Â“Could I hold it, please?Â” Â“No, me first!Â” Â“Please, Daddy, me!Â”<br><br>A few minutes later weÂ’d all had a turn at cuddling our brand-new puppy. And just like that, Biki became part of our large family. Indeed, soon we couldnÂ’t imagine life without this furry Heinz-variety friend with the eager smile and energizer-bunny tail.<br><br>Â“HomeÂ” for us at that time was an ancient cabin nestled among the Eastern Kentucky hills. All around us stretched acres of farmland and forestsÂ—a veritable paradise for children and puppies alike. Biki soon taught himself to round up our free-ranging chickens. Next he became a pro at rounding up our cow and the horses, and faithfully guiding them home from pasture. (Although theyÂ’d been managing quite well on their own for years!)<br><br>He walked us to school, stayed with us in the fields, splashed with us in the nearby creek, curled up with us by the old pot-bellied stove, went hunting with my father, chased rabbits and squirrels, and played ball with us for hours. He even let our cats sleep on his back. As far as we were concerned, Biki was the best dog in the entire world.<br><br>Six years passed. Finally, I was ready for college. Since we couldnÂ’t afford for me to live away from home, my whole family moved with me to the small college town of Morehead, Kentucky. Including, of course, Biki. He loved being with us in our new home. But without his chickens and cow and other daily Â“choresÂ” to tend to, and with the rest of us gone to school or work most of the day, he seemed lonely and lost. A working dog with no workÂ—no purpose in life.<br><br>At first we lived several long blocks from my school, but soon we were able to move into a small house right across from the campus. Hundreds of college students rushed from building to building or lounged on the grass under the trees. And none of them had dogs with them at school. What a tragedy!<br><br>ThatÂ’s when Biki discovered his destiny. For the next couple of years heÂ’d leave home each morning when we left. He then Â“workedÂ” the entire campus, carrying his ball with him, trying to be friends with as many lonely students as possible. Before long, he was as much a campus fixture as the school cafeteria.<br><br>Soon came more moves. First I transferred to the University of Kentucky in Lexington. Then our family needed to relocate to the big city of Cincinnati, OhioÂ—to an apartment building that didnÂ’t permit dogs. Â“But we canÂ’t go without Biki!Â” we all protested. Â“HeÂ’s family! How could we leave him?Â”<br><br>ThatÂ’s when the president of the college came up with a solution. Â“Oh, please let Biki stay with us!Â” he begged. Â“Our whole family is in love with him. In fact, the whole college is in love with him. HeÂ’s like a goodwill ambassador for us. WeÂ’ll make sure heÂ’s always well cared for.Â” So Biki stayed.<br><br>The last time I saw my beloved dog was the summer after I graduated from college, when I stopped by my old campus hoping for a glimpse of that brown bundle of joy. Sure enough, he was at his post on the front porch of the college presidentÂ’s home, his worn old ball at the ready. Spying me, he rushed out for a good petting. When we were done, he turned around and headed back to the house.<br><br>I watched him go, feeling a little sad. He remembered me, but this was home now. This was where he belonged. BikiÂ’s affection for our family had prepared him for affection on a much larger scale.<br><br>Biki quietly returned to his spot on the porch, ready to help the next lonely student who needed a dogÂ’s unquestioning love.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think this has been posted before.<br>Anyway i am going to post again.<br>This story is very nice.<br><br>A Boy's love.<br><br>On the last day before Christmas, I hurried to go to the supermarket to buy the<br>remaining of the gift I didn't manage to buy earlier.<br><br>When I saw all the people there, I started to complain tomyself,"It is going to take forever here and I still have so many other places to go.<br>Christmas really is getting more and more annoying every year.How I wish I could just lie down, go to sleep and only wake up after it..."<br><br>Nonetheless, I made my way to the toy section, and there I started to curse the prices, wondering if after all kids really pla ywith such expensive toys.<br><br>While looking in the toy section, I noticed a small boy of about 5 years old, pressing a doll against his chest. He kept on touching the hair of the doll and looked so sad. I wondered who was this doll for. Then the little boy turned to the old woman next to him, "Granny, are you sure I don't have enough money?"<br><br>The old lady replied, "You know that you don't have enough money to buy this doll, my dear."<br><br>Then she asked him to stay here for 5 minutes while she went to look around. She left quickly. The little boy was still holding the doll in his hand.<br><br>Finally, I started to walk toward him and I asked him who did he want to give this doll to.<br>"It is the doll that my sister loved most and wanted so much for this Christmas. She was so sure that Santa Claus would bring it to her."<br><br>I replied to him that may be Santa Claus will bring it to her, after all, and not to worry. But he replied to me sadly.<br><br>"No, Santa Claus can not bring it to her where she is now. I have to give the doll to my mother so that she can give it to her when she goes there."<br><br>His eyes were so sad while saying this.<br><br>"My sister has gone to be with God. Daddy says that Mummy will also go to see God very soon, so I thought that she could bring the doll with her to give it to my sister."<br><br>My heart nearly stopped. The little boy looked up at me and said, "I told daddy to tell mummy not to go yet. I asked him to wait until I come back from the supermarket."<br>Then he showed me a very nice photo of him where he was laughing. He then told me, "I also want mummy to take this photo with her so that she will not forget me."<br><br>I love my mummy and I wish she doesn't have to leave me but daddy says that she has to go to be with my little sister."<br><br>Then he looked again at the doll with sad eyes, very quietly.I quickly reached<br>for my wallet and took a few notes and said to the boy, "What if we checked<br>again, just in case if you have enough money?"<br><br>"Ok," he said. "I hope that I have enough."<br><br>I added some of my money to his without him seeing and we started to count it.<br><br>There was enough for the doll, and even some spare money.<br><br>The little boy said, "Thank you God for giving me enough money."<br><br>Then he looked at me and added,<br>"I asked yesterday before I slept for God to<br>make sure I have enough money to buy this doll so that mummy can give it to my sister. He heard me."<br>"I also wanted to have enough money to buy a white rose for my mummy, but I didn't dare to ask God too much. But He gave me enough to buy the doll and the white rose."<br><br>"You know, my mummy loves white rose."<br><br>A few minutes later, the old lady came again and I left with my trolley. I<br>finished my shopping in a totally<br>different state from when I started. I couldn't get the little boy out of my<br>mind.<br><br>Then I remembered a local newspaper article 2 days ago, which mentioned of a drunk man in a truck who hit a car where there was one young lady and a little girl. The little girl died right away, and the mother was left in a critical state. The family had to decide whether to pull the plug on the life-assisting machine, because the young lady would not be able to get out of the coma.<br><br>Was this the family of the little boy?<br><br>Two days after this encounter with the little boy, I read in the newspaper that the young lady had passed away.I couldn't stop myself and went to buy a bunch of white roses and I went to the mortuary where the body of the young woman was exposed for people to see and make last wish before burial.<br><br>She was there, in her coffin, holding a beautiful white rosein her hand with the photo of the little boy and the doll placed over her chest. I left the place crying, feeling that my life had been changed forever. The love that this little boy had for his mother and his sister is still, to that day, hard to imagine. And in a fraction of a second, a drunk man had taken all this away from him.<br><br>Dont drink and drive.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>I'm Sorry I Lied</strong><br><br>Jenny was so happy about the house they had found. For once in her life that was on the right side of town. She unpacked her things with such great ease. As she watched her new curtains blow in the breeze. How wonderful it was to have her own room. School would be starting, she would have friends over soon. There will be sleep-overs, and parties. She was so happy. It's just the way she wanted her life to be.<br><br>On the first day of school, everything went great. She made new friends and even got a date! She thought, "I want to be popular and I'm going to be, because I just got a date with the star of the team!" To be known in this school you had to have a clout, and dating this guy would sure help her out. There was only one problem stopping her fate. Her parents had said she was too young to date. "Well I just won't tell them the entire truth. They won't know the difference. What's there to lose?"<br><br>Jenny asked to stay with her friends that night. Her parents frowned but said, "All right." Excited, she got ready for the big event. But as she rushed around like she had no sense, she began to feel guilty about all the lies, but what's a pizza, a party, and a moonlight ride? Well the pizza was good, and the party was great, and the moonlight ride would have to wait, for Jeff was half drunk by this time.<br><br>But he kissed her and said that he was just fine. Then the room filled with smoked and Jeff took a puff. Jenny couldn't believe he was smoking that stuff. Now Jeff was ready to ride to the point, but only after he'd smoked another joint.<br><br>They jumped in the car for the moonlight ride, not thinking that he was too drunk to drive. They finally made it to the point at last, and Jeff started trying to make a pass. A pass is not what Jenny wanted at all (and by a pass, I don't mean playing football.) "Perhaps my parents were right. Maybe I am too young. Boy, how could I ever, ever be so dumb?" With all of her might, she pushed Jeff away, "Please take me home, I don't want to stay."<br><br>Jeff cranked up the engine and floored the gas. In a matter of seconds they were going too fast. As Jeff drove on in a fit of wild anger, Jenny knew that her life was in danger. She begged and pleaded for him to slow down, but he just got faster as they neared the town. "Just let me get home! I'll confess that I lied. I really went out for a moonlight ride."<br><br>Then all of a sudden, she saw a big flash. "Oh God, Please help us! We're going to crash!" She doesn't remember the force of impact. Just that everything all of a sudden went black. She felt someone remove her from the twisted rubble, and heard, "Call an ambulance! These kids are in trouble!" Voices she heard, a few words at best. But she knew there were two cars involved in the wreck.<br><br>Then wondered to herself if Jeff was all right, and if the people in the other car was alive. She awoke in the hospital to faces so sad. "You've been in a wreck and it looks pretty bad." These voices echoed inside her head, as they gently told her that Jeff was dead. They said "Jenny, we've done all we can do. But it looks as if we'll lose you too." "But the people in the other car?" Jenny cried. "We're sorry, Jenny, they also died."<br><br>Jenny prayed, "God, forgive me for what I've done. I only wanted to have just one night of fun." "Tell those people's family, I've made their lives dim, and wish I could return their families to them." "Tell Mom and Dad I'm sorry I lied, and that it's my fault so many have died. Oh, nurse, won't you please tell them that for me?"<br><br>The nurse just stood there. She never agreed. But took Jenny's hand with tears in her eyes. And a few moments later Jenny died. A man asked the nurse, "Why didn't you do your best to bid that girl her one last request?" She looked at the man with eyes so sad. "Because the people in the other car were her mom and dad."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>She was Not Beautiful </strong><br><br>She was not beautiful. Nothing about her was extraordinary. Nothing about her made her stand out in a crowd. She grew up in a family of six and being the eldest, she learned responsibility at an early age.<br><br>As she grew stronger and brighter, she instilled a sort of light and cheer to whomever she met. She was not beautiful, but she made others feel better about themselves. She meets a rebel boy who thinks he is all man, befriending him, she teaches him. She teaches him how to read and a little boost, the 'man' needed to go to college, they become fast friends and she fell fast in love with her rugged handsome student.<br><br>The 'man' then finds himself in love with a girl. A girl who was so beautiful. Her hair was a hallow of light around her. Her eyes the bluest blue of the ocean. 'Like an angel' he tells his tutor 'like a beautiful angel.' The girl swallows a lump at her throat. She was not beautiful, she did not posses the heart of the one he loved, but she did not care. As long as he was happy, she would be happy, or so she tried to. She helped write the most beautiful letters to his angel. All the time visioning it was she herself receiving those very letters. And so the girl helped him choose the right clothes, say the right words, and buy the right gifts for his angel.<br><br>His angel brought him much joy and much pain to the girl who cried behind her smiles. But that never stopped her from giving more than she will ever receive. Then one day, the angel he loved left him for another man. A richer more successful man. The boy was stunned. He was so hurt, he did not speak for days. The girl went to him. He cried on her shoulder and she cried with him.<br><br>He was hurt and she was too. Time went by and so wounds heal. The boy realizes something about his friend/tutor. Something he never realized before. How her laughter sounded heavenly and how her smiles brightened up the darkest days, or how simply beautiful she looked to him!<br><br>Beautiful. This plain, simple girl was beautiful to him. And he began to fall. Fall so in love with this beautiful girl. On one day, he picked up all his courage to see her. He walked to her house, nervous, and fidgeting, Running his thoughts over and over his head.<br><br>He was going to tell her how beautiful she was to him. He was going to tell her how wonderfully in love he was with her. He knocked. No one was home.<br><br>The next day, he found out that the beautiful girl he fell in love with had a brain tumor that put her into a coma. The doctors were grim and the family decided to let her go.<br><br>One final time he got to see her. He held her hand. He stroked her hair and he cried for this beautiful girl. He cried, but it was too late. The beautiful girl was buried and the heavens broke. Out a beautiful spring shower, a cry for their loss. She was the most beautiful girl in the world and she had taught the rebel boy-man to love and what it is to be loved.<br><br>She was the most beautiful girl in the world.<br><br><strong>Look around. Aren't there a lot of plain faces? Take a good look. A real good look or you might just miss out that beautiful person.</strong><br><br></div>
