Hmmm......[/b]</blockquote>yea lor.......the timing is a bit too zhun to be coincidence. the area where i live in is always getting fumigated so not much insects except for mosquitos and cockroaches, yet almost every year around the same time a big moth will fly to my house, stay for a few days, then die there.<br><br>and the kind of moths that usually come aren't the usual light brown kind you see around flourescent lamps that are quite small.... the kind that comes to my house is always quite big and usually has some fanciful patterns on the wings.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Mothman<br><br>Ever since the fall of 1966 people have reported a strange creature in Point Pleasent West Virginia. One incident where two newly married couples Mr. and Mrs.Scarberry  and Mr. and Mrs. Malette were driving through a remote part of town when at 11:30 p.m. they drove past an old generator plant. The door of the plant seemed to have been ripped off and that's where they saw it.<br><br>They reported that it was about 7 feet tall and its wings were folded against its body. The most striking thing about it was its eyes.  They were huge and red like bicycle reflectors and seemed to be almost hypnotic.  Roger Scarberry reacted by slamming down the accelerator. The creature shot straight up without flapping its wings and took flight.<br><br>The car was zooming down the road at 100 mph but the creature was still able to keep up. Once they reached the city limits of Point Pleasant it broke off from its pursuit and disappeared.<br><br>In the next couple of days there were many reports of a strange "Bird".<br>One report said that a car was dive-bombed by a bizarre flying creature frightening the passengers. Another report happened on the 14th. It involved a farmer who was watching television at about 10:30 at night when it went black and emitted a strange noise.<br><br>His dog Bandit started barking madly outside. He went out to check and it was barking at the barn. He took a flashlight and shone it into the barn and saw the eyes of something that he thought looked like two bicycle reflectors.<br><br>He was very scared and said that night he slept with his shotgun. The next day he found tracks of the dog in a circle as if chasing its tail. No other tracks were found and bandit was never seen again. On the morning of November 16th there was a press conference held due to all the reports and sightings of it. The creature was dubbed "Mothman" after the popular T.V. series Batman.<br><br>Sightings continued to pour in but all the characteristics of it remained the same. It's eyes, build, size and the malfunctioning of radios and television sets featured in many reports also a sudden increase of dog disappearances and reports of animal mutilations in the area..By the time of the next years anniversary of the first incident, over a hundred reports had been collected.<br><br>On the evening of October 16th, 1967, the Silver Bridge which crossed the Ohio river collapsed in rush hour traffic. Over forty-six cars fell into the river. It was the biggest disaster that ever hit Point Pleasant  and seemed to mark the end of the flurries of Mothman sightings.<br><br>People began to speculate that Mothman may have been responsible for the bridges collapse but the severity of the incident seemed to turn the public's attention away from Mothman and only scattered reports of him have surfaced since then.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br><img src="http://www.geocities.com/captainosmoteria/motheyes.gif"><img src="http://wchs8.com/traveling/pic/001109_3.jpg"></div>
