            <div class='col-md body'>Bar,<br><br>The disturbing thing is not the sexual objectification of teachers. We can always nullify it with the raging hormones of puberty. WhatÂ’s more alarming is that the complete lack of self-awareness, self-analysis, mental and emotional growth in the almost celebratory accounts and descriptions of some posts. A child or adolescent is easily forgiven for the sexual curiosity manifested or even displayed. However, less forgivable is the non-jesting and continued sexual objectification of women by older teens and some early twenties here. No doubt this will be detrimental to the health of the later representations of women theyÂ’ll have in life. To see nothing wrong in the sexual objectification of an authority figure paves the way for the expression of other sexual perversions later in life.<br><br>cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yup, i think teachers in singapore would do anything just to get good grades for the students without their development (as in psychological) in consideration.<br><br>I have seen too many Singaporean students here who came and lose out because they fear speaking out their own opinions. They come up with good opinions actually, they have these fear in them that prevented them from speaking up. It take quite some time before they get adjusted.<br><br>If you have noticed many many students came to N. America and feel very very uncomfortable calling their teachers by their first name.<br><br>Secondary school teachers could be very mean and do not give due respect to the students. Somehow i see that this is a very sad case that these students grow up hurt psychologically.</div>

Not abt "respecting the students"?!

Case in point would be Stephen Chow movies (Fight Back to School) in which the student sexualises his displaced "mature" identity in the school environment ; only by penetrating Zhang Min can the displacement be righted. So in a way, the guiltless posturing owes a debt to debasement of authority figures in the media.<br><br>Bish : Are there still rankings in schools nowadays?

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey sorry man, maybe I misunderstood the main gist of the topic. My point is not the sexual objectifying of teachers or authorities.

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Bars,<br><br>I donÂ’t watch Stephan Chow movies Â– they give me a headache, but I hear what you are saying. As much as the media has a part in authority-debasement, I also think the modalities of cognition should be juxtaposed with the availability of images. The detachment from authority figures is remedied via the Baudrillardian simulacrum in which the images of subjects/objects have collapsed. This simulacrum offers proximity between consumer and subject of consumption. Upon this proximity, the consumer appropriates the subject of consumption according to personal experience. I think personal experience is important because the debasement of authority via media does not affect all students and thus needs to account for the specificity in modalities of cognition that the consumer brings along with him/her.<br><br>Eck,<br>Just make sure she doesn't have her gun cocked and ready!<br><br>Does anyone have the latest JC rankings?
