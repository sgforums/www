            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>I posted similar paragraphs in  another thread " should male students keep long hair", but the democratic and liberal issue seems digress the original topic, so someone suggest me starting a new thread. Ok, let's start...<br><br>This short hair rule debate in the newspaper let me recalled a debate about Singapore's democracy and human right which we held in our culture studies last year. In the debate, most ppl said that singapore definitely wasn't a democratic country, it has high "parental control" system, just like China. and singaporean don't care the human right and democracy very much, because singapore is a wealthy country, and basically, ppl can share the social wealth, and ppl satisfy to the high living standard in sg and used to the safe living environment under the strict rule. So singaporean don't require very much in the democratic and liberal issues. That's our opinions to the democracy in sg.<br><br>Forgive me and feel free to correct me if I said something wrong above, because I am not a singaporean and I haven't been to sg, I don't know much about your country. Just the Internet brings me close to u ppl through the forums and the electronic newspaper.<br>Democratic and liberal issue may be a boring topic, but I really want to hear your opinions in this aspect, because I did very bad in my assay writing about this issue in my finial exam last semester. so much wiser in this forum, enlighten me, pls<br><br>What 's your opinions in your country' political system, and what is your future expectation to the democratic development in your country? How about human rights? ( i am currently doing a project about human rights, so want to hear more opinions)According the needs theory, when the basic living requirements are satisfied, what's the next thenÂ¡K.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>KK,<br><br>No, SÂ’pore is not a democratic society. Not in the way of western definition that is. We do have free elections, a supposedly independent judicial, legislative and executive system and the modus operandi of government is seemly democratic.<br><br>However SÂ’pore is not democratic because it is a hegemonic state based not simply on coercion but also by consensus. The exertion of political ideology may not be manifested in Repressive State Apparatuses (army, police) but instead exerted through Ideological State Apparatuses (education, judicial system, culture, arts).<br><br>A democracy is the freedom to form and join organisations, freedom of expression, right of political leaders to compete for support, alternative sources of information and individual liberty. At this point in time SÂ’pore does not fulfil ALL the above requirements. The reason for the need to seem like a democracy but not act like one has a lot to do with economic circumstance. We have aligned our interests with that of multi-national companies and global economic trends in what has become a Faustian Pact where most of us willingly give up our individuality in return for the mobility that brings economic gain. In the long run SÂ’pore digresses more and more as a sovereign country and represents more and more a stable and efficient vehicle (or base point) for the western exploitation of Southeast Asia. (After all the meaning of something is only what it means to others, and not itself).<br><br>Human rights as an ideal is accepted by SÂ’poreans but not embraced since social rights or the rights of the larger community override individual rights. As such, although we would know what you mean when you say Â‘human rightsÂ’, we donÂ’t know what it feels like. The Chinese moral ethics most commonly applied to our society is Confucianism, which does not value the notion of individuality. It seeks a utilitarian effect and this has been politically exploited to good effect.<br><br>cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My friend and i were just discussing this the other day and we have come to the conclusion that singapore is operating as a "dirty democracy" that is to say, it seems democratic, but beneath the surface, everything is controlled by the govt, from the way we think to the things we do etc etc, seems to me like a "1984" situation cept here we don't realise that there IS a big brother watching us.<br><br>Being in a democracy which does not give you freedom of choice is plainly ironic, and thinking of it makes me laugh. I laugh at how we can actually accept this, and then i am sobered by the fact that somehow, this screwed up system of a "dirty democracy" actually works. Sure they give you a choice, you can choose to conform or you can choose to go to jail. The only reason why the govt hasn't broken us yet is probably cos we are spineless fucks. They work on equivocation or double meaning or whatever its called, instead of an open ended question, you're given MCQs.<br><br>but this doesn't matter.why? cos s'poreans DON'T CARE! Money has sedated our society, money is like a drug and boy we're addicted! With our senses numbed, we thus need things like the courtesy campign once a year and people suppourt this cos they feel guilty themselves, the govt suppourts this cos they feel guilty for creating such an uncaring nation, the foreigners suppourt(?)is hmm... cos... maybe they need something to laugh at... ("Well Bill, here's a nation that needs to be told how &amp; when to be kind!")<br><br>Human rights... very iffy topic. Who came up with it anyway? I think its quite a contradiction in itself. If one were to practice his rights fully, it'll only be a matter of time before he in fringes on someone else's rights. A has a right to smoke if he wants to, and B has the rights to smoke-free air! And frankly human rights doesn't seem to go hand in hand with a capitalist system. Someone is always being exploited somewhere along the line! Where are their rights in that? If you ask me, frankly, humans are not worth it, unlimited desires, limited resources (Economic problem number 1) we will never be satisfied. to everyone here, good luck with living, Heaven knows we need it...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there is no such thing as a democratic  election in singapore...look at the new elected president...he was chosen by you know who....yet everyone is told that he is the elceted president...<br><br>and the last election with another big shot here...he told people that if they didn't vote for him he was going to make sure that your area got the short end of everything the government had to giveand basically make life harder for you...so what choice do we have?...hmmm?<br><br>It's a joke...they insiult the intelligence of the people of this nation by telling us something we know is so obviously a lie....but noone wants to say or do anything...why?...as stated by Msseus, because we have nothing to gripe about...We have rooofs over our heads, food on our tables, transport systems, jobs, money, family, friends...why risk losing it when you know you will lose anyway if you tried?<br><br>I sure as hell wouldn't say anything...not worth it.

(which i think is oredi no more left)...i tot they shd sort of like announce "authorities have intentions of upgrading chinatown into a blah blah blah we welcome suggestions and ideas from u ppl..." instead of saying "who who who HAVE DECIDED to upgrade chinatown to turn it into a --watever-- it will commence in when when when and end in when when when..."...<br>another incident...the thing abt the national library having to give way to some undergrd tunnels...somemore the National library just undergone major renovations and restorations a couple of yrs ago...as usual..THEY did not merely announce to the public..THEY oredi had the perfect blueprints and plans in hand...oni need to wait for piling and bulldozers to awake...of cos...protests are useless...again...<br><br>my stand is...there is no absolute democracy in spore...eben in such minor things..which i think we as singaporeans shd have some says in...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First and foremost, I am not a Singaporean but I do reside in Singapore to study.<br><br>I would like to know how do you people define democracy? What kind of democracy would you like to have? Is it the kind that the USA have?<br>My next question is do you think you are mature and responsible enough to handle full-fledged democracy? Think it through!<br><br>Those questions asides, I feel that pure democracy cannot exist anywhere in this world. There bound to be people who abuse this privilege and ultimately, it may create chaos.<br><br>One of the opinions say that the government should listen to people's voices before they carry out projects that concern the community. Can you imagine how long it would take if the government had to wait for the people to give their opinions before they could carry out the project? Moreover, it is impossible to please everyone so in the end there will still be unsatisfied parties and if there were full fledged democracy, these parties can do virtually anything to turn the people against the government.<br><br>We can see that countries like India are wasting not only valuable time but also resources changing the government so development is hindered. All of these are in the name of democracy.<br><br>Even in the USA I think development is also somewhat hindered by the presidential election because the change in presidency can totally change the direction of the government.<br><br>Take China as comparison. It's definitely not democratic but it's progressing at a rate that definitely scared the hell out of the USA.<br><br>I think the tradeoff between democracy and progress is worthwhile provided that the government is capable of making proper progress.<br><br>Look below you not above you!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From some of replies above, no doubt that the democracy in sg should be improved.<br><br>I agree with Msseuss said that money make ppl don't care about the political issue. How wonderful life in sg ? I don't know, but I just know that sg always be one of the countries have the highest living standard and best living and working environment. many hk ppl especially for the youth also envy u ppl in sg very much. On this point of view, we can't deny that sg government really did a very good management to improve ppl's living standard and the economic development under the coercion.<br><br>u sgean may quite enjoy the life in sg. In short term, 5 years or 10 years, that's all right. but let's look at the future, the long term, I mean 20 yrs or more, can the coercive policy stand forever??  Time change, society change, this policy better last for unchanged??<br><br>What is democracy?? basically, I am talking the USA type of democracy, Form my limited knowledge in this aspect, I know that democracy mean " by the ppl, of the ppl and for the ppl". Should every country enforce democracy?? Sure the answer is NOT. For example, china can't enforce tatally democratic policy NOW.<br><br>"by, of and for the ppl"  the three elements must happen at the same time and same place?? I also feel very confused if u compare Singapore with India. Sg is not a democratic country, but the government are regarded as " for the ppl and of the ppl", right?? ( hope I am right, hehe). On the other hand, India is a democratic country, but most ppl are so poor there, most of them can't share the social wealth. It is "by the ppl", but can't say " of and for the ppl". So I am confused now.(that's the reason i did very bad at my assay writing in the exam) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>Maybe I better say that sg and India are definitely not good examples to take about democracy for the three elements mentioned above. Everything has exception, right?<br><br>anyone care to enlighten me?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh well...all has been said...DEMOCRATIC??We have said the pledge.."...To built a democratic society, based on justice and equality, so as to acheive happiness, prosperity and progress for our nation.."....<br><br>We are working towards invisible doom without realising it. Just take a look at the amount of social issues increasing .... yeah! a developed nations having more social problems as it developed...We dun need an entirely full fedged nation but an empatatic and compassionate one...How many of u are willing to voice out and also letting some actions taken into consideration....??Yes??Maybe U can also help me to write to the ST forum in this particular Issue...that i have writtenn them 4 days ago which I have not received any replies from them. Recently BG LEE has asked us to make public opinions on all the social problems in SG but not blespheming the Government...This is what I wrote to the editor:<br><br>To: The editor<br>I am a Singaporean student studying in Canada right now in Psychology. After being here for 5 months, I have realise the transportation here in Canada though far more backward than in Singapore, but they do pay much more attention to the passengers with disabilities. Even for ppl sitting in the wheelchairs, they even have gadgets to enable the wheelchair to wheel smoothly from the ground into the buses conveniently. As far as i am staying Singapore ever since I was born, we often seen ppl who have difficulties in moving around especially in public transportation because for the fact that our transportation does not allow them to use them conveniently. It is already very difficult for them to actually hail a taxi to go to the designation, needless to mention MRT or buses.<br><br>It is quite depressing to see people with disabilites being isolated or ostracised by the public. They are also human beings like all of us staying on the same land, breathing the same air. I still remember a National song called "One people, one nation, one Singapore." the lyrics of the song touched my heart, cos we really come a long way to reach this stage. I do believe that in order for a nation to come as one, we must treat people at the same level and the same amount of respect, regardless of what they are. The problem with the society nowadays is that we see with our visual senses but  not with our heart. Those handicapped needs our attention as well as fair treatment in all aspect as well. I do understand the constraint  to cater to the needy because of the overpopulation and small area of this island. But I do hope to see a change or at least an improvement in the transportation facilities so the disabilites can enjoy a better living environment, rather have to think of all plausible ways to get from point A to point B.<br><br>Well...some might disagree the point i have to point out...but if SG is democratic to the Nation....the Nation consists of the unfortunate as well...We can be only be only thinking of ourselves....but not the needy...I am totaly disappointed and disgusted by the so called "humanity" we have in our blood....Why should we looked at ppl who are handicapped in another light??Why should they be deprived the so called "human rights"....in also going to Orchard road to see the Xmas lights..??Why are they deprived the freedom to travel around conveniently??Just becos they "are different"??Imagine ine day you end up in an accident and u have to depend the rest of ur life in the wheelchair??How would u feel if u know that u are not being treated EQUALLY becos u are DIFFERENT from the so called NORMAL ppl??<br><br>Being the majority does not mean we are normal....hope all of u understand this...<br>Those disabled needs more care and concern and attention then anyone else...so now now...some of us even have the time to get depressed over things that is in the past...Come on!Dun wallow in self-pity and see what u can do for those ppl who needs our attention and empathy more than we do...A little thought means so much, Actions speaks louder than words...write to the ST<br>forum to voice out your opinions.. <a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/</a><br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 21 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>YLH&gt; Look below and not above. GREAT idea, then again, why look at an example that makes you shine in comparison? "yeah, lets compare ourselves to China, THEY're not EVEN a democracy!" how silly!<br><br>I think most singaporeans will never be "mature" enough to handle a democracy like that of the US. What I'm simply saying is, ok, granted we will never reach that platform/level why bother deluding ourselves into thinking we ARE a DEMOCRACY?? It just makes us laughing stocks. I hate the way Singaporeans say it "Oh yes MY country is a democratic nation", and the trouble is they actually believe it. I would rather the govt come straight with us and say "sorry, we are only part democratic because there are some things we cannot allow to happen in this tiny island due to (state reasons here)". WHY LIE?<br><br>I can't disagree, the government is doing a GREAT job, really unexpected cos no one ever "thought that singapore would make it, but we did". Which is why i think this whole concept of democracy &amp; capitalism doesn't go hand in hand, and the govt is smart enough to realise that, and that's good for a young nation like ours, in such a precarious situation, the govt was smart enough to realise that the "pure democracy" will not work here.<br><br>All I'm asking is for them to come clean. I'll feel less frustrated if i knew i was for certain living in a semi-democratic country and not being given a choice for certain things than to THINK i live in a democratic country and being deprived of choices.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>KK&gt; i don't know if its a really good idea to compare sg to india for obvious reasons. India in its road to become a democracy, has major social obstacles to overcome such as the caste system so ingrained in their society. Singapore on the other hand has much less of a problem because we were relatively new and the pple just... well, assimilated real fast. the fact that there are many poor people in india doesn't mean that the govt isn't for the pple etc, it just shows that capitalism is dominant and that pple are corrupt, which is how the rich stay in power in the first place! The circumstances are not the same for singapore and india and to make a comparison will not be a fair test (under controlled conditions- primary sch science!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">).<br><br>as for you pple in HK being envious of us here in spore, please don't waste your time! its the "grass always seems greener somewhere else" syndrome...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I hv always wanted to leave S'pore, many of the forumites shd know about this...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  I dun like the way S'pore govt treats its people... like idiots literally...<br><br>Govt: Vote for me and you'll get MRT and upgrading. If you dun vote....!<br><br>SGP: Okay, okay! we vote, we vote!<br><br>I want my freedom of speech(not human rights here, pls), and I do not need to be threatened into voting for anyone during election. And the general conduct code of an election hv been broken by virtue of them suing other election candidates(of the opposition of course!).<br><br>And dun make me laugh that Singapore hv a fair judiciary system. Its one of the greatest joke of all time. I said its one of the greatest joke of all time becos there is another great joke, that Singaporeans actually believe in their judiciary system. Tell you what... the judiciary system is ok when the case does not involve any politician. Period.<br><br>Your PM was talking about the depleting values of the country's younger generations, but that was the hardwork of the education system in S'pore... and the voters were simply voting for your money what, the MRT, upgrading, etc. You think they really voted for a charimatic leader? Do you have one? Yes of course in LKY. His tactics suits his time of ruling, but such tactics shd not be used under current conditions. He is about all you have in Singapore.<br><br>Talking about politicians, I must say I respect Hougang's Low Thia Kiang very much. Been following him(spiritually) for many years now, and I must say that I'm glad he won the seat in Bedok(3 elections ago I guess), and also kept his Hougang seat this time round. First saw him contested in Tiong Bahru(shd be lah...was still quite young, but old enuf to understand his statements) 4 elections ago(dunno which year) and the things he said made the most common sense. I dun see too many politician speaking common sense nowadays.<br><br>A bit off track, but anyway, if Singapore do allow freedom of speech and allow free media representation(i.e. free to question policies), I think I'll probably be more happy to stay in S'pore. Someone in the forum once told me off that I dunno situation overseas and that I shd not criticise before comparing. I must say that freedom is one of the most important thing I treasure, and S'pore just does not provide that.<br><br>I know its a bit long already, but just want to cover a bit on Human Rights. I think its over-used and over-abused in western countries. Thats why u see so many court cases in USA, I guess...<br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming? Like asif I care.....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Abt the mrt and upgrading stuff, i think its juz another form of money politics which is being practiced all over the world, in the west and east. America got their share of money politics too and all those lobbying.<br><br>On the election scence in singapore. To be true and fair, we have a fair election, one which is not rigged. Why does PAP wins election after election? I think its mainly bcos of the success of Singapore in such a short time. Ppl want this success to continue. Another reason is bcos there juz isn't any quality opposition. Hey i think Low Thia Kiang is quite capable. He is the only quality opposition ard in my opinion.<br><br>I think our judicial system is fair and clean. At least it isn't ridiculous. Freedom of speech and human rights, animail rights or whatever rights is take a bit too far in America. If u take a look at the cases they handle each day, i think u will be laughing at it. Ppl can be sued for ridiculous reasons.<br><br>Moving to overseas? Its going to be a very difficult over there. Remember the Nuclear secrets scandal? Yah that scientist was locked up juz bcos hes an Asian. Theres no proof taht he pass secrets to China and even the investigators have admitted that he passed the lie detector test. They gave him thumbsup for honesty, but officials are still accusing him of various things.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have used extreme example of China in my previous posting but I am not only referring to China in my closing statement. Please don't get me wrong there.<br><br>I would like to know why a lot of Singaporeans are hell bent of having American-style democracy. Can anyone please enlighten me about the reasons behind this strong desire for American-style democracy?<br><br>Democracy doesn't mean that the government has to follow what the people want because ultimately it is the community's interest who is considered before individual interest.<br><br>I realise that there are some people who blame the government for 'bribing' voters with projects that will benefit the community. There are 2 sides to a coin. If the people cannot be 'bribed' by these projects, the government cannot win any vote, can they? So please don't put the blame solely on the government or authority but do look into yourself, do some soul searching if you like, and ask that question 'Am I ready for the democracy that I so strongly desire?' You do have to  make some sacrifices if you want that democracy, after all nothing comes free in this world. Are you willing to do that?<br><br>If I'm not wrong, even the presidential candidates in the USA do give similar promises during their campaigns. I think George Bush promised a cut in tax during his campaign but in reality, tax rate increased three times (in three separate occasions)during his term. Aren't Singaporeans lucky that at least the government do deliver their promise?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, Mind&gt; our election are not rigged but they're definately not fair.  imagine getting sued &amp; totally destroyed by the govt just becos you spoke the truth &amp; its too painful for the establishment to handle i.e Tang Liang Hong.  The candidates couldn't fight him in a debate cos they knew they were just lifeless &amp; spineless officials and wd lose.  Tang had spoken on relevant &amp; urgent issues close to the heartlanders &amp; already won the hearts &amp; minds of Cheng San.  So wat to do ??? can't win right ? use the entire propaganda machinery at your disposal to create a monster i.e Tang the Chinese Chauvinist to distort his image n scare voters.  okay so he lost eventually but  is there a need to destroy him SO completely, make him almost a bankrupt till he has to exile in Australia?  Even our northern neighbors make fun of us. I think Mahathir had more dangerous enemies like the Islamic Fundamentalist, ppl who proposes laws like  if a muslim abandons Islam he should be killed.  But he was gracious enuff to concede defeat when he saw his ppl had done a bad job in that state.<br><br>Hound_Dog&gt; rioting &amp; insulting the govt are not features of a full fledge democracy.  they are signs of social injustice, repression &amp; poverty.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe someone of u might beg to differ, but i believe that so long the economic growth and success is sustain, PAP will still win the election even if they dun do anything to do the opposition. Cos there is not guarantee that the opposition can do the same. The only different thing is how much they will win by. Juz in case if u guys think i'm a PAP supporter, I'm not one. I dun support anyone. Put aside ur emotions and think logically for a while, even if PAP dun sued the opposition, PAP will still win cos rite now most Singaporean are still concerned with the economy.<br><br>Yah i believe in individual rights, but i also believe in community rights too.<br><br>America or western styled democracy isn't as gd as u think. To copy their democracy and move it to Singapore will result in a disaster. Not that singapore's is perfect but neither is America's.<br><br>Juz in case if anyone of u think that America is the champion of freedom and democracy. U are wrong. I think they are juz using the notion of democracy to reach their economic, politic and military aim. To be true and fair again, countries all over the world uses this tactics which can be considered the oldest trick in the book, in my opinion.<br><br>If they really believe in democracy, i think they should believe in international democracy which is virtually non-existent in this unipolar world which is soon becoming a bipolar world. Juz take a look at East Timor. The ppl have been suffering but America did the minimum, cos interfering in East Timor will not benefit them in anyway.<br><br>Got a qn here, do u think smoking should be banned in public places? Bear in mind that although smoker have the right to smoke,     non-smoker have the right not to breathe in the smelly and harmful smoke. Yah dun give ridiculous reason like if non-smokers dun want to breathe in the smoke, they can shut their nose or walk away cos in some places u can't walk away, like in a bus?<br><br>Hey ngkaihoe, i believe in improving something and being creative. Instead of accepting America's style, why not we create our own.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Mind (edited 22 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mind,<br><br>If you believe that the American democratic system is used to achieve a specific political, economic and military agenda, why is it so hard to believe that the whole notion of economic awareness and dependency amongst SÂ’poreans is a Faustian Pact? In exchange for economic well-being vis-Ã -vis authorised leadership, we submit to notions of the community and a pejorative opposition. It is the same exchange used by America albeit on a much subtler and sub-conscious level.<br><br>This idea of a western/eastern synthesis of democracy best suited for the cultural climate of our little tropical island is itself an ideological narrative meant for mass consumption for the purpose of establishment hegemony. Choosing good eastern and western values is an ideological operation that validates mass compliance and existence justification that ultimately levels ground-level antagonism into political sedation for mobility and manipulation.<br><br>Hence the dangers of 'creating a new style' bring about the vulnerabilities of formation and agenda-based contortions that so avails itself for ulterior motives.<br><br>cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>*Sigh* The only thing i can say is, pls read my post more clearly terence. All my posts in this topic is abt driving across the pt that whatever election tactics is employed here in our election scence is used all over the world, including the west. They might be a little different in styles but they are basically the same idea.<br><br>Mooting the idea of our own system and style will involve certain dangers and certain group might exploit this. But when the idea of democracy is first mooted, dun they face the same problems too. Surely u can see beyond this. Being creative and innovative isn't what all of u guys want?

            <div class='col-md body'>Mind,<br>I agree with you. I think a lot of people, not just in Singapore but in other countries as well, idealise the democracy practised in America. However, what we see is not the whole situation. What we see is what the American government want us to see; that is they want people outside USA to think that American style democracy is wonderful so they can accuse any country of being not democratic when and where it serves their purposes. So isn't this just another form of propaganda or indirect indoctrination ?<br><br>ngkaihoe,<br>As I have said in my previous posting, please don't just blame the government. The government will not work if the people do not support them. You feel that the government is wrong in buying people's voices with prosperity and material well-being, what do you think of the people themselves who (in your opinion) let their voices be bought with money? From your posting, I have the impression that you think that the government cheapen or even insult the people's freedom of speech by giving it monetary value. Then what about the people? You can insist that the people have no choice but I think they do have some choices and I'm sure that they have their own reasons to choose the present government.<br></div>
