            <div class='col-md body'>i still remember last month at westmall, whn i was walking into popular, a school girl around 14 - 16 held on to 5 cds on her hand and rushed out quickly. With the alarm ringing immediatly after she reached the gate. but she didnt stop and continued walking hastily and turned into a staircase. I stood there shocked. didnt noe whether to chase or whether it was a malfunction. and the worse thing was no one chased nor bothered. so if you u see her, a girl in green skirt and light green collared uniform, rmb to kick her crouch.</div>
