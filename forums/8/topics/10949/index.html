            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Mr Rion, relax man.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Singapore's education system does have its own good and bad points. It is encased in a rigid caste, forcing people to learn what the government wants them to learn. Frankly speaking, what I have studied is not really useful in the working industry, but at least I won't feel so lost in it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Disciplinary wise is another issue. Youngsters nowadays have a different mental stage than youngsters before. I believe the issue of hair color was discussed before. So I won't elaborate further.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey,hey,hey!<br>Well, I have juz read all your comments... its cool. I just finish my Os and is waiting 4 results now. I had quit school after my Ns. Then I went to Japan to take a look at the life over there as well as do a fashion research and mix with the people there and cool down a bit. Happy Swing! LEts see where my next destination is....Aniway, school is still the same hotel I know.

Shaping the future of the nation. Dun mind my comments, I m a very outspoken guy, its more like shaping a nation of sheeps lead by a socialist( a type of guided democracy) government. Well, Singapore is actually a nice place to live in, the people R nice but afraid to be too outspoken. The girls R pretty n quite cute <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">, I can make happy noise( be happy ), the food is good, green plants all round, low crime rate, as well as this wonderful forum and its ppl inside. Kind of like this place.<br><br>Well, I guess U R right, I may be laughing at myself now when I m older. Well, in a person life, there is always a time to feel settle down and stop the nonsense( sing loudly at Orchard, Make one eye stare at cute girls ).

            <div class='col-md body'>Glad to see you cool down a little. From reading this thread you put up, I almost thought the education system dealt you a death blow that has traumatised you enough to spew fire and lightning over in our forum. You got political and I could not resist giving you a reply here. Here's two cents from me-<br><br>The education system is somewhat irrelevant because its mostly based on how much a person can read and memorise instead of how much practical information one can apply to their future professions.<br><br>It is indeed really sickening to have to cram the gist of several textbooks read over a year only to regurgitate its content into a paper of which merely takes 3 hours to complete. That is a sad prospect indeed, but I think you would have to agree with the following:<br><br>The authorities 'richen' the syllabus of our students year after year thinking that increased learning capacity deserves more input of knowledge. The latter sometimes takes the form of vocabulary that we don't use, or concepts that we would forget in a moments notice or even moral education that turns out to be very obvious propaganda attempts. The worst part is, materialistic parents encourage their children to endorse and partake in this race to memorise the world-- and the introverted individualistic youngsters grow up to become our employers; creatures of the irrelevance that they have built their credibility upon. I disdain paper qualifications because they reflect poorly on people and how well they can perform a given role/task - It does not show how widely a person has read, or how abreast they are of current affairs, or even how precisely a person is adept at any given skill, manual or otherwise.<br><br>Perhaps more efforts should be made to let our children learn things that are applicable to life. The current system clearly nullifies what little is left of curiousity and creativity. The Focus should be upon contributing to society rather than accumulating degrees and the like to gather material benefits and the promise of financial security. I think I had enough of it... but are things likely to change? No. they won't. The thousands of degreeholders would likely scream in horror should their 'divine' scrolls be devalued overnight. So, guess what? We are more than likely going to be driven under the pressure of conformity again. Read "Ken's Song?" it would help in people's understanding of singapore's inflated education system. Sigh...<br><br>One last thing I got to add. Although I agree with the spirit of your post, I must dissuade you from taking this kind of approach to posting on sgforums, Rion. People have a tendency to get the wrong impression of you and the Chief himself could very possibly ban you for excessive expletive use. Oh... by the way, welcome to our online community!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> *Rebellyon extends hand*</div>

Well, I almost let my mind blew off at the hands of the education system 1 1/2 year ago but its all over now. I juz had a feeling of depressed anger and grievance of pitiness whenever I saw the 12-16 yrs old school children after their school. I mean they R forced to become in a state of mind that follow orders only. Gush... I was like that 1 year ago...*Bring back bad and sickening memories* Whats funny is that when I saw the bengs and lians, I feel more relieved. No matter what the bloody society and the Singapore sheeps labels them as, they seems to have choose a different path than the thousands of school children... well, its juz a part of my thinking.<br><br>Well, I feel that U don't have to describe a society that we don't like it such polite and stable way... juz my comments again. Well, I definately don't think that a good degree should be  like a kind of heavenly script.. which can be used to make a very good movie in life and that let all the others who did not have it to be down in the pecking order. There are still a lot of things in life to be proud of, good buddies, family, good character, great determination to do well in an interest or career, dreams and so on. Not juz a piece of slighter bigger than A4 size paper that writes that a person had memorize 101% of the everything the society had told them to. The parents... they really need to have their braincells regrow not stop thinking that the society is greater than them. They will have to look at their childrean and told them that the society is not their grandfather. Society is bulid by us not that we R created by the society. And lastly, Yeah its crazy to juz to memorize everything 4 a sake of a paper. When most of the things will not be applicable to our future days. N I will not be posting in such a swearing way in the future, this time around, the emotions juz get to my head a bit too quickly. After I read the post I had put up, I thought U guyz must have been thinking: " Oh God, This felle most have been some kind of horrible ah beng who is very violent and acts without thinking " Well, I myself is a bit stun when I read it... honestly.<br>And Rebelloyon ~* Thumb up to U * <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Nelstar: Life does if U know how to appreciate it... There R lots of thing to do in life as well as dreams to fufil.<br><br>Finally, a bit personal...Juz a bit of self intro. what R U guyz doing at the moment? I m now currently waiting for my Os... and hope to enter Lasalle Sia to do Fashion Design in July.<br><br>------------------<br>There is the need all around for kindness for the ideal of love.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sadly, I never have any love for our education system. But we got to bear in mind that while creative as you are, this world has many types of people. There are many people who aren't as creative and independant as you are. They need someone to guide them. The government in this case is the someone. I never like the education system as it only slows us down and worse for guys with the National Service but there's nothing much to do unless your dad is someone in the parliament.<br>The government do need to change this old traditional system in my opinion though, with the advancement of technology such as a internet, we can learn and know a lot more even if one is not so widely travelled. The government somehow still stick to the old school method with slow and traditional changes. It is different in the past without the internet, you need to be widely travelled to actually interact with foreign cultures but now it is much more easier though a practical interaction with foreigners will prove to be better.<br>The government treat most of the teenagers more like babies, "moulding their future" for them. Unlike the system in United States where they treat their individuals as a young adult and expect them to be more independant. However, unlike United States, Singapore do not have the extra human resource to spare. They need to force and make sure every year, there is x% of graduates into every certain industries so, "moulding our future" is sadly a YES for Singapore. If we have our own natural resource besides human resource, it will turn out to be different from what Singapore's education system would be today.<br><br>My 2c and calm down =).<br><br>------------------<br>Death is an illusion created by those who do not believe in themselves, there for i shall never die<br><br>Treasure your time, your love and yourself before you lose them. ~Tango~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree that with the internet revolution, the education system world wide needs an overhaul. However, I think school is definitely here to stay. In fact, I quite like the education system in Singapore. And nope, I am never the teachers' pet. Just look at the proportion of revenue the govt pumps into education every yr. I know moeny/resources do not provide the benchmark in measuring the system here but at least they DO give a rough idea abt how the govt value the gerenations that are going to "mould the nation" rite?<br>I believe education will be the most profitable investment the spore govt has done so far.<br><br>- The sunrise is no less beautiful because the only person awake is blind. You are no less loveable becasue those around you are incapable of giving love. If we don't appreciate ourselves, who will? If we don't find ourselves loveable, who else will? -</div>
