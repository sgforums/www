I think just a simply dinner with my wife's side family and my mine because we are living in Singapore , very costly then the rest of the money can invest in the honeymoon.<br><br></div>

It's very MCP to have the husband dictate the amount of money to give to his wife. Nowadays it's shared account, shared finances.<br><br>9. children expenses - people always boast that it's expensive to have children, in fact its not.<br><br>10. car - thats very poor reason you gave<br><br>11. insurance - it's not necessary to have any insurance at all. you can get 1 or 2 but you don't have to dump your entire income into paying the premiums.<br><br>12. dinner - some of us forgo the dinner<br><br>13. bill - the first night in the hotel is usually included in the package. you don't have to pay for that. in fact, some hotel offers 2 nights stay.<br><br>14. 'sister's' ang pow - nobody in the right mind will give them a ang pow of a thousand dollars.<br><br>15. hard liquor - not necessary. you can tell your guest to BYO and you just pay for corkage.<br><br>if i remember you correctly, you are one of those MLM'ers promoting yourself in the MLM thread. I hope your "solution" is not about selling magnectic mattress or bogus perfume from paris.</div>
