Of course, if I want to plan and do everything for my own, I will still ask them to find out what are the basic needs, no harm asking.<br><br>I view wedding dinner is a chance to celebrate good things in life. Nowadays, people are so busy with their work and their life, that we seldom pause and look around. Which I guess lead to you saying the society is turning cold. Again, it is up to us individually to decide whether we want to follow the flow or change if we don't like what we see.</div>
