            <div class='col-md body'>I read an interesting article some time ago. It discussed the socio-political mentality of the Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia, particularly Singapore.<br><br>What is the Chinese Singaporean but a banana? Yellow on the outside and white on the inside. Caught between the West and East, we cling to Western ideas as tightly as to Â‘Asian-nessÂ’. Unlike 2nd or 3rd generation Chinese in America who can justifiably call themselves Americans espousing democratic ideals, we in Singapore, without a majority to assimilate into, yet disconnected from mainland China, are neither here nor there. Stuck in the middle of a Malay region, cut-off from China and riding the waves of the West we are an aberration.<br><br>So where do we go from here? Is it so simple to say we are a blend of East and West? Do we know what that means? How can individuals select and blend values from two polemic cultures when the grain of polemic ideals often goes against each other? Is this why we are so schizophrenic?<br><br>cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>personally i would rather forget the whole values thing.  my life is my own and i do not owe allegiance to asia because i don't think i get anything from being asian except that i look asian.  moreover the whole set of values are often dictated by people who have ulterior motives.  let's take mandarin language as an example.  the reason why it is taught here is simply because it is the national language of PRC.<br><br>following rules, or values, blindly because they are supposedly mine is being lazy and complacent.  why should we keep going on about western and eastern values like we're pugilists eyeing some metallic belt?  where's our metallic belt?  and even if asians win the world domination socially, politically, economically, who can guarantee that our beloved fellow asian neighbours will forget that they and us still have our differences after all?<br><br></div>

There is no internal clash of values since a bananaist fully embraces a Western culture. But the question is, can you be white with Chinese skin, or can you be Chinese with a western mindset?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to be truthful, I don't quite see the matter.  I've said I don't care whether I'm supposedly Chinese or not, I am my own woman.<br><br>Are you asking whether the world will let chinese having white mindset or if a chinese can really embrace western culture with it "not in his blood"?<br><br>either way, i think being born asian just gives me the look and the biological make up but culturally it is nothing. i rather like the idea of not knowing right now all my values but see how I feel about it when I am faced with certain situation.  if some values contradict each other then I have to decide for myself what is my priority.  Sooner or later I will get a satosfactory conclusion if not a compromise.<br><br>that's what i think, but i am curious about your thoughts.  why does ethnicity, sense of belonging and their repercussions matter ?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was tempted to add something along the lines of: we are not actually acting like bananas because we cannot fully appreciate what values held by the Chinese or the West, but I found myself unable to list any values that can be labelled as specifically Chinese or Western, because somehow or rather, the same value seems to be reflected in the other culture. Perhaps you could help by naming some values that you have in mind to be discussed?<br><br>From my point of view, I see being a banana as being putting western "values" in front of Chinese "values", so much so that you begin to look down on anything Chinese. I'll have to say at this stage that I disagree with that, because thats not what most people are doing. I would say that a lot of people are adopting whatever values that seem suitable for certain situations. That means to say, I think most people don't see themselves as totally Chinese or totally White, because they act differently in different situations.<br><br>So, I'll say at this stage that we are indeed shizophrenic but not bananas.</div>

That means that we are flexible to adopt any mindset that we want. Whether the environment is condusive for that is another argument. On the other hand, that means that we can also adopt values and mindsets that are not good, from either side, which is what I see some people doing. They embrace something which they don't understand enough and makes a mess of it. e.g. to take something like freedom of speech literally and fail to recognize its implications. WAIT!

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Terence<br><br>In my own opinion, Singapore has a mixed hybrid culture that adopts the Eastern values in term of political and social ideology, and also Western values which someone pointed out as Machievellian pragmatic. In some sense, the way of life in Singapore is a hybrid between old British culture (in the 1970s-1980s), Japanese culture (affecting us all the time) and American culture (which is now surfacing in Singapore since the 1990s). I would put it that we are seeing the invasion of American culture into Singapore by the number of Starbucks we have in Singapore and a couple of the US stores.<br><br>The Singapore government adopted what I called a changing of times strategy. They will mold their economic and social policies such that it would be packaged in the culture which they see as the most popular. Now that American is the superpower with a strong economy, you can see the politician promoting buzz words like dynamicism in entrepeneurship, re-engineering the corporation and try to give the impression to even students that people should go to the best Ivy league Universities.<br><br>I wonder sometimes, we are being followers to this fashion trend of the country's policies. But then again, I choose to be a non-conformist to the way things work for me..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hong Kong like Singapore before is attempting unsucessfully to shake off the effects of colonialsm. Its people are caught in the middle of two differing cultures and it's people finding it very difficult to adjust.<br>Bannanaism is not adept at describing them because they have a country and a belonging to China, through history and heritage even during colonial times.<br>They can be described as a very chinese City with western characteristics.<br>The same cannot be said of Singapore, through the old "Singpura", Singapore has always been a "nation" without a country. through its mix of Malay, Chinese and Indian immigrants it is still after 30 years trying to forge it's own identity and uniqueness. It will be to no avail unless people can rid themselves of their strong roots of their ancestors. Many of the chinese people who came to Singapore as immigrants in the 60's did so in avoiding communism and the Cultural revolution. They see Singapore as a borrowed place where they yearn for the day when they can return to their true roots. Whilst this mentality remains there is little hope of Singaporeans forging a new identity.<br>As for banana? Go anywhere in the world as you will see a Chinatown. This is unique amongst the races and is derived because Chinese through language and perhaps inferiority(?)tend not to assimilate into the culture of their host country. This is very much an attitude. Granted, condition is the obvious physical factor but attitudes and the way one perceives themself is the overlying element.<br></div>

I'll probably elaborate later but if anyone needs me to clarify my stand, feel free to post.<br><br>I'll be bold to say. "America does not exist". Or to rephrase, _Americana_ does not exist as an entity but as collgation of a similar set of ideologies and political grammar as the average Singaporean. The diversity of the United States strangely does not feature much in the discourses of ideologues except when it suited them so I feel it is important to keep that in mind. Read Baudrillard's essay on Disneyland. It's illuminating.<br><br>errr... to be continued. *sigh*<br><br>cheers<br><br>------------------<br>This guy walks into a bar with a duck on his head.<br>The bartender, who's seen just about everything says, "what can I get you?"<br><br>To which the duck replies "you can start by getting this guy off my ass."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Bars,<br><br>I knew youÂ’d come up with a postmodern interpretation. (laugh) Yes, I agree with you on the Baudrillard interpretation. I think his illustration of the non-existent Gulf War was brilliant in the way visual and literary semiotics collapsed in the simulacrum. But how far will a post-structuralist approach explain modernityÂ’s problem with identity?<br><br>Let us, for argumentÂ’s sake, assume the myriad of ideologues and ethnicities in American have been galvanised for objectification of global identity through media, movies and what not. This objectification is not only an external phenomenon but an internal as well. The ritualisation of domestic democracy and all things Â‘AmericanÂ’ give meaning to identity and not vice versa (in an Althusserian sense). This objectification, gaining momentum right from their Civil War and appropriations of political idealism from the French Revolution, have given the Chinese diaspora of America a stable (if imaginary) ideologue to chew on while the Singaporean Chinese is still standing on unstable ground.<br><br>cheers<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't get it, why are some of you so concerned about being labelled a banana - yellow on the outside, white on the inside? To me, it's no big deal. I think S'porean are like the Japanese in that we take the best of the east and west and we blend it into something uniquely our own. The Japanese were no great inventors, but they are great modifiers and they improved on lots of inventions from the west and dominated quite a fair bit of the technological field.<br><br>As I see it, if we can keep our roots of being Chinese by knowing how to speak Mandarin and know the importance of good traditions &amp; customs, keeping and also being well versed in the western culture, what have we got to lose?<br><br>I can never understand why some Chinese cannot be bothered to learn their own language &amp; yet have time to learn French/Spanish/German, etc, etc ... Yeah, yeah, I know that some of them didn't have the opportunity  because of their country's policies but hey once they start working, what's stopping them from learning? No matter how good our grasp of the English language or how eloquently we speak it, it's not our mother tongue. If being Chinese &amp; yet one can't speak either Mandarin or any of the dialects, you can't blame the Caucasians for finding it strange.<br><br>I think you start having an identity crisis when you yearn to be either more "ang moh" and despise things Chinese or more Chinese and despise things "ang moh". Why not keep an open mind &amp; take only the good values of both cultures?<br><br>I accept the fact that I'll never speak English with a genuine American or British accent and I'll never have deep-set eyes or a sharp nose, but that doesn't freak me out. Perhaps being bilingual helps 'coz I can switch between between the two easily &amp; I don't think that speaking Mandarin is so 'cheena'.<br><br>Quit wasting precious brains cells on this &amp; be happy that we can have the best of both worlds. What identity crisis?<br><br></div>
