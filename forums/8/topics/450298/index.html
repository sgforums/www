              <p>singapore government very hard to control what companies do, honestly... if companies want to employ foreign workers, it's their rights, the government cannot force them say no...</p>
              <p>HOWEVER, the government policies such as anyhow let foreigners come in to study (and give them money somemore) and then these foreigners take away the jobs of Singaporeans, this is something the government can do and act on. Unfortunately, there are 60% who voted for them... sometimes, you just wonder why...</p>

              <p>You complain that the salaries of foreigners here are much higher that that of locals, and there must be a reason for that. They are probably more intelligent, creative and talented. </p>
              <p>Universtiy rank has little bearing on individual skill. You can copy your way through any university (esp. NUS with its modular system), but you can't cultivate talent if its not there to begin with.</p>
              <p>Rather than complain and bitch about them, try to learn from them and improve yourself. The government cannot pamper people like you all the time. Work hard and be honest, and your salary will improve. You must prove that you are valuable to the company and not dispensable. Only then will companies pay you more to keep you.</p>

              <p>I graduated with a degree from a private institution and naturally I understand that my salary wont be as much as those from govt universities (NUS/NTU). Fair enough. But how about those foreign talents paper qualifications?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I had a chat with one of my friend who works in a bank and he told me that these foreign talents are very highly paid despite the degree coming from some india university which is world-ranked 16000++!!!! omg I cant believe it. Last year I worked part time in this organization where this engineer guy accidentally left his pay slip at the photocopier machine, at age 29, he earned $6k-$7k++, from some unknown university in the phillipines. I was like wtf....the hell I study so hard and earn $2k++ for? And guess what? Months later, the entire Singaporean IT team was replaced by indian nationals. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now Im so disillusioned when some of my NUS/NTU friends gets together to bitch about our salary ranging from $2k-$4k. Is there a system whereby how these FT's salaries/headcount are regulated? My friend's department hired the foreign talent as the head, then slowly the whole department has already been filled with that FT's country people. I have nothing against that as if it were me, I would leave the good things to my own ppl too. But isnt there a way to control it?</p>

              <p>normally when foreigners come in,the salary is negotiated by the agents who in turn get paid by the job seeker themselves.</p>
              <p>in your case if salasry is $2k /mthand average increment is $30 /year by company.then your salary would only be $2300/mth after 10 years.</p>
              <p>the dealings of foreoigners salary is done by HR manager and job agents.some under table $$$$ is  passed as in one case in past.the hr is happy....foreigner is happy.....job agent is happy...all except u who hasnt got a cut of it .</p>

              <p><br> The reason why so many foreigners are employed in jobs which Singaporeans can easily do too is because they are  much cheaper. Clear as daylight! They come here they all bunk together  4 Burmese or Pinoys men into one room of an HDB flat and they are out there to get that job which may pay them two and half times what tthey  can get back home  but the package is still 20% to 30% lower than what a local Singaporean will be paid in the same job.  Naturally the employer wants to save costs!</p>
              <p>But is it right to continuously bring in cheap labour to compete with your citizens is the question. The small man in the  heartlands  did not vote in a government  so as to suffer more competition and get their rice bowls broken , for the higher order of a better GDP for the country, so that there is justifications to  pay  their  leaders better!</p>
              <p>The point here is with the cost of living being so high and cost of
              flats are and all time high, and the expectations of Singaporeans to
              "start" a family- how do you accept low salaries and "bunk in -4- in a
              room with your colleagues,( just like the way  foriegn labour  lives in S'pore) to save on cost?</p>

              <p>I graduated with a degree from a private institution and
              naturally I understand that my salary wont be as much as those from
              govt universities (NUS/NTU). Fair enough. But how about those
              foreign talents paper qualifications?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I had a chat with one of my friend who works in a bank and he
              told me that these foreign talents are very highly paid despite the
              degree coming from some india university which is world-ranked
              16000++!!!! omg I cant believe it. Last year I worked part
              time in this organization where this engineer guy accidentally left
              his pay slip at the photocopier machine, at age 29, he earned
              $6k-$7k++, from some unknown university in the phillipines. I
              was like wtf....the hell I study so hard and earn $2k++ for? And
              guess what? Months later, the entire Singaporean IT team was
              replaced by indian nationals. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now Im so disillusioned when some of my NUS/NTU friends
              gets together to bitch about our salary ranging from $2k-$4k. Is
              there a system whereby how these FT's salaries/headcount are
              regulated? My friend's department hired the foreign talent
              as the head, then slowly the whole department has already
              been filled with that FT's country people. I have nothing
              against that as if it were me, I would leave the good things to my
              own ppl too. But isnt there a way to control it?</p>

              <p>There are alot of nus/ntu grads earning more than 6k-7k at age of 29(more for gals cuz of ns for guy). It depends on what he/she majored in.</p>
              <p>Not sure about IT though, but from my understading(correct me if i am wrong), our IT grads are not as well-recognised those from USA, UK, and the fast-developing India.</p>
              <p>For those ft u stated, they might have graduated from unkown uni, but bear in mind, those uni might be one of the best in their respectively countries. This allows them to gain entry to top-tier jobs avaliable in their homeland. After all, experience are equally(if not more) important than cert. of cuz, it's cert that allows us to gain the valuable exp.</p>
