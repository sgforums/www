            <div class='col-md body'>An interesting theory of time travel suggests a scenario where a bullet shot from a gun to to hit a target...The supposed future in this suggests that the target  is destned to be  hit but somehow if u can travel faster than the bulltet and shift the target away from its destined fate or destroy the bullet...u have altered the future..a flaw with this theory is that genuine time travel as depicted in science fiction suggests something to have already happened and and u go back  or  forth to alter it ..in this case the bullet hitting the target hasnt happened yet.....Its still happening at present and u just altered the present...There's no way yet to travel to the past or future to alter anything after the bullet has hit its target ..The fundamental law in this case suggests that we go back into the past to destroy the gun or bullet in which  case the bullet ceases to exist or into the future to destroy the same gun or  bullet which would warrant the event to be non existent<br><br>On the other hand this thesis proves the existense of an alternate future where the bullet keeps on travelling to hit another target or it just loses its momentum and drops to the ground if there's no 2nd target..yet the same flaw keeps popping out, nothing has happened yet..its just going to happen but there are many possibilites which is determined by the present...The existence of another target or no 2nd target at all......The future is what we make at present</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Bhai:<br><br>First of all, very interesting observation. I'm sure that time travel is a very fascinating topic to everyone.<br><br>Is time travel possible? First we have to understand the space-time continuum. Our visible universe consist of 3 spatial and 1 time dimensions. Space-time is a 'continuum' because neither makes sense without the other. When discribing an event in the universe, one must specify where and when it took place.<br><br>What makes time different from the other 3 dimensions? Well, obviously one can very easily travel to and fro in space, but everyone here knows that travelling back in time haven't yet been achieved. This is because time points in one certain direction.<br><br>There are 3 arrows of time, the thermodynamic, the psychological and the cosmological arrows. Most of the information below are taken from A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking.<br><br>The second law of thermodynamic dictates that entropy (disorder) increases with time in a closed system. For example, a broken cup will remain broken if nothing is done to fix it. The universe is one gigantic closed system, so we can safely assume that disorder increases in the universe with time.<br><br>The psychological arrow of time (how humans view time) points in the same direction as the thermodynamic arrow. Why? That is because we can remember the past, but not the future. To remember an event, energy has to be spent, this energy increases the amout of disorder in the universe. Therefore the psychological arrow points in the same direction as the thermodynamic arrow.<br><br>Lastly, the cosmological arrow points in the direction which the universe is expanding. However, we cannot say that this is continue indefinitly into the future. There might be a day when the arrow of time points differently. If you survive through this phase you may live to see broken cups gathering themsleves up.<br><br>Although time points in one direction, time is not absolute. That is to say, every observer in space will have his or her own measurement of time as said in the theory of relativity. Time slows down in gravity. Similiarly one can also 'travel' to the future by taking a spaceflight at the speed of light and  then returning. No laws of science have been broken. You have travelled forward in time, but the problem is that you cannot travel back. For more insight on time travel. Look in http://science.howstuffworks.com/relativity3.htm<br><br>Still, there might be a loophole that allows for time travel backwards. Supposing that wormholes exist, one might be able to travel back in time through a higher dimension.<br><br>In present day science, time travel is still impossible. However, we are all hoping.</div>

Are you referring to the quantam mechanics? Although Einstein played a big part in its developed, he did not believe it the quantam theory. Einstein was uncomfortable with Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principal and he once famously said that "God does not play dice".<br><br>Anyway, the above has very little to do with time 'travel'.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah and when we have time travel. Da yanks will prolly develop it, or the chinks.. and then they;ll go back and alter some events and everything will change without us knowing. how do we not know RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW things have not changed hmmmmz =)<br><br>Time travelling and universe discussion gives me a headache.. seriously.</div>

One is that we can go back and participate in a past/future but only in the way that already happened or would likely to happen and the other way is to go back or forth merely as an observer...<br><br>Another thesis suggests that our past and future is  our present and altering the present changes  the "old" versions of  past and future..Such in the case of the terminator whose mission is to prevent a "supposed" future by coming back to the  "supposed" past which both are  actually the present..If we destroy something in the past, it ceases to exist in the future, in this case the the point of the "new future" starts at the current present which in turn is the "past" in context of the "possible future"..Genuine time travel to the future  as depicted in science fiction is possible?  but apparently not because nothing has happened yet.THe future hasnt been invented yet..<br><br></div></blockquote>yeah it's a 4D thing right... we're not very conscious of the 4th dimension/parameter, which is time.... so all of u live in a 4D world. i only live in a 3D world tho.</div>
