            <div class='col-md body'>Thye will know if the sensors goes haywired......very often, if is human error.<br>my experience is worse........felt so malu! and it is in a GUESS boutique many years back...ard 6-7 years ago.....<br>As my friend and I walked out of the shop the sensors went off! We did not even purchase anything from the shop. We were so stunned that we just stood at the entrance....the stoopid sales person came and said...can you come in with us, need to check your stuff...As if my friend and i stole something. many eyes in the store was staring back at us. Luckily, an observant customer saw that a price tag was on the floor...and pointed it out to the sales person. That was why the alarm went off! the sales person apologised but my friend and i were so paiseh!<br>Come to think of it, last time still young....a bit goondu.....<br>If it happens now, i would have made a big fuss over the embarassment. Maybe i can get some vouchers in return...kekeke <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
