            <div class='col-md body'>I am always wondering if local graduates are more marketable or overseas students? In the case of the different specialization, I know psychology in Singapore is nt as good as overseas,and they seems to be crappy and not as attentive and dedicated as the psychologist overseas I have heard. SO what do you all think? Any newspapers reports or your most humble opinion?:}</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good topic Rinoa... but I have another addition to the scenario.<br><br>What if the degree is gained thru' distance study in S'pore fm an overseas uni? It seems to be that these are the bunch with the least recognised degree among all... I'm one of the victim I guess. It seems that many people don't really take degree gained thru' distance study as a real degree... maybe there are too many easy degrees around, which give distance study degrees a bad reputation. What I can say is that taking a part-time degree is really stressful and tiring... not many can endure the whole process.<br><br>As for full-time degrees, I wud think US degrees are recognised internationally, whereas Singapore degrees have an advantage finding jobs in singapore itself. But of course you must look at the Uni you're talking about. There are simply too many Unis in states, so much so that people always think twice when they see a "new" name...<br><br>same goes for Aussie degrees, which will provide better chances for opportunity in Australia... hmmm.. maybe I shd go to Australia then...<br><br>something irrelevant here... can anyone tell me what is Heartlander as oppose to Cosmopolitan? Reading Strait Times now, and dunno whats the meaning of Heartlander. The survey is about whether Singaporeans see themselves as Cosmopolitan or Heartlander. About 49% surveyed says they are both. Providing these info for those who are overseas, and are too lazy to surf the online version of ST.<br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming? Like asif I care.....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>that's a topic which do not have a definite answer. some company prefer local grads but some want oversea grads.<br>probable reason why chose local grads: cannot go into NUS or NTU, then go oversea<br>probable reason why chose oversea grads: they're more independent and more creative.<br>just like u, riona, i'm an oversea grad.<br>take accountancy for an example (cos i'm one of them), to be an ASCPA (australia), u have to take five module exam. to be an ICPAS (singapore), u have to take only a stupid ethics exam. so how do u value accountants graduated from different countries????</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa,<br>Hi nice to know that u are back. Anyway the demand for overseas grad and local grad largely depends on the profession. For Business, engineering....I think local uni students are more sought after. As for psychology, I think overseas grad are better. Personally, I don't think the people here are very open abt this kind of things. This kind of things are not as advanced as in the US or europe. So far I have read research done in europe and US, but few are from asia. Even less from singapore. Maybe medical, but not pyschological. I have no idea why it is this way. If u have noticed....<br>Anyway, I think this profession is quite good. In the sense that not as many competition as engineering and business....<br>Hope u enjoyed ur new year!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Guy25 said it. Depends.<br><br>In my most humble opinion (since I know nothing anyway), I get the impression that in certain fields overseas grads are sought after. Things like marketing, design, architecture, arts etc, which overseas places are seen to be more advanced than singapore, overseas grads will be more welcome. Technology wise overseas unis have the higher end stuff such as pharmaceuticals, so if there are jobs involving this I guess the people who graduated from the states would be more favourable.<br><br>Maybe stuff which singapore doesn't have or don't do well, like psychology or zoology, if there are such jobs in singapore, an overseas degree would be better.<br><br>But one thing I think people assume about graduates from overseas is that after a few years of living in a different place, going to their clubs/ pubs, talking and relating to people of other races, oogling at the boys and girls there... you are supposed to be more creative, wiser, more cultured, educated, mature, well connected and in short, worldly. I have no idea whether thats true or not, but I'm straying from the topic.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i feel tt overseas certs/degrees/diplomas are somehow "easier" to obtain than local ones...dunno why the the ppl (i m not generalising here...just stating wat i gathered from frens) who cant sort of "make it" in spore can make it when they go overseas...perhaps is the difference in education system...on top of that...overseas grads (those tt cant make it in spore initially) seems to hold higher pays and positions just bcos they have studied abroad...<br>however...one of my frens that had just been back from 2 years in australia studying A levels was told by MOE that the A level taken in australia is not accepted by spore standards...that poor bloke has to retake his As in spore as private student...hiaK~..wats this man?...<br>so, can someone give me a conclusion?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would be inclined to feel that other than the graduates of the Ivy League Universities (eg Oxford, Cambridge, MIT, Havard), graduates from other universities (local or overseas) are given more or less the same opportunities.<br><br>Nowadays the degree is so common that it is more like a "minimum requirement" thing. As long as you are a graduate from a recognised university, and you meet the requirement, you'll probably be considered for the job interview, which is the deciding factor whether you get the job or not.<br><br>For example, in the case of an accountant position in SIA, I understand that their minimum requirement for the interview is a 1st Class Hounours degree in Accounting. From my understanding there is no discrmination as to where that degree comes from (so long it is recognised by the company). The papers only certify that you are qualified to handle the job; your character and attitude are the qualities that will get you the job.<br><br>It is also widely regarded that overseas graduates are more independent, responsible and have better interaction skills than local counterparts. I suppose these would be added "pluses" that will help during the interview, but they are just factors and not deciding factors. After all, how can one tell that the interviewee is responsible until you have assigned him/her with the job? It is quite interesting to note that doing well academically does not really mean doing well in a job (something like IQ vs EQ).<br><br>Anyway, just some personal opinions from an undergradute from an overseas university who has never applied for a job before.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>I do not embrace my dark side, but I do acknowledge it;<br>else I can never be whole<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well...in the case of taking part-time degree, the reason that it might seems "less recognised" becos it does not have the good lectures as in overseas to let expose the kind od knowledge. And I really have to agree that Overseas grads are more independant..I dun even have tutorials here and students are mostly very interative esp those caucasian kids so you really have to keep it up with them.<br><br>And for courses who needs Labs and research, I guess overseas have better equipments and the expertise. Usually, the Profs actually know what u need if u approach them personally and they will try to help you as far as they can...dunno about local prof...heard they are really lazy....<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>As well as saying that students go overseas becos they can't get to local U is an alternative to seek higher education...and why they got higher pay cos I think SG education system is totally spoonfed and screwed up....so much of the theory and little EQ....you have so many input but little output...now employers know what they are getting into. A cert is just to let go thru the first step of the interview...how u present urself and sell yourself is the next important.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 05 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One of my teachers said to me before: You are what u are, u are not a piece of paper.<br><br>Sad to say, Singapore is still a society where paper certificate is still very impt. Basically, i think our education sys, although is not that bad, but it emphasis too much on the first step, ie getting employed, but not on the second and subsequent steps. I think we should we trying to produce ppl who can produce the results and not ppl who look fantastic on paper. Personally i think, there isn't much difference in ppl with overseas or local certificates. It is what is inside u that matters, not the origin of the paper. It is overly generalisation to say that ppl who studies overseas are more capable. My uncle send his children to Australia to study, saying that the U over there is better. My father also wanted to send me over there, but I have refused to go over there. Cos i believe that ultimately whehter i succeeds or fail in life depends on me and not the paper. Well my cousins have came back during the hols and frankly speaking, no offence to anyone, i dun find them excelling at all. They are one of the top students in sg, and after some time in australia, they dun look as if they have learned a lot over there.<br><br>Yah, can anyone tell me is Business Adminstration in NUS gd? Some of my frens are telling me the degree is too general, but some says the degree is gd if i can get a first class honours in that course. True? No offence to ppl from bus ad, but is it true taht bus ad is a dumping grd? Some of my frens say that engineering is a dumping grd too. True or false? Or do u guys think that chemical engineering will be a better choice?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa:<br><br>I do not really know much about the worthiness of a psyc. degree in Sg, but I think in Canada, if you want to be come a psyc. specialist, you have to attain a Phd degree in psyc..  Man! That takes years and exhaustive effort, but if you like what you are doing (unlike me), then those years of hard work are worth the time and effort.<br><br>No matter what you do, never get into accounting for anyone here who is thinking about it.  In fact, don't even think about it.  For example, I am swamped with endless paperwork everyday and yet getting peanuts paycheques for what I do.  Real frustrating!  Errghhhh!  Sad I know but that's the reality.<br><br>As about BBA, that depends what you want to specialize. If you specailize in Finance and Accounting in a BBA pprogram, there should  be no difficulty in finding jobs if you have a BBA in Finance and Accounting.  But pay is another matter.  If you are in Human Resources, it could be challenge to find a job if you do not have any experience.  I have a friend who had a BBA degree in Human Resourecs (HR), he is now working for a rental car company (Enterprise Rent a Car) serving customers and shuffling car between places; that's because he could not find a job in HR due to his lack of experince.  Sad I know but that's the reality.<br><br>Bochup:<br><br>Lots of unis in US.  In some unis, you could even buy a degree, literrally.  The only few prestigous ones are UCLA, Harward, Boston, etc. (I think, I am not even too sure).<br><br>I do agree that taking part time courses thru distance education or while you are working is really nerve wrecking.  I did my accounting designation while I was working.  All I can say is that I had no life.  My schedule is work on Monady to Friday and homework on Saturday and Sunday.  Real crap man!  But thanks god it's over.  I am not sure if I want to do something like this again.<br><br>Heartlander / Cosmo?  What's that?  Never herad of such things.

            <div class='col-md body'>One thing I must say though. This<br>gold rush brought by the technological<br>movement has certainly changed things<br>a lot.<br><br>I can tell you for sure, if you are a<br>good hacker, knows about computer systems<br>at the tip of your finger, you can be paid<br>big sums of money to work even if you have<br>not completed primary school.<br><br>This phenomena is largely unseen decades<br>ago.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Glad to see assumptions and generalisations are not yet out of fashion. There are 3 factors that distinguish an overseas degree from a local one.<br>Firstly, the field you decide to major in. It is generally acknowledged amongst academics and postgrad students that the American unis are stronger in social sciences. The average 1st degree spans 4 years (a UK uni will last 3years) because a cross-disciplinary approach is encourage where a social science student will take humanities or science modules for the 1st and 2nd year. This helps develop all round learning and also provides a broader choice to the as yet undecided student. UK unis specialise immediately. They are renowned for humanities and classical studies.<br><br>Secondly, the local market of your discipline is an important consideration. The US job market is wider and more volumous than most as such offering US uni graduates more career options unlike the Singapore market. A UK degree opens you likewise to the European market. A US or UK grad would find it much easier to work in the markets of the respective countries of study because these markets recognise their degrees or alternatively return to Singapore.<br><br>Thirdly, the overseas grad has lived on his or her own, fended for him/herself and (one would assume) observed and enjoyed a foreign culture thus picking up (one hopes) social skills and perspectives the local grad may not possess. This exposure, independence, alternate perspective and broader world view may be incentives for the employer though I know of many overseas grads who return as ignorant as when they left.<br><br>A heartlander is a Singaporean who by definition is local in outlook, conservative in values and is economically dependent on the local market. An archetypal heartlander would be a taxi-driver, hawker, teacher etc.<br><br>A cosmopolitan possesses a global outlook and has skills that are marketable worldwide. A cosmpolitan is one who has either studied or worked overseas and is comfortable with foreign culture. Examples would include IT specialists, economists, sociologists etc.</div>
