So if you switch jobs and your salary is 1.2K, your next employer may give you a 10% increment from your last drawn.  There will also be a tendency to push down wages since they may think you are a lousy worker that can be exploited (since you have such a low salary expectation).<br><br>I would like to tell you everything is fine and you will get your deserved salary after working for 5 years or so, but trust me, things don't work this way now.<br><br>Increments will be less than before and any additional money you make will be through your variable bonus.<br><br>So your basic salary can actually remain stagnant for 2 to 3 years until u get promoted.  If you can live with that, then by all means do so.<br><br>But think carefully before u take that low paying job.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>But think carefully before u take that low paying job</strong><br><br>It cuts both ways like you said. It is well known having a lower starting pay means when you negotiate for your next job they will base their offer on your last drawn pay of cuz.<br><br>The main point is if that person is the only bread winner of that family and is jobless for months, do you think he should just get the job first as long as the pay can cover his family expenses? No money in spore can die ppl wan leh....<br><br>Ask for MP help, they see you got leg got hands still cannot find job muz be you too picky liao. Typical human behavoir I guess.<br><br>So to take up the job or not is mainly on individual. If that pay is desperately needed to put bread on the table for family it is confirmed muz take it up. If family is supporting you while you look for job then by all means reject it and await the next better paying job.<br><br>My few cents worth of opinion.
