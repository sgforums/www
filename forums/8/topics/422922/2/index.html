              <p>This is because you are in the rat race in this free market economy. The only way out from this rat race is to learn to make money and get out from the rat race. You are in the stage of "realisation." Go and read books by Robert Kirosaki to break this cycle.</p>
              </div>

              <p><br>It is very important to realise that the main way to get out of this cycle is not to win the rat race, but rather, not to participate or take the race too seriously in the first place.</p>
              <p>For every 1000 people who participate in the rat race, only 1-2 might emerge as the winners who achieve passive income and able to enjoy life. The rest will end up slogging most of their life, trying to get to somewhere but never getting there.</p>
              <p>You can achieve happiness right now at this very moment once you realise what you truely want.</p>
              <p>Take a min to think this through.</p>
              <p>Many people look towards money as their goal, but deep down inside, what they really wanted is not money, but in fact, they want the things that money can buy, or which money can provide for them. Going a step further, what they really wanted is not these things either, they want the feeling of happiness that comes with owning the items.</p>
              <p>To put it plainly, what people are pursuing all along is just pure happiness, something which we used to have when we are an innocent child but somehow lost in the mist of growing up.</p>

              <p>Nowadays working adults are like zombies, working robots, who work from morning til 7pm-8pm average on weekdays and hardly had time for other stuff when they're back home. On weekends, the activities &amp; appointments are either so piled up that it's like another working day, or it's so relaxing that they think they're wasting their time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do we really have to work so hard, so long? Is it worth it? If you know you're going to die soon, will you still do that?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Personally i think we have to appreciate every single moment in our life, practicing mindfullness. We only have around 80 yrs to go before we're expired, is it really necessary to work such long hours for the rest of our lifes? If you take away the long hours you spend studying from primary 1-6, then sec 1-4, JC, Poly, University, then working. How much time or mins of your life are you truely living?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We have all we need - fresh air, water, food. They're not at a high cost. The majority of us work because of our fear of getting sicked, medical cost, insurance, burden and our endless craving of more and more and MORE of those material stuff which we don't really need. You are forever in your journey to reach your "destination" which is forever resetted and you'll be forever on your striving stage. This is sad.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Although i understand the need to contribute to the society and play a part in the economy, i think it's equally important to appreciate life. Our present cycle of work, spend, work, spend is really a waste of time!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, Singapore would not remains the leading economy if we slow down, but we will not DIE. It's up to you to see if you think it's worth it. We'll gain more by having less.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A white paper might appear empty and not as colourful as those colours you see, but did you know that a paper is white because it has every colours?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We ought to stop this endless craving of ours, we're living a demonic life! Innocent child are trained to never had enough of everything. The open market had spin the desires of ppl to the point where it's out of control. People are manipulating people in the management, media. Insurance are eating and fueling the insecurities that people have. People are lost, they work and work and work, but they never seem to be happy. They know something is wrong but they can't identify it, because everyone seems to be doing the same thing! People are committing sucides more often.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A world that is currently built on desires, craving (industrialisation, capitalism, consumerism) is dangerous. They're built on the foundation that people can never truely be satisfied, they have to be always on the mode - "looking for more" in order for the economy to work. They're boosting the demonic factors found in every religions. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's no wonder we're now at the end of times!</p>

              <p>how you know there arent many asian nobel prize winners or asian scientists?maybe the reason america had the most inventions is because they were the richest and most advanced nation throughout most of the twentieth century while china and russia's growth was stagnant cause their communist dictatorship was paranoid of western culture and capitalism.</p>
              <p>anyway famous scientists didnt make a difference to this
