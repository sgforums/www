            <div class='col-md body'>My newly wed couple friends were recently pressurised by their parents into having children cuz they are past 30.  But at the same time, they are struggling in their career, not knowing whether they will still have a job next month.  The media is trying very hard to convince us that job market has gone up.  "But is there job security or not?"  They said.<br><br>Their relatives keep bugging them and say "Don't just think for yourself.  Think for your parents.  They are old".  Then why can't the parents and relatives think for the young couple.  The couple later suay suay both lost jobs, no money to feed babies (yes!  babies are expensive hor!), are they going to contribute baby powder and diapers money?<br><br>But I told my friend, these people can be ignored.  It's none of their business.  Relatives are irritating!  Heng ah.. mine mostly not in Sg.<br><br>On the whole, money and job are the issues that are hindering the baby making.  Those who dun wan kids for personal reasons like "I hate children" only take up a very very small percentage.  Govt should look into the two issues before bugging the youngsters to quick quick get married and have children.<br><br>I can still remember vividly that in Jan this year or end last year, Govt told us to accept the necessary company restructure and retrenchment.  Fine lah.  If economy or the company is not doing well, there is nothing we can say but to accept or even embrace changes.  But then six months later, they talked about giving births.  (What fark is this???)<br><br>Btw, side track a little.... I just found out that the minority (I shall not mention the race) is still enjoying the subsidies for their children's education.  That's why their population is booming.  If the govt can give the majority population the same, then we (the ppl and govt) can talk about how to go about create and multiply.  Govt should at least subsidy Pri Sch children.  After all Pri sch education is compulsory.</div>

I agree! With the rising cost of living, falling wages and benefits, lack of job security, and the difficulty getting a job after you are past 35 or 40, regardless of your educational qualifications, its hard to find a compelling reason for reproduction in Singapore. I definitely do not want to bring my kids into this world to suffer.  Sometimes I wonder if any of the boneheads in parliament realise that.<br><br>OT: I also find it mildly disturbing that our children are being taught to be competitive from young, being labelled/pigeonholed and put on different educational routes at a very early age etc. Its like the local system of education is less about education but more about elimination. Not a very healthy environment for children to grow up in.</div>
