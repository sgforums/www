            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys,<br><br>Feeling pretty bored. So happen to chance upon this topic, thought you guys might like to share your views and experiences. It can be anything from past or existing relationships to how you feel about love these days.<br><br>For me, haha, no right mate yet. Still waiting for God to put one in front of me.<br><br>Some points to consider about as you share your views:<br>-does qualification and status<br>matter?<br>-does age matters?<br>-does his/her lifestyle matters?<br>-looks and size?<br>-race and religion?<br><br>For me:<br>-qualification and status do<br>matter.<br><br>If ever there's an rjc chick or some MIT scholar having the hots for me, i guess it would really take alot of courage for me to go into a relationship with that someone. At the end of the day, its the guy taking care and overseeing the welfare of the loved one. I find it particularly difficult to fathom a girl bringing in the bread and butter. Unless, under very unique circumstances, probably i would accept. Inferiority complex? Maybe. Also, guess it has nothing to do with gender discrimination or so. It's just that the world is cruel. Haha. Just my 2 cents worth. Keep the threads coming it guys.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: violet;">Age matters. I dun want to be dating a man old enough to be my granddad.<br>Looks &amp; size matters. If not how could i have fallen for him in the first place?<br>Social Status and qualifications matters. It may not matter when u are still dating but when u get married things are different. Imagine he is a fish monger and u are some big shot banker. Will the both of u understand the pressure and stress of the other party's job? I dun think so. Both of you would have a totally different lifestyle altogether.This brings us to the lifestyle, different ways of living life and different approaches to things. It will bring abt quarrels and eventually lead to divorce if the couple cannot work it out.<br>Thus i feel that a couple should share the same type of lifestyle unless they can really compromise. </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Whether or not your partner is right for you is one of the most important decisions of your life. Your entire future depends on these choices so how can you be sure you have the picked the right one?<br><br>Well, the first thing you need to do is honestly ask yourself is why you love or are with your partner? You would be surprised at the answers you hear when you ask that same question to your friends.<br><br>The wrong answers to that question include the following:<br>Because they love me.<br>It's better than being alone.<br>I don't want to hurt them.<br>Because I am not sure I would find someone better.<br><br>These answers indicate a relationship built upon fear, insecurity and pity. There are good matches out there, but if there are too many ifs, ands or buts then sooner or later the relationship will fail. Now that doesn't mean you will break up, you could stay together for the rest of your lives and still fail as a couple.<br><br>So the question still remains, how do you choose the right partner?<br>Obviously you are going to choose a partner that you are physically<br>attracted to. Apart from that aspect, there are a few important areas you should look at:<br><br>Communication Level<br>When you talk to them, are they on the same level as you? How long does it take them to answer your question? Do you get bored because they answer everything else under the sun rather than the question you asked or do you enjoy the tangents they take you on?<br>Do they speak very slowly compared to you? Do they understand you when you speak? Can you really talk to them about absolutely anything? This may not seem important now but could you imagine living with someone for the next 50 - 70 years that can never answer a direct question, frustrates you to no end by their speed of communication and just doesn't get it when are trying to explain something to them?<br><br>Common Interests<br>This is really a given. You have to have something in common with them to be able to be with them. Otherwise you will have nothing to talk about and nothing to do together. Yes, physically you may have great sex, but how far can that really take you? When two people have different interests, one person usually ends up sacrificing their desires for the other person... or you end up living completely separate lives.<br><br>Ambitions<br>Do you both want the same things in life or are they going to hold you  back? Are they willing to let you have that career you have always wanted. Even if it means working long hours plus going to school at night?<br><br>Ethics Level<br>Do they have the same values as you? Would they feel totally OK doing<br>something that you would have strong objections to or vice versa? Do you have the same beliefs on major issues such as religion, prejudice, raising children etc? If not, is this something that will become a problem in the future?<br><br>Grooming and Cleanliness<br>Are they a slob and you the type of person that likes to keep the house<br>immaculate? Do you take the same level of care of your appearance?<br><br>There is a lot of false information about relationships out there. One of<br>the biggest lies is that opposites attract. That is really just a myth. Now<br>a lot of the things I have listed above do come down to personal choice. It comes down to what you are and are not willing to accept. Just because you have fallen in love with someone does not mean that they are the right one for you. The number of people in physically abusive relationships should be testament enough to that. One thing is for sure. Do not settle for something less than you want because you are scared of hurting them, being alone or you feel this might be the best you can get. You never know what you might have missed that was right around the corner. Settling is always settling, no matter what way you look at it. By doing so, you will be left with a lifetime of "what ifs".<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
