I brought him there before and then he said he wanna go home then walked off in another direction until I told him wrong liao<br><br>He abit siao siao also, Whole day keep tellinh me his weird sexual fantasies until I don't want to talk to him liao.. When I talk seriously to him about his future and poly admission, He scolded me and told me ONLY to talk to him when I decide to talk crap with him like how he wants to OWN EVERY single DVD in the world, One per title.. Told him he would become a bum but he still fantasize about having a 4 storey bungalow when he doesn't have any special talents<br><br>He depleted his bank account already and still keeps spending like no tomorrow<br><br>He is 16 going to turn 17 this year..

            <div class='col-md body'>hi,<br>let me speak from a parent's point of view.<br><br>Setting a curfew is hard considering that I was young once and I do enjoy hanging out with my friends, talking just about everything under the skies, sharing our victory stories about our parents, friends or teachers. Those were the days.<br><br>but look @ what is out there now. It is like a sea where you can never satisfy its' hunger.  There are too many real stories out there that just scare the hell out of every parents.<br><br>The one where the gal was kept for a few days and tortured?<br>The two boys who were dudded the "MacDonalds boys",<br>The gang fights.<br><br>We as parents understand the freedom you desire.<br>But we are more worried that trouble come to you than for you to make trouble. One wrong look, one wrong move can bring youngsters endless trouble.<br><br>Look at Singapore Christmas Party at orchard, I bet many parents would have asked their children not to go, but I bet most went anyway. Then the foul cries of being molest, being in gang fights. No point in "I told you so" stories then, right?<br><br>I totally agree that if we, parents were to hand-hold our children, hey, they won't be able to take the knocks of life. They won't know the danger, and most important the consequences of their actions.<br>Most of teenagers think they are young, they can afford to make mistakes, but hey, one you are marked by the law. This society does not forgive that easily.<br><br>However, if a proper framework is establised and trust is establised, then it is easier for parent-child relationship to progress. I was taught that when the child is young, you can correct and if necessary, scold, but once in primary, you need to be their friend, to understand.<br><br>Almost all parents wish their child will go forth and grap the stars, achieve greatness, be better in their lives than the parents.<br><br>rem the old saying "I eat rice more than...", well, just say that we, parents have been there, done that.</div>

Like my friend, Already passed 16 going to be 17 soon but about 40% of the teens would be breaking the curfew by the law but he would be home 6 hours before <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
