            <div class='col-md body'>If they are rude, just reprimand them or ask for their name and lodge a complaint. Or You could always tell them "oh c'mon, you are just a sales girl here...please serve me a better attitude".<br><br>Of course some salesgirls will keep looking at you la but it's just to make sure that whenever you need help, they can always attend to you immediately. Why would they be afraid that you steal when there are cameras all around the stores/shopping centre? Looking at you is standard la...you go where also the same.<br><br>I guess the best thing they can do is to greet you when you enter the store and then leave you alone. then whenever you look at them as if you need help, they will attend to you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
