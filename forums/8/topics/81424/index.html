            <div class='col-md body'>That's the problem with Singapore Sales staff.<br><br>They seem to give the snub to local consumers if they are not decked out in designer clothing.<br><br>Apart from that. they seem to treat caucasians, japanese with such favourtism that it makes you wonder if we're still a british colony or the Japanese occupation.<br><br>It really churns my stomach to see sales staff possessing such traits.<br><br>The colonial rule is over! Kaput! And so is the Jap Occupation! We don't have to lick their boots or their behinds for that matter!<br><br>If it is argued that the above mentioned have higher spending power, I would agree. But should you consider the number of locals as compared to tourist stepping into the boutique, it is statistically higher for us locals.<br><br>Bearing in mind that the Singapore Sale is on, I urge all netizens here to give this pugnacious, boot licking, anglophilic, insolent sales staff a piece of our mind should they scorn and snub at us!<br><br>Make a scene! Tell them you want to talk to their manager, if the manager treats you like them too, bring it up to their big boss! For all you know, they might give you an incentive.<br><br>But our main purpose is to incalcate these recalcitrant sales personels that they should treat every customer equally!<br><br>PS : I'm gonna walk into some designer boutique in singlet and shorts one day and ask my bulter to hand them my platinium card!!!Jus a thought <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
