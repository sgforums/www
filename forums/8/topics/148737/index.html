            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">PISCES WOMAN</span></strong><br><br>She likes to be in a dream world than to be in reality. She is weak &amp; sensitive when it's come to "Love". She can cry if her best friend is breaking up, &amp; she can be over excited when her friend gets a new boyfriend, who is good looking &amp; rich even if it's nothing concerned her at all. U might be surprised to see that she is shy just because she is in love. More or less it will be in Pisces woman. She loves small animal &amp; gifted in training animals. She has sixth senses &amp; she can guess what will happen next, it's her nature. Even she has a good sixth senses, she cannot pick or foreseen her own choice of lover. She cannot tell if she meet a sincere guy or a one night stand guy. She likes to buy &amp; pick her own clothes. She likes to dress cute &amp; be cute. Pisces woman tend to be good looking woman &amp; has a nice skin. Her hands &amp; feet are small &amp; soft. Pisces woman loves to shop for shoes as if she collects them. She is a hot lady that everyone wants her. Whether she has a man in her life or not , she will never try to over power any man. It's not even in her thought. She thinks man can handle things better, &amp; she will make her man feel that way. She is an easy going person, so being with her is easy. She is a confident woman &amp; likes to make people who stay with her happy. She knows how to please &amp; how to comfort a man. If something is wrong, she will try to make other people believe that it's must be because of someone else, not because of her love one. She will not push her man to be ambitious but to make him feel like he should be happy with the way he is now. She is happy with u for what u are now. A Pisces woman , if she has a bad childhood, she will always remember it &amp; it will make her a very unhappy person. She will pity herself &amp; feel sorry for herself. She tends to hurt herself without knowing it &amp; so vulnerable to drugs (real drugs or just sleeping pills). She has many choices &amp; u can never tell which path she going to take. If u love her, then hold her tight because she never knows why she did what she did or what she will do next. A complex character. U may think she is a shy innocent type &amp; can't hurt anyone, then u are wrong. U might think she is a fragile person who needs protection, wrong again. She has been through a lot, a tough cookie. She is a dreamer &amp; love the word "Love", so she is the type who will buy gift for anyone for any occasion, especially if it is a gift for wedding or an anniversary even for someone who she does not know so well. Be very careful if u fall in love with Pisces woman. She can be a total different person before &amp; after. She can be an angel before &amp; later a witch, but everyone is not perfect, right? She will be soft &amp; gentle most of the time, so not to worry. She is emotional &amp; extremely sensitive when she frequently got hurt. She is the type who can cry her heart out. She can have a secret fear inside, when she says she does not need anyone. She badly needs someone to protect her, but sometimes she can hide that feeling by being stubborn. She likes to hide her shyness &amp; her weakness from her enemy. She does not like to follow any fixed rules. She can be a good housewife if u know how to handle her. Many men will ask to marry her because she is a 100% woman. If she wants to be sweet, she is a real angel.<br></div>
