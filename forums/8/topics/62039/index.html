            <div class='col-md body'>The importance of learning can never be stressed enough. Once learning stops, there will be stagnation. For any organisation to function well in the ever-changing environment, its members must learn constantly and effectively.<br><br>Different people learn differently. The learning process will be more effective if one understands oneÂ’s learning style and uses the appropriate learning method for oneself.<br><br>In this article, you will read about the four learning styles identified by learning theorist such as D.A. Kolb, and P. Honey and A. Mumford, together with some guidelines that will help you discover the learning methods and activities that will be most suitable and beneficial to you.<br><br>ACTIVIST<br><br>Activists like to interact with other people and are constantly doing something. They concentrate fully on what they do, perhaps with little thought about the consequences. They love new experiences and actively brainstorm to solve problems. The Activist will Â“ try anything onceÂ”.<br><br>The Activist learns best:<br>- in Â‘here and nowÂ’ activities, e.g. competitive teamwork tasks or games<br>- when he plays a central role, e.g. when he leads discussions or gives presentations<br>- when he is allowed to generate ideas without restrictions<br><br>REFLECTOR<br><br>Reflectors like to make observations and think things through. Every experience, opinion and piece of information is valuable to them. They like to consider all possible angles and consequences before making a decision. Being thorough and cautious is important to Reflectors.<br><br>The Reflector learns best:<br>- in activities where he gets to observe, analyse and contemplate<br>- when he carries out in-depth research such as investigating, assembling information and probing to get to the bottom of things<br>- when he gets the opportunity to review happenings and learning points<br><br>THEORIST<br><br>Theorists go by logic. They tackle problems in a logical, analytical and systematic way. They are interested in basic assumptions, principles, theories and models. They strive for perfection. Being certain is important to Theorists.<br><br>The Theorist learns best:<br>- when he can methodically explore the links between ideas, events and situations<br>- when he understands ideas and concepts that are clearly based on logic and are well-argued<br>- when he can analyse and explain the reasons for success or failure<br><br>PRAGMATIST<br><br>Pragmatists like to try new ideas, theories and techniques to see if they work. They are impatient, down-to-earth people who like making practical decisions when solving problems. The Pragmatist is the one who says: Â“There is always a better way,Â” and Â“If it works, itÂ’s goodÂ”.<br><br>The Pragmatist learns best:<br>- when he is shown techniques of doing things with clear practical advantages<br>- when he gets many opportunities to practise and experiment, especially with coaching/feedback from a recognised and experienced expert<br>- when he can concentrate on practical issues, e.g. drawing up action plans with a defined objective, suggesting short-cuts, etc.<br><br>Once you have identified and understood your learning style, you can employ the most suitable learning methods and activities for yourself. You may find the learning process much more enjoyable and effective, and become a more active learner and valuable member of your team.<br><br><a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/armynews/display0.asp?articleId=44" rel="nofollow">http://www.mindef.gov.sg/armynews/display0.asp?articleId=44</a><br><br>wat is ur learning style?</div>
