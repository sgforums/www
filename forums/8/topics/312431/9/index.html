              man, they are just not born with a "heart"! so pitiful man! this forum
              gave me a very very bad impression, cos everytime i see any post
              regarding animals posted here, there are bound to be idiots stirring up
              troubles. next time if people need help from forumers, please DON'T

              messing up the world! from one of ur post, i see you love meat ya, but
              do you know that studies have shown, your personal impact on global
              warming may be influenced as much by what you eat as by what you drive?
              the single best way for us to combat global warming is to go vegetarian
              or vegan! well i'm not going to go further, if ur interested, do some

              <p>i agree with fatum on one point, is that someone should apologise for demonizing the indian man.</p>
              <p>and for you all to be objective too. love animals, that's great, but remember we only have that much resources to do so. don't forget your fellow man in your holy crusade to save all of them furries.</p>
              <p>and when i mean don't forget your fellow man means putting strays above the dignity of a human being.</p>

                                      you drive? the single best way for us to combat global warming is
                                      to go vegetarian or vegan! well i'm not going to go further, if ur
                                      interested, do some research. u might think this is bullshit, but
                                      do not challenge me on this, if you want, go challenge the

              <p>I can see a very simple solution to it.</p>
              <p>If you like cats, adopt it, help it, whatever. If you don't,
              don't even post or even bother, why piss yourselves off? Don't you
              have other things to worry about? Will stray cats affect your job?
              Your marriage? Or whatever else that needs worrying off?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Someone is being nice and is trying to help those poor cats.
              They're animals, and they have lives too. Just like us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>People worry about litter, food, poo and crap. If you own a cat,
              or know about it, you should know cats aren't like dogs, which just
              leaves a big mess behind.</p>
              <p>For people who are feeding them in public. Do your job, clean up
              after yourselves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Everyone plays their part. Everyone is happy. Why flame in the
              first place?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Or is that always the case in SgF? Someone wants to help or
              seeks help, they get shit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw Fatum. You're really taking a radical turn in this thread.
              It's ridiculous.</p>
