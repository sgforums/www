              <p>i don't see you inconveniencing yourself to clean up after them, dude. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>
              <p>i like animals too, but if you're going to be a zealot, it's got to be more than just sitting behind a computer and type "FIGHT THE POWER", you know?</p>
              <p>letting the cats roam free is a double edged sword. they're going to make a big mess, do spare a thought for those who actually clean those mess up. maybe you should spend a day cleaning up all that cat shit, and then see if you still think they're cute and furry.</p>
              <p>just my humble 2 cents worth.</p>

              <p>sterilised cats still poop all over the place. poop which aren't cleared by you or me. maybe we should get opinions from those people who clean up cat shit everyday?</p>
              <p>and there must be a reason why whoever who called pest control did what he did. to go out of his way to call pest control, it must have disturbed him greatly, maybe their night meowing is disturbing his sleep until he cannot do his day job? i mean, if its tolerable, i really can't be bothered to call pest control etc. unless its something that i've tolerated for ages until i cannot tolerate anymore, right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>don't get me wrong. i'm pretty neutral about it. but i'm suggesting that we all think in a wider scope. think about people who are cleaning up the mess, for starters. and for the record, i think its terrible that there are crazy folks who torture cats and kill them by stomping on them etc.</p>

              <p>exactly. they don't know any better. so the only solutions i see (apart from tolerating) is either you move yourself, or you move the cats. and it's alot cheaper to move the cats.</p>
