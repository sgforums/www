              <p>the thing about being all righeous about saving the planet. it's so easy to be a hypocrite.</p>
              <p>so it's not right to deal with the stray cats, but it's alright to exterminate rats?</p>
              <p>it's right to promote CFC free sprays, but yet you burn so much paper money during hungry ghost festivals?</p>
              <p>while on one hand you try to solve deforestation by using recycled paper, you drive cars which uses petrols which is collected by invading wildlife's territory and drilling lots of holes on the other?</p>
              <p>and my personal favourite, you condemn dolphin-unsafe tuna, but yet you enjoy a good bowl of shark's fin soup.</p>
              <p>and not forgetting, some of the vegetables you vegans eat are sprayed with pesticides, which harms the eco system and poison insects and animals and birds too. oh dear. i wonder how you folks sleep at night</p>

              <p>nope. i really do admire them. and it's not vegetarians who deserve scolding. it's vegetarians who think that meat-eaters are cruel and heartless that deserve scolding.</p>
              <p>being a vegetarian is a personal choice. but don't give me that "i became a vegetarian to save the planet" crap, because it makes you a hypocrite. if you say that you became a vegetarian because you want to live healthily and stuff, yeah i think it's cool. but damn man, you think you're making the world a better place by eating rabbit food, while you're using styrofoam, eating pesticide laced food, taking petrol-using transport, using make up which was tested on lab animals.. etc..</p>
              <p>sorry, i don't buy it.</p>
              <p>and i don't pick on anyone on sgforum, unless something bugs me. and seeing that indian man being demonized as heartless and cruel while you all shoot your vegetarian mouth off without even understanding his plight is something which bugs me alot. it probably bugs fatum too.</p>
              <p>and i don't think i'm wrecking anyone's image here, but i'm here to point out the rubbish that you're dishing out. i'll never place a human being beneath an animal, (not including animal-torturers). and i'll never understand how can you all think that the indian man is in the wrong, when he did nothing wrong in the first place.</p>
              <p>pity the animals, whatever, but don't demonize a man when you did not understand his plight.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and i did provide a solution. i agreed with the indian man. if you can't live with the cats, either move out or get the cats out. and obvious solution is get the cats out, which he did. now go hit the salad bar or something, because your narrow-minded hypocritical views disgust me.</p>

              <p>the hypocrite would be the person who preaches love to all creatures (thus we should care for the cats as we would a human), but somehow forgets to include indian men who dislike cats, and in turn, demonizing him into a heartless creature not even worth spitting on much less protecting his dignity and rights. ( i definitely won't be the hypocrite here)</p>
              <p>oh, you shouldn't always believe what scientists say. they're always singing a different tune every few years (pluto is now no longer considered a planet, and they discovered a few creatures which they said were extinct). and logically, if everyone continues to dump waste into oceans, chop down forests, and burn rubber tyres, i VERY MUCH doubt that eating salad is going to save the planet.</p>

              <p>well, if you're so eager to prove to the world you're the better man, why even bother to argue back? you could prove to be the better man by giving in to me. but you aren't, that's why you're still arguing with me, and by critisizing me for arguing and yet doing so yourself, you're a hypocrite. and even more so, when you stop replying to my posts after i post this, because what i have just said about giving in never once occured to you until now.</p>
              <p>you've just proven yourself to be a superifical hypocrite, little man.</p>

              <p>Hi, i signed up to sg forums specifically for this thread. you should know then, that i love animals, more so beyond that, i have been volunteering at the SPCA for 3 years, been a member since i was 10, and do attachments at vet clinics in my holidays. in short, i think i have a right to put across what i know on this issue.</p>
              <p>1. yang is an animal lover, a rather responsible one at that who tries to extend her love to all animals. i know because i have been quietly reading her blog entries for some time. of course when her appeal for help is met by derision such a the likes of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">dumbdumb!</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fatum,</span> it's really discouraging and i think it's natural to flare up when something u're passionate about is being smirked at or put down by others, especially so with "farks" (nice one. really) and rude comments. i don't necessarily agree with some of her anger directed to animal haters, or the indian man, but i understand where it's coming from, which i think is what you cat haters should at least try to do. or is that too tough?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i say that many cat lovers who actually do actively try to bridge the gap between their own love for felines and that of the cat haters, are <strong>responsible, </strong>becasue they send these wild cats to vets for sterilization which means <strong>reduction in stray</strong> population <strong>without having to resort to killing</strong> them. vets do their part by offering discounts to these procudeures. most neighbourhood cats you see with a ear tip sliced off means that they have been sterilized. in short, animal lovers spend time and effort in helping, which is more so than what i can see from detractors in this board. they spend their <strong>own money</strong> to help these animals which is more than what many typical singaporeans are doing.</p>
              <p>to<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> fatum</span></strong>:</p>
              <p>please don't go trusting wikipedia in all your naiveness, then citing them as hard core proof for your "i hate cats kill all cats" stance.</p>
              <p>toxoplasmosis-- can be acquired from eating raw meat (pork, duck, chicken etc), or from eating cats feces. meaning you can get toxo even without stray cats, even though cats are the definitive hosts. anyway toxo causes mostly infections that are NOT symptomatic, unless your immune system is very weak, like HIV(AIDS) patients.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Giardia-- gawd, giardia can be passed in sooo many ways, mostly from drinking/eating infected water/food by human feces. cats are hardly the only animals that can spread giardia, anyway it's not even determined that giardia can pass to humans by cats!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>campylobacter--again, mostly is by transmission from human feces. so why implicate cats? you should make sure u're not so ignorant before making such sweeping statements.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>you said cats feces are an "eyesore", and says it's irritating to listen to their "call spring" (haha). but can i ask you, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">why have you become someone who is willing to readily agree to the expedient way out to these solutions, at the cost of many lives?</span>  how can you let yourself agree easily to killing of cats just so you can live in a less noisey place and a supposedly cleaner place? there are lives at stake here, though people like you certainly don't think lives of cats are significant. and that is really disheartening to people like me to spend her free time trying to help animals.</p>
              <p>and thank you for your worry about people with cat allergy. so thoughtful. but there are equally as many people <span style="text-decoration: underline;">allergic to dogs and other animals</span>. and to food. and to pollen in the environment. and even to medicine. do you mean to say that we should eliminate all these too? is that even practical?  <strong>why direct your blame at cats then!? </strong>don't take it out on them just because they have no voice. (besides the cat wailing as you so hate to hear)</p>

              <p>i tell you how. how is by education. education for ignorant people like you, who <strong>care more about their own existance in this world than for the co-existance</strong> with other species. education to let people who like to displace blame onto animals, to let them know that the issue is not so clear cut and that it's not fair or accurate to so easily blame animals.</p>

              <p>clarification: i don't hate cats or animals. i am just pro-human. between a choice which benefits human or animals, i will choose to protect my own species first.</p>
              <p>i'm just here to say that the indian man must have a strong reason why he wanted the cats out of his neighbourhood so badly, so until you know why he hates cats that much, don't demonize him.</p>

              <p>sorry about the no post thing, haha i think i just broke that promise. but really, my intention was not to demonise him. in fact i hardly mentioned him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>what makes my heart ache is to read comment after comment of justifying your stand, some valid, mostly misconstrued. really, it's totally normal to be pro humans, but surely you can take animals into account too, and find a middle ground?</p>
              <p>*though it's wrong to be pro human when it comes to comparing scratches on a car (that was the main reason the indian gentleman cited so eloquently in the video) with the culling of the cats who might or might not have done it. thanks.</p>

              <p>you may not have demonized him, but there are others here who did. especially the lady in the video</p>
              <p>and until you buy a car with your own money and have get have your tyres punctured by some rats sharpening their teeth, then come tell me how pro-animal you are. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>because until you do know how it feels, i'm very much inclined to feel that you guys are just full of it. not that i disagree with your efforts to relocate the cats, i think it's cool so long as the indian man is happy with the arrangements.</p>
              <p>so as long as the cats are relocated, whether by kind hearted hippies, or by other authorities, i think the indian man would be rather satisfied, knowing that his $40,000 car will be safe from strays.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and i didn't get your post about me not putting myself in the indian man's shoes. why do you think i'm so annoyed with you hippies in the first place? it's because i took the time to understand that the indian man was mad because his $40,000 car was damaged needlessly, while you guys have too much cat fur in your lungs, which probably obstructed airflow into your brains, to be unable to think for a second that no human would bother flying into such a rage over a few stray cats unless something really drastic happened.</p>
