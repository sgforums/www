              <p>Firstly, i never try to be offensive. Perhaps you should stop being so sensitive. I can understand if a cat scratches my car/bike (it happened before), but its just animal and they dun have advanced thinking like us and i figured out how to solve this problem of cat sleeping on my car with all furs.</p>
              <p>What i dont understand is why do u and that man need to get upset for these and its like blaming the cats? Bah nvm. Your bike is more precious by the way. Anyway, your dislike to cat never been too extreme like that man. That should be enough. Anything just PM.</p>

              <p>yea, that is the point of your view. Well, we all dont know how bad is the scratches on his car. Perhaps too many scratches until he go to that extend. IMO, still not the extend to ask authorities to kill the 10 cats.</p>

              <p>ok, here i'm seeing 2 types of solutions. one is preventive the other is damage control.</p>
              <p>you're thinking about damage control, where you spend money fixing up after effects, without dealing with the original problems. it's like.. you've got a hole in your roof, but instead of patching the roof, you put buckets underneath the hole to collect the water when it rains.</p>
              <p>i think its definitely cheaper and more effective to deal with the source of the problems.</p>

              <p><br>I know, but they still a cat.. i got pissed off too like u, but the anger disappear very fast knowing they just a cat. So i had no choice to put some same colour tape as my bike's seat. Well round cut tape lol. ok la if i really sounded offensive then sory, just wan u to know i never even think to be offensive.</p>
              <p>So to prevent this, perhaps u can get something to cover your seat like some piece of cloth to prevent this from happening.</p>
