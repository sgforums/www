              <p>oh please, HUMANS brings their house dogs downstairs, POOP and walk away. i've seen so many lo. HUMANS pee and shit behind carparks and blocks and we've seen those too.</p>
              <p>u cant deny the fact that stray cats will and always will continue to co-exist in singapore. its already a culture. gosh. if u talk about alergies and diseases, even house cats/dogs will cause that. people die even without these animals' existence. don't bother arguing back seriously.</p>
              <p>one more thing. we sterilised all the cats, they dun spring call anymore. have a heart man. their lives are not any cheaper than urs.</p>

              <p>it is still an eye sore ... do you go around cleaning up their poop too after their meals get turned to cat turd ? ... like private cats and dogs owners ? ... or do you leave that to the bangla brigade ? ....</p>

              <p>before Yang0923 and Fatum continue to flame each other, i think i should make a fair statment here:</p>
              <p>If there are too many cats around, it is the right of pple to complain and get the AVA guys to take action.</p>
              <p>If the cats arent making too much trouble or they did not "offend" you, then it is good for us not to disturb them by NOT calling the AVA guys.</p>

              <p>i guarantee u that all those 10 cats have been sterilised. all 10 that he filmed down. plus the rest as well. its just simple gesture and a small part for us to pay to get them sterilised. is it so hard for them just to leave them alone.</p>

              <p>cats may be "lowly" compared to us humans. but sometimes its wad we humans do tt make us even more "lowly" than a harmless four legged animal.</p>
              <p>neighbourhoods who quarrel at nite, renovate, kids cry jump here there. they are noisy too. nuisance too. wad can u do? move to somewhere nobody stays near u? so maybe when u die, nobody knows till 2years later?</p>

              <p>i wan to point one thing out:</p>
              <p>if the guy call pest control, den what can we do?</p>
              <p>technically, the guy is not in the wrong when he called the pest control.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What can we do? i suggest u all form a grp to talk to the guy.</p>
              <p>seek AVA or SPCA help.</p>
              <p>Write to the newspaper.</p>
              <p>you must understand that quite a number of pple here are really irritated by cats that they wan to throw the cats out of the neighbourhood. It is not that they do not hav a heart or they are so called "lowly" but cats are not human afterall and they do not know how to think. Yes, a cat is a life, but too many of them will seriously spoil the whole living environment.</p>
              <p>i do like cats too (my neighbourhood hav some very cute cats), but i agree tooo many of dem will really make u irritated.</p>

              <p>excuse me but i have emphasised we have cleaned up after their food. and even if we dont feed them they will still find food themselves and shit.. we cant decide when they shit or not. but its more of those ppl that have brains and owns dogs who CHOOSE not to pick up dog poop who are the selfish ones realli.</p>
              <p>and i've adopted one already and in the midst of spreading the word to get others adopted. that i dun need u to worry bout. definition of selfish is not being able to tolerate others and expecting everything to be done for u.</p>
