              <p><br>Awww.. poor things....have to suffer non-life threatening allergies and dirty shit.. and all the things that MAY happen... and gosh.. let their peace and hygiene be COMPROMISED by the narrow interests of a small group of people and animals.... life sucks, doesn't it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>looks like you are really trying very hard to justify killing the cats and giving all the reasons for it. I am sorry I really can't be convinced by your reasons - which you keep repeating anyway - your basic premise being that YOUR personal life as a human being is more important than a bunch of living things (who are incidentally not human beings unfortunately). (of course you also entreat us to consider other people who think like you, which is very neighbourly.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Although think these reasons are shallow and self-centred but I realise it is unfair to impose my beliefs on yours.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Afterall, you are better than those who abuse them, then kill them. All you do is get someone else to kill them.. humanely even! it is not your fault that you don't want to spend the time or money in other methods of control - for example, cat repellent pellets that prevent them from entering your compound. (but who wants to spend money for these, when you can kill them for free!)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you need to resort to this to gain peace of mind and to even lead a normal life - then I guess I would be really inconsiderate to try and convince you to stop killing cats.</p>

              <p>There are many solutions to the problems.</p>
              <p>It isn't just culling. It also called sterilisation.</p>
              <p>Other alternative: Providing a shelter for them.</p>
              <p>By culling or removing them totally from the public space implies some form of intolerance.</p>

              <p>I can see a very simple solution to it.</p>
              <p>If you like cats, adopt it, help it, whatever. If you don't, don't even post or even bother, why piss yourselves off? Don't you have other things to worry about? Will stray cats affect your job? Your marriage? Or whatever else that needs worrying off?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Someone is being nice and is trying to help those poor cats. They're animals, and they have lives too. Just like us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>People worry about litter, food, poo and crap. If you own a cat, or know about it, you should know cats aren't like dogs, which just leaves a big mess behind.</p>
              <p>For people who are feeding them in public. Do your job, clean up after yourselves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Everyone plays their part. Everyone is happy. Why flame in the first place?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Or is that always the case in SgF? Someone wants to help or seeks help, they get shit.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I can see a very simple solution to it.</p>
              <p>If you like cats, adopt it, help it, whatever. If you don't,
                  don't even post or even bother, why piss yourselves off? Don't you
                  have other things to worry about? Will stray cats affect your job?
                  Your marriage? Or whatever else that needs worrying off?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Someone is being nice and is trying to help those poor cats.
                  They're animals, and they have lives too. Just like us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>People worry about litter, food, poo and crap. If you own a cat,
                  or know about it, you should know cats aren't like dogs, which just
                  leaves a big mess behind.</p>
              <p>For people who are feeding them in public. Do your job, clean up
                  after yourselves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Everyone plays their part. Everyone is happy. Why flame in the
                  first place?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Or is that always the case in SgF? Someone wants to help, they
                  get shit.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Quite true.. TS is only asking for help to adopt those pityful cats. I see no point flaming at this thread. If you think the cats are pissing or shitting at your front gate do something about it to prevent the cat from shitting at your front gate again.</p>
              <p>Prevention is not about culling...</p>
