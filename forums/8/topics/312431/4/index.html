              <p>It is weird that how an animal lover's plead for help, can spark
              such harsh replies. It just differentiates animal lovers from the
              animal haters. *tsk tsk*</p>
              <p>The way I see it, Yang0923 is just asking for some help from
              fellow animal lovers to prevent killings or exterminating of lives
              (yes, living beings). you dont need to be a 'steve irwin' or any
              celebrities to show passion and care for animals. By posting here,
              Yang0923 is doing SOMETHING about an issue. thats action. Mind you,
              this is the internet, a medium, where it is broadcasted through the
              world. Yang is spreading awareness, of animal haters with drastic
              measures, to the community of sgforums. Thats what Yang has
              done.</p>
              <p>Lets put down those humans who vandalise or litter the vicinity
              or those, who modify their vehicles, flooring their accelarator in
              the middle of the night, as well since it can mean an end to all
              problems. we can have those who protest such ideas to adopt those
              humans and take them home. Woot! Do spare a thought for the
              residents staying around the vicinity be it lower or higher
              levels.</p>
              <p>The way things are now, be it authorities or animal lovers, we
              help to control the situation by forking out money to sterilise the
              stray cats and help control the situation. Killing and
              exterminating are not the solution to any issues.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>p.s. I can foresee this thread going on and on. The topic should
              change to "Animal Lovers VS Animal haters"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To Yang0923: Dont worry, as long as the cat is sterilised, the
              council or the authorities wont do anything to the cats. All you
              have to worry is whether animal haters will inflict any unnatural
              means of destruction to the cats. at least you know whom to look
              for if any damage is done.</p>

              <p>My estate here which is I am staying in the HDB, quite a few aunties will feed the cat during the night. From what I observe those aunties will feed them fish &amp; rice and mind you these aunties will put the cat food onto the disposable plate &amp; feed the cats. When the cat has eaten everything THAN the aunties will clean up the area where they fed those cats. IMO it is clean, no unwanted pest lying around if the leftover food is not finished.</p>
              <p>The town council at my area have educate these aunties the proper &amp; clean way of feeding them. What I think is we need to educate those cats lover to feed them the proper &amp; clean way which will not be disturbing to those whom dislike cats.</p>
              <p>No point farking here &amp; there..</p>
              <p>I have read about cats behaviour, so I understand their behaviour. Cats seldom poo on the pavment , they do it in grass. What I believe is those poos on the pavment are from dogs owner cos those owners are irresponsible to clean up what their pets have left.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Recent studies published in the Journal of the American Veterinary
              Medical Association indicate that trap-neuter-release programs are not

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">As well, there is increasing concern about the role feral cat colonies play as a vector of disease, particularly <a title="Toxoplasmosis" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasmosis">toxoplasmosis</a>, <a title="Giardiasis" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giardiasis">giardiasis</a>, <a class="new" title="Camplylobacter (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Camplylobacter&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">camplylobacter</a>, and other diseases and parasites that can infect both domestic cats and humans.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_cat#cite_note-8">[9]</a></sup> </span></p>

              <p>Well, different people different styles of feeding those cats. Other estate I saw cat lovers will put dried cat biscuits on to the floor &amp;  leave it there for the whole night &amp; who will clean up those biscuits if there is no cats eating it. For me I have done what I can which is telling those uncles/aunties to put on a plate if they don't want their cats to gone missing the next day.</p>
              <p>They asked me why would the cat gone missing?</p>
              <p>I replied if those unwanted leftover is there for the whole day, there will be pest and if there is pest, resident will surely complaint to town council and you can't get to see those lovely cats anymore.</p>
              <p>Maybe one fine day you could do it like me. My estate here have lots of cats, nobody complain about poos or pest anymore for the past 2 years till now.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/cry.png" alt="cry.png"></p>

              <p>It is weird that how an animal lover's plead for help, can spark
              such harsh replies. It just differentiates animal lovers from the
              animal haters. *tsk tsk*</p>
              <p>The way I see it, Yang0923 is just asking for some help from
              fellow animal lovers to prevent killings or exterminating of lives
              (yes, living beings). you dont need to be a 'steve irwin' or any
              celebrities to show passion and care for animals. By posting here,
              Yang0923 is doing SOMETHING about an issue. thats action. Mind you,
              this is the internet, a medium, where it is broadcasted through the
              world. Yang is spreading awareness, of animal haters with drastic
              measures, to the community of sgforums. Thats what Yang has
              done.</p>
              <p>Lets put down those humans who vandalise or litter the vicinity
              or those, who modify their vehicles, flooring their accelarator in
              the middle of the night, as well since it can mean an end to all
              problems. we can have those who protest such ideas to adopt those
              humans and take them home. Woot! Do spare a thought for the
              residents staying around the vicinity be it lower or higher
              levels.</p>
              <p>The way things are now, be it authorities or animal lovers, we
              help to control the situation by forking out money to sterilise the
              stray cats and help control the situation. Killing and
              exterminating are not the solution to any issues.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>p.s. I can foresee this thread going on and on. The topic should
              change to "Animal Lovers VS Animal haters"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To Yang0923: Dont worry, as long as the cat is sterilised, the
              council or the authorities wont do anything to the cats. All you
              have to worry is whether animal haters will inflict any unnatural
              means of destruction to the cats. at least you know whom to look
              for if any damage is done.</p>

              <p>my point is that, for such a zealot, he certainly don't inconvenience himself in his cause. it's easy for him to just diss some indian online in his comfortable air-conditioned room. if he wants us to take this seriously, he had better be doing more than just yak online.</p>
              <p>hell, i can do that too. just park my arse down, and paste some pictures and type some fiery words of passion, and try to arm-twist everyone to agree my point of view. anyone who disagree with me are classified "demonic beasts from the lowest pit of Dante's nine hells", and all who agree with me are righteous, benevolent beings who fart sunshine and rainbows.</p>
              <p>easy isn't it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and i still disagree with you idiots who can't see why some residents would consider the cats as pests. and before you stone me for being an animal hater, i'll just say it first. i don't hate animals, i pretty much like them, they make earth really pretty, and i grew up watching earthvision, and i'm against rhino and elephant hunting for their tusks, so i don't buy stuff made of animal skins and decorations from tusks.</p>
              <p>but i also know that cats can be annoying when they're fighting at night, or when they damage properties, or when they're making noises, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">every resident have the right to have their properties protected from shit, urine, and claw marks.</span></p>
              <p>and i notice the people with "lesser compassion" are people who have experienced such annoyance first hands. while those "cat lovers" never did. (i'm not including people who rear cats and dogs at home. if you rear them, you should have expected to have your sofa chewed out, and your tables and chairs treated as claw sharpeners, if you don't, you're an idiot.)</p>
              <p>so again, i suggest that you animal lovers open up your eyes and put yourselves in another person's shoes before your start calling them monsters.</p>
              <p>and don't tell me to put myself in the cat's shoes. because animals don't have the capability to be courteous to others. they run on instincts, and have no sense of self-restrain. i'm telling HUMANS to put themselves in another HUMAN's shoes.</p>

              <p>treating animals well don't mean condoning their acts of destruction. whether it be destruction of peace, or destruction of property.</p>
              <p>treating animals well don't mean you feed your pets rubbish because
              they love to eat it, and allowing them to misbehave. you discipline
              your pets when needed.</p>
              <p>treating animals well mean when you have decided to rear a pet, you do your part to give your pet a good home, and to give it proper training and food etc.</p>
              <p>treating animals well mean you don't kick animals or abuse them for no
              reason (hardly any reason justifies such violence), even more so to
              abuse animals for pleasure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in other countries, people who live too near forests will find their homes invaded by monkeys. so in order to live up to your standards of "treating animals right", i have to endure them raiding my kitchen for food, shitting all over the place, tearing up the curtains and tearing down the house?</p>
              <p>why not i raise the standard, by giving the monkeys a pat on the back and a foot massage to go along with it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the right way is to allocate an area where animals can roam freely, yet not interfere with human activities, which may be dangerous for both parties.</p>
              <p>since the cats are in the neighbourhood, and they're causing problems, they should be taken out of the neighbourhood and i'm giving the authorities the freedom to do whatever they deem is right for the cats.</p>

              <p>i just saw the vid. and i really think it's too much of yang. what's she trying to prove? that the indian is inhuman? childish å°�åŠ¨ä½œ</p>
              <p>and it's damn irritating the way she mocked his accent. she deserved to be flamed.</p>
              <p>yang, you want to do something about the cats, do it, post vids about how pitiful the cats are etc. instead of focusing on an indian with a strong accent. your focus is all wrong, and i think you're an idiot.</p>
              <p>you didn't come here to pick a fight huh? you certainly picked a good one with the indian. hypocritial bullshitter, you don't see steve irwin doing that on national geographics do you? you're just a superficial animal lover. you insult someone whose car has been scratched by the strays by insulting his faith and mocking his accent and nationality. you're no gracious saint yourself! what you are, is just a superficial hypocritical bitch.</p>
              <p>he didn't ask for his car to be scratched, that's probably why he never reared any pets. maybe when your property have been defaced by the cats, your opinions on cats might change. then you'll even be a bigger hypocrite.</p>
              <p>bitch... if you want to preach that we should love all creatures regardless if they're humans or cats, you better walk the talk and love indians too. they're also living creatures with emotions blah blah blah. unless you're indirectly saying that indians don't belong to that category of "living beings"</p>
              <p>FYI, God hates shallow double-standard hypocrites more than people pissed off because cats scratch their cars.</p>

              <p>I used to love cats a lot,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i mean i still do,</p>
              <p>but recently they scratched the seat of my bike leaving a hole that collects water whenever it rains</p>
              <p>and after the rain when i ride my bike</p>
              <p>the hole will ooze out water and wet my pants at one particular spot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so now,</p>
              <p>tell me who`s gonna pay for the repair on my seat?</p>
              <p>and sometimes they leave a lot of fur behind after they nap on my bike</p>
              <p>it`s really dirty lohz, so who`s gonna clean my bike?</p>
