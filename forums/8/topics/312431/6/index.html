              <p>yea, that is the point of your view. Well, we all dont know how

              he go to that extend. IMO, still not the extend to ask authorities
              to kill the 10 cats.</p>

              <p>well, if it's something minor and a one off thing, i don't think he'd blow such a fuse. from what i watch on youtube. he really sounded pissed. and that bitch Yang made things worse. in any case, if the indian man initiated the movement to kill the cats, that stupid Yang certainly sealed their fates.</p>
              <p>it's like if a judge sentence someone i know to death, and instead of pleading the case, i add oil to fire by telling the judge that he'll goto hell. do you think it'll work? tada.</p>
              <p>in the end, Yang is a stupid idiot.</p>

              <p>yea but will one-man show work? Will authorities bother to answer his one-man show call? If im the authority, i would have investigate what kind of damages that the cats bring and also the car of that man, and i would speak to neighbourhood ppl if the cats caused them any problem. At the end, i stil think the man cant make things changed cuz like TS said, mostly wanted the cats to stay.</p>
              <p>But i also see one disadvantages of feeding cats... Now maybe only 10 cats, later on there will be more and more to depend on food from ppl.In future im sure it will bring much problems</p>

              <p>and no, i don't sterotype you. i just dislike your double standardness. i respect people like steve irwin, and every other humanitarians and animal lovers who go to the beach to try to save beached whales, or try to relocate animals to a safer sanctuary from humans living near them, or encourage others to eat dolphin-safe tuna, or even as simple as educating others in the beauty of nature etc.</p>
              <p>i don't respect people who don't see the bigger picture and think that they're right while everyone else is wrong. and especially if they never walked a mile in the victim's shoes, yet think the victim's are wrong for feeling the way that they're feeling.</p>

              <p>if u're living in africa and a river croc wanders into your house, i'm pretty sure you call the local authorities to take it out.</p>
              <p>besides it's more appropriate for the authorities who best know how to handle the situation, to take the cats out rather than us. because personally, i don't know how to handle cats, i may injure them, or they may injure me. the authorities have special equiptments and containments to hold the cats. it's more effective, and safer for either party.</p>

              <p>so what do you think of the content of the video ? .... you were
              responsible for taking the video, and posting it up, you even
              posted the man's picture up before being told to take it down ....
              do you find the actions fo the woman in the video reprehensible ?
              .... if you do, why did you post it up ? ....</p>
              <p>I still think you owe the man an apology ... together with that

              <p>if u're living in africa and a river croc wanders into your house, i'm pretty sure you call the local authorities to take it out.</p>
              <p>besides it's more appropriate for the authorities who best know how to handle the situation, to take the cats out rather than us. because personally, i don't know how to handle cats, i may injure them, or they may injure me. the authorities have special equiptments and containments to hold the cats. it's more effective, and safer for either party.</p>

              <p>yea, i agree some cats are dangerous, take a look at some cats face.. they look like devil (especially male) But i think the 10 cats are tame enough cuz get used of human presence.</p>
              <p>Still, majority always win in this case. I think for now the cats will still stay. Unless authorities take a bigger step and quickly catch the cats into adoption centre. Those neighbours who love cat can always adopt them later on.</p>
              <p>As for TS, at least she/he kept one of them as a pet.. other neighbour im not so sure if they are more into action than just words.</p>
              <p>TS just kept us posted with latest news. I would like to hear how authorities handle this too.</p>

              <p>Putting a collar on some of these cats ? Maybe it  willprobably save their life? I don't know. This is one of the crappy idea i can think of. I don't think AVA will murder the cats, as firstly, the animals are already sterilised and have they done any damage to government properties? Is there more than one complaint case in the area ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If AVA carrys out actions against the cat, if you want, bring th matter up to the top and speak to the MP of ur GRC about  "animals rights". It could be better that you can rally a group support via petition or not to voice out the matter. Though i think, it quite waste of time to bring this matter up to an MP, but then i'm not much of a cat-lover.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The issue could probably be solved when animals and man co-exist peacefully. I could have approached the man who complain and solve the problem discreetly if possible.</p>

              <p>i'll ask my friend who's nuts about cats see if she's willing to take one more in.</p>
              <p> and yes, its the hols now, that's why i'm quite free to pick on hippies like you. and truthfully i WAS very disgusted at the video, especially the woman (which i thought was you).</p>
              <p>PS: that woman who dissed the indian's still a bitch. and you should at least rename the video. cat killer? he's asking the authorities to remove the cats, not kill them. i'm pretty sure he didn't call them up and say "i need you to kill the cats in the neighbourhood"</p>
