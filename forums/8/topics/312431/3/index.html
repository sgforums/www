              <p>yeah actually, i've gone hungry for one full day before. actually there're people i know who've gone hungry for 40 days to be exact. and about the cat poo. there're people cleaning them up, regardless its dog, or cat or human. that's why i said. it's better to get their opinion on that matter. after all, it's them who cleans up the mess, not us. and definitely not you. the way i see it. you're the one talking cock here. your passion don't exceed your comfort zone. you're no steve irwin. all you do to show your love for animals, is just talk, or maybe a little action which won't cost you much.</p>
              <p>you want to save the planet? by all means, go ahead, hold a campaign, spread awareness, spread the love. don't sit behind the computer screen and yak. NATO.</p>
              <p> people who're against abortions, stand outside abortion clinics with banners and pamphlets and urging mothers not to abort their children.</p>
              <p>people who're against deforestation march down to forests, tie themselves to trees and bear the shame of being ridiculed as tree humpers.</p>
              <p>people who're against hunters who hunt endangered species, dedicated their lives to protect these animals, even giving their lives for the cause.</p>
              <p>people who do mission work, go to the middle east, and in the end, die for their faith, or live in dumps with the people they reach out to, just to spread the love and joy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>what have you done?</p>
              <p>(btw, since you show such zealous passion for the strays, so i assume you've starved for a day yourself to understand the plight of the cats? somehow i don't think so. bullshitter <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and nobody chooses to be whatever they are now. i didn't choose to be chinese, if i was given a choice, i'd have chosen to be an european etc. but none of us have a choice. but it has no relevance to this cat issue. whoever who complained about the cats have the same rights as everyone else to live peacefully. but unfortunately, you can't negotiate with cats, unlike a noisy neighbour.</p>
              <p>so the only solution is either you move, or you get rid of the cats, and it's a no brainer here.</p>

              <p>oh theres no need to apologise anyone here especially me. TS just stating his opinions and wanted to help the cats from getting killed.</p>
              <p>if talking bout poo, i really never see a cat poo on the pavement or on the road.. the cats will either poo on the soil rather than on cement floor. Not cats from my neighbourhoor.</p>
              <p>And will anyone clean the cats poo ? I dont even think the cleaners will even clean the poo...but still the cats dont poo anywhere like doggies, if this poo gives problems, the neighbourhood would have complain and dont forget the indian man also would add this into another reason of killing cats. But there are no cases of poo.. We should just stop talking non-existence problem of poo.</p>
              <p>anyone who think the cat should stay or be killed, just give a call. Best if anyone offer to adopt. and it would be better if they catch them and put them into adoption centre. There are many stray cats and dogs, killing them are simply too much.</p>
              <p>I just couldnt forgive that indian for making a dumb decision to call authorities just to kill the cats.. he never even think of other alternatives... is that what an educated person will do? Gosh</p>
              <p>And yea, i never even thought TS is debating with anyone and losing the debating and asking ppl to leave..This isnt a debating competition at all ! Why think of TS losing the debate and asking ppl to leave? hm, i dont understand.</p>

              TS, by posting here, every1 is already entitled to pass comments. I agree that you owe the man in the video an apology. 
              
              All residents are entitled to call the town council if there is a cat problem in the area. From the number of cats in the picture, the area does indeed seem to have a pest problem.
              
              Just because you like cats doesn't mean that every1 living in the vicinity have to tolerate the problems that the strays create. Not everyone like cats and they do create all sorts of problems. They scratch cars, make all sorts of noises in the middle of the night that keeps people up. Do spare a thought for residents staying on the lower levels.

              <p>It is weird that how an animal lover's plead for help, can spark
              such harsh replies. It just differentiates animal lovers from the
              animal haters. *tsk tsk*</p>
              <p>The way I see it, Yang0923 is just
              asking for some help from fellow animal lovers to prevent killings or
              exterminating of lives (yes, living beings). you dont need to be a 'steve irwin' or any
              celebrities to show passion and care for animals. By posting here,
              Yang0923 is doing SOMETHING about an issue. thats action. Mind you,
              this is the internet, a medium, where it is broadcasted through the
              world. Yang is spreading awareness, of animal haters with drastic
              measures, to the community of sgforums. Thats what Yang has done.</p>
              <p>Lets put down those humans who vandalise or litter the vicinity or those, who modify their vehicles, flooring their accelarator in the middle of the night, as well since it can mean an end to all problems. we can have those who protest such ideas to adopt those humans and take them home. Woot! Do spare a thought for the residents staying around the vicinity be it lower or higher levels.</p>
              <p>The way things are now, be it authorities or animal lovers, we help to control the situation by forking out money to sterilise the stray cats and help control the situation. Killing and exterminating are not the solution to any issues.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>p.s. I can foresee this thread going on and on. The topic should change to "Animal Lovers VS Animal haters"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To Yang0923: Dont worry, as long as the cat is sterilised, the council or the authorities wont do anything to the cats. All you have to worry is whether animal haters will inflict any unnatural means of destruction to the cats. at least you know whom to look for if any damage is done.</p>

I like cats, but I dont like many of them. The pictures you took shows many cats.
