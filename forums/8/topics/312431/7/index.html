              <p>disease is a part of life - if there is substantial evidence that they are really causing harm - fine. It isn't a good thing to do, but its for survival.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> If anything, we should work on medicine to prevent the disease or cure it.And culling should be kept to a minimum.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Killing living things cos they poo on your doorstep - is not doing something for your survival.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But don't worry - you won't be lonely. Lots of people are like this. People kill off animals because they are 'inconveniently' living on our farmlands, and places that we settle. And when we destroy the places they used to live in, and they don't have places to live anymore, they start living on OUR land - even more reason to kill them off!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In fact when you are 50, you should be very happy that there might be much less animals to contend with! Human supremacy! Aren't you happy?</p>

Its residents include such exotic animals as pair of lorises, a cassowary, a python, a civet cat and a ferret.</p>
              <p>The shelter was founded six years ago when Raymund Wee, a dog groomer, discovered that a plot of land designated by the Singapore government as a training and breeding ground for dogs, was available for sub-lease. Wee sold his shophouse and opened Noah's Ark Lodge. Since then, he has then put in $1.5 million to develop a 'mudhole' into a lushly foliaged sanctuary for cats, dogs and other animals.</p>
              <p>Noah's Ark Lodge is presently the only privately-funded shelter in Singapore for animals that would otherwise be homeless or destroyed. Raymund continues to operate his grooming business for needed funds, and is aided by supporters and volunteers, in caring for the animals.</p>
