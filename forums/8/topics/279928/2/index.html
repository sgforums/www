He was talking about the levels of insights, and certainly as Thusness agreed Eckhart Tolle has not yet achieved full realisation.<br><br>Secondly dharma dan doesn't like Neo-Advaita kind of teachers who don't emphasize on constant harcore practise, but more like 'give up the search, you don't need to do anything' or 'you are already perfect' etc. Though, Eckhart Tolle is not really a Neo-Advaitin kind of guy and does advise constant practise and even formal sitting with various vipassanic-like meditative subjects (which Eckhart calls 'portals').<br><br>Anyway, in terms of insights as Thusness said before, Eckhart Tolle would be at Stage 4. Not complete yet. But even he would appreciate the value of Eckhart Tolle's work, very inspirational and transforming. Good pointers. Though the lack of insight into the deeper subtleties of our nature is apparent, it is still a great book and some parts of what he wrote is very clear.<br><br>I do refer time to time to TPON.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by january:<br><br>for the 1st and 2nd paragraph, it is similar to all those self help and self development books which tries to teach people about happiness and success, so the description of "highest and transcendental nirvanic bliss" is quite a superlative and flowery langaue. Well, for those who says that they have really experience this nirvanic state, i congrate them but so far the general masses of world and public have not really experience such orgasmic bliss yet.</blockquote>'Highest transcendental nirvanic bliss' is not a flowery or poetic statement, but is exactly what you experience when you attain such realisations. Though, it is beyond all our imaginations of what that bliss is. Bliss has many categories... I have experiences of jhanic meditative bliss which is even more blissful than sex, but even that is incomparable to the highest bliss of nirvana.<br><br>Regarding bliss, Thusness spoke from experience:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Like samatha meditation, each jhana state represents a stage of bliss associated with certain level of concentration; the bliss experienced from insight into our nature differs.<br><br>The happiness and pleasure experience by a dualistic mind is different from that experienced by a practitioner. Â“I AMnessÂ” is a higher form of happiness as compared to a dualistic mind that continuously chatters. It is a level of bliss associated with a state of Â‘transcendenceÂ’ Â– a state of bliss resulting from the experience of Â“formlessness, odorless, colorless, attributeless and thoughtlessnessÂ’.<br><br>No-self or non-dual is higher form of bliss resulted from the direct experience of Oneness and no-separation. It is related to the dropping of the Â‘IÂ’. When non-dual is free from perceptions, that bliss is a form transcendence-oneness.</span><br><br><blockquote>the integral stuff and how different things correlate with each other in the entire universe is not some new age and new things. All people know that everything is connected. Politics is connected to entertainment is connected to financial world is connected to how virus change.</blockquote>Yea not new age..</div>

At least that is how I understand it.<br><br>JonLS stated similar things on his topic on 'Enlightenment' --<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by JonLS:</div><div class="quote_body">This is a misinterpretation of what I am saying.  I am not saying that everyone can and does experience clarity right now.  What I am saying is that since I see clearly now, I realize that this clarity has always been there.  And what is true for me is true for all others because there really are no others and also because all others are like me and all others are me.<br><br>But more importantly what I really said is that "you don't need time to be what you already are".  That is not the same thing as the article you quoted.  This saying in fact acts like a koan on the mind, stopping it dead in its' tracks.  But you have to really want the truth if it is to act that way for you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div></blockquote></div>
