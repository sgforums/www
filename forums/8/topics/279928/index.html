            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by january:<br><br>why are there different level of god.<br>it is not apropriate to use the word god for what higher level of god.</blockquote>In the sense yes, because God is so often misunderstood.<br><br>Usually when we talk about God, the only God people know of is the mythic image of God.<br><br><blockquote>god is generally being known as supreme being or creator but because there is no good evidences for it, therefore we say that god does not exist. period.</blockquote>Yes, but you are talking about the mythic, personal Creator. And I personally do not suscribe to this belief as well.<br><br><blockquote>if you believe in science, hyperspace, anti matter and quatam physics... you call them and discuss by their technical names... and not attach new flowerly language like spiritual thingy and higher level of god stuff.</blockquote>'Higher level' is simply an analogy, that there are different levels of consciousness (such as Ken Wilber's 10 or 9 fulcrums)... this is actually factual and documented psychological states (including some levels which are trans-personal, which some people call transpersonal psychology, though we must understand that from an integral viewpoint psychology is only an aspect), and one would usually progress through the fulcrums as one ages from a baby upwards.<br><br>And that transpersonal insights (insights refer more specifically to realisations of our formless nature of mind/self, or higher, our non-dual nature) can be achieved through various forms of mysticism (which Ken wilber calls psychic, subtle, formless and non-dual mysticism corresponding to the 4 different types of transpersonal experiences)... all these are documented and factual and is happening to many many people including many in this forum. These forms of 'mysticism' or I prefer to say, simply 'spiritual practises', are like the microscope or telescope that allows us to peak into the depths of our consciousness to discover our true nature, through transcendent glimpses. This is actually a very scientific process of finding out truth, actually. (this is elaborated in, as you probably have watched already, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wX_W1BB_0M" rel="nofollow">Ken Wilber - Spirituality and the 3 Strands of Deep Science</a>)<br><br>Anyway, like Eckhart Tolle himself said, the word 'God' is so misunderstood that he will generally avoid using that term.<br><br>Here's what he said:<br><br><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">You used the word Being. Can you explain what you mean by that?</span><br><br>Being is the eternal, ever-present One Life beyond the myriad forms of life that are subject to birth and death. However, Being is not only beyond but also deep within every form as its innermost invisible and indestructible essence. This means that it is accessible to you now as your own deepest self, your true nature. But don't seek to grasp it with your mind. Don't try to understand it. You can know it only when the mind is still. When you are present, when your attention is fully and intensely in the Now, Being can be felt, but it can never be understood mentally. To regain awareness of Being and to abide in that state of "feeling-realization" is enlightenment.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">When you say Being, are you talking about God? If you are, then why don't you say it?</span><br><br>The word God has become empty of meaning through thousands of years of misuse. I use it sometimes, but I do so sparingly. By misuse, I mean that people who have never even glimpsed the realm of the sacred, the infinite vastness behind that word, use it with great conviction, as if they knew what they are talking about. Or they argue against it, as if they knew what it is that they are denying. This misuse gives rise to absurd beliefs, assertions, and egoic delusions, such as "My or our God is the only true God, and your God is false," or Nietzsche's famous statement "God is dead."<br><br>The word God has become a closed concept. The moment the word is uttered, a mental image is created, no longer, perhaps, of an old man with a white beard, but still a mental representation of someone or something outside you, and, yes, almost inevitably a male someone or something.<br>Neither God nor Being nor any other word can define or explain the ineffable reality behind the word, so the only important question is whether the word is a help or a hindrance in enabling you to experience That toward which it points. Does it point beyond itself to that transcendental reality, or does it lend itself too easily to becoming no more than an idea in your head that you believe in, a mental idol?<br><br>The word Being explains nothing, but nor does God. Being, however, has the advantage that it is an open concept. It does not reduce the infinite invisible to a finite entity. It is impossible to form a mental image of it. Nobody can claim exclusive possession of Being. It is your very essence, and it is immediately accessible to you as the feeling of your own presence, the realization I am that is prior to I am this or I am that. So it is only a small step from the word Being to the experience of Being.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong>by eternal now:</strong><br>'Higher level' is simply an analogy, that there are different levels of consciousness (such as Ken Wilber's 10 or 9 fulcrums)... this is actually factual and documented psychological states (including some levels which are trans-personal, which some people call transpersonal psychology, though we must understand that from an integral viewpoint psychology is only an aspect), and one would usually progress through the fulcrums as one ages from a baby upwards.<br><br>And that transpersonal insights (insights refer more specifically to realisations of our formless nature of mind/self, or higher, our non-dual nature) can be achieved through various forms of mysticism (which Ken wilber calls psychic, subtle, formless and non-dual mysticism corresponding to the 4 different types of transpersonal experiences)... all these are documented and factual and is happening to many many people including many in this forum. These forms of 'mysticism' or I prefer to say, simply 'spiritual practises', are like the microscope or telescope that allows us to peak into the depths of our consciousness to discover our true nature, through transcendent glimpses. This is actually a very scientific process of finding out truth, actually. (this is elaborated in, as you probably have watched already, Ken Wilber - Spirituality and the 3 Strands of Deep Science)<br><br>Anyway, like Eckhart Tolle himself said, the word 'God' is so misunderstood that he will generally avoid using that term. </blockquote>u say that ken wilber stuff are academic and scientific based. and there are those transpersonal experiences and deeper depth of consciousness..<br><br>so what is it about these.. has he found the other universe .. or has he found the ability to survive his death...  or are these documented transpersonal psychology still in its higher consciousness level talking?<br><br>current psychology studies and MRI of brain scanning in mainstream science shares with us knowledge like what kind of depression are there and what are the causes of deja vu feeling in people. These psychology things tries to tell us more knowledge and try to explain things....<br><br>ken wilber has its own interest and direction of knowledge... so these higher form of consciousness .. what is the latest news about them that we can relate to.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by january:<br><br>u say that ken wilber stuff are academic and scientific based. and there are those transpersonal experiences and deeper depth of consciousness..</blockquote>I would think so -- but I am not 'endorsing' Ken Wilber's credibilities, nor is it revelant nor necessary. Just telling you what he said is true in that video, and also, transpersonal psychology is a highly documented and factual stuff and is also something that is being studied. This is not invented by Ken Wilber or what.<br><br><blockquote>so what is it about these.. has he found the other universe .. or has he found the ability to survive his death...  or are these documented transpersonal psychology still in its higher consciousness level talking?</blockquote>All these are not the field of transpersonal experiences, though non-local events are related to the non-local nature of reality. But don't confuse these things with transpersonal insights.<br><br><blockquote>current psychology studies and MRI of brain scanning in mainstream science shares with us knowledge like what kind of depression are there and what are the causes of deja vu feeling in people.

Well, for those who says that they have really experience this nirvanic state, i congrate them but so far the general masses of world and public have not really experience such orgasmic bliss yet.<br><br>the integral stuff and how different things correlate with each other in the entire universe is not some new age and new things. All people know that everything is connected. Politics is connected to entertainment is connected to financial world is connected to how virus change.</div>
