She lied to her parents to attend one of my gatherings. I was so angry she put me is such a tough position.<br><br>Then after that she got hooked up with the same indian foreign "talent" (The one who asked me out to get drunk and get lucky - but hurled abuses when I refused) to do samba dancing and all that body contact stuff. She thinks she's very beautiful and thus attracted his attention. she claims he's been very gentlemanly with her and she loved him alot. I told her to be careful because he is married back in India and he was attempting to get a number of girls in bed with him (I found out after I started asking all the girls - They are so stupid to keep quiet and let this guy do so much damage to everyone else).<br><br>This girl didn't want to heed any advice, told me I am nagging her and being an old prune and is getting in the way of her happiness. So I wished her luck. Now... I am sure when his contact ended, he's back with his wife - more or less.  Even if not, he just want play things and he's never serious with anyone. His idea is that as long as he can get any sex free, he will even if it means using force.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dey!! I'm not the one asking for girls numbers lar.  LOL.<br><br>I jump into yellow river also cannot wash green ah.<br><br>Just wanna know what girls think of this kinda guys.  Cos a lot of my friends always keep asking me to go get some cute girl's number on the train or whadever.  A bit irritating... give ppl wrong impression somemore.<br><br>The closest thing to that I've experienced was a piece of paper that was passed to me.  But thats not asking... its ppl giving. Different story.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dun really have good impression on guys who ask number like that. unless can be sure he is a good person, but hard to judge a book by its cover only.<br><br>Ever encounter few years back when I was in the secondary school era. But its always not very nice. I would cut contact with them after a while cause they all appear very desperate for gf no matter how you look like, hard to click well, the way they talk very insensible and self centred. Its like almost impossible to get to know a total stranger unless got a dramatic happening(accidentally took the wrong phone?) haha only in drama I think.<br><br>Friends are all known now either friends' friend, school mates, ex colleages or colleages. I think its really fate, to get to know friend at a certain place.</div>
