But the guys who got the numbers do not understand I only want Normal friends. But these guys want a Fuck Buddy. They obviously are very stupid and think all sg girls are cheap Wh0res. But I am not surpirsed of their impression since lots sg women throw themselves onto any Foreign (colored) "talents" who can splash on alcohol. They started to call for alcohol sessions in an attempt to make me drunk. when I turn down these invites, the abuses came and then the prank calls and etc. Anyways, these low life come from all walks of life, from Police force whose a CID, to computer programmer who booast he's a manager (ha ha - I am not born yesterday), to former Author Anderson employee, to some freaky white African and whole bunch of people (married/troubled and everything in between) trying to look for ONS, Fuck Buddies, and Orgies ... basically, there's a lot of people with bad ulteria motives out there.<br><br>Its pays to play safe.<br></div>
