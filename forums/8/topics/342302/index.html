              <div class="top_headline"><br></div>
              <div class="top_headline">SINGAPORE'S grand old lady is getting her most expensive makeover yet.
              Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall will be refurbished and reconfigured
              to add more space for arts groups.
              <p>The price tag: $180 million, almost a third of what it cost to build the Esplanade.</p>
              <p>This sum is on top of the $115 million set aside for the next
              five years to grow Singapore into a global arts city. The premises will
              close in 2010 and reopen three years later.</p>
              <p>News of the makeover came as a surprise to the arts
              community, who had worried that cuts would be made in government
              funding in the light of the economic downturn.</p>
              <p>But Senior Minister of State for Information, Communications
              and the Arts Lui Tuck Yew assured them otherwise as he gave more
              details yesterday of the masterplan to guide Singapore's arts and
              cultural development.</p>
              <p>'I can assure stakeholders that the Government remains fully
              committed to this sector...We'll work with them to help them weather
              the storm,' he said.</p>
              <p>The refurbishment of the two venues is part of a broader plan
              to develop and promote cultural institutions around Empress Place. One
              recent project announced: the construction of the National Art Gallery,
              reported to cost $320 million, at the former Supreme Court and City
              Hall. It is expected to open in 2013.</p>
              <p>The imposing Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall was gazetted
              as a national monument in 1992. The theatre is 148 years old while the
              concert hall is 103 years old</p>
              <p>In 1995, the concert hall, which was then home to the
              Singapore Symphony Orchestra, had its interior repainted and the
              air-conditioning system improved to the tune of $700,000.</p>
              <p>The next year, $6 million was spent renovating the theatre,
              including installing an orchestra pit and fire curtains for the stage.
              In 2002, $250,000 went to maintenance and repair works for the theatre.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts said
              the latest refurbishment will include improving the acoustics, seating
              and backstage facilities.</p>
              <p>The space will also be reconfigured to accommodate rehearsal needs and commercial pre- and post-performance activities.</p>
              <p>The theatre and concert hall will continue to operate until renovation commences.</p>
              <p>Mr Yan Yin Wing, music director of the Braddell Heights
              Symphony Orchestra, which has been performing at the concert hall since
              1986, welcomed the plans.</p>
              <p>He said: 'The concert hall is getting a little bit old compared to other modern venues such as the Esplanade.'</p>
              <p>His 70-member orchestra has begun looking for a new concert venue but will continue to play there next year.</p>
              <p>Rear-Admiral (NS) Lui also announced plans to review the Arts
              Housing Scheme. It will be extended beyond providing work space for
              professional artists and arts groups to include private arts businesses
              and specialised services such as art conservation.</p>
              <p>In 2010, when the School of the Arts, Singapore moves from
              its temporary premises at Goodman Road to Kirk Terrace in the Bras
              Basah Road area, the vacated premises will be converted into an
              additional 15,000 sq m of arts housing space.</p>
              <p>The National Arts Council will also be launching a scheme
              next year to support Singaporean artists' residencies abroad, as well
              as foreign artists' residencies here.</p>

              <p>to neglect the infrastructure of a country is something which will come back to bite you in the ass when everything blows over...</p>
              <p>there is more to running a country than meeting the immediate needs of the people.. those immediate needs are also looked into... just coz you do not see it happening doesn't mean it isn't happening...</p>
              <p>it could be hell of a lot more efficient and effective, but throwing money at it will not do a world of good...</p>
              <p>and... as aforementioned, there's fiscal policy... the spending puts money into the economy...</p>
              <p>it would be sad if the whole global economy pulls out of the depression and we're not poised to be able to move with it...</p>
