Also in these countries, if you are considered underprivileged, you get money from the govt, for example, if you earn like $200 a month, the govt will give you like $400 a month so you have $600, but, if you work twice as hard and earn $400 a month, the govt will give you $250 a month, so now you do have more money-you have $650 now, but, you have to work twice as hard. So if you earn more they give you less, so pple would rather work half as much and earn $50 less. Actually I feel this is not healthy. It's creating a not so encouraging mindset on people, and, those high earners may have negative impression "so what if I work hard and earn over tens of Ks per month, 48% of my salary will still go back to the govt to help those who doesn't work as hard, and or, those who doesn't as much money as I do on further studies to get good jobs"<br><br>normally people migrate hoping to seek better life and salary or education elsewhere .

First 15000 might be tax free, then every $1 after that you are taxed 20% up till 50000, then maybe every dolalr after that 48%.

Do your homework and find a country that best suits your needs, etc and make the legal, mental and emotional decision to disengage yourself from Sg.

Well, assuming that your example is based on fantasy of course...coz I haven;t heard of a developed country that taxes 48% of your salary...</div></blockquote>In Norway income tax ("inntektsskatt") and wealth tax ("formuesskatt") are direct taxes ("direkte skatter"). <strong>Income tax </strong>is paid directly as a percentage of income, whereas <strong>wealth tax </strong>is a tax on things you own, such as a house, bank deposits etc. <strong>Taxes are paid both to the state and the local municipality</strong>. In addition, <strong>a premium is paid to the social security system</strong> to finance public hospitals, medical treatment and various social benefits.<br><br>The <strong>most important indirect tax ("indirekte skatt") is value added tax</strong>, VAT, which is a general tax levied on sales within the country and on import. VAT is levied on most goods and some services, and applies to all stages in the chain of production and distribution. Any person engaged in trade or business is required to register and to charge and pay VAT on goods he/she supplies. VAT on inputs purchased by the registrants is deductible in the VAT accounts. VAT is thus not a tax on the registrants but a tax on final consumption.<br><br><strong>VAT is presently calculated at a rate of 12 to 24 per cent of net price.</strong><br><br>All self-employed persons are obliged to add this tax to sales of goods and services; it is a punishable offence not paying this tax in Norway. Further information on value added tax is available from the Chief County Tax Inspector ("Fylkesskattesjefen").<br><br><strong>Your employer in Norway is obliged to deduct tax from you wages before you are paid. </strong>Once you have found employment in Norway you must obtain a tax card from you local taxation office as soon as possible. Your employer and the taxation office will provide all necessary information on how to apply and what you must enclose with your application. The tax card states what percentage of your income your employer must deduct in tax. <strong>If you start work without a tax card, your employer is obliged to deduce 50 % tax. </strong>This is generally more than would be deducted from you wages if you had a tax card, but if you have paid too much tax, you will receive a refund in the spring or autumn of the following year when the tax assessments are completed.<br><br>http://www.norway.org.uk/policy/tax/tax.htm</div>
