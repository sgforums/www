            <div class='col-md body'>Right...I am not going to push the issue any more as I think that there is enough material for the merits of each side of the argument to be critically assessed.<br><br>Re the topic, I clearly want to leave Sg - perhaps for the UK or Canada.<br><br>My reasons are quite straight forward really...Some of them:<br><br>- I think the Singaporean citizenship is a burden. Of course, there are worse countries to be citizens of. That is, however, not the point. If there are better options, why should I not pursue them?<br><br>- I think there are better places than Singapore to raise a family.<br><br>- I want a car, a nice home (with room to swing a cat) and have enough left over to live comfortably without having to put in 14 hr days for the rest of my working life.<br><br>- I think having 4 distinct seasons makes life interesting and more invigorating.<br><br>- I do not like what i perceive to be the Singaporean mindset. Just one Eg. It seems to me that Singaporeans in general have a very narrow definition of success IE money and high-powered career. IMO, the successes of people leading full and rich (albeit not financially) lives are insufficiently acknowledged.<br><br>- I like the notion of starting overseas from scratch - without the benefit of familial support etc. Of course, there are advantages to that too - no support = no pressure as well. I am responsible for myself and am accountable to no one. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

There's no disputing that one.<br><br>It's a laudable goal to try and comfort people that things aren't so bad in Singapore, and along those lines I have already agreed with Kinokuniya on the first page of this thread that where one chooses to live is a matter of individual tastes.<br><br>However, does saying that things are worse elsewhere really mean that things are good in Singapore?  Would it not be a more reasonable approach to highlight the advantages of living in Singapore, rather than the disadvantages of living elsewhere?<br><br>On top of that, it should be pretty obvious from my responses to other people on this thread that I have no issue with people disagreeing with me, as long as what they're saying is accurate.  If I find that something is inaccurate, I'll question it, and there's no issue of me wanting to create unhappiness here.  If anything, leading people to the wrong conclusion with inaccurate claims would later be a source of unhappiness for those who accept those claims without verification and act upon it, would it not?<br><br>As far as I'm concerned, this is a purely logical discussion - that's why I've brought up the figures and done the calculations.  I don't see the need to get emotional about a mathematical matter.</div>

There are still countless mindless cases of discrimination.. where locals are penalized for getting pregnant, for getting married, turning 40.. and local job applicants are turned away for the same reasons as well..<br><br>Alot of "improvements" in Singapore are done on the surface, but rising costs still hit the lower to middle class hardest.. sparkly statistics waved here and there but little of it is felt on the ground..<br><br>Tax in foreign countries, I can live with.

What you are trying to do here is support a claim.<br><br>If you don't support a claim with facts, it leaves the door open for saying anything one pleases.  That being the case, I could say that anybody could move to a certain country and buy a mansion with a few Ferraris to fill the garage.  Would you not want me to back up such a claim by at least naming the country?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Phoebie:</div><div class="quote_body">why are you all so eager to know the name of the country?

I read what oxford posted, worked the figures according to the most highly taxed country in his list and showed the workings here, and what he posted does not support what you said.  If there's a country with even higher taxes, oxford's post does not show what country it is.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Phoebie:</div><div class="quote_body">maybe I shouldn't have stated 48% taxes so clearly, I should have just state 40% taxes and above.

This is a serious topic.</div></blockquote>First, your mistake is not stating such a figure.  Your mistake is being vague and evasive about this particular country, and then in complete contradiction being very definite about such a country existing.<br><br>If you're saying that this is not fun and games, well and good.  If we are getting serious about this, we need to check and ensure that all assertions are accurate and substantiated by facts and figures.  In light of that, saying 48% at one moment and then randomly changing it to 40% is just not logical.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Phoebie:</div><div class="quote_body">I know one against five aint easy for me.
