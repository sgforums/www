            <div class='col-md body'>Actually no place can beat Singapore for cleanliness and safety. Even the people on the street won't bother you like in many other countries where unemployemnt, drugs and hopelessness causes them to look for trouble, some challenge to excite them. So if you guys want to leave, do so, but go for a short holiday first in the country you would like to live in, stay for a few weeks and see if you can stand the way of life there and the loneliness. Don't pack up and leave for another country and regret you left a year later. Make sure you have a job there before leaving, found a suitable home there and nice school for your kids. Do a lot of research before you decide. I tell you, you will think twice. The only negative here is, Sg is such a small place and no where to run, hide or even relax without bumping into neighbours, colleagues, friends, relatives and others. So for this type of entertainment, you need to fly overseas say to Canada or USA or Europe and get yourself lost there. This explains why so many people at the end of the year after collecting their 13th, 14th or more months bonus chabut to. RUUUNNNNNNN AWAAAAAAAY! Go and hide from everyone somewhere like in Phuket, but you meet friends there too. Maybe less in Chiang Mai because not so much attractions like in Bkk. Have fun. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>some other countries charge 10% GST, and in these countries, those who earn around 10k and above per month need to pay 48% income tax<br><br>Most of the tax collected (in the other mentioned countries as above) are used to fund the social welfare. Also in these countries, if you are considered underprivileged, you get money from the govt, for example, if you earn like $200 a month, the govt will give you like $400 a month so you have $600, but, if you work twice as hard and earn $400 a month, the govt will give you $250 a month, so now you do have more money-you have $650 now, but, you have to work twice as hard. So if you earn more they give you less, so pple would rather work half as much and earn $50 less. Actually I feel this is not healthy. It's creating a not so encouraging mindset on people, and, those high earners may have negative impression "so what if I work hard and earn over tens of Ks per month, 48% of my salary will still go back to the govt to help those who doesn't work as hard, and or, those who doesn't as much money as I do on further studies to get good jobs"<br><br>normally people migrate hoping to seek better life and salary or education elsewhere . They don't really hope to see themselves regretting after making the decision of packing their bags and leaving their homeland.<br><br>As the saying goes "ni kang wo hao, wo kang ni hao" (You see me good, I see you good) and you'll be shocked to see the number of foreigners wanting to get PR or citizenship status here <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Coz your description above sounds like, to be honest, typical primary school level hog wash - high on speculation, low on details and formed largely on the basis of chinese whispers.<br><br>I'll consider your points by reference to the UK.<br><br>Yes, tax is used in some countries to fund social welfare - like, inter alia, a health system, heavily subsidised  education system (eg grants for students, lower fees for students and incentives for students) and as you mentioned things like unemployment benefits.<br><br>Now you say things like <blockquote>...in these countries, if you are considered underprivileged, you get money from the govt, for example, if you earn like $200 a month, the govt will give you like $400 a month so you have $600, but, if you work twice as hard and earn $400 a month, the govt will give you $250 a month, so now you do have more money-you have $650 now, but, you have to work twice as hard. </blockquote>What are 'these countries' you are talking about? I know the UK has a minimum wage system so you can't be talking about the UK. For a vague post, you seem to come up with a lot of detail here...<br><br><blockquote>So if you earn more they give you less, so pple would rather work half as much and earn $50 less. Actually I feel this is not healthy.

However, please forgive me because I did not know how the tax system worked at the time. You see, 48% (in your example) would refer to any amount earnt after you hit a certain level. Eg. First 15000 might be tax free, then every $1 after that you are taxed 20% up till 50000, then maybe every dolalr after that 48%. So no, 48% of your salary doesn't go back to the government.<br><br>Your entire argument there is therefore really not much of an argument. Well, assuming that your example is based on fantasy of course...coz I haven;t heard of a developed country that taxes 48% of your salary...<br><br>In short, please be more specific. Thank you.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Kinokuniya:</div><div class="quote_body">True, but there are things you have to trade in for lower-priced housing and cars and education.<br><br>Such as, your family and friends here, the safety of the country, the culture, the people who readily and truly accept you as one of their kind, to mention a few.<br><br>Ultimately it boils down to individual preference...<br><br>I don't think there's any (or many) places better than Singapore in all aspects.<br><br>It all comes to whether you're willing to give up something to obtain another.</div></blockquote>Agreed that it varies across individuals.  I'll speak for myself here.<br><br>Family-wise, oth my parents have passed away and that does give me a dubious advantage.  However, even before they'd gone, both of them had accepted my decision to move, and in any case I popped by once a year to see them (and get some food and shopping in) - we kept in regular touch over the phone and by email, and with Skype now, keeping in touch with my sister is extremely easy.  In terms of friends, more and more of my mates from Singapore are coming over.  I'll touch on that later.<br><br>As for safety, I've discussed this on other threads before, so I'll give the short version here.  Despite what the news reports in Singapore say, I'm extremely safe in Melbourne.  Hell, I've got no problems going anywhere with a Rolex strapped to my wrist.<br><br>As for culture and acceptance, that's a really subjective issue, isn't it?  Look through this forum and you'll see plenty of people complaining about fitting in in Singapore and being made to feel like second-class citizens even though they're supposed to be first-class citizens, so can we assume that Singaporeans fit into Singaporean culture?  In my situation, I've got a good mix of friends who are local and who have migrated here from Singapore and other countries.  Also, I'm marrying a local next year and I get along great with her family.  What else do I need?<br><br>Just last week, one of my secondary school mates finally migrated here with his wife and two daughters.  He was doing well for himself in Singapore and also came from a well-to-do family - I still remember hanging out with him at his parents' place in Bukit Timah.  His father gave him a couple of hundred grand and said, "Get out of here - Singapore's no place to bring up your kids".<br><br>So I think there are some people who, despite their success in Singapore, do see things wrong with living there.  Again, looking at threads on the forum, especially in Speaker's Corner, you'd have to question if Singapore is the best place to live.  As you've said, it comes down to how much and of what each individual is willing to stomach, and if a 10% GST and high income tax are what I have to put up with, it's more than a fair exchange in my book.</div>
