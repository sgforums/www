            <div class='col-md body'>I presume we are the lowest income tax is because<br><br>1. Housing for a pigeon hole is like quarter of a million to own<br>2. A crap piece of paper like COE already cost like 5 digits, don't for get it adds up together with a car can practically kill you<br>3. Medical is on your own and even so using CPF only limited to C an B2 wards you want better wards cough from your own pocket.<br><br>Other countries have higher personal income tax is because they have other problems like feeding the useless but its a trade off for a house and transportation are much more affordable.  Moreover the petrol here is not subsidised other places have subsidies for their petrol.<br><br>End of the day is how you look at the whole picture if you are satisfied with here stay if not try to leave and don't come back.<br><br>No use complaining as nothing usually will be done.<br><br>If you in the low - mid level like me and you watch the show Finer Side of life by Dick Lee and the woman (can't remember her name) you get pissed as what the show gives me an impression that only if you can own the things they present in the show you are nothing.

Not mentioning an old BMW 5 series ok I rephrase a 2nd hand BMW would cost like the piece of COE paper that we all buy here. Your flat can get you a decent house with lawn and personal garage. If you move to a more rural area it gets you a few acres of land.<br><br>I weight the different pros and cons and do you know why all the Singaporeans that goes overseas refuse to come back? I think your guess are as good as mine. Higher income tax so what I can enjoy what i can never enjoy in Singapore.<br><br>But on a fair note its not Singapore's fault as we are lack of land so everything goes vertically instead of horizontally.<br><br>What ever the case people make a choice and stick with it, complaining will only cause more misery in yourself.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Peace, Out</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;">Well, so what if we have a low tax rate?<br><br>It says nothing about our total cost of living or the quality of life we can have as a regular citizen holding a regular job - the former of which, by the way, is skyrocketing while the pay of an average salaried worker has remained fairly stagnant for about a decade despite our sparkling official statistics!<br><br>And what quality of life can we expect as a normal citizen in a country where the government acts as if its policies are the word of God, crushes anyone who dares suggest otherwise, then when something goes wrong it shifts the blame entirely onto its citizens.. telling us it's our fault, we're a bunch of whiners who should go solve our own problems instead of looking to them for solutions?<br><br>Singapore has become an adult playground for the minority rich at the expense of the lower-middle class majority, going against and even suppressing the will and thoughts of the majority.  Is that what they call a long-term solution?  Even if we are strong on the outside, what's going to stop our Nation from collapsing onto itself on the inside?<br><br>No way I'm gonna have my kids grow up here.  Here they either become elitist, or "overassuming leeches".<br><br>Life is just not so black and white.  It's a stalemate in Singapore... and it's time to move to a place with a soul.  As for taxes ... money lost can be earned back.  But not time.</span></div>

We are continuously told we're getting the best and therefore we have no right to complain.. I think we'd be much more appreciative if our govt  is at least very honest with us about this.<br><br>I do agree Singaporeans  like to complain, largely due to the lack of empowerment of the people, because we feel we don't have the power to change things.. for example, we aren't even consulted for important policy or law changes, which can be sometimes implemented within 24 hours (wth!)..  I see complaining as a good healthy sign.  It means we aren't as complacent and "bo chup" as is generally perceived.<br><br>I'm pretty sure that if the govt is willing to come down from their godly perches high up on Mount Olympus, us commonfolk would be most happy to meet them halfway.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> But.. as I said before in other posts, looking at the recent "elite" series of events, I'm not so confident of that.</span></div>

While our CPF can be used to buy housing etc and that this amount of money will be ours ultimately, there is lesser flexibility and a smart investor is able to use this money and grow it at a rate higher than that within the CPF..<br><br>The only benefit I can see from our CPF is the extra employer contribution of 13% as well as the ability to use CPF for housing. But again when compared with our countries, are our housing comparable in pricing psf?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i too agree that cost of living is gettting higher and higher.. i was shock when the news report that GST will increase nx yr..<br><br>imagine all the things goes up.. they says that our salaries will goes up too.. but i doubt so, even if it is, we will only be getting another 100 bucks more but this means that we will be doing more work to get that pathetic pay so as to cope up with the rise of GST.<br><br>i noe the government is gd. when they announce this GST increase, at the same time they are also announcing that they will be helping out with the lower income pple.. but do they spare a though for middle income pple like us? where we are not getting any benefits from the gov cos we are not under the low income range, we are also not as rich as the high income pple where  a little bit price increase to them is like peanuts.. but we still nid to pay taxes every yr, nid to cope with the high cost of living..<br><br>it not that i am condemnig the gov but sometimes i really hope that they will actually tik of us when they come out with all these plans.<br><br>the gov kip giving the civil servants so much bonus. their one yr bonus is equivalent to my 3 yrs bonus man.. all these money belong to the taxes that we working in private sector companies gave every yr..  they shoudl actually cut down on their bonus, cut down the salary of the minister..<br><br>sorry for complaining too much but i am really unhappy bout all these things that the gov had come out with..  if i earn enough, i will most prob spend the rest of my yrs in malaysia.. malaysia have what singapore have, the place is bigger and the hse is cheaper.. but i wun give up my citizenship..</div>
