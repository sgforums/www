We need to take into consideration the taxes to be paid and correspondingly the services the state provides in arriving at the decision as to whether S'pore is really more expensive.<br><br>And for those of you who are not so good with your maths, the top bracket rate is absolutely critical, unless of course if you have absolutely no hope of breaching the top bracket. To illustrate the point, if 70% of your income is taxed at the top bracket (say 50%), the fact that the first 30% is taxed at some lower rate will not lessen the pinch! This I can testify to and also why Michael Schumacher (a german) is a tax resident in Monaco and not Germany.</div></blockquote>The point is that it's not as simple as tax brackets.  To put it simply, you can bring home a certain amount of dollars every year, but how you actually end up doing is also contingent upon how far each dollar goes.<br><br>For example, let's say, even after higher taxes, you bring home $100,000 a year.  If a three-bedroom house on freehold land sets you back $400,000, aren't you better off than bringing back $200,000 a year in a place where an eqivalent house costs a million?<br><br>So yes, I agree that the top bracket is important, but I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's critical because the cost of living can negate the effect of high taxes.</div>
