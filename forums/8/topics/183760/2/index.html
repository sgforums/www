Being able to enter SIM, doesn't guarantee you a piece of qualification ( i have known of people who got stucked in SIM for nearly 5 years, failing again and again), you still gotta use you brains and put in some hard work. Furthermore, SIM's exam papers are set and marked by examiners from foreign unversities, at the same standard which they assess their own students. It's not easy to get a good honours too, so if you can get a 2nd upper or a 1st class honours for your SIM/UOL exams or maybe good grades in your transcripts, it sure beats a local uni student without honours or average Bs &amp; Cs in their transcript.<br><br>However, of course, considering 2 same class of honours from SIM/UOL and a local uni,of course,the local uni's piece of paper will beat SIM's hands down, as simple as that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Nowadays sad to say.. its a NHNT (no honours no talk) world.... many (but not all) companies are looking for honours grads... preferbly 2nd upper and above.. so.. for those who spend 3 years and graduate without honours.. its still alittle lugi.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually so what if the degree says degree in management. It does not mean you will not get the job. It really depends on how much experience and how you write your resume in future. Resume - first step in getting an interview.<br><br>E.g. My colleague has a degree in Computer Science but he working in the Finance/Costing side. Alike to me, my degree is in International Business, but working under the Finance/Costing side. FYI: Finance/Cost jobs normally state that the person MUST have an Accounting or Finance Degree.<br><br></div>
