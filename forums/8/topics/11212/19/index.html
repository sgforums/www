            <div class='col-md body'>Bluerf:<br><br>You must understand, there's a living, breathing, real-life community here. You must remember that behind every post, there's an actual person writing it. Inevitably there will be conflicts in a community, and the results can be quite ugly sometimes.<br><br>Funeral had originally written a rather lengthy post lambasting certain people in this forum. If you were railed against as such, you'd get upset too. His words were intended to stir up a hornet's nest, for what reason I do not know.<br><br>Then on a certain day, for reasons known only to him, Funeral edited his original post to a fullstop. I suppose he did this to hide his misdeed. However, certain parts of his tirade can be found if you would bother to read through the early pages of this thread.<br><br>Most of us here are fun loving crappers you see, if you'd noticed the vast majority of posts in this thread is not in response to what Funeral had written. That would seem even weirder than several pages of posts written because of a fullstop, wouldn't you agree? Since we don't know who this Funeral fellow is,  we're not going to whine about what he had written. Instead, we've turned this whole thread upside down with our crappy posts, HA HA HA!!!<br><br>But the fact still remains that whoever had written it had evil intentions to slander certain people here in the forum. He is not an ignorant outsider, he is someone who has been actively involved with the people here. As in real-life, not virtually. And not just for a short time either. To have him write such nasty things about them, surely they will be affected?<br><br>As it is, I suppose things haven't quite cooled when you made your remark about a fullstop generating several pages of posts.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by BluErf:</div><div class="quote_body">Funeral has amazing powers of starting a thread.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Just 1 '.' and it opens the flood gates to a 7-pg thread.<br><br>3 super cheers for Funeral and all the forumnites who make this possible...    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div></blockquote>It's not the second statement that prompted my dear friend Mille to tell you to look deeper beneath the waves and not just skim the surface of the matter, so to speak. I believe it is that third statement of yours. There's no way any one of us would like to be associated with Funeral after what he has done.<br><br>After Mille had advised you to look deeper, you posted a reply.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by BluErf:</div><div class="quote_body">  Millennium:<br><br>My comment doesn't really depend on wat actually happens deep down... I am only saying that one '.' can start a 7-pg thread. Nothing wrong wat.     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>[This message has been edited by BluErf (edited 14 April 2001).]</div></blockquote>I believed you have missed the point, you see. Mille is not the only one who has told you to look deeper. Moose has also. And it is not our responsibility to tell you what happened, it is you who should have read through first before commenting. That's what's wrong. That's what Mille meant by you commenting irresponsibly. Three cheers for Funeral and the forumites? Uh uh, we ain't going to be lumped together with that troublemaker.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by BluErf:</div><div class="quote_body">  Millennium:<br>aiyo, since I dun know, then u juz tell me it was edited loh...     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Why so worked up?     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anywayz, was the remark so called 'irresponsible'? I think not... You may call it 'uninformed', but never 'irresponsible'.<br><br>Cool down, cool down... If you feel I have caused you great greviances, I apologize to you.<br><br>PS: What's an irresponsible comment? Its one that hurts someone with nary an afterthought. Hmmm... are you feeling hurt?     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by BluErf (edited 16 April 2001).]</div></blockquote>You see, if you don't want to admit you've made an irresponsible comment, that's fine, you can plead ignorance. And yes, you have apologised. But the manner in which you wrote it, rather condescending isn't it? It's as if you're implying that it was Mille's fault for not informing you of the current situation, when it is actually your responsiblity to find out. Yes, we crap a lot, and most of the time we're anything but serious. Except when it comes to sensitive issues. This thread was an extremely sensitive one, at least until we took over, HA HA HA!!!<br><br>There may not be many responses in this thread to the subject at hand, but who knows, in real life there could have been angry confrontations. I wasn't involved then, I wouldn't know. The point is, you had been advised to dig further, but instead you probably chose not to and tried to pass yourself off, claiming that you did nothing wrong. The warning bells were already ringing, couldn't you hear them? Has the thought ever struck you that there was more to this than meets the eye? That Mille was not so much berating you but giving you a hint?<br><br>Instead, you chose to focus on what he had said and not what he was trying to tell you. And then you try to justify your comments and make Mille appear to be over-reacting. Since you wished to take Mille's advice as a challenge, well, you've set the tone for a confrontation, and then one thing leads to another.<br><br>So now that you know the full story, you and Mille can stop bickering. There's no point arguing anymore anyway. I've noticed that you registered in December 1999, so you're an old bird like the rest of us eh? So tell me, what brings you back here?<br><br>[This message has been edited by KTE (edited 28 May 2001).]</div>
