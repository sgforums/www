            <div class='col-md body'>erm...will like to express a little sympathy to everyone in this case. The victim was viewed as the one being scarred. True, thats very obvious. But i feel tat the culprit themselves could be victims too. I feel tat to make them do such a thing to a young girl tat looks like someone around their age, I'm sure they themselves will also have their own sad story to tell. I view this case as one where both parties are victims and the culprit is our very own "high-technology"+"high-educated society". Wat a load of bullsh*t. Ppl around the world especially young ones who can't think bout themselves are actually losing alot of their morals and humanity. "Sigh sigh".<br>To say back about the case itself. The victim who was scarred was actually not the "average girl-next door" too. B4 this incident happen to her,she was one tat doesn't care much bout her mother and doesn't listen to her words as reported by the papers in which her mum herself say this.<br>Plus to think bout it,which mum will not make a police report on her missing daughter after so many days? it goes to say tat her mum had actually thought she was juz doing wat she normally do! Well,on the other hand we too cannot blame the girl. Her family was complicated too. Father in drug rehab centre and her mum was working so hard everyday to even give her attention. Attention was properply wat the girl was looking for in the first place.<br>Oh well....society had do lots of harm to many round us. My heart goes to everyone out there.<br><br>P.S. Juz wanna know whether will anyone here mind the girl's scar on her body if u were her frd? I will definatly not mind.<br><br>------------------<br>if love is blind, please hold my hand cos i'm blinded by your love.</div>

Even if they *have* changed, and even if they *have* showed grief and guilt for hurting the girl, is it possible to give her back her sanity back from the traumatic experience?

You rape and bound and scald a girl because of a HAMSTER??<br><br>Arafel, I respect your views, but I just cannot see how a crime like this can be reversed, true they might repent, but this is just too hard a pill to swallow, true society might reject them - but this is the price that they have to pay for doing such an unthinkable thing.<br><br>jeff :<br><br>Yeah, its true, everyone has to take responsibilities for their own action. Perhaps whats missing isnt IQ as society is always harping about but EQ ... no compassion for anyone else<br><br>Let me explain about compassion, before you harp around me fo being hypocritical after all the rant that I've talked about above. Compassion, love for family, friends. Compassion for animals Instead of just having this primal instinct to just do what you want to do.<br><br>So what I'm trying to say here is that, give support to everyone around you but if they did something wrong, they have to be punished for it, and if they show repentace, good for them If they dont ...Perhaps there could be something that they are holdin back on and may need a specialist in.<br><br>x men :<br><br>Thats true, but its in our minds .. and its already molded to think " we have to do something about it" but *who* actually stands up to do soemthing about it? Everyone is always waiting for someone else to start<br><br>Christmas :<br><br>Those words that you have just typed are you own views, and I respect you for that. If you think that that is the mentality of society, then fine - I'm just saying that everyone has to take responsibilities for thier own action<br><br>And of course, I wouldnt mind a the scars on a friend - but will *she* mind? Will SHE feel the same? Will she ever feel normal again .. I think not ..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br></div>

The victim was viewed as the one being scarred. True, thats very obvious. But i feel tat the culprit themselves could be victims too. I feel tat to make them do such a thing to a young girl tat looks like someone around their age, I'm sure they themselves will also have their own sad story to tell. I view this case as one where both parties are victims and the culprit is our very own "high-technology"+"high-educated society". </div></blockquote>How environment affects a person to turn to they wayward path also depends on the person itself,although the culprits may have a sad story to tell,but they certainly weren't forced or coerced to do such a henious act,what they do also depends on their thinking and from what they did to the poor girl,it's obvious they took to the wayward path,heeh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>When you were born, you were hungry and everyone around you was full.
