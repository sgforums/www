Why bother letting him out if nobody is interested in giving him the chance to be a productive member of society?<br><br>I would be wary of bringing family members into this discussion .... the sort of justice a family member of the victim would want to see meted out upon the culprit isn't always the best for society, as it will always be clouded by emotions.<br><br>While it may not be your intention to use a family member of mine as an example, I'd appreciate if you would refrain from using words like "your sister".<br></div>
