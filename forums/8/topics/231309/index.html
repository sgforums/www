            <div class='col-md body'>I am losing faith in people.......Is it just me or??<br><br>I trusted my steady GF 100% for 2 years. But last week i happened to see her handphone that contains series of intimate sms with another guy. Initially I tried to convince myself that it could be just friendship sort of things......but many of the messages are too intimate and flirty..I asked her about his guy and she tries to hide most of all the facts. She can tell that she is going to driving class in the evening, but from her sms communication I can make out that she met that guy...<br><br>After this incident, I am unable to trust her or anyone and I am getting more antisocial..Girls can be distracted to temptations around and can forget what is real relationship...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br></div>
