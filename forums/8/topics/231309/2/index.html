I cant even remember whether we had made a pact or not to hide anything but I hv this thing abt being truthful that he knows of very clearly. In fact, he checks on my handphone more than I did his! (when did i seriously ever privy into his phone at all till i got suspicious one day?) However, his frequent check on my hp to the extent of saving my galfriendsÂ’ numbers in his hp when I discovered one day did struck me as oddÂ…</strong><blockquote><br><br>Originally posted by Scuby:<br><br>I asked directly leh. But I also do not have 100% details or what. I do not know much about this guy too..My GF is trying to prove that there nothing intimate between them and SMS sent are just normal......If such exchange of SMS are so normal, where will she draw line between friendship and serious relationship?</blockquote><strong>It came to a point that i realized now sometimes I have to act before I even get 100% proof. Trust on my instinct before its too late. Perhaps this is not for all cos I'm as blind as bat. I am no jealous pot at all and if my guy were to comment on some beauty, I'd join in. He cld tell me that he'd hooked his female colleague's arm just to spite a girl and I cld laugh along with him. I had THAT much trust in him.</strong><br><br><blockquote><br><br>Originally posted by Scuby:<br><br>I can understand normal sms leh...I do not mind also. My GF and this guy exchanges SMS from morning to evening starting from 'gm' and can get very intimate at times like' you do not know how much i love you'. ' i miss you too much' , ' are you free today evening?' ' can we meet in eve?' what colour dress are you wearing?' ' etc etc.....<br><br>I did not understand initially because this guy's name was saved in my gf's phone as ' jasmine'. After seeing similar sms for many days, i really got a doubt and got confirmed by calling that number that this not jasmine but a guy.<br><br>Sa me evening I asked my GF who is Jasmine and she innocently replied that she is her colleague. I repeatedly asked and she told just another girl. I made her to call that number infront of me and this guy picked. After knowing that truth is out, my GF admitted that 'Jasmine. is a guy and told me many lies to cover up when I shown her the sms.....</blockquote><strong>Then I begin to find his behaviour odd as in purposely hiding his phone away, to the extent of putting right under the pillow below his head when he sleeps! That spruced me into action to check his phone. Then I realized he was being very careful to delete all msgs in his outbox. But I discovered some new incoming msg which was quite endearing like that of ScubyÂ’s gfÂ’s. Worse still, there were some mutual friends that we know of online and I realized he had changed the names too though not to the extent of their gender. Long story short, a marriage of 7 years. We broke up in the end. He was never honest with me in the very beginning, during or after. He was never a trustworthy guy.</strong><br><br><blockquote><br><br>Originally posted by BrUtUs:<br><br>well like tat u literally not wrong but u still supposed to hv some trust on her n not look at all her msgs... tis kind of thing jz ask her if she still wanna be with u anot lo, if yes then f the incident cos might be her flirting...</blockquote><strong>I really wished I had seen thru his colors right in the beginning. Much later after weÂ’re not together, then I discovered from my galfriend that not too long into our marriage, he had tried to hit on her.</strong><br><br>It could be just some bad eggs. But really, I hope not to encounter any more people like that. He was one ever deceitful guy and it just breaks you down further each time you uncovered a new truth which was purposely concealed.</div>

Our level of trustworthiness, I believe, has always remained more or less the same.  It's just that it's easier to get caught in today's word of internet, e-mail/blogging, phones, satellite TVs and cameras.<br><br>On top of this, since people of the past were much more reserved, more guarded, secrets would not easily have gotten out.  In other words, it would have been much, much easier to keep secrets (and appear trustworthy).</div>
