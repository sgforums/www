              <p><br>They are only not suppose to.</p>
              <p>But with all those healthy lifestyle schemes they have been trying to push onto the public.....so its a close one eye scheme for bicyclist to ride on the walkways.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Those truly involved in those schemes, are people that actually do take precautions about riding on walkways.  But most are just arse holes who dont give a fart about whoever is using the walkway at the same moment.</p>
              <p>And yah.....I really would have preferred to stick a stick into the wheels and watch those errant bicyclist sail and sommersaut thru the air.</p>

              <p>The pathway is not for cyclists to use, but most of them do not care about it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Quoted from ( err...somewhere ) :</p>
              <p>In the event of a hit and run accident, the victim or witness <br> <br> should note down the time and location of the accident, as well as <br> <br> characteristics of the cyclist and the bicycle before lodging a report <br> <br> with the Police. The Police will investigate the case accordingly."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It seems that you can report your cases directly to the police, but ironically it will be better for you to be knocked down first.</p>

              <p>Nikar, great to know u posted sensible thread.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ya, we all know the pathway is originally meant for pedestrians, humans to use.   Sad to say the "kind hearted" govt have one or two years ago allowed cyclists to use the pathway as well.</span>  </p>
              <p>Give thanks to the ruling party who always "have our interest and safety" in their hearts.   They the bloody elites never use pathways to experience such incidents.   Even if they do use pathways, they will be protected by many bodyguards.     So they are always above and we are always below.   Those below ones always suffer.</p>

              <p>Nikar, great to know u posted sensible thread.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ya, we all know the pathway is
              originally meant for pedestrians, humans to use.   Sad to
              say the "kind hearted" govt have one or two years ago allowed
              cyclists to use the pathway as well.</span>  </p>
              <p>Give thanks to the ruling party who always "have our interest
              and safety" in their hearts.   They the bloody elites
              never use pathways to experience such incidents.   Even
              if they do use pathways, they will be protected by many
              bodyguards.     So they are always above and we
              are always below.   Those below ones always suffer.</p>

              <p>This is not a small matter? Ok lets look at this through a cyclist's point of view. Lets say you are right, pathways are only meant for people walking and not cyclists and that cyclists should stick to the roads.</p>
              <p>You mentioned 76kgs hitting a 50kg body at 30kmph. Lets see, I am cycling on road, using your approximation, my total body and cycle weight is 76kgs. A simple car like vios or altis weighs 980kgs, plus the passenger(s) inside, it will be clost to 1,100kgs. It will be travelling at about 80kmph.</p>
              <p>So.. 1,100kgs hitting 76kgs with 80kmph is acceptable? While yours is not? Isn't that unfair? =( Besides, if its a lorry, just fantastic, because the weight will be over 11 tonnes.</p>
              <p>I cycle on road and face this constant danger because of people like you. I wear protective gear fully knowing that its of absolutely no use. I follow proper rules fully knowing that its of no use.</p>
              <p>I am sorry to say but because of this kind of selfish mentality, there are honest and good cyclists who lose their lives on the road while trying to follow the stupid rules.</p>
              <p>I knew one of them.</p>
