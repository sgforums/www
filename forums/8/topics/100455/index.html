            <div class='col-md body'>Malaysian gives up to Penang police<br><br><span style="color: red;">After 9 days on the run</span>, sought man gives himself up and was brought back to S'pore last night. <span style="color: red;">He says he has nothing to do with Huang Na's disappearance</span><br>By Li Xueying<br><br>THE Malaysian vegetable packer wanted by the police in connection with the case of a missing China girl surrendered yesterday after nine days on the run. But there is still no sign of the girl.<br><br>Mr Took Leng How, also known as Ah Hao, gave himself up to Penang police and was brought back to Singapore last night.<br><br><span style="color: red;">The 22-year-old Penang native was the last person seen talking to eight-year-old Huang Na, before she disappeared on Oct 10 from the Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre</span>.<br><br>His 19-year-old sister, Miss Took Lee Keow, told The Sunday Times that he had called the family yesterday morning.<br><br>During the conversation, Mr Took told his father, Mr Took Long Lai, 52, to follow a friend of his to his hideout. From there, father and son went to the local police station.<br><br>The meeting took place at around 1pm, and Mr Took surrendered to the Royal Malaysia Police at 1.30pm.<br><br>Expressing the family's relief, Miss Took said: 'We're more fang xin now. At least, people won't keep staring at us.'<br><br>Mr Took's sister, Lee Keow, said he told their dad he was ready to surrender. -- CHEW SENG KIM<br>Mr Took was questioned twice by Singapore police, was cooperative and said nothing which gave the police grounds to detain him, though they confiscated his passport.<br><br>But <span style="color: red;">he failed to turn up for his third interview on Oct 21</span>. Singapore police issued a warrant of arrest for abduction against him on Oct 26.<br><br>A police statement announcing his surrender said: 'We would like to convey our gratitude to the Royal Malaysia Police, especially our counterparts in Johor, Penang and Perak, for their invaluable assistance.<br><br>'The close cooperation shows the level of rapport and trust that exist between the two police forces.'<br><br>Huang Na's mother, Madam Huang Shuying, 27, sounded subdued last night when she was asked about the surfacing of Mr Took.<br><br>'I don't know what to say or feel. I just hope that something positive will come out of this.'<br><br>Mr Took's surrender capped a small chapter of an ongoing saga that police say is the 'biggest hunt for a missing person in five years'.<br><br>Massive searches for Huang Na - activated both by the authorities and ordinary folk - have sprung up in Singapore and Johor.<br><br>Mr Took apparently regretted fleeing Singapore.<br><br>Shin Min Daily News yesterday carried reports of a telephone interview he gave to the Malaysian press.<br><br>He said that <span style="color: red;">he secretly entered Malaysia because he wanted to see his 14-month-old son, Shun Wang</span>, but did not manage to do so.<br><br>The past nine days had been 'hell'. When asked how life had been, he retorted: 'How good can it be, hiding here and there?'<br><br>His legs also hurt, and he could not walk for two days after leaving Singapore.<br><br>However, he could sleep at night, he added. 'I did not kidnap Huang Na, so I'm not scared. <span style="color: red;">I left Singapore because of my son</span>.'<br><br>He also said that he sympathised with Madam Huang, his former colleague and flatmate.<br><br>'I want to tell her, I also love Huang Na because I have a child myself. I hope that people won't make wild allegations about me, because the truth can be dug out.'<br></div>
