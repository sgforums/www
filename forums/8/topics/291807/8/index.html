When the train stopped at Raffles Place, this bleedy kiasu ang moh woman rushed in to grab the only available seat.  She was very well dressed, corporate style, carrying a jacket, a newspaper, a handbag and a briefcase.  She sat next to this local who was asleep.  This ang moh woman elbowed this local woman a few times when she digged things out of her bag, flipped the jacket in the woman's face etc.  No reaction from the woman.  Until this ang moh woman pushed her bag inbetween them.  The woman looked at this nuisance ang moh and asked her to put her bag on her lap and to stop elbowing her and smacking her cheek with the jacket.  The bleedy ang moh woman asked why she cant put her bag on the seat and this local woman said "sure you can if you AND your bag take up only one seat."  The bleedy ang moh stood up as though she was going to attack the local woman.  That one, now not sleepy - opened her eyes so big and glared at the ang moh and said "u want to fight is it?  I not scared of you".  Immediately some commuters standing there said "alamak, another ang moh want to bully us".  ha, the ang moh woman immediately sat down and shut her eyes, with her bag on her lap.  I admit to feeling very happy that the bleedy ang moh was put firmly in her place.  I don't see what the big fuss over them is about, just because they lack colour pigments!<br><br>Confusion over 911?  Can't really blame that woman.  It was changed from 999 to 911 and then after d-day, quietly changed back because the gahment scared Osama also will target us on 9-11.</div>
