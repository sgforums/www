THis thread become crapping thread already</div></blockquote>Firstly the idea is more a dream than a possibility. Let me, a layman, analyse certain facts with you.<br><br>Firstly, the setup cost.<br><br>The necessary equipment:<br>Chairs, Tables, Utensils, Cloth, POS system (includes cash register, NETs, Credit Card etc), Cups, Glasses, Plates, Menu, Coffeemaking Equipment. Refridgerator, Air-conditioning. Music-Jukebox/Hi-Fi/Whatever Sound System, Containers to keep things (Stationary etc), Cupboards, Washing Detergent and many more. Initial Set-up cost.<br><br>The necessary staff:<br>At least 2. Let me say, each earns $900 a month (+ CPF blah blah deposits). Your annual salary given to staff will be around $2,3400 (including 13th month)<br><br>Designing and Renovation, (Calculate yourself)<br><br>Monthly rental (unless you're going to buy the place  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  which is really questionable)<br><br>Earnings per cup X number of cups sold<br><br>Number of cups sold will be depending on number of customers and number of cups per customer.<br><br>Number of customers and staying time. Average staying time for a student is 2 hrs without purchasing any drink (or free glass of plain water, unless you want to collect money for that.) Average staying time for people down for tea break 30 mins. Average staying time of people who decide to stay for extreme hours during exam periods - 4 hrs. Number of chairs will indirectly affect number of customers. An overly congested place (whether too much chairs or too many stoners) will make people have a bad experience and refuse to visit again.<br><br>Even if coffee bean decides to allow you to sell their franchise coffee, THE necessary skills to make the coffee....<br><br>To break even, you must deduct from earnings after paying monthly wages, monthly maintenance. And that may take more than one year.<br><br>Does that look like a good deal to you?<br><br>Not to me.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

Try to clinch some deals with movie makers to have your brand appear in their shows (especially Americanised movies). That's what I suggest.<br><br>[quote]<strong>and they will take up the space where other paying customers will need.. who will turn and walk away because your product is easily available elsewhere.. </strong></div></blockquote><strong>No not really, even if I have 1 Starbucks on the street and many other not so famous coffee houses. I am sure many people will still stick to Starbucks, because part of the utility enjoyed by consumers is to be seen over there, its a fashion thing.<br><br>He's right, students have'nt got 2 coins to rub together.
