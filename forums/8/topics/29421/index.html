Copyright gives creators the ability to gain recognition and financial reward from their creativity and incentive for further creation. This in turn enhances the enjoyment of culture and entertainment.<br><br>[size=large]<span class="normal">[color=cyan]Who is Protected?</span></span></span><br>Under the law of copyright, owners of rights, at least initially, are the authors who created the work and their successors in title. Oftentimes in the case of making of comic strips, cartoons and cartoon films, many individuals and entities such as illustrators, scriptwriters, publishers and producers, are involved in a given production. Depending on the nature of the contribution made by each individual and entity, as well as the legal system of that particular country, they may or may not qualify as authors or co-authors. The laws of many countries also provide that, whoever is the initial owner of rights in a work, all economic rights may be transferred (moral rights, being personal to the author, can never be transferred).<br><br>Many creative works protected by copyright, including comic strips and cartoon films, require mass distribution, communication and financial investment for their dissemination; hence creators at times sell or license the rights to their works to individuals or companies (such as publishers, film studios, syndicators, etc.) that are better placed to market the works. In many cases the consolidation of rights in a single agent is fostered by national laws through provisions on transfer, entitlement to exercise exclusive rights or initial ownership of rights by the employer. Contracts also play an important role in determining the ownership or the licensee of rights in those cases.<br><br>What Protection is Provided to Comic Strips and Cartoons?<br>In general authors and other rights holders have the rights to authorize or prohibit the following acts: reproduction, adaptation, distribution, public performance, broadcasting, communication to the public, translation and adaptations. Apart from these Â“economic rightsÂ”, human authors can also enjoy Â“moral rightsÂ”. Moral rights involve the right to claim authorship of the work and the right to oppose changes to it that could harm the creatorÂ’s reputation.<br><br>Many comic strips and cartoons are just the beginning of a long chain of subsequent products and services such as movies, games, multimedia products and merchandized items which bear the characters that initially appeared in the original production. Again, contracts play a crucial role in determining the terms of exploitation and use of the work.<br><br>Merchandising of items such as toys, interactive games, books and clothing including the characters of the production are now much more than mere ancillary aspects of the original productions. These merchandising items can also be protected by intellectual property rights, mainly copyright and trademarks, along with other areas of law. Hence Mickey Mouse, Tintin and many other characters have received another life after their initial debuts.<br><br>Comic strips and cartoons are increasingly seen on the Internet or in the form of digital multimedia products. For people to enjoy those creations without the fear of infringing copyright, and for the creators to safely explore these media as a new means of delivering their products, the adjustment of the legal system is critical. The WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) (entry into force on March 6, 2002) and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) (entry into force on May 20, 2002) provide the appropriate legal ground for such types of exploitation of works. Wide acceptance of the two treaties is expected and required to ensure that[/color]</strong><br><span style="color: red;"><span class="large"><strong>How Long are they Protected?</strong></span></span><strong><span style="color: olive;"><br>Under major international treaties, copyright works are protected for the lifetime of the author plus 50 years after his or her death. There is a tendency to extend this term to 70 years after the death of the author, in particular among [/size]</span></strong>industrialized countries.[/color][/b]</div>

The laws of many countries also provide that, whoever is the initial owner of rights in a work, all economic rights may be transferred (moral rights, being personal to the author, can never be transferred).<br><br>Many creative works protected by copyright, including comic strips and cartoon films, require mass distribution, communication and financial investment for their dissemination; hence creators at times sell or license the rights to their works to individuals or companies (such as publishers, film studios, syndicators, etc.) that are better placed to market the works. In many cases the consolidation of rights in a single agent is fostered by national laws through provisions on transfer, entitlement to exercise exclusive rights or initial ownership of rights by the employer. Contracts also play an important role in determining the ownership or the licensee of rights in those cases.<br><br>What Protection is Provided to Comic Strips and Cartoons?<br>In general authors and other rights holders have the rights to authorize or prohibit the following acts: reproduction, adaptation, distribution, public performance, broadcasting, communication to the public, translation and adaptations. Apart from these Â“economic rightsÂ”, human authors can also enjoy Â“moral rightsÂ”. Moral rights involve the right to claim authorship of the work and the right to oppose changes to it that could harm the creatorÂ’s reputation.<br><br>Many comic strips and cartoons are just the beginning of a long chain of subsequent products and services such as movies, games, multimedia products and merchandized items which bear the characters that initially appeared in the original production. Again, contracts play a crucial role in determining the terms of exploitation and use of the work.<br><br>Merchandising of items such as toys, interactive games, books and clothing including the characters of the production are now much more than mere ancillary aspects of the original productions. These merchandising items can also be protected by intellectual property rights, mainly copyright and trademarks, along with other areas of law. Hence Mickey Mouse, Tintin and many other characters have received another life after their initial debuts.<br><br>Comic strips and cartoons are increasingly seen on the Internet or in the form of digital multimedia products. For people to enjoy those creations without the fear of infringing copyright, and for the creators to safely explore these media as a new means of delivering their products, the adjustment of the legal system is critical. The WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) (entry into force on March 6, 2002) and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) (entry into force on May 20, 2002) provide the appropriate legal ground for such types of exploitation of works. Wide acceptance of the two treaties is expected and required to ensure that[/color]</strong><br><span style="color: red;"><span class="large"><strong>How Long are they Protected?</strong></span></span><strong><span style="color: olive;"><br>Under major international treaties, copyright works are protected for the lifetime of the author plus 50 years after his or her death. There is a tendency to extend this term to 70 years after the death of the author, in particular among [/size]</span></strong>industrialized countries.[/color][/b][/b]</blockquote>How about BOOKS..???  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
