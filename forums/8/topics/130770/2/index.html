Most of these 'nuts' will only be embolden if the girl(s) in question take the easy way out.

Say he is mesmerized by a stranger he met on the bus, and after admiring what he thinks is surely an angel from heaven, , he, being the shy, nice guy (as the hero in romantic movies inevitably are; they will bump into one another some other time, during which he will have mustered up the courage to ask her out...) decides that he should take a snap shot of what he thinks is the love of his life lest he never meets her again.

I do not know using a camera phone to capture shots of a lady at normal viewing angle is considered outrage of modesty or not.<br><br>I do know that they are criminal cases against people using the camera phone / hidden camera for up-dkirt shoot.

            <div class='col-md body'>Nope, it is not an offence to stare at another person unless he was peeping.<br><br>But it IS an offence to assault (including to slap) someone else for merely staring at you.. since you can't justify your action as an act of self-defence. Similarly, by accusing someone else publicly of being a pervert when you aren't able to prove beyond doubt that he is indeed one may very well amount to defamation. The best policy is really, not to take matters into your own hands cos you may just complicate things. If you feel that your modesty has been outraged, please refer the matter to the police instead.</div>
