              <p>Sometimes, when they call, I will fork out some time to help them no matter how busy I am. It is their job, so I shall be kind to help them. You know.. sort of being gracious and all. What for lie to them that you're not free? I wonder why are we so busy that we can't even spare 5-15mins to help others?</p>
              <p>You know, zhu ren wei kuai le zhi ben. So will you help the telesurveyors?</p>
              <p>But if I'm really &amp; honestly so, so, so busy, I will politely decline or ask them to call back later. I will never be rude to others. 'Cause I believe we should have mutual respect for each other. The same attitude goes for when calling telcos, etc &amp; speaking to the customer service officers, or entering the retail shops to buy things &amp; speaking to the sales personnel politely.</p>
              <p>Thus, at times, I will buy that particular item even though it is not what I really need, all for the pleasant customer service that I've experienced.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I've heard &amp; seen my fair share of rude Singaporeans, be it on the phone or out on the streets.</p>
              <p>Are you one of them?</p>

              <p>i do it sometimes. depending on how polite the caller is. whether or not i can understand what the caller is saying. and the 'company' they represent. but if you are going to mumble and chant even after i ask you to repeat/speak more clearly,loudly/etc a few times, im just going to say i dont have time. bye. and i;ve ever done a survey once which required me to be on the phone for more than 30 minutes. by the end of it, my ear hurt. lol</p>
              <p>there are rude people everywhere. though in some places, not saying please/thank you is the norm. and by saying please n thank you, pple will nkow straight away that you are a foreigner. and sometimes having people know that you are a brand new foreigner is not a gd thing.</p>
              <p>im usually polite. especially to strangers. unless they piss me off first.</p>

              <p>In reply to FI: ah. I see. But that's the wrong mentality to adopt. You will come across as being greedy. In hokkien, it's called gien peng gien sai. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> </p>
              <p><strong>You should help others without expecting anything in return. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Remember: A sincere 'thank you' is also a form of appreciation.</strong></p>
              <p>But let's say, if it's in the company's policy or they willingly give you a gift as a token of appreciation, then that's a different story. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>Oh. I didn't know that. Lemme guess, are you a M'sian?</p>
              <p>Hmmm.. I say you've not spoken to enough people. Try speaking to those uneducated Aunties &amp; Uncles, or rich spoilt brats &amp; their useless showoff parents/so-called highly-educated pr*cks who have simply no manners &amp; respect for others . It's either you have a hard time communicating with those ignorant fools - simply wanting to tear your hair out, or face a distasteful and overbearing, atiitude. I'm really disgusted with such people.</p>
