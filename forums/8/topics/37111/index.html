Everyone knows.<br>I believe poly grad would not want to be in a co. engaging in drilling holes, moving furniture, sweeping floors or emptying rubbish, cos all those jobs that you mention are meant for either 'O' levels or below. Moreover, poly grad are well over-qualified to be doing all that! perhaps you can check it out from those recruit section on papers daily. We are of course talking about higher end job here.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>
