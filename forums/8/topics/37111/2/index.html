If u NUS but do not add value to the company, who will promote such a person? A good cert onli looks good on ur resume, the true test comes in the work itself. When promotion of cos, qualifications do count. But in time to come, u shld consider upgrading urself. Just like my fren who is an engineer in a company, the company wants him to take a degree first before promoting him because the engineering degree prepares him for a supervisory position. Like for me, in poly i took a business dip, the subjects basically prepares u for an executive position but my degree in business covers subjects to prepare me for management level so, u see the difference?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>recently just attend a career talk from a reputable company.<br>This is the comment they give about degree holders about to enter working world:<br><br>Getting a degree (a form of cert) is only to show that you have the ability to study. But as to whether you will get the job that you want, depends very much on how you present yourself during the interview and how can you contribute to the company and if you have leadership qualities.<br><br>I do agree with the above.<br>Because I have went for a few interview before landing in my current research job. Prior to that, I thought I perform really well in my dream company(not the present one), but I was not selected! Then... I was selected to be in my current company in which I thought I may not have perform that well on that day of my interview.<br><br>My opinion:<br>Just relax and perform naturally at the interview session and don't be nervous. You'll never be able to know how they screen pple neither from resume you sent in nor from the interview with you. There are some companies who are looking for X-factor eg. whether if you are a "pple-person". Cos I believe everyone can do the same job, but as to who will do it well and can be part of a team would be what employers are looking for. Just keep cool and be natural during interview.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

The lecturer said the journalism school in sg not established. if want to pursue comm studies, shld go overseas.<br>If not, poly is better than going NTU. there's more hands on.
