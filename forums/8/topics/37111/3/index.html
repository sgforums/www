Master Cse after seeing the N/p advert.  - just thinking trying my luck and  to kill the extra Time available &amp; most importantly to upgrade myself &amp; get ready when mkt recovers.<br>I was grateful to be able to get accepted despite my overseas degree &amp; graduated with much new knowledge gained.<br><br>Actually, to me Local Uni &amp; Foreign Uni. has its own Pros &amp; Cons difficult to deem which is more superior. It depends on which angle you look at it from .<br><br>It is very true tt experience is important as it helps one to apply  knowledge gained in school to your work. To create wealth out of raw information you need the related experience .<br><br>Lastly, if you didn't do your OS degree full time at the Uni. itself but doing  it @ the local school here,  be careful your degree may not be widely accepted .<br>Sad to say this but it is quite true &amp; I hv came across a few cases of bias / rejection be it @ job application or applying to higher degree cse.<br></div>
