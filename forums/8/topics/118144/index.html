            <div class='col-md body'>IMO, it is true that having selfish attitudes will get you to somewhere but won't let you get far in terms of relationships with people.<br><br>You may be successful, but in the end, you may lose your friends prior to your selfish attitudes. As a result, you become a lonely successful person. Will you be happy? Will you die happy?<br><br>It is also true that one must be more concerned with his own needs and benefits. Nevertheless, one must not be afraid to share. Only the narrow-minded ones are afraid to share their success, their talents and some other things. They are afraid to lose. They are afraid to be overwhelmed. That's what makes them small people.<br><br>Big people are the ones who are generous in their giving. They give with a smile in their hearts, and with that, they gain respect from people in the society. With respect, and a good character, it will accelerate oneself from glory to glory.<br><br>On the whole, there're only two choices.<br>- Would you want to gain respect by being generous and big-hearted?<br>- Or would you want to be painfully selfish and lose everything in the end?<br><br>Every man for himself. That's true. BUT! The reason why we are made differently is because we need each other. Humans are made to be <strong>inter</strong>dependent. You may not have the talent that I have, and vice versa, because we are different. And because of this, the more we should share, our talents etc... while at the same time, minding our own business.</div>

To kill a person and have the person say Thank You. Now, that is smart. To piss off someone in the process of taking, thereby, risk the potential of future mutual gain or having your bad reputation being spread around, that is stupid. Take also got skill wan.<br><br>Selfish? Yes, no doubt about that.<br><br>Need to have this type of attitude to survive in this world? No, you don't. To survive, you just need 3 things - air, water and food (+ maybe shelter). Everything else is optional. However, man is greedy. They like to have what others have. So, as long as someone else is better off than them, they will take and take. And even when they are better off than everyone else, they will still take and take. How much is enough? Now you see everyone has a car, car becomes a necessity. Few years later, if everyone starts to own aeroplanes, it will also become a necessity too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>lesson learnt when i was 14.<br><br>playing a game in school with this guy. inter level competitive game.<br><br>i was very competitive, and even though I know it was clear cut I would win. I was not satisfied with merely winning, but i basically thrashed him. I took away every single point he had.<br><br>the look on his face at the end of the game stayed with me forever, even though I have forgotten his name.<br><br>sometimes you only take.. and sometimes you only give.<br><br>But if you are taking, i think... just remember to leave some for the person as a 'hou lu' to recuperate, to recoup, and not destroy entirely.</div>
