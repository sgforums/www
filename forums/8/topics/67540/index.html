            <div class='col-md body'><br>Fun-loving<br><br>Cool<br><br>Sociable<br><br>A: All of the above<br>By Ho Ka Wei<br><strong><br>GEEKS are fun, outgoing and sociable - possibly even more than non-geeks.<br></strong><br>The notion may not square with popular perceptions, but studies show that <strong>Web surfing techies are hardly the hermits they are thought to be.</strong><br><br>While the original 'geeks', or the earliest users of the Internet, may have been mostly male, highly-educated and less social, today's geeks are more outgoing.<br><br>For instance, a Singapore study showed that <strong>Internet users spent more time with family and friends - 9.3 hours of face-to-face meetings a week, while non-Internet users spent an average of about 6.4 hours.</strong><br><br>Also, the Internet was increasingly seen as bridging the gap between the online universe and real life. For example, one could buy a movie ticket online to catch a show in a real cinema later.<br><br>The study also found that people go online mainly to look for information, send e-mail and for entertainment, in that order.<br><br>Some of these findings were published in a report, called the Singapore Internet Project, by the school of communication and information (SCI) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in December 2002.<br><br>Its findings have now been incorporated into a global report, the World Internet Project, put together by the Centre for Communication Policy at the University of California, Los Angeles.<br><br>It has pooled together surveys done in 14 countries, including Japan, Britain, Germany, Sweden and Singapore.<br><br>Dr Jeffrey Cole, director for the centre, said in an e-mail reply to The Straits Times yesterday: 'The real change in the Internet is that over the past four years, the mainstream of our societies has come online and users look and act like everyone else.'<br><br>The centre started the study back in 1999 to monitor the impact of the Internet on people and society, and the NTU has been involved with it since then.<br><br>The then-dean of the SCI, Professor Eddie Kuo and two faculty members, Dr Alfred Choi and Dr Lee Wai Peng, authored the Singapore report.<br><br>Dr Lee told The Straits Times on Wednesday that their study found that the Internet, in fact, promotes face-to-face interaction.<br><br>She said: 'Children told us that the Internet is an efficient tool for them to organise face-to-face get-togethers. In addition, the Internet allows people to contact those who share their interests and professions.'<br><br>Dr Cole said: 'Internet users seem to make socialising an important priority in their lives and again, this was not true four years ago.'<br><br>An SCI faculty member, Dr Mark Cenite, said: 'Hard core geek users who substitute virtual for real interaction may exist, but these studies suggest that they are the exception rather than the norm among Net users.'<br><br>He added that studies have shown that people tend to fit media use into existing patterns in their lives, rather than let media transform them into something they are not.<br><br>There is even an annual contest in the United States to find the Sexiest Geek Alive.<br><br>Geeks The Straits Times spoke to had no complaints about being called one and their interests covered not just technology, but areas like health, the arts and pop culture.<br><br>One of them, Miss Annie Sum, 30, a technology consultant, was probably one of the first few to embrace the personal digital assistant in 1996, when she bought the Apple Newton - a device about the size of a Tablet PC (personal computer) with handwriting recognition technology before Palm popularised it.<br><br>She noted that today everybody rushes for the next big thing - alongside geeks - just to have fun with technology.<br><br>Another geek, Dr Seamus Phan, 39, is a technology consultant who speaks about fitness as passionately as he does about fire walls.<br><br>He had the makings of a geek since Primary 1, when he was the scrawny child who had to wear spectacles.<br><br>While in junior college, he worked on chemistry experiments - with university professors.<br><br>Dr Phan, chief of KnowledgeLabs News Centre, a tech consulting and training firm, said: 'The term 'geek' does not bother me, because one has to rise to the challenge of being one.'<br><br>[/quote]<br><br>no longer can anyone accuse us forumnites as being "no life"!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
