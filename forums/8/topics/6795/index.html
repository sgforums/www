            <div class='col-md body'>zenithal,<br><br>Excerpt from SPPA (Singapore Planned Parenthood Association) Annual Report 1999, Teen Survey on Sexuality and Relationship 1999, Page 9.<br><br>-----<br><br>Examinations to pass.  Kinks with a boyfriend.  Other pressing commitments.  Computers attacked by a virus.  Despite these difficulties, SPPA Youth Committee and youth groups gave time and effort in coming up with the Teen Survey on Sexuality and Relationship in Singapore.  The youths helped in the design of questionnaires and in the encoding of data.  The aim of the research was to understand the extent of sexual activity of youth participating in adolescent sexuality programmes of SPPA<br><br>Highlights of the survey:<br>1. Some 2,369 youth respondents participated in the survey, mostly from the secondary schools;<br><br>2. Of the 2,369 respondents, only 38.5% reported to have dated;<br><br>3. Majority of respondents did not approve of pre-marital sex;<br><br>4. Only 3.4% of the 2,369 respondents reported to have sexual intercourse (85 respondents);<br><br>5. The data revealed that much of the pre-marital sex among the 3.4% of the respondents who had sex was unprotected.<br><br>-----<br><br>(Note: Survey is sponsored by NYC - National Youth Council)<br><br>If the survey is to be taken at face value, pre-marital sex, or at least up to the age of 18 years old is not common at all.<br><br>At the end of the day, the question about whether one is willing to be romantically attached to a non-virgin depends very much on individuals.<br><br>It would however, be hardly fair to use acceptance / non-acceptance as a gauge of your (would-be) significant other's love.  Reason being that some might not even give a hoot in the first place, whilst others might be deeply concerned, or even worse, unable to be reconciled with this fact.<br><br>Moral of the story: save all the trouble and just remain virgins like LittleMan and Prodigal.<br><br>Regards,<br>Paul Mah.<br></div>

And it is different from making love.<br><br>Personally I won't believe a man too much when he says,"I will definitely remained as a virgin before i get married". Sometimes when the time is right, the atmosphere is right, the mood is right, everything is right and you just can't control yourself.
