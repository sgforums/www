            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Has the love match between sport's golden couple ended?<br>By Jose Raymond, TODAY | Posted: 16 October 2006 0707 hrs</strong><br><br>SINGAPORE: Their love affair was described as the perfect sports match.<br><br>The love story of Ronald Susilo and Li Jiawei made the headlines for months after they announced in September 2004 that they were engaged to be married, following a two-year courtship which began soon after they took part in the 2002 Manchester Commonwealth Games.<br><br>But recently, on top of having to face bruising battles in the sporting arena, it appears that all is not well with Singapore's most famous sporting couple.<br><br>Susilo and five-time Sportswoman of the Year Li have split, according to the sports grapevine.<br><br>Talk of the pair going their separate ways has surfaced before. Close friends and associates of the pair told TODAY that theirs has been an on-off relationship.<br><br>Susilo, the 2004 Sportsman of the Year, laughed off the suggestion that he and Li, now ranked sixth in the world, have split.<br><br>He said: "Everything is fine between me and Jiawei." He added that the last time they met was a month ago, just before the start of the Volkswagen Singapore Open table-tennis championships.<br><br>Li, who is currently undergoing centralised training in China, could not be contacted.<br><br>Sources at the Singapore Badminton Association (SBA) told TODAY that they were worried over how the latest developments regarding Susilo's relationship with Li could affect his performance on the court.<br><br>"We are concerned ... with the Asian Games just six weeks away," said an official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.<br><br>"We see that he is very frustrated sometimes and we are also aware of the rumours that he and Jiawei have split. We also know that he is very much in love with Jiawei."<br><br>The official added that Susilo was not asked about his problems as it was something which the couple would have to sort out between themselves.<br><br>Susilo, too, has not discussed any of his personal problems with the sports bodies as "he is very professional", said the official.<br><br>Sources close to TODAY said on Sunday night that Singapore Table Tennis Association (STTA) president Choo Wee Khiang could raise the matter with Li when he visits her over the next two weeks in China.<br><br>Mr Choo declined comment on Sunday, but STTA general manager Jackie Tay said: "What goes on between Jiawei and Susilo is strictly their business."<br><br>The couple bought a private apartment in Kembangan after their engagement but did not set a date for the marriage.<br><br>Susilo, who ruptured his Achilles tendon last August at the World Championship, has been on the comeback trail since the start of the year.<br><br>He returned to Singapore two days ago after losing to Taufik Hidayat in the quarter-finals of the Japan Open.<br><br>Before his defeat by Taufik, he made the finals of the New Zealand Open in August, but lost to Malaysian Lee Tsuen Tseng. - TODAY</div>
