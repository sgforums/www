Chris is over 6 feet tall and is good looking.  No I am not gay.  Later, I heard that they had some very lustful or intimate one night stand kind of thing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup, firewire is right on the dot.<br><br>Girls who try to pick guys up from clubs are the ones who are after looks, and money.  If you wanna stand out from the crowd, you either got the handsome look and/or money.  Yes, with good looks, flashy cars (not just some ordinary cars), flashy brand name clothing, fat wallet; and those type of girls would stick to you like glue.  Then some of them could be so shrewd that they would pemper you with anything so that they can slowly suck your money. Yes, sucking your money, not only sucking your dick!<br><br>Yup, it's a sad reality - no money,<br>no honey! Only money talks, bullshit walks!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm... firewire is VERY VERY rite... it really sux when u go out with ur goodlooking friends and all the girls flock to 'em leavin g u on the sideline... well, personally, no girl has ever walked up to me and asked me for my number but a couple of times they approach my friends and ask them for my number. dat's how i started dating in college but it only happend 3 times... u know, those once-in-a-blue-moon things that jsut hit u out of nowhere... and out of the 3 times, only one of them was chio (the one i dated for a couple of weeks of course lah) but that was it... its really hard and as much as i liked to get picked up by hot girls, as guys, we still have to make the initiative... though it sux like crap 'cause either u get rejected or end up making urself look like a fool, espcially if girl is a bitch...<br><br>yea, the richer and better u look, the better the quality of girls u get... BUT there are some exceptions, got a spore acquaintance here in college, real rich fellow, not dat bad looking but short, think his dad drives the only mclaren something or ferrari in spore... anyways, he drives a porsche taga, filthy rich, but no matter how hard he tries, he can't seem to get any chio white girls... i've seen him with some really big onse (big meaning over 100 kilos) though  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> oh well, god is fair  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

(unless u are really extremely good looking) but sometimes girls picked up by rich guys too...and get the fortune to sit in a sports car. Still, this is once in a blue moon kinda thing.But I know there are couples who got attached in the clubs...so....it is up for you all to think<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>
