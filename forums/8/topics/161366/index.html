            <div class='col-md body'>I remember when I was still in primary school, I used to sing along to this particular song by mary hopkins. And I wondered then, whether the song will one day come to mean a lot to me because of its reflection of what I would eventually feel.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">once upon a time, there was a tavern<br>where we used to raise a glass or two<br>remember how we laughed away the hours<br>dreamed of all the great things we would do<br><br>those were the days my friends<br>we thought they'd never end<br>we sing and dance, forever and a day<br>we live the lives we choose<br>we fight and never lose<br>for we were young and sure to have our way<br><br>then the busy years went rushing by us<br>lost our starry notions on the way<br>if by chance I see you in the tavern<br>smile at one another and we'd say<br><br>those were the days my friends<br>we thought they'd never end<br>we sing and dance, forever and a day<br>we live the lives we choose<br>we fight and never lose<br>those were the days, oh yes<br>those were the days<br><br>just tonight, I stood before the tavern<br>nothing seems the way it used to be<br>in the glass I saw strange reflections<br>was that lonely woman really me<br><br>those were the days my friends<br>we thought they'd never end<br>we sing and dance, forever and a day<br>we live the lives we choose<br>we fight and never lose<br>those were the days, oh yes<br>those were the days<br><br>through the door there came familiar laughter<br>I saw your face and heard you call my name<br>oh my friend we're older but no wiser<br>for in our hearts the dreams are still the same<br><br>those were the days my friends<br>we thought they'd never end<br>we sing and dance, forever and a day<br>we live the lives we choose<br>we fight and never lose<br>those were the days, oh yes<br>those were the days</span><br><br>To me, the tavern was cineleisure in the days when they still had california lemon, lasermania, netshock and the old foodcourt. Those were the days when we were young, wild and proud. Growing up with so much pride and so much angst, so much naivete and tainted minds that should have remained unpolluted at that tender age. I feel so small and caught up everytime I reminisce about that part of my life - one of the most memorable chapters in my nineteen years. More than two years of tears, angst, love and hate. Between friends, frienemies and beyond. And I know that a part of the little girl in me has never left that part of the life. It lives at the back of my head and sometimes it comes back to haunt.<br><br>Ghosts.</div>
