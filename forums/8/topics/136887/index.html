            <div class='col-md body'>This incident happened on the 28 May 2005 at about 1.30am in the morning. I(Mr Lim-Working Adult 27yrs) and my friend(Mr Ong-NS 21yrs) met for a late night prompt trip to Johor Bahru to pump our bikes petrol and planning to have supper after that.<br><br>We happily rode to the causeway and waited quite some time before our turn to get through the checkpoint due to the queue was longer then mrt. After we have got through, we went to second Shell petrol station which is further in where there are a lot of Singaporean pump their petrol there too.<br><br>After the petrol top up was done, we decided to take a short rest at the petrol station drinking some beverages to fresh up ourselves. Then the incident happens. A Malaysian Chinese guy Mr X wearing spectacles, with a small build wearing green tee-shirt and a pair of blue jeans with slippers came towards us in a passer-by manner. I knew he is a Malaysian as due to his accent.<br><br>Initially I thought he was trying to ask us something, in fact he made up a story regarding about himself been cheated as he borrowed someone money and was supposed to meet up at the shell petrol station to collect it but the person did not turn up. And he asked us for some money to take a cab to Johor Jaya as he has no money with him to get home and no friends to assist him at that point of time. So after listening to his pathetic story and Mr Ong felt quite sympathized for him. Mr X had a very disappointed expression on his face that moment BUT I am sure it was not TRUE! As his acting was much worse than an extra in television.<br><br>We replied to him that what do you need in order for us to help? Then that con-man responded that he needs $10 dollars from us in order to get home to Johor Jaya, so I just reached into my pocket and gave him about $2 ringgit and told him thatÂ’s all I have, if you want just take it else we will leave.<br><br>We remained quiet for awhile then he mentioned since we are all Chinese why not help each other? Those words made me felt very furious and I was thinking in myself since you said we are all Chinese but is that the correct way to compel people for help? I was quite frustrated at that time which I think Mr Ong has the same sentiments too. So we discussed whether to help him or not as we did not bring much money ourselves too. And Mr Ong showed him that he has not much money but with SGD$10 in the wallet only so he asked him to give him the SGD$10 but Mr Ong refused to because he needs to use that later. So after some time he was quite impatient waiting for our reply and told us if we donÂ’t want to help him, he will stick that needle with aids virus into both of us. That moment we were quite shaken by his words but I stay as calm as possible in case he tries to poke that thing in us.<br><br>I answered him firmly that even if you poke us with that syringe, we do not have any more to give you. He tried to get closer to us that very moment with the needle and said Â“DonÂ’t blame me, if I do thisÂ”. I promptly pulled Mr Ong away from him as he tried to get closer to him instead of me then I warned him not to come any closer. I said to that idiot even if you do that, we also have no more to give you. If you need more, try from others.<br><br>The next moment he asked me Â“Are you going to help me or not?Â”. Then I said Â“I am very sorry, thatÂ’s all I haveÂ” and he kept asking repeatedly till I am so furious then I said Â“No, we are leaving now!Â” then he tried to get even closer and Mr Ong warned him in a angered manner Â“DonÂ’t come any closer!Â”<br><br>So finally Mr X asked the last time and I still firmly replied Â“No!Â”. He said Â“If you wonÂ’t help then run lah, you run and seeÂ”. I pulled Mr Ong and walked backwards together facing that moron in case he tries to stab us from the back. He walked off also then sitting beside another Chinese guy which I think should be his accomplice. Suddenly a group of Singaporean malays rode in and park their bikes so I warned them quickly about this Chinese man trying to extort money with an aids virus syringe in case they become victims too. After that, Mr Ong and I rode our bikes and leave instantly back to Singapore where we felt much safer.<br><br><strong>TIPs:</strong><br><br>- Best to avoid dark places.<br>- Never show off your valuables.<br>- If approach by such people, try to stay away at least 3 metres away or more if possible.<br>- Try not to confront him in case there are accomplices hidden waiting to assist him.<br>- Beware of any action and notice what he is doing while leaving also.<br>- Go in as a group of 4 or more with guys and not too late at night<br><br>Description of Con-Man: Malaysian Chinese wearing spectacles, slim, approx. 1.70metre height, middle long hair and age about between 30-35yrs old.<br><br>I wish all Singaporeans who visited Malaysia are back safe and sound. Good luck!<br></div>
