I must say I am not an expert in this religions stuff, but let me share with you what is my view about it.<br><br>I personally feel religions is a faith issue.  It consist mainly of 2 components:<br><br>1. A meaning about life or a purpose in life<br>2. And Hope.<br><br>Now let me just ask a simple question:<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">If, shall what you believe in(may it be a religion or yourself or science) is totally not truth.  Meaning shall you find out that your faith is a lie, what your feeling will be, and what will you do?</span><br><br>Regards</div></blockquote>You are talking about "beliefs." Faith and "beliefs" are two different things. You can have many many different beliefs and change your beliefs. You either have Faith or you don't; Faith is what causes you to be alive spiritually. Will you ask yourself the question: <span style="color: red;">What if I am not really alive, what will my feelings be, and what will I do?</span><br><br>You cannot ask people who are alive spiritually to ask themselves: "What if I am not really alive, what will my feelings be, and what will I do?"<br><br>Sure you may ask Christians, Buddhists and believers of other religions the question: "What if you find out that your beliefs are lies, what will your feeling will be, and what will you do?"<br><br>I am interested to know also.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by casino_king:</blockquote>For casino_king<br>------------------<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> This better be good...no need GOD to answer your questions, let me enlighten you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><strong>How did you know that God is desperate for people to believe in Him?<br></strong><br><br>When and where did you hear that GOD is desperate for people to believe in HIM? Clearly there is only so little depth produced from a person's mind when he doesn't have the understanding of religion itself and questions only with a curious mind .<br><br><strong>How did you know that there is no reason why God does not want to give man a reason to?</strong><br><br>Hope that you're not questioning for the sake of arguing. You will need to be able to express your questions in a clearer manner first before anyone is able to answer the doubt in your confused mind. No reason for God to give man a reason to.....???<br><br><strong>How did you know that God does not exists just because there is no evidence present?</strong><br><br>GOD does exists and there are many people in the world who have been touched by HIM during their most difficult and darkest times in their life. The evidence of GOD existence lies within the people that has been touched by HIM.<br><br><strong>How did you know that God did not intentionally refused to give man evidence of His existence?</strong><br><br>GOD gave the evidence of GOD existence in the world by taking care of the worthy people who deserves it. The people who has received GOD help will be the best evidence of GOD existence in the world.<br><br><strong>How did you know that it is not because God wants man to come to Him by Faith and not by evidence?</strong><br><br>Having the fear of GOD is a more appropriate term to use than faith. Anyone can say they have faith in GOD itself and yet behaved in a manner that is against the very faith which they have proclaimed. Having the fear of GOD helps in straying from misbehaviour that is against GOD or anti-GOD.<br><br><strong>How did you know that it was not God who wanted man to come to Him by Faith and not the church that demanded it?</strong><br><br>Hmm? If it was not GOD and not church, then who? Think you need to rephrase your question well and take effort to express yourself clearly. If you're asking who wanted men to go to GOD, then I can tell you it is men themselves who wanted to go to GOD. Reason is because once men has been touched by GOD, there will be changes in men's life and nobody can deny the truth of being touched by GOD. And this has nothing to do with church, which is merely a gathering place for all Christians.<br><br><strong>How did you know that sin is not a natural consequence of a limited and finite universe populated by finite and mortal beings?</strong><br><br>Sin itself has nothing to do with limited nor finite universe or anything around us. When we sinned, sin comes from within us and inside us. You can never shift your own sins to anything else except yourself and your sins are truly yours alone.<br><br><strong>How did you presume to know what Good and Evil is?</strong><br><br>This can be interpreted in many ways. Knowing the difference between good and evil can be learnt through life experiences, understanding of the Holy Bible, laws in our world, individual convictions. Simplest way to identify between good and evil would be from the reaction experienced from any situation. Good brings about the happiness, well-being, peacefulness to all targeted individuals except bringer themselves. Evil brings about the sadnes, discomfort, chaos to all targeted individuals except the bringer themselves.<br><br><strong>How did you know that it is not the presence of sin and the mortality of man that causes him to seek and put his Faith in the perfect God?</strong><br><br>It is the fear of GOD that causes men to place faith in GOD. The real faithful believers of GOD would have real life experiences to affirm their loyalty to GOD.<br><br><strong>How did you know the only way to have Faith in God and be born again is not man recognising his imperfection and recognising the perfection of God?</strong><br><br>Care to state the evidences/arguements of your question? IF you have reverted to my previous replies above, you won't need to ask this question anymore...unless you have trouble understanding my replies.<br><br><strong>How did you know the only way to have Faith in God and be born again is not man recognising the perfection of God and recognising that he is powerless to expect and demand anything from God?</strong><br><br>Is this a trick question? Don't ask the same question again and please revert back to your previous questions for answers. I hope I'm not wasting my time and effort in replying you. Take note and don't be repetitive.<br><br><strong>How did you know the only way to have Faith in God and be born again is not man recognising his limitations and that he has no understanding of God and must simply put his Faith in God?</strong><br><br>You cut and paste one is it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong>How did you know the only way to have Faith in God and be born again is not man recognising his limitations and that he has no understanding of God and must simply put his Faith in God?</strong><br><br>*** IGNORING CUT AND PASTE ***<br><br><strong>How did you know the only way to have Faith in God and be born again is not man recognising his limitations and that he is completely at the mercy of God?</strong><br><br>*** IGNORING CUT AND PASTE ***<br><br><strong>How did you know the only way to have Faith in God and be born again is not man recognising that despite his limitations had an instant realisation that God reconises him?</strong><br><br>*** IGNORING CUT AND PASTE ***<br><br><strong>How did you know that Faith in God is not the only way to be born again.</strong><br><br>Faith in GOD has nothing to do with born again. Unless you can elaborate why, where and when did you get this mis-interpretation, I'm ending this reply. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyway you don't seems to be genuinely interested in the post from the way you asked and responded to the questions in here.

Clearly there is only so little depth produced from a person's mind when he doesn't have the understanding of religion itself and questions only with a curious mind .<br><br><strong>How did you know that there is no reason why God does not want to give man a reason to?</strong><br><br>Hope that you're not questioning for the sake of arguing. You will need to be able to express your questions in a clearer manner first before anyone is able to answer the doubt in your confused mind. No reason for God to give man a reason to.....???<br><br><strong>How did you know that God does not exists just because there is no evidence present?</strong><br><br>GOD does exists and there are many people in the world who have been touched by HIM during their most difficult and darkest times in their life. The evidence of GOD existence lies within the people that has been touched by HIM.<br><br><strong>How did you know that God did not intentionally refused to give man evidence of His existence?</strong><br><br>GOD gave the evidence of GOD existence in the world by taking care of the worthy people who deserves it. The people who has received GOD help will be the best evidence of GOD existence in the world.<br><br><strong>How did you know that it is not because God wants man to come to Him by Faith and not by evidence?</strong><br><br>Having the fear of GOD is a more appropriate term to use than faith. Anyone can say they have faith in GOD itself and yet behaved in a manner that is against the very faith which they have proclaimed. Having the fear of GOD helps in straying from misbehaviour that is against GOD or anti-GOD.<br><br><strong>How did you know that it was not God who wanted man to come to Him by Faith and not the church that demanded it?</strong><br><br>Hmm? If it was not GOD and not church, then who? Think you need to rephrase your question well and take effort to express yourself clearly. If you're asking who wanted men to go to GOD, then I can tell you it is men themselves who wanted to go to GOD. Reason is because once men has been touched by GOD, there will be changes in men's life and nobody can deny the truth of being touched by GOD. And this has nothing to do with church, which is merely a gathering place for all Christians.<br><br><strong>How did you know that sin is not a natural consequence of a limited and finite universe populated by finite and mortal beings?</strong><br><br>Sin itself has nothing to do with limited nor finite universe or anything around us. When we sinned, sin comes from within us and inside us. You can never shift your own sins to anything else except yourself and your sins are truly yours alone.<br><br><strong>How did you presume to know what Good and Evil is?</strong><br><br>This can be interpreted in many ways. Knowing the difference between good and evil can be learnt through life experiences, understanding of the Holy Bible, laws in our world, individual convictions. Simplest way to identify between good and evil would be from the reaction experienced from any situation. Good brings about the happiness, well-being, peacefulness to all targeted individuals except bringer themselves. Evil brings about the sadnes, discomfort, chaos to all targeted individuals except the bringer themselves.<br><br><strong>How did you know that it is not the presence of sin and the mortality of man that causes him to seek and put his Faith in the perfect God?</strong><br><br>It is the fear of GOD that causes men to place faith in GOD. The real faithful believers of GOD would have real life experiences to affirm their loyalty to GOD.<br><br><strong>How did you know the only way to have Faith in God and be born again is not man recognising his imperfection and recognising the perfection of God?</strong><br><br>Care to state the evidences/arguements of your question? IF you have reverted to my previous replies above, you won't need to ask this question anymore...unless you have trouble understanding my replies.<br><br><strong>How did you know the only way to have Faith in God and be born again is not man recognising the perfection of God and recognising that he is powerless to expect and demand anything from God?</strong><br><br>Is this a trick question? Don't ask the same question again and please revert back to your previous questions for answers. I hope I'm not wasting my time and effort in replying you. Take note and don't be repetitive.<br><br><strong>How did you know the only way to have Faith in God and be born again is not man recognising his limitations and that he has no understanding of God and must simply put his Faith in God?</strong><br><br>You cut and paste one is it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong>How did you know the only way to have Faith in God and be born again is not man recognising his limitations and that he has no understanding of God and must simply put his Faith in God?</strong><br><br>*** IGNORING CUT AND PASTE ***<br><br><strong>How did you know the only way to have Faith in God and be born again is not man recognising his limitations and that he is completely at the mercy of God?</strong><br><br>*** IGNORING CUT AND PASTE ***<br><br><strong>How did you know the only way to have Faith in God and be born again is not man recognising that despite his limitations had an instant realisation that God reconises him?</strong><br><br>*** IGNORING CUT AND PASTE ***<br><br><strong>How did you know that Faith in God is not the only way to be born again.</strong><br><br>Faith in GOD has nothing to do with born again.

What you have say about religion,faith and believe so far I do undertsand. However, you seem to have stop there and doesnt want to see farther and deeper into the issue.<br><br>I have to say you are incorrect to say that<br><br>quote:Before you have faith in somebody, you see that person, you know that person and you understand that person.<br><br>How many a time we put our faith on people we never see before? Especially in time of need?<br><br>We have faith in a person because of the person's values. Same as why we have faith in GOD. Just that faith in GOD isnt just mean the value of GOD but also the Truth in GOD.<br><br>However whether that Truth is a concept or not is not up to anyone of us to judge. Isnt the concept of money the same? Afterall it is only a piece of paper but we see the value in it.<br><br>Til now you have not answer my question.

You can ask people what happens when their concepts of God turns out to be false.<br><br>Faith in God is a different. The result of Faith in God is that God becomes real to you. You have a relationship with God. You cannot ask people what if the relationship turns out to be false? It is a naive question.<br><br>You cannot ask somebody if his relationship with his parent of siblings or spouse or relatives or friends are false. They might not have a good relationship or they might not even have a relationship but there is no such thing as a false relationship.<br><br>It is also possible for people to imagine that they have a relationship but that is not your question is it? Whether people are only pretending to have a relationship with God? Which is why I said that your question is naive. Naive in the sense that just because you do not have a relationship with God, you assume that others do not.</div>
