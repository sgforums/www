If you totally llisten to what that person said 100% without checking, you better pray you are in the right direction.

We also need to involve anybody which share the same good spirit. With the strong community, we can learn together.<br><br>It depends on whether you want to see that religious person objectively. If you totally llisten to what that person said 100% without checking, you better pray you are in the right direction. Todays' problem, we see lot of people just follow what their leader asking, without checking.
