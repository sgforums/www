The rules of scientific method applies. Furthermore some religion claims the world is made in days or world is flat etc. Tis can be verified by science as well. Whether or not they deliver the goods ? I don't know man... why link believing in religion to obtaining special and unfair favours ? Doesn't tat make him unfair and bigoted ? Is taking unfair advantages a primary reason to believe in a religion ? Cult also promise riches and success. So the more they promise the better the religion is ?<br><br><blockquote>Whether religion teaches good or evil would depend on what those people with religious experiences say. We can safely say that it teaches good because they all say the same thing regarding love and compassion. </blockquote>So if there r people who claims they made "religious experiences" however they say tat it teaches them to do evil, then u will start to believe in it ? Sad to say the proportion of people involve in cults and still experiences spiritual awakening is really in abundant as well. The problem is most people just want to believe wat u want to believe.<br></div>
