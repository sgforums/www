You are a credit to people who call themselves "free thinkers." Most I know who call themselves "free thinkers" are just too lazy to think.<br><br>As for your question regarding Jesus in Islam and Christianity; the Christians believe that Jesus is divine (while being totally Human.) This makes sense because if God is God then God can become Human totally if God wants to.<br><br>If God cannot do that how is God all powerful? To Islam, Jesus is all Human and is not God becoming Human.<br><br>Jesus nevertheless is respected as a great teacher in Islam. He is regarded as a prophet and given a place of honour like LKY is given a place of honour by Singapore (not necessarily all Singaporeans.)<br><br>The question is, if Islam accords Jesus such high status, shouldn't they then try to understand what Jesus taught? Shouldn't they find similarities in what what all the prophets in the patheon of Islam taught?<br><br>They rather depend on the "final revelation." Is there ever a "final revelation" or they simple chose to believe that? As a free thinker, you cannot accept a "final revelation" (if you insist you can) since life had moved on since then and life has changed so much since then.<br><br>What is left for you as a free thinker to do, in this example, is to study what Islam teaches and what Christianity teaches... be careful that you be led astray because learning from the religion that has vested interest can lead you astray.<br><br>What you should do is find out what the prophets say and ask an independent 3rd party if you can find one.</div>

It's true that all make sense in theory, and it sounds good. However, the reality is not exactly like what in theory, right?<br><br>You 've got to separate human behaviour and the religious teaching.<br><br>I think most of religions are teaching to love other human being. Well, certainly I know Buddha and Christians really teach this "love" very well.<br><br>I also hear some passages from Islam about "love".<br><br>However, human is human...not divine. Human do mistakes, and unfortunately, they do it again and again. Certainly every religions have it's own hard-liners.  I doubt those hard-liners really understand their own religion.<br><br>So how do you know which one is good? Let me give you a hint: do not choose a religion, but choose the person who you think can lead you to better life in spirit! This person is the real believers of God, and God listens to them.<br>Another important hint is that the Good One will not HURT and kill people!<br><br>I have a personal comment about Muslim, tho. I have lot of wonderful Muslim friends in Spore, and they all very very very nice and devout and willing to help. However, when I was in Indonesia, in kampung, every week, the devoters put the loud speaker in front of my house, and turn on the radio and I was forced to listen to the hatred preaching. Even though I was in my room, and lock my door, I can listen it like using my walkman. From the preaching, I can hear hatred towards government, hatred towards christianity and other non-islam religion. Everyweek, they are tought that non-muslim are kafirs. If those people listens to those preaching everyday, I am not surprise they are willing to become a suicide bombers in future.<br><br>So do you get what I mean? I'm not saying Islam is bad, or other religion is bad. However, watch out to those person preaching hatred towards others!<br><br>This person preaching the hatred teaching most likely don't understand what they are trying to preach!<br><br></div>

Problem is that you end up believing him and the "evidence" that he gives you (holy books) and miss out on your original intention in the first place and that is to have Faith in God. you end up having faith in the practices and holy books and that is where you end up.

You are a credit to people who call themselves "free thinkers." Most I know who call themselves "free thinkers" are just too lazy to think.<br><br>As for your question regarding Jesus in Islam and Christianity; the Christians believe that Jesus is divine (while being totally Human, makes sense because if God is God then God can become Human totally if God wants to otherwise God is not all powerful) but to Islam, Jesus is all Human and is not God becoming Human.<br><br>Jesus nevertheless is respected as a great teacher in Islam, a prophet and given a place of honour like LKY is given a place of honour by Singapore (not necessarily all Singaporeans.)<br><br><span style="color: red;">The question is, if Islam accords Jesus such high status, shouldn't they then try to understand what Jesus was teaching and find the similarities between what all the prophets in the patheon of Islam teach?</span> They rather depend on the "final revelation." Is there ever a "final revelation" or they simple chose to believe that?<br><br>As a free thinker, you cannot accept a "final revelation" (if you insist you can) since life had moved on since then and life has changed so much since then.<br><br>What is left for you as a free thinker to do, in this example, is to study what Islam teaches and what Christianity teaches... and you will be led astray because that is learning from the religion and religion has vested interest.<br><br>What you should do is find out what the prophets say and ask an independent 3rd party if you can find one.<br></div></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Ok I try my best here. In Islam, the final and last Prophet is Nabi Muhammad s.a.w. If I'm not wrong, I hope I'm not, Prophet Muhammad was the chosen one to be the last of all prophets and the "best". This means to say before everything was created, his existence was already confirmed and "pre-told". All the prophets were "chosen" to "lead" their "era". Prophet Muhammad was chosen to lead the last "era". This last "era" includes now. We are all in this so called last "era". </span><br><span style="color: orange;">All the prophets are human. They were just given special powers and abilities to convince people of their time. (You can try goggle more about the prophets in Islam and their "special powers/abilities")</span><br><span style="color: green;">The bible, is not totally rejected in Islam. (I hope I'm not wrong) There were 4 "books" sent down from God. (I hope I'm not wrong again) In Islam, we believed that the last "book" sent down, the "Al Quran" to Prophet Muhammad to guide his "era". The "Al Quran" was claimed to be unchanged throughout the various generations. The current "Al Quran" that we can find nowadays are supposedly the exact verses from the "original" one. The "original" 3 books were said to be "gone". The Bible(with all due respect) were said to be the 3rd one. But it was said to be changed and edited. (Christian brothers please clarify on this, I hoped to know too)</span><br><span style="color: blue;">In Islam, just to inform those who did not know, if there are Muslims who "worshipped" Prophet Muhammad or "idolized" him, it is totally wrong. Idol-worshipping is not allowed in Islam. Prophet Muhammad, with all his "divine powers" which was a gift from God, is still human like all of us. When we do our prayers, we do not pray to him or to whosoever. We only include him in our prayers. Ultimately we pray to God. We do not worship the "Black Box" we called the Kaabah in Mecca although all Muslims in the world pray in that direction. It is just to unite the directions for all Muslims all over the world to pray to.<br>I hoped I had provided a clearer understanding about Islam to all those out there.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </span><br><span style="color: olive;">I just want to say, every religion have their teachings and within the religions, because humans are humans, there are people who tend to deviate from the teachings. So called wrong conceptions and understandings causes some people to practice "differently" from what the religion teaches. I'm sure we have all played the "telephone game" or whatever it's called whereby an original piece of message is passed down from one person to another in a line by whispering until the last person and it turns out that the piece of message turns out to differ slightly or greatly from the original message. This "concept" could be happening in the religions practised today.</span><br><span style="color: indigo;">To my Christian Brothers, I'm want to know more what are the differences between Christian and Catholics and those other ones? I have always wanted to know the differences. And what is Trinity?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </span><br><span style="color: red;">Like I said let's make this a peaceful exchange and learning experience of the different religions. Those with insulting comments and flame-intended posts, maybe should go open another thread perhaps?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </span></div>
