How did you know that people's experience are false? So your original question really doesn't means anything since u disregard all experiences as irrelevant. Rolling Eyes Then since u do not care if it is real or not, I can cut and paste your previous answer into tis again; Since u yourself express doubt about other people experience, I can also express doubt about other people experience. Laughing Look like I do not have to be the top brain surgeon to rebute tat statement Laughing<br><br></div></blockquote>I don't about other people's experiences, I know my own experiences and they know their own experiences; you do not know anybody experiences but you insist that you do.

So your above statement is not valid Laughing Why ? Wanna challenge me and insist I am not "spiritually awakened"?

May santa and the tooth fairy be with you!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Since you claim to have been Spiritually Awakened; you believe in Spiritual Awakening after all?

If u want a real life example then I can easily replace "santa claus" with "cults". The idea in the end is the same. Rolling Eyes Sanat claus make the idea more obvious</div></blockquote> So now you do not believe in santa and was not awakened spiritually by santa and the tooth fairy? Oh I forget, when it suits you you believe in God and if it doesn't you don't. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">Adam and eve was a parable Shocked HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA !!! Go back and read before u comment wat is parable lah ! Adam and eve was known before jesus was born Laughing HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH !!!</div></blockquote> Oh you thought that Adam and Eve was Jesus's parable? For your information, Adam and eve was known before Jesus was born.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Or is the Adam and Eve story for you a literal story?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">U r just playing with words.

U know wat is "eternity" ? Opps... U do not know eternity because u also do not know when it starts and ends Laughing In fact u can't use the word judgement too. Do u know "good and "evil" ? Since u do not know, u do not know "judgement" Laughing In fact why do u even use authority ? DO u know wat is full "authority" ? U don't have it, u can't feel it how can u use tat word ?<br><br>Do u know wat is your problem. U don't understand English<br>Laughing Laughing Laughing Laughing</div></blockquote> Did I say I know Good and Evil? Like you? I say good only in the sense that as far as I see, the consequences are / should be good. But you on the other hand claim divine status that you can see from eternity to eternity and have the authority to pronounce whether something is Good or Evil. First brain surgeon now you claim divine status? I thought you did not believe in God?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">So u r telling tat rituals r "endless" and not important ? Then tell them not to do lah ! Stop the hindus from walking over charcoals and restraint christian from singing hyms. Who r u to say they r not important ? Whose authority? Yours?</div></blockquote>So now you finally get it? Nobody has the authority to tell them to stop? Not even you? Hello, now you admit you are not god? Changed your mind and position again?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">Tis is really cruel Laughing I really think I should stop replying to tis thread.</div></blockquote> Don't stop unless you think that you have been cured of your delusions being the top brain surgeon and god.
