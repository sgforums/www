Christianity, Hinduism, Islam... the same.</div></blockquote>it <span class="large"><strong>NOT</strong></span> the same.The problem is even the not so informed christians ,muslims know the very<strong> basic concept of their religions</strong>.Whereas tis so called folk practitioners don't even have the <strong>slight idea </strong>wat buddhism is all abt.As wat  <strong>An Eternal Now</strong> have explained to u <blockquote>By the normal and usual definition these people are Taoists or Folks-traditions-practitioners, but they themselves do not know that, and they do not know what Buddhism is about, that's why they call themselves Buddhists, although Buddhism has nothing to do with what they practise.<br><br>Those who practise deity worship and folks traditions are more towards Taoism - even though they may worship Buddha and Guan Yin. This is because Chinese Folks practitioners can worship any being they think are divine.<br><br>There is still a lot of ignorance of Buddhism. By worshipping Buddha, they did not mix Taoism with Buddhism, it is not even Buddhism at all. Buddhists don't even worship the Buddha and Buddha is not a god. Similarly if they pray to Jesus, they are by no means a Christian.<br><br>There is actually no difference between Western interpretation of Buddhism and the Eastern interpretation of Buddhism - it is either Buddhism, or Not buddhism. A Buddhist can only be considered a Buddhist after taking refuge in the Three Treasures, Buddha, Dharma and Sangha</blockquote><span class="large"><strong>BASIC CONCEPT OF BUDDHISM</strong></span><br><br>1. There is no almighty God in Buddhism. There is no one to hand out rewards or punishments on a supposedly Judgement Day.<br><br>2. Buddhism is strictly not a religion in the context of being a faith and worship owing allegiance to a supernatural being.<br><br>3. No saviour concept in Buddhism. A Buddha is not a saviour who saves others by his personal salvation. Although a Buddhist seeks refuge in the Buddha as his incomparable guide who indicates the path of purity, he makes no servile surrender. A Buddhist does not think that he can gain purity merely by seeking refuge in the Buddha or by mere faith in Him. It is not within the power of a Buddha to wash away the impurities of others<br><br>4. A Buddha is not an incarnation of a god/God (as claimed by some Hindu followers). The relationship between a Buddha and his disciples and followers is that of a teacher and student.<br><br>5. The liberation of self is the responsibility of one's own self. Buddhism does not call for an unquestionable blind faith by all Buddhist followers. It places heavy emphasis on self-reliance, self discipline and individual striving.<br><br>6. Taking refuge in The Triple Gems i.e. the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha; does not mean self-surrender or total reliance on an external force or third party for help or salvation.<br><br>7. Dharma (the teachings in Buddhism) exists regardless whether there is a Buddha. Sakyamuni Buddha (as the historical Buddha) discovered and shared the teachings/ universal truths with all sentient beings. He is neither the creator of such teachings nor the prophet of an almighty God to transmit such teachings to others.<br><br>8. Especially emphasized in Mahayana Buddhism, all sentient beings have Buddha Nature/ Essence. One can become a Buddha (a supreme enlightened being) in due course if one practises diligently and attains purity of mind (ie absolutely no delusions or afflictions).<br><br>9. In Buddhism, the ultimate objective of followers/practitioners is enlightenment and/or liberation from Samsara; rather than to go to a Heaven (or a deva realm in the context of Buddhist cosmology).<br><br>10. Karma and Karma Force are cornerstones in Buddhist doctrines. They are expounded very thoroughly in Buddhism. Karma refers to an important metaphysical concept concerned with action and its consequences. This law of karma explains the problem of sufferings, the mystery of the so-called fate and predestination of some religions, and above all the apparent inequality of mankind.<br><br></div>

They score full points in maths ? Everything they say must be right ? They never make mistakes forever ? Nah... u can't tell the difference. Physically they r still the same. I can say I have been enlightened myself. Can u say I am wrong ? U can't, because how can personal experiences be wrong  I don't know why do u bring in "trust other people experience". I am simply comparing all the accounts of the people who claims they made spiritual breakthrough and derive a logical conclusion from it. If u can't even do tat then u can't tell a mad person from a sane one. How do u know a person is mad when he talks/hurt himself or say he can see ghosts eerywhere ?

There r really children who believes in them and they act similarly to people believing in religion. And who say tat religion is not a construct of the human mind ? Since there r so many different and contradictory accounts from the different religion, surely either only 1 or none of them r true and the rest "construct of human mind".<br><br><blockquote>Who?

This teaching is meant for Jews, you are not a Jew.<br><br>It is not about not receiving punishments. It is a very technical concept. It is about whether you are qualified to have Faith in God. It is about Jesus making you qualified to have Faith in God; still it comes down to Faith in God.<br><br>Put your Faith in God is the key. When you put your Faith in God and not "small" gods, that is, human concepts of God, idols, you will be born again. When you are born into God's kingdom, God becomes real to you and you start to have a relationship with God.<br><br>So do not ask about Christianity from seekers in the church just like you should not ask about Hinduism from seekers in Hindu temples.
