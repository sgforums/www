They have a golden aura ? They score full points in maths ? Everything they say must be right ? They never make mistakes forever ? Nah... u can't tell the difference.

U can't, because how can personal experiences be wrong  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> I don't know why do u bring in "trust other people experience". I am simply comparing all the accounts of the people who claims they made spiritual breakthrough and derive a logical conclusion from it. If u can't even do tat then u can't tell a mad person from a sane one. How do u know a person is mad when he talks/hurt himself or say he can see ghosts eerywhere ? They r his personal experience as well. How would u know ? So every claim from every mad people r all true ?<br><br><blockquote>Guide the seekers to being Born Again and becoming Enlightened. These are special favours</blockquote>If tat is wat u mean in the earlier statement, then I guess people who r good at brainwashing and psychology is the most enlightened one. Surely u got to acknowledge there r pursuasive people around tat can twist the mind of the weak<br><br><blockquote>You reap what you sow. It does not matter how you justify your actions; whether the devil or a voice in your head asked you to do it</blockquote>I still don't see how the above have any link with the others.</div>

The purpose is always to make you live a honourable, peaceful and fulfilling life. A person without a religion is a person without fear and hopes in life. This might makes the person dangerous cos he/she is not bound by any moral obligations to do good to people around him/her. A person with no fear is also a person with no hopes in life, cos he/she will try to achieve everything by themselves...thus might potentially lead to self-isolation. Nobody can bear living in this world alone when they're alone.<br><br>IF anyone felt that they're alone in this world even when your parents, friends are still alive and around you. Then they are truly alone and miserable, I would suggest taking up a religion to fill up the voided portion of the heart.

Are you some sort of god? </blockquote>Judge of other people personal experiences ? Nah... u r putting words into my mouth and nto understanding my arguments. I am just thinking critically on your issue of "spiritual awakening" I have already stated many times tat "spiritual awakening" is not unique and many other people experiences the same thing. Do u agree tat there r people from different cults who claim exactly, if not more intense experience and yet their religion is really "unbelievable" ?<br><br>I didn't say the people who had experience "spiritual awakening" to be lying about their experience, I am saying tat many people from different religion has their share of witnesses on tis aspect as well. So wat is the possible conclusion ? U can only conclude either all religions are completely right (which is impossible because they contradicts each other) or tat "spiritual awakening" is mainly a random occurences or not conclusive enough to determine the validity of a religion. So wat other logical conclusion can u reach ?<br><br>Just basing on tis is a very weak stand to say the religion is real.<br><br><blockquote>What if God simply refuses to give people like you evidence of His existence?<br>What if God simply refuses to give people like you experience of His existence?<br>What if people like you will never experience God because you are just too arrogant and God refuses to have anything to do with arrogant people? </blockquote>I don't know man... on one hand he is desperate for people to believe in him and on the other he refuse to give them a reason to. Isn't tat strange ? The more simple answer is simply because he does not exists (so no evidence is present) and yet the church wanna retain believer so insist they use faith (no doubt from believer and accept everything said to them). The idea of sin is simply to make u feel guilty and put all the blame of the problem on yourself (the evil and imperfectness of world is not attributed to god even though he is the one who made it and he is supposed to be powerful to change it)<br><br><blockquote>What makes you so sure that Buddhist Enlightenment will produce physical changes that you can see? How do you know that if you do not see a golden aura means that they are not enlightened? </blockquote>No, I do not think tat buddhists got a golden aura of halo when they r enlightened. I am no buddhist myself  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><blockquote>The individuals think that their experiences are of divine origins; who are you to say that it can never be? </blockquote>Consider cults saying tat their experiences r of "divine" origin yet their scipture is faulty like hell, I can really say tat one should exercise caution and think critically before accepting it at face value<br><br><blockquote>What is your point other than it can't be it can't be? </blockquote>U have not shown me any reason why "it must be it must be it must be"<br><br><blockquote>People tell you that they have a headache and you are behaving like a child who has never experienced headache and keep insisting that there is no such thing as a headache?</blockquote>Talking about headache, it is really scientifically shown tat it really exists. There r physical changes tat can be seen in a person when it is suffering headache and it is repeatable in the sense tat other people tat faces the same headaces shown similar symptom. The cure for headache is shown to work reasonably and the causes to why it occur is also shown to follow a certain trend. The logic behind headache is given and it is logical with no contradictory evidence tat point otherwise. As such I will not insist there is no such thing as headache even if I do not have one. Can u say the same to "spiritual awakening" ?<br><br>U tell everybody tat ghost exists just because u see a shadow passing through your doorway and insist tat it is the necessary and sufficient evidence to prove ghost exists. When other people advise tat it means nothing, u put up a defend and say they r like a child. I wonder who is the real child here.</div>
