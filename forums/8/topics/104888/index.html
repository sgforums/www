            <div class='col-md body'>Whether or not he likes this girl is not the point. The thing is that HE LIED. I believe that communication and honesty is the key to every relationship.<br><br>If he just wants to meet up with this girl as a friend, I don't see why he should have to lie about it. He should have just told you about it, I'm sure you are not unreasonable. And if you didn't feel comortable with it, as a boyfriend he should respect that and not meet up with her.<br><br>When one person starts lying in a relationship, it is a sign that something is wrong, because you should never feel the need to lie. Plus, once you're caught, it is hard to trust you ever again.<br><br>My advice is to confront him, and explain to him that he should never have lied.<br><br></div>
