            <div class='col-md body'>If he's interested in photography, might as well jump straight into a dSLR...

If I'm not wrong, a second-hand 350D is about 850 quids (Gotta check clubsnap)<br><br>The Canon Powershot S-series is already quite steep in the learning curve IMO, almost on-par with a dSLR. In fact, I find it to be just like a dSLR, only that you can't change the lens and there's still some restriction in settings.<br><br>It was actually quite hard to convince my mum why I want a dSLR...<br>"Why do you need another camera?

            <div class='col-md body'>Bart, IMHO you've left out the key advantage of a prosumer.  When I was getting my head around photography, I found the preview feature particularly handy because I got to play around and see how changes in the shutter speed and aperture size could affect the photo before I took it.  That, combined with the S1's capability, made photography particularly satisfying such that I eventually moved up to DSLR.  I'd go as far as to say that had I started with a 400D, I would probably have lost interest in photography at an early stage.</div>

You got the XX-XXmm lens ah? Can lend? Can lend?)<br><br>Anyway, for the preview thingy. Its not as bad as during the film era and when dSLR are out of the reach of us mere mortals. The startup cost and running cost of film was really the thing that puts my interest in photography on hold. You need to develop the film before you can see the result and basically for a poor student like me, not quite possible.<br><br>Its no argument that the Powershot S1 to 5 is a very good camera, the super-macro is damn cool. (But dang... They only intro-ed the hotshoe in S5...) The downside is, if you're a fast-learner, you can grow out of it pretty soon. (15 seconds max shutter? No bulb?) And for people without much spare cash, not really a wise move to get a compact then a dSLR. I myself took quite a leap of faith to get my dSLR, albeit a second-hand one. (Not to mention persuading my mum)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ehh, I suppose it depends where you sit on the technology adoption scale as well as cash flow.  I tend to approach things a but more slowly and I didn't decide to switch from the S1 to the 400D until I decided that I actually liked photography enough.<br><br>In any case, my next step is underwater photography, and the S1's underwater case is a helluva lot cheaper than one for the 400D, although after three months I still haven't tried it out. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm.  I like the idea of having IS built into the body instead of the lens, but that being the case I'd go for the Sony Alpha rather than the Pentax on terms of value for cost.  At the end of the day, I'd go for a fast lens instead of IS, so it's no big deal IMHO.<br><br>A few people have said that the K10 is noisier at above ISO 800, compared to the 400D, much less the 30D which the K10 seems to be aimed at.</div>

Usually those dust that can be shaken off by the filter can also be blown away using a blower. If your sensor has dust, it'll end up as black spots on your pictures.<br><br>Generally, all current dSLRs have quick startup. As for anti-shake, Canon and Nikon are all lens based. Sony's offering has sensor based, not too sure about other manufacturers.<br><br>As for focus, I usually only use one, the middle one. I'll aim at my subject, focus-lock, then I compose. Only when I'm lazy then I'll use AiAF (Canon)<br><br>Anyway, if you want 1st hand and below 1K, then I'll suggest you get Nikon, since that is the one that fits your budget.

            <div class='col-md body'>Its best that you go down to the shops and have a feel with the camera, you'll be the one using it and afterall the camera have to be the one you're comfortable with.
