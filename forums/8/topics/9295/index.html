            <div class='col-md body'>okie...Since my thread is missing, I am going to start a new one!<br><br>(at least it gives me the chance to correct my spelling error!)<br><br>Can you think of one word, just one that best describe you as a person?!<br><br>Mine would be water. H2O. Aqua.<br><br>Why? Cuz I am constantly changing and adapting to my surroundings. I react to the people, the events around me and in many ways, they indirectly shape me into a new person constantly. I am always growing, observing and learning new things. I thrive in change and challenges. Just like water, you can't hold it in your hands but you can contain it in a space and see its form. There are also the other two different states of water -- ice and steam.<br><br>------------------<br>Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices within the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.         ~1 Corinthians 14:4-8</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like the water that flows into the vast sea, I am shapeless and seemingly unable to be contained. It has become clearer to me as the years go by, that I am truly made up of conflicting thoughts and abstractions. Not necessarily a bad thing, it's definitely a quest to predict and be able to tell what I will do or think of next. For even I myself don't know how I will approach things next. I settle for answers suited at that moment, and like most things, there's more than one answer to every question. After some time has passed, perspectives shift the way you think and your attitude towards a certain situation changes. But in all things, I pursue for the very best (measured against -my- personal definition of "best" which ultimately equals satisfaction sans bitching.)<br></div>

But, to me, the word Grace best describe you.<br><br>*Eck: the word Slack doesn't describe you at all.  You might be slacking at work, but it sure doesn't describe your character.  I think the word delusion describe you.<br><br>*churra: you are not lazy lah!  If you are lazy then how can you get that recognition at work?<br><br>*ET: got one word that descible you better? kekee..your words seem so vague.<br><br>*bochup: If I am not mistaken, bochup means don't care/careless/can't be bother.

Don't forget you still have a lot of good friends that are willing to help you in your path.<br><br>*christmas: darkness?! But christmas is suppose to be a day with beautiful and colorful lights.<br><br>*EcK: why delusion?!  Cuz I feel that at times you will lose your focus in life.  You will be easily stray away from your focus and get illusional with other stuff...You think of yourself too less, I know you are capable of doing many things, but you are a bit delusional...<br><br>*jeff007: Xiao meaning silly? crazy? My chinese is not that good.. =P and if so, what makes you think of yourself like that?<br><br>*Siaobell: kekekeke everyone feels lonely from time to time.  Don't forget to open up your eyes and look at all the ppl that cares so much for you.<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...sting like a bee...</div>
