            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, take this mini-quiz. Do you:<br><br>- Agree to go to "chick flicks," the opera, plays, etc., even though you don't want to (and she never reciprocates by attending the events you enjoy)?<br><br>- Always pick up the tab for dating expenses, even though she has an excellent, high-paying job?<br><br>- Have sex only on her terms and only when she's "in the mood"?<br><br>- Suddenly find yourself changing your clothing, hairstyle, dÃ©cor, and car according to her demands?<br><br>- Act as her door-to-door chauffeur, problem-solver, financier?<br><br>- Keep calling her (and making excuses for her behaviour) when she doesn't return calls or is otherwise "unavailable"?<br><br>If you answered "yes" to any of these questions (or a hundred similar ones), then you're the victim of sexual manipulation. You are running scared -- afraid that if you stand up to her or don't succumb to her demands, she'll cut off the sex.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>sex = power</strong></span><br><br>Whether or not men know it (or want to admit it), women are in complete control of the sexual arena. They know that a woman's physical appearance is an irresistible drug to men. They know that lust can temporarily stun a man's ability to reason. They know men want sex and will do anything -- even act contrary to their inherent masculine natures -- to get it.<br><br>They know they can turn even the most macho he-man into a begging puppy dog just by a secret, throaty whisper in the ear. They know they can manipulate a man into spending thousands of dollars on them with the bat of an eyelash or the tip of the tongue flitting out between the lips. They know that they can get away with behavior that society would never tolerate in men.<br><br>This is an awesome power, and women are experts at wielding it. Sex should be an intimate bond between two equal partners, but for women it is first and foremost a tool. They addict men to their sexuality and then withdraw it to keep them panting for more. They dangle sex in front of men like a carrot on a stick, knowing full well that they can get men to do anything they want them to do.<br><br>They are masters at sexual manipulationÂ…<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">oldest trick in the book</span></strong><br><br>The tools of the female manipulative trade are seduction, flattery, deception, evasion, unavailability, and innuendo -- all cunning levers to bend men to their wills. Women shave, pluck, dye, paint, starve, tuck, enlarge, and de-wrinkle themselves for one reason -- to package themselves for sexual power over men.<br><br>A woman will never give herself emotionally to a man unless he has something she can exploit. Sexual manipulation is essentially dishonest, by its very nature designed to mislead and control men.<br><br>Unfortunately, in our society, women are permitted to abuse their sexual power. They are allowed to flaunt their sexuality, yet still claim to be victims. They are allowed to exploit and profit from men's natural drives in the adult entertainment industry. They are allowed to dress seductively in cleavage-baring tops and hip-hugging jeans without any fear of sexual consequences.<br><br>They are allowed to seduce men into handing over their wallets without any worry of judgment or criminal censure. They are allowed to flirt and seduce in the workplace, and then cry "sexual harassment" when a man responds according to his biological imperatives.<br><br>They are allowed to use sex to their advantage -- and withdraw it -- when it is convenient for them and then hide behind a self-serving version of feminism when it comes time to pay the price.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">a man's sex drive is honest</span></strong><br><br>At its very core, the male sex drive is honest, clean, open, and uninhibited. But at the hands of manipulating women, it becomes man's worst enemy -- it turns him into a senseless puppet dancing to a woman's tune. Driven blindly by testosterone, men sacrifice their male power on the altar of female sexploitation.<br><br>We pay for dinner, go shopping for clothes, tolerate moods, forsake our buddies, and cuddle up on the couch watching a DVD of Sleepless in Seattle, all in hopes of getting laid.<br><br>When a man in lust surrenders his male power to a woman, she calls him a "gentleman" -- translation: a sucker manipulated to do exactly what she wants.<br><br>It's not pretty.<br><br>In fact, it's a disgrace.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">take back control</span></strong><br><br>But there's a simple solution: stop letting her get away with it. Women are like spoiled brats -- you have to put your foot down and start setting limits.<br><br>Here are a few tips that'll help you put the brakes on female sexual manipulation.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1- Be true to yourself</span><br>If you want to go see Bloodsoak II instead of Endless Boundless Love, then say so. If she doesn't want to go, then go by yourself -- she'll get the point. Hopefully in the future you'll achieve a spirit of compromise.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2- Stop paying for her</span><br>Financing her social life only enables her abuse of her sexual power -- it keeps on proving to her that she can exploit you and get away with using her feminine guile.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3- Firmly set bedroom boundaries</span><br>Break the grip of her control of the sexual arena. Insist on complete partnership -- sex when you want it, too, not just when she feels like it.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4- Be prepared to lose</span><br>Risk losing sex. When you stand up to her manipulation, she will cut you off, scorn you, belittle you, scream at you -- and she may even leave you to find a more compliant sucker. But it's better to be rid of her than to spend any more time being a volunteer to her sexual manipulation.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5- Walk away</span><br>This is your ultimate defense. Refuse to be manipulated. Reclaim your male rights and get out of there. You'll find somebody better.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">decide what woman you want</span></strong><br><br>It's up to you, guys. Dating should be about partnership, not a whore/john relationship, where a woman oozes up against you with one hand reaching for your wallet. It should be about honesty and equality, not about a woman taking advantage of your natural sex drive to get what she wants.<br><br>Ultimately, it should be about standing up for your rights as a man and no longer letting yourself be manipulated by feminine wiles.<br><br></div>
