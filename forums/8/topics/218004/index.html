            <div class='col-md body'><br>Zeno came to that conclusion--that motion was an illusion. In that, I would say he is correct. But Zeno did not, to my knowledge, come to that conclusion concerning the state of rest. Perhaps motion is not fluid but discrete--like frames of a film running in chronological and rapid sequence which produce the illusion of motion. So all objects can only exactly occupy the space they occupy (i.e. they are at rest) at any given instant and therefore have no space in which to move. Likewise, the "instant" we refer to can be infinitely refined but there comes a point in which the object has no time which to move, in which to act. The object is then annhilated in the next instant only to be replaced by a very similar but not exactly identical replica. Each succeeding instant gives rise to an extremely rapid succession of these spatial/temporal replicas that we then intrepret as a single object in motion.<br><br>But this interpretation has a major flaw, if events occur in slices of space and time in which there is no time to act or space to act in, how does one then discern motion which is, in fact, an act--the act of discerning? How does discernment occur where there is no space or time in which to act? It cannot and yet it undeniably does.<br><br>So what is motion? To have motion, we must have a body to be placed in motion, space for the body to traverse, and the motion of the body. If you take away one, the others cease to be intelligible or to have value. But are mover and motion separate entities? The mover the object and the motion the transitive attribute? The motion is nothing more than the object itself. Motion is unintelligible without a mover. But are motion and the mover the same? How then do we distinguish them? How can we NOT distinguish between an object in motion and an object at rest? Motion is neither identical to the mover nor separate from it.<br><br>A body in motion is nevertheless at rest at any given point-instant of its motion. It divides space into that which has already been traversed and that which has yet to be traversed. There are no other categories. There is no space being traversed to place in between the other two because that is merely where the object sits at a state of rest where it does not have the space to move. What gives space any distinction at all between that which has been traversed and that which is yet to be traversed is the arising of motion itself.<br><br>Yet, how does motion rise? When does a body begin to move? When it is moving? No, it is already moving. When does it START to move? Before it is in motion? No, because it is not yet in motion. When does a body BEGIN to move? When does the motion arise? It doesn't. But that is not to say that motion doesn't arise because then we could not distinguish space and matter which are intelligible only when motion completes the trinity. Motion arises and yet it doesn't.<br><br>Just as there is no category of "space being traversed" there is no point at which motion arises--a body is either in motion or it is not.<br><br>So, as Zeno postulates, there is no motion only rest? No. The same critique applies to rest as applies to motion. When a body in motion ceases its motion and comes to rest, at what point does the body BEGIN to rest? When it stops? No, it is then already at rest. When does it BEGIN to rest? Just before it stops? No, it is still in motion then. When does it begin to rest? It doesn't. And yet we distinguish a body at rest from one in motion and so there must be moment at which rest arises.<br><br>Moreover, if there is no motion, there is no rest and vice versa. One exists only by being differentiated from the other. One without the other is unintelligible. Without an independent existence, neither state can be said to be intrinsically real.<br><br>Therefore, motion AND rest are illusions.<br><br>sounds like it</div>

I think it means is that there is no definite number of sets you can obtain by assigning the points. For example, 1 set of points is that from point A to point B has 3 points in between. Another set could be 5 points in between. And another would be 123 points in between and so on till infinity number of sets. It is the number of sets that is infinite and not the amount of points in between. Because, for every set, the number of points are fixed.</div></blockquote>but I think calculus is able to derive a larger "picture" by the infinitesimals because the infinitesimals themselves are not actually 0. However this paradox brings up the issue of moving from one "point" to another, and a single "point" as we know it has no spatial dimensions. I'm just not sure whether we can say each point is not arbitrarily identifiable because it has no spatial dimensions. If affirmed, then moving from 1 point to the nearest point would indeed take 0 time because the distance covered is 0.<br>which makes me question how is it related the the "sets" u have mention<br><br></div>
