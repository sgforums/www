Doctors, nurses and hospital personnel whom are most worthy of praises for saving lives have now became the main target by some selfish and thoughtless individuals. This group of people should conceive a situation without the commitment and precious devotion of these health workers. Although it is every SingaporeanÂ’s responsibility to take precautions and safety measures to guard against the bug, I strongly urge the public to be compassionate and sensitive to them as they struggle with their work daily despite their personal pain and sacrifices. I hope that we as fellow Singaporeans will support and cheer them as we stand united in this crisis.<br></div>
