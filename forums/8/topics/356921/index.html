            <div class='col-md body'><p>Once upon a time a tortoise and a hare had an argument about who was faster .<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>They decided to settle the argument with a race. They agreed on a route<br>and started off the race.<br>The hare shot ahead and ran briskly for some time.<br>Then seeing that he was far ahead of the tortoise, he thought he'd sit under<br>a tree for some time and relax before continuing the race. He sat under<br>the tree and soon fell asleep.<br><br>The tortoise plodding on overtook him and soon finished the race, emerging as the undisputed champ.<br><br>The hare woke up<br>and realized that he'd lost the race.<br>The moral- "Slow and steady wins the race. This is the version of the<br>story that we've all grown up with."<br><br><br>THE STORY DOESN'T END HERE<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The hare was disappointed at losing the race and he did some<br>soul-searching.<br>He realized that he'd lost the race only because he had been overconfident,<br>careless and lax.<br>If he had not taken things for granted, there's no way the tortoise could have beaten him. So he challenged the tortoise to another race.<br>The tortoise agreed. This time, the hare went all out and ran without<br>stopping from start to finish. He won by several miles.<br>The moral - " Fast and consistent will always beat the slow and steady.<br>It's good to be slow and steady; but it's better to be fast and reliable."<br><br>THE STORY DOESN'T END HERE<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The tortoise did some thinking this time, and realized that there's no<br>way it can beat the hare in a race the way it was currently formatted.<br><br>It thought for a while, and then challenged the hare to another race, but<br>on a slightly different route. The hare agreed. They started off. In keeping<br>with his self-made commitment to be consistently fast, the hare took off and<br>ran at top speed until he came to a broad river. The finishing line was a<br>couple of kilometres on the other side of the river.<br><br>The hare sat there<br>wondering what to do.<br>In the meantime the tortoise trundled along, got into the river, swam to the opposite bank, continued walking and finished the race.<br><br>The moral - "First identify your core competency and then change the<br>playing field to suit your core competency."<br><br>THE STORY STILL HASN'T ENDED<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The hare and the tortoise, by this time, had become pretty good friends<br>and they did some thinking together.<br><br>Both realized that the last race could<br>have been run much better So they decided to do the last race again, but to<br>run as a team this time.<br><br>They started off, and this time the hare carried the tortoise till the riverbank. There, the tortoise took over and swam<br>across with the hare on his back. On the opposite bank, the hare again carried<br>the tortoise and they reached the finishing line together. They both felt a<br>greater sense of satisfaction than they'd felt earlier.<br><br><br>Moral of the story: United we stand.</p></div>

              <p> </p>
              <p>It was felt that "united we stand" was ideal and work pretty well for the both of them. but as time goes by, the hare felt that he had did all the dirty job of running and carrying the tortoise throughout the journey and the only job that the tortoise did was to carry  him across the river.</p>
              <p>The hare decided to abandon the slow tortoise and hire a boatman instead and kept on winning</p>

              <p>Having learned his lesson from the hare, it was said that the tortoise who was abandoned, hired dogs to do all the running or him. He began to believe that if he pays the dogs well and above the market rates, all his dogs will happy and not be corrupted. He began to pay his predigee rates comparable to CEO of multi-nationals.</p>

              <p>Once upon a time, 3 friends, a hare, a tortoise and a centipede, were having beer at home when they ran out of beer. All three were too lazy to out and buy some more beer. They decided to draw lots and centipede ended up as the one who has to go to the shop just downstairs to get the beer. After 20 mins, centipede still did not return. Hare and tortoise were getting impatient. Another 10 mins passed and still no sign of centipede. Hare &amp; tortoise decided to go down and look for centipede. When the opened the door, they saw centipede still putting on his shoes!!</p>

              <p>Once upon a time, chicken had six legs and snake and dragon belongs to the same family that slide to travel. Then when the buddha called for the animals to race. The dragon badly wanted to win the snake as both could slide equally fast. So the dragon secretly approaches his good friend the chicken to borrow 4 legs from it and promised to return the legs to the chicken after the race.</p>
              <p>Finally the dragon manage to outrun the snake and won the race. But after the race, the dragon refused to return the legs to the chicken. So that's hy chickn is lft only with 2 legs.</p>
              <p>Moral of the story? You have been short change. You sould have 6 chicken dumping instead of 2</p>
