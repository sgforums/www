              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>Yes, this is Nikar3 and since my ID was banned (more on that later), I've decided to register a new ID under this "Nikar444" (it wasn't Nikar4 due to me typing too fast and ended up as "444").</p>
              <p>First of all, let me try to clear my name and say that "N!kar 3" isn't me.</p>
              <p>It is a cruel joke by some mongrel I offended (don't wanna name names here), and to get rid of me, they were so unscrupulous and despicable to register a fake name impersonating me and got me banned. My 1100+ over posts are all gone now. Not a problem at all, since I never bothered about post counts (although some folks here feel proud of their HUGE post count achievements).</p>
              <p>Hey, whoever you are out there, you won! Er, no......I don't wanna resort to such lowly and dirty tricks myself, thank you.</p>
              <p>Most of all, FireIce......well, I have since lost all respect for her.</p>
              <p>You know what? When a forum member alerted me about the fake me, also known as "N!kar 3", I posted a clarification thread trying to explain it wasn't me. Imagine how much damage this mongrel can cause to me just be impersonating my ID.</p>
              <p>What did FireIce do when she read that post? She locked it at once.</p>
              <p>And when I PM her, no reply. Not a surprise, though, since she must be very busy.</p>
              <p>Suddendly, N!kar 3, that fake me, created a topic about Brunei and Sing exchange rate, and she assumed it was me, and BANNED ME without checking! I've been here since 2004 and have been PM-ing some members here on a frequent basis! WTH?</p>
              <p>As Coolgeek84 puts it here in this thread ( <span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.sgforums.com/forums/8/topics/367103</span></span> / last post on first page) :</p>
              <p><em><strong>lol.. TS self pawned.. Bravo.... But poor Nikar 3, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">if indeed
                                          n!kar 3 is not a clone then I pity Nikar 3.. lolz.. And if FI
                                          banned him, then I got no respect for her too.. haha</span>.. Oh oh.. wait
                                          a second.. cannot say that rite? Else she will ban me.. *rolls
                                          eyes*</strong></em></p>
              <p>And some of you guys out there are not really as analytical and smart as I have made you out to be. Ditzy? Brunei and Sing dollar?! I've mentioned some weeks long ago that even though I don't know where to buy LG USB cable for my phone or what's the GST rate, at least I knew the exchange rates of foreign currencies. How could it be that I delibrately make such posts?</p>
              <p>Yes, I have angsty views and drastic opinions sometimes, but I don't go around trolling like some guys here. Just because opinions differ, you guys are so small as to keep mobbing me?!</p>
              <p>What you gonna do now, Mrs. Iressponsible "FireIce" Moderator? Ban me again?!</p>
              <p>Lock this thread? Oh yes, that's what people like you are most talented at, right?</p>
              <p>Thanks for reading. I just had to get this out or I just feel very uncomfortable inside.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And if you've a problem with me, stand out here and we talk things out. We put out problems face to face and discuss it like real humans do.</p>
              <p>Don't resort to lowly gross tricks such as impersonation. That's not what your parents taught you, I'm sure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks,</p>
              <p>Nikar (Nikar, Nikar2, Nikar3, but NOT "N!kar 3")</p>
