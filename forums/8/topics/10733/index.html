Some of the gays are really huge big fellow like those we saw on Tv WWF,wreslter.But too bad they act like sissy.There goes their image of Aronld or vammm dammn.<br>These are some of the views.I hope that u all can join in and speak up your stand.Stand leh buay steady la 4 your rights,<br>and sit down to relax 4 your minds.That all i have to say....hope to hear from u ...soon<br><br>------------------<br></div>

No scientists dare to say where AIDs came from. One of the earliest proof of AIDS came from a Roman female corpse, but that doesn't mean AIDs came from Italy!! Others speculated AIDs came from Africa. But at any rate, I wonder where you got your "AIDS-originated-from-India" idea.<br><br>Second point - AIDs not equal gays!!!! That is the old 70s misconception where people thought AIDs is a gay disease. It is not. AIDs is mostly spread through herterosexual activities. Gays got the blame because they were outcasts of society; people fear the abnormal, and they fear the unknown. Thus it is convenient for them to accuse gays of propagating the disease when it is the regular virile guys that did it.<br><br>And who says lesbians can't get AIDs? As long as there is exchange of body fluids (excluding sweat, urine, saliva, tears) through bodily membranes, transmission is possible.<br><br>Dun anyhow 'how hsiao'.<br><br></div>
