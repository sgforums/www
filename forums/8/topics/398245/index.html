              <p>During the last weeks me and some other participants tested whether we could tell difference between Newater and tap water. The survey concluded that we actually were able to tell the difference in more than half of the cases.</p>
              <p>Interestingly, we also believe we found that the taste of Newater depended on the given bottle. The taste seemed to differ a little between two bottles, sometimes. This could perhaps have something to do with which factory the water is produced in/which area the water originates+++ We are really not sure, any suggestions will be thankfully accepted.</p>
              <p>In addition, we also found the water quite descent, much better than many of the bottles you can buy with water from lakes here and there, swampwater etc. Can this mean that when Newater goes for export, it can be advertised as "luxury water", in the same manner as some types of mountain spring water? That would be really sumting!</p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>There was a documentary I saw years ago. In the west coast of America, the water of Colorado River was recycled. If I remember correctly, by recycling the used, dirty downstream water thru cleaning and pumping it back into the upstream river. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>This way, they can have a continuous flow (recycle) of water.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Many years later (I believe, it was more than a decade later); they discovered that the fish population dwindles and dwindles. This, despite, everything they did to rejuvenate the fishes.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Finally, they did some comprehensive studies. They found that American women were consuming birth control pills and somehow traces of these pills found their way into the waterway. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Over the years and thru the recycling process, accumulated and contaminated the eco-system. The fishes were, literally, fed on diet of birth control drugs.  </span></p>

              <p>Are you really sure? I believe US "Newater", along with most european producers, use gammarays and/or strong chemicals to "purify" the water in addition to reverse osmosis. It tastes either little or nothing, or has a chemical taste.</p>
              <p>Newater is not like that, actually minerals are added, giving the water an even better taste while keeping some of the local "flavour" also (i know it sounds disgusting, but it is supposed to be totally harmless). Today a new plant opened in Changi, which will use water from the eastern part of town. For all I know this may actually turn out to be yet another taste.</p>

              <p><br>You make it sound so disgusting and brutal.</p>
              <p>I dont think it is fair to call Newater "shit", as the "shit" has been degraded severely and all that remains is water and "flavour molecules". Most of the undigested proteins, fats and carbohydrates are removed, or used for anaerobic degradation or sumtin like that.</p>

              <p>a green future is part of the sustainability concept and this is vital towards saving the Earth...the barriers have always been the high initial investments which many companies, at times of current recession, would be quite refrain to do so...</p>
              <p>newater has gone through many trials to come to its current stage...but it would be more useful for commercial and industrial purposes where large gallons of water are used for building, construction and landscapes...so far new pipelines linking to newater should be in progress to all businesses....this would be an applauded efforts in water conservation....</p>

              <p><br>Well, actually I dun think it is the pureness (if by pure you mean as little other compounds than water present) that makes it suited as a good blend. I`d say its opposite.</p>
              <p>100% pure water is just water, what gives different types of water different flavour/taste (which is the basis of their "net worth"/popularity, so to say), is actually the presence of <em>other compounds than water</em>, which can be interpreted as <em>lack of purity</em>.</p>
              <p>I think it is here newater outcompetes many other brands. Try for yourself - some bottles can have a rthr sweet taste, while others have the "forest-like" taste. Imagine this simple fact as a frontier for their ads. Other water brands tasting like paper or plastic can consider themselves crushed under the heels of newater....lol! =D</p>
