Look at that incident where a grp. of malays beat to death a fellow malay biker. Aren't they all muslims? Also, during NDP, there was fireworks and I saw malay youths, drinking beer and all while waiting and touching their girlfriends, and even sticking their hands up their blouses in public. Next the fasting period was just over, i had muslim frens who knew they were supposed to fast, but they didn't and on top of that...when we went to a pub after work, the 2 of them wanted to follow, and drank whiskey with us. Lastly...the thing which irks me most, is when there's work to be done, they eat snake, say have to go mosque pray. I mean, we usually schedule our meetings from Mon to Thu, and if its Friday, its usually around 3, though we try not to because we would rather be out on a Friday after school. Can the muslim forumnites here educate me, if its necessary for you to visit the mosque everyday?Because when I told them off about their work attitude, they said I'm racist, and don't respect their religion, WTF rite?<br><br>Thanks,<br>SpecOps87</div>

For me...I'm born into a Buddhist family, but when people ask me I will tell them I'm a freethinker and make a joke saying that I'm a cheapo cuz by being free, i'm free to be blessed by all the higher beings. I listen and learn from others religions, and I refrain from commenting on them. But sometimes...people go overboard about it.What to do?</div>

Some are from fairly well to do families but can't give a damn to whats happening around them. And given that they are in their late teens or early adulthood, they have a choice, and are to make sound judgments on their own. For your explanation, it seems that if you break the law because your upbringing is unsupervised, than your parents should do your time or serve your time with you.<br><br>Correct me if I'm wrong, during the fasting period, from sunrise till sunset, our muslim friends are not supposed to eat, drink, smoke or indulge in pleasures of the flesh, yes? Than tell me, why do I see them doing just that? And the last one about pleasures of the flesh, was done openly and freely in a park? Isn't there some Islamic law that prohibits close proximity between a male and a female that are unwed?<br><br>Lastly, yes, the ruse of using religion to escape work got so bad, I had to make an attendance sheet for the whole team to sign when we have project work meetings. Or have submissions at night. Because this guy told me that he has to go to the mosque at night, when we are all rushing our projects for submission due at 0900hrs the next morning. Tell me is that required? I'm very against the fact that people use religion as a reason to escape their duties or to reach a certain agenda. Tell me whats the difference between him and Osama? Both bend religion in the way they deem fit so that it will suit their needs and meet their agendas. </div></blockquote>That is why I put the word usually.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>And I agree with Tiggerific, muslim in name but not in practice.</div>
