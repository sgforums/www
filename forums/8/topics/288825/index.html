            <div class='col-md body'>only people with limited mindspans and a generalized perception of people's social behaviour would think this way, be it muslims or non-muslims.<br><br>say by accident, u serve a jewish man and a muslim man pork. both WILL react the same way. Its just that because in S'pore, the majority of the muslims are malays and it is well known that they are associated with Islam so  by nature they will react to a certain level of anger when faced with any thing they perceive as being anti-muslim (i dont mean tt in a bad way, (like a non-halal bistro or not enough mosques etc.  get wat i mean?)<br><br>anyway, try put a muslim in a place like Canada (this is based on the personal xperiences of ppl i noe) or any other country where the majority of the ppl are non-muslims) u think they will react the same way when prob faced with a 'muslim problem'? In a predominantly jewish town, u serve pork, the ppl will over-react. in a city where islam is the religion for a race of ppl making up the 2nd most highest pecentage of the population (and also with the fact tt singapore is considered 'muslim-friendly') , the ppl will over-react.<br><br>add in sensitive feelings like 'im a muslim, got a problem wiv tt' or 'muslims r overreacting' and a little 'im misunderstood and i deserved to be treat equally', and the 'issue' will be blown way outta proportion.<br><br>about the 'im a muslim got a prob wiv tt', if i recall correctly the jews of USA have also faced wiv a similar difficulty, esp after WW2...and i remember someone telling me in the past, they also faced alot of problems bcos of their religion..like having 2 wear yarmulkas(jewish 'songkok'), being diff, being misunderstood etc.  i think its just ongoing pressure and stuff like dat...these kinda things may seem trivial but it takes a certain kind of...i dunno, maturity 2 understand.<br><br>HUMAN NATURE. sole reason, nothin else.<br></div>
