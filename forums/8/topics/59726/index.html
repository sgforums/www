Things have turned out as planned.<br><br>Next step: 'Don't tell her you love her yet. You have to stretch the suspense a LITTLE longer. Wait until she kisses you on the lips then confess. Otherwise DON'T tell her yet. But be a little more assertive in terms of actions: you can try holding her hands and see her response (but don't rush it!).<br><br>It's best that you create opportunities for her to take the initiative to start all the intimate actions (i.e. kissing and hugging etc). You will get much more satisfaction than initiating it.<br><br>However, remember after 2-3 actions from her, you MUST reciprocate with an action (kiss /hug/ whatever) to show that you are still interested in her. Otherwise, girls will take it that it's a one-way love and will back off.<br><br>In courtship, it's always 3 steps forward and 2 steps back (Paula Abdul's 'Opposites Attract' song). Take it a slow and steady and you will see progress. Never rush!<br><br>Good Luck!<br><br>*Think I should start charging for such consultation services.. hehehe.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">*<br><br></div>
