Shouldn't the parent be worry that their son pick up bad habit in camp like smoking, gambling, drinking beer and vulgar language and hence be protective over their son? Would you as a parent accept the fact that your son came home from camp shouting "FU*K YOU" at his sister during weekend? What's with the ill-treatment comparison when both situation are totally different?</div>

If given a choice to avoid NS, would most parent do so?? They have their alternative to migrate for the sake of their son's future. it's 2.5 years you are tokking about. Within this time frame, your son could had gotten his degree from oversea and started working and competing with those expatz on equal ground for top position.<br><br>You said they forget instructors not shaping them into model sons but model soldiers? you mean cheap labour? Their son career going to be in the army you mean?

Why not you send your son for another round of ns and be even more proud of him. Even thought by the end of that 2nd round ns, he still didn't sign on, you still can be proud that your son had done 5 years of cheap labour for the government. Not bad right? You are answering the government call when they are panicking due to lack of cheap labour in ns you know? Great accomplishment for your son.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
