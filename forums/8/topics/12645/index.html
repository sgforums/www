There are also poly grads and other private degree holders in NS who pass out as sgts.<br><br>A lot of our training methods are "lifted" from other country's doctrines. Vulgarity is merely part of serious training. Such words are usually used only if trainers want recruits to take their orders seriously.<br><br>It's unlikely that vulgarities are rampant in SAF, not yet anyway. There is a code of conduct even for specialists.<br><br>And oh yes, there is proper training and experienced officers and comdrs to train recruits; but then again, wat is considered good enuff training? Wat's good to someone may not be good enuff for u. It's subjective and open to speculation. No system is perfect, and hence we deal with wat we have as best as we can.<br><br>In short, vulgarities DO NOT ruin the image of SAF...if that's the case, i guess the US Marine corps can go suck nucks yeah?</div>

You must have forgotten that SAF NS is conscripted and hence the culture most likely will not be changed. The point is no wonder how much pple disapprove of NS, nothing will be changed. The only way is to change your own path for yourself or your son.<br><br>And think of it this way .... those who are garang soldier, expert with weapons, armoury etc will be those who will get the sales in ?????  ... those people right at the top..... so if you think a battle or a sale can be won using Fu*k you, Chao Ch** bye...... I think you are also not realistic ..... There are cases of simple guy holding a simple clerk position winning sales over in the outside world compared to a officer who thought he's still on top of everyone. Think about it. Is your performance in the SAF a measure of your working capability in the outside world?</div>

If given a choice to avoid NS, would most parent do so?? They have their alternative to migrate for the sake of their son's future. it's 2.5 years you are tokking about. Within this time frame, your son could had gotten his degree from oversea and started working and competing with those expatz on equal ground for top position.<br><br>You said they forget instructors not shaping them into model sons but model soldiers? you mean cheap labour? Their son career going to be in the army you mean? If so, yes it will be worthwhile. if no, isn't it a drag to local guy?</div>
