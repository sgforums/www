He felt that he was the one who brought this chinese woman to a PR status, give her a good family, worked hard to save for children future, then his wife(the mother) started to betray him while he worked day and night driving. She started to flirt with rich boy/men, towkays, handsome guys etc etc.<br><br>So in the fit of his anger, he wanted revenge, he wanted to hurt this woman back for the rest of her life, he took the stupid act of killing her daughter borne from her first marriage in China. He is damn stupid, this happened to alots of Singapore guys, it just that most never take drastic action at what he did.<br><br>China Chinese have long embraced communism, and it still live on in most of the people, communism do not take relationship emotionally, the culture tends to be very much self centre, so they do not really treasure about husband and wife relationship, on average by 16, most gals hv lost their virginity, by 30, most have married once if not twice. The cohesiveness of family from the taught of confucianism is lost, so like it or not, they can easily forget tragedy and live for another day. What this bus driver wanted to achieve is to make his wife suffer for the rest of her life in thinking of this tragedy, but I dun think so. He shall pay his life for it.</div></blockquote>u tell me tis for wat ?</div>
