              <p>the problem with sg guys are they are very scare of getting rejected, i think singapore guys are grown and nurture or pampered in a way of success in everything, of course they can have good career or score well in studies, but to girls, they are hopless, and reject to them is like a big failure which they feel is like getting a D or E in their grades, that is wrong. Once i reject a guy and his mother can call me up to ask for any chance of me accepting his son, because he when into depression for a month, and that worry his dear mommy. I went to his house and settle the problem.</p>
              <p>Unlike my taiwan native guys, they are more open to rejection, and that make them more willingly to go after girls, to taiwan guy, as long as the girl is not engaged, he has all the right to go after her even if there is only slim chance.</p>
              <p>As a girl perspectives, i think sg guys need to buckle up on relationship and take as a give and go kind of relationship.</p>

              <p>No, the trouble is that most girls are educated, which means they have much higher expectations. A guy cant just be a good guy. He also has to be...(add lots of criteria) Attractive girls are too in demand, and there are very very very few attractive girls who a decent good girls.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are so many attractive girls who do slutty things like taking nude videos, nude photos and posting online, or photos in bras and panties. Great for guys to perv at, but shows the girls is very self centred and a slut.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good thing is that it helps to eliminate the undesirable ones</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Most attractive girls are definitely not a good girls- one who is friendly to all, smiles naturally, doesnt judge others by job, bank account, number of friends etc. Most of them judge and dont give 99% of guys the time of day.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for the person who said guys are too shy etc, I've approached girls before, and let me say that firstly, I have almost never found an attractive girl to be single- ie available, and secondly, since they judge extremely quickly, I rarely even get 2 seconds before they make "that" face. Approaching is only a small reason- again, they have this long list of criteria which they make snap judgements on.</p>

              <p>the problem with sg guys are they are very scare of getting rejected, i think singapore guys are grown and nurture or pampered in a way of success in everything, of course they can have good career or score well in studies, but to girls, they are hopless, and reject to them is like a big failure which they feel is like getting a D or E in their grades, that is wrong. Once i reject a guy and his mother can call me up to ask for any chance of me accepting his son, because he when into depression for a month, and that worry his dear mommy. I went to his house and settle the problem.</p>
              <p>Unlike my taiwan native guys, they are more open to rejection, and that make them more willingly to go after girls, to taiwan guy, as long as the girl is not engaged, he has all the right to go after her even if there is only slim chance.</p>
              <p>As a girl perspectives, i think sg guys need to buckle up on relationship and take as a give and go kind of relationship.</p>

              <p>No, the trouble is that most girls are educated, which means they have much higher expectations. A guy cant just be a good guy. He also has to be...(add lots of criteria) Attractive girls are too in demand, and there are very very very few attractive girls who a decent good girls.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are so many attractive girls who do slutty things like taking nude videos, nude photos and posting online, or photos in bras and panties. Great for guys to perv at, but shows the girls is very self centred and a slut.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good thing is that it helps to eliminate the undesirable ones</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Most attractive girls are definitely not a good girls- one who is friendly to all, smiles naturally, doesnt judge others by job, bank account, number of friends etc. Most of them judge and dont give 99% of guys the time of day.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for the person who said guys are too shy etc, I've approached girls before, and let me say that firstly, I have almost never found an attractive girl to be single- ie available, and secondly, since they judge extremely quickly, I rarely even get 2 seconds before they make "that" face. Approaching is only a small reason- again, they have this long list of criteria which they make snap judgements on.</p>

              <p>now society different. but inlife there are more goals thanjust girls and fashion. anyway ot os better if people have this kind of mentality. they thus have weaker mind. i am just glad i am from another generation. for the years ahead in a modern society it is better to have a stronger soul and mind to forge the way ahead. for i foresee tthe newer generation will need a strong fabric of the brain to even exist.</p>
