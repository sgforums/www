              <p>the problem with sg guys are they are very scare of getting
              rejected, i think singapore guys are grown and nurture or pampered
              in a way of success in everything, of course they can have good
              career or score well in studies, but to girls, they are hopless,
              and reject to them is like a big failure which they feel is like
              getting a D or E in their grades, that is wrong. Once i reject a
              guy and his mother can call me up to ask for any chance of me
              accepting his son, because he when into depression for a month, and
              that worry his dear mommy. I went to his house and settle the
              problem.</p>
              <p>Unlike my taiwan native guys, they are more open to rejection,
              and that make them more willingly to go after girls, to taiwan guy,
              as long as the girl is not engaged, he has all the right to go
              after her even if there is only slim chance.</p>
              <p>As a girl perspectives, i think sg guys need to buckle up on
              relationship and take as a give and go kind of relationship.</p>

              <p>@itchyarmpit: i have to agree with you, but if they were to ignore to this extend after rejection, don't you think they are pretty <span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 17px; line-height: normal; white-space: pre;  ">immature? Even if they get together, i doubt they would last long. Of course </span></p>
              <p>there are guys who fail to respect the girls decision. Unless the guy stalks the girl 24/7, i don't think there is a reason for the girl to avoid the guy.</p>

              <p><br>Most Singapore guys really cannot take a rejection and they don't know how to move on after a rejection. On the other hand, Singapore girls also don't know how to repair and restore the friendship after the rejection so that to make it easier and more natural for the guys to move on after the rejection.</p>
              <p>But some guys are really born super duper irritating, they don't understand feelings cannot be forced and neither can be it reasoned or explain with logics. Love is an emotion, so how can they continue to believe that they can change our minds by being persistent enough?</p>
              <p>If there's no feelings and attraction, it simply means there isn't any real feelings or attraction. It's so simple as that, and it doesn't means the guy is not handsome enough, not rich enough, not helpful enough, not persistent enough, not close enough. It's simply because we know that guy isn't the right guy for us and we reject him. Of course there are occasions where we know that guy isn't the right one but we still gave him a chance and try and ended up fail in the relationship.</p>
              <p>The right guy will still need to meet up with the right girl, or should I say the right girl need to give the right guy an opportunity to go after her.</p>
              <p>Then maybe there will be more peace in this world if we all know how to reject each other and help each other to move on.</p>

              <p>I personall think there is still a large majority of Singaporean girls who are good. Pretty or not thats another issue. But if you do not mind too much about looks, it shouldnt be too difficult in getting a decent pleasant looking girl. The only thing is that Singaporean girls (who are of a grown up age) would see bread and butter issues more important than pure love. Most, including myself, would of course want a guy that would at least be able to support us in future. I am not saying the guy must be rich, but he must be at least able to provide the minimum.

              <p><br> Most Singapore guys really cannot take a rejection and they don't
              know how to move on after a rejection. On the other hand, Singapore
              girls also don't know how to repair and restore the friendship
              after the rejection so that to make it easier and more natural for
              the guys to move on after the rejection.</p>
              <p>But some guys are really born super duper irritating, they don't
              understand feelings cannot be forced and neither can be it reasoned
              or explain with logics. Love is an emotion, <span style="color: #ff0000;">so how can they
              continue to believe that they can change our minds by being
              persistent enough?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">they watch too much drama</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>If there's no feelings and attraction, it simply means
              there isn't any real feelings or attraction. It's so simple as
              that, and it doesn't means the guy is not handsome enough, not rich
              enough, not helpful enough, not persistent enough, not close
              enough. It's simply because we know that guy isn't the right guy
              for us and we reject him. Of course there are occasions where we
              know that guy isn't the right one but we still gave him a chance
              and try and ended up fail in the relationship.</p>
              <p>The <span style="color: #ff0000;">right guy will still need to meet up with the right girl</span>, or
              should I say the right girl need to give the right guy an
              opportunity to go after her.</p>
              <p>Then maybe there will be more peace in this world if we all know
              how to reject each other and help each other to move on.</p>

              <p>Is there really a right girl/guy? We seem to believe in waiting for that fairytale to materialise for us; what if there is someone who is always beside you quietly supporting, but you never notice him/her? When we finally give up on our fairytale search we come to our senses and realise all the nice people around you have been taken up...</p>

              <p><br>I believe there is a right person for all of us and it will happen as long as you believe in it.</p>
              <p>And it doesn't means the person couldn't be someone next to you or someone far away from you.</p>
              <p>The ONE is referring to the person who is ready for you subconsciously and but you are not able comprehend it consciously somehow but you do know or desire the person subconsciously (like dreams, thoughts).</p>
              <p>Fairytales are also stories derived from real-life experiences.</p>
              <p>The person who gave up their dreams of searching for and meeting the ONE, certainly don't deserved to meet their ONE and of course will NEVER even realise even if the ONE were around them all the time.</p>
              <p>Love is like a dream indeed, you want to fall deeply into it and wished that you'll never wake up, cos you know the moment when you're awoke, you will be alone.</p>
