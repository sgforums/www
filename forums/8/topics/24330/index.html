            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large">Screw him. Althought I don't like Singapore. But selling whatever Singapore have cost money and time to give you, is not respecting Singapore. You may say it is a profitable to sell, because you had lined up for some time. How much will you sell? I know it wouldn't be cheap.<br><br>Another case, Singaporeans wanted the goodie bag only. Whats the big deal?? one big bag, with some food, 1 light sabre, heart-shaped light, magazines and vouchers. It doesn't cost even $10. And I know you are going to sell it for $5 - $30 each. In that cast, why don't we buy our own goodie bag and stay at home watching?<br><br>Dun misunderstood my ideas, think about it. I am going to sell something I get for free. It is alright.. but you sell something that other people wanted badly but can't get it. Like for example, 1 poor guy waited for few hours for the ticket and he can't get it. When he came home and log on to sgforum, and found that someone is selling it. He email the person and realised that he can't afford it. In fact, he should get it for free if he is given the chance. Do you think it is unfair? people had lined up for so long too and can't get the ticket. and you are the lucky ones who got the ticket and sell it for high price? Think twice. You are selling your own pride and Singapore's Respects.<br><br>1) You sell your pride because you are thick face to sell something that everyone haves the chance to get it free.<br><br>2) You selling Singapore's Respects because you do not even think about the consequence you had made. Singapore give you free because it is national day for Singapore. And you had made numberous of Singaporean citizen unhappy about your motive.<br><br>To our prospect, everyone should get the ticket. We had paid Taxes to the government. In return, The government had uses the expenses and time that they had provided to 'Few' of the Singaporeans who had recieved the ticket. But what now?? Someone trying to sell the ticket! This is our efforts!! We gave government taxes and government uses something to overwrite it. you should now either accept the ticket or give off the ticket if you still have some dinity. Many of the citizens had already paid their taxes and now paying more just to get something they can get free but they are unlucky.<br><br>Again, we revise the topic. the affectivity of this illegal selling will cause great corruptions. DO YOU KNOW YOU CAN START A RIOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE TICKET??<br><br>-My speech ends,<br>-Sukoru Reonhato Lucifer, </span></div>
