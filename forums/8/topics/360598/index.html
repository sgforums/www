              <p>there's no point lowering the bar, since the local uni can only take in limited number of people.</p>
              <p>so if there are indeed so many people with better results than you, no matter how low the standard or cut-off is you also won't get in because all the uni places will go to those students who have better results.</p>

              <p>Well, it is true that diploma holders have an advantage over "A"-lvl students due to experience, but you must know, some of the "A"-lvl students are like eagle, sponge lai der.</p>
              <p>You put them in a pail of knowledge, they will soak everything up VERY fast.</p>
              <p>But to your credit, eagle admits he does a fingering job with good pay, and even have time to chat the whole day, hehehe...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for candiz, what you say is very true, but as you probably know, some "A" students with triple C, and in rare cases, even worse, manage to get a place in uni, whereas many poly guys/gals with 3.6 couldn't even get in.</p>
              <p>Personally, I will argue that these poly graduates have the experience which SHOULD have given them an edge in getting a place, but priorty is given to JC students instead.</p>
              <p>People argue that JC students are no better than sec school students if they cannot make it into uni, but this shouldn't be the reason why majority of the places are given to JC students.</p>
              <p>Poly students have worked very hard for at least 3 years to get their diploma in their specialised field, a place in the uni shouldn't come as a giveaway, but some of them INDEED have the passion to work harder despite their shortcomings, hence they should be given a chance to prove themselves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The reason why I recommend lowering of the bar is because I can see for myself many students who have worked hard for their diplomas end up being punished for their 'small' mistakes here and there. Unfortunately, the GPA is not a end of year exam, but a built up of effort, hence every little thing counts.</p>
              <p>Honestly speaking, it is not really about the amount of total space in uni, but the amount allocated to poly graduates. Some fine-twitching will need to be in order if you ask me.</p>
              <p>Even if that is not possible, how about having entrance exams for poly graduates? It will be silly to do the same for "A"-lvl students, since they most probably doesn't even have ample basic knowledge of the course they are entering, but for poly grads, they could use this chance to work hard and prove themselves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Back to the two new unis again, having more unis isn't a bad idea, but the quality of the uni does matter a lot. Indeed, the main branch might be an outstanding uni, but these 'foreign branches' might not be as good. This is worrying me, consider that more poly graduates are able to enter these unis than the local unis.</p>
              <p>But once again, I guess we will have to wait and see. You never know when the foreign unis may just decide to cancel the project or move it somewhere else due to costs issues.</p>

              <p>Ok firstly, calm down dear. Secondly, you talk mainly about design stuff. Well of course an A level holder will not have the 'hard skills' in designing work because JC has not taught it. this doesn't mean they would be able to learn the hard skills at tertiary level. and I can only think of design being one of the rare fields that a diploma holder might have an edge over the A lvl holder. For others, like law, well you HAVE to go to Jc.</p>
              <p>And also, is the institute open solely to poly grads only? or can A lvl holders apply?</p>
