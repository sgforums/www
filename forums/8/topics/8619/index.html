            <div class='col-md body'>Suppose there is a frog living in a well with few other frogs, many of them feel that they may not leave the well ever or even if they do, they may live...in yet another well.  Therefore, they do not care to know about the seas, the oceans and the mountains.  They talk about well things and read the well newpaper which is full of well happenings such as <strong>one</strong> promising well frog who has passed away (and ignoring greater happenings outside such as frogs in some mountains getting massacred by <strong>hundreds</strong>)<br><br>Is there something wrong with this way of thinking?  After all, if there is no desire to ever get out of wells, it is only too practical to learn about well and forget about everything else beyond wells?  So what if frogkind doesn't grow intellectually?  It will be the problem of future generation frogs and well, so far, no frogs have been hurt by the lack of general knowledge (except when trying to pass pretentious froggy exams where most frogs have learned to pretend that they care and they argue about mountains as if they know what mountains are all about).<br><br>Then, finally, that's frogs, who care about frogs, we are human.  And as the song goes, "we are singapore.....", is it healthy for Singaporeans to pay attention mostly to Singapore happenings if as far as we can imagine, the African racial clashes have nothing to do whatsoever with our wellbeing?</div>

Is life onli about whether it's a sunny day or a cloudy day today? is that it? surely you coem to the point htat yoiu grow bored and lack the drive to continue living.

If you are not aware of the concept of "fun", how can you be aware of "boredom"? There wouldn't be any basis for comparison in the first place. It is the constant desire to attain a certain something that you do not have that gives rise to frustration.<br><br>Mayajade, let's look at it in terms of individuals. Ideally every individual should provide a helping hand to another individual in need, even if there are no tangible benefits from doing so. However in reality, resources are limited - you have to prioritise how they are spent. The natural tendency is to commit these resources into something which we have vested interests before we spend them on causes without any justifiable returns.<br><br>How many of us can really put helping others before helping ourselves? I'm not talking about the sort where you donate $100 to charity. I'm talking about helping someone else at the expense of yourself, requiring painful sacrifices from you. You will not find this happening very often in the increasingly materialistic society. This is the way of the affluent nations too.<br></div>
