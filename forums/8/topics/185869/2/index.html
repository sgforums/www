Coz they should have personal pride?<br>Basically, it is a job. They are paid to do their job. Personal pride and responsibility states that if you are paid for your time and effort, then you should be responsible to attain that level of standard, since that was what you agreed to when you accept a job.<br><br>If every single service provider gives an excuse of bad service coz no one appreciates, I can fully understand why Singapore's service is so unacceptable. Go to USA, Go to Japan, their customer service level is so good, even though you aren't buying anything from their shop. Why? Coz they have personal pride and responsibility.<br><br>And Singaporeans like to complain so much about not being appreciated. Is that an excuse for bad service? I think everyone should do some soul-searching. Be professional. Do your job properly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think that is why the problem lies. Is that we think becos they are paid to do a job, they should maintain a certain standard and so WE DO NOT have to appreciate them for that basic standards shown.<br><br>You wanna tok about places like Europe or USA? The service staff over there I must admit is first class. And why is that so? Were they born with better manners than Singaporeans? Nope. That is because, service personnel like even waiters are treated by employers and customers as PROFESSIONALS. They felt important and naturally felt proud of their job. Over here, you should know how people look upon waiters or service personnel...anything but a PROFESSIONAL. If we do not treat them as professionals, how do we expect professional service from them?<br><br>Also, smiling and courtesy is a very critical part and basic standards of service personnel. And just because it is BASIC, you do not have to APPRECIATE THEM for it? In any job and also in YOUR JOB, i believe the basic requirement is to do fulfill your responsibilities and do your job well. THESE ARE BASICS. But would not it be wonderful and boost your morale if your boss or even customers tell you "WELL DONE" for submitting your monthly report on time or for making sure that the filing is being properly done.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, towards Singaporeans, salesman attitude are worse when compared with tourist/angmohs/etc.<br><br>Don't you guys feel guilty? When you work in say Supermarkets as cashiers, or work as salesman, whatever. The way you talk to foreigners, compare it with the way you talk to our fellow Singaporeans. How many of us here will say that "Oh nono, my attitude is all the same!"<br><br>We're pictured with Singaporeans = Kiasu/Kiasi/Budget/Cheapskate. No offence. I am a Singaporean myself and that is a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General</span></strong> picture I see in our Singaporean Society.<br><br>Let's put it this way, it will definitely make me happier to serve Singaporeans with the same attitude if I experience nice stuffs from them but obviously no.<br><br>I worked in Cold storage during my "after-O-Level" days. Basically when you come across foreigners asking for expensive fishes, 10/10 cases, no one will secretly put the "PACKED-ALREADY" fish which you have cut into some unknown fridges in the supermarket and pretend it isn't theirs. As for Singaporeans, I'll give it a 4/10 case where someone will not put it back. You may ask, how do I know if it is our Singaporean or Foreigners. "I cut the fish, I priced the tag, like duh? Of course I recall the customer's face?"<br><br>It is pretty bad for us, we cut the fish, and you didn't want it. 10/10 times is because of the price. Some of them wanna act big, "oh gimme 5 KG of the fish", cut 5kg for them and in the end they didn't check the price, turns out to be 20+ or something, then hide it at some corners of the supermarket. Till cleaners or manager pass it back to us then we know that it wasn't being bought. This will trouble us and people may not want it as it is being treated as "unfresh". Ultimately my point is, if Singaporeans attitude change, so will Salesman or what so ever change. Even if you're a Singaporean yourself.<br><br>My experience, my 2cents.<br><br>Cheers!</div>

Afterall, they're Not selling food, they're selling CLOTHES.  If any of the items get soiled, you're Not gonna be held responsible for it, SHE is.  Besides, it's quite common &amp; also basic etiquette that drinks &amp; food are Not allowed inside retail shops?<br><br>Anyway, I think being gracious Not only improves a service staff's day, but our own too when they give us an appreciative smile for the effort we put in to make their day.
