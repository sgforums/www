You mean u like it when you do ur job, nobody compliments you, but jumps on you the moment you did not do it?</div></blockquote>I dun like it, but that comes with the job. Ultimately, if you cannot/will not do what you have been paid and what you have agreed to do, then perhaps it is time for a career change.<br><br>On the point of customers having a part to play in fostering a good service culture, yes, i agree. But that seems to be another topic altogether. Nothing in the Orig Poster's words suggests that they have been unreasonable.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After reading the threads in this topic, me like to ask a question:<br><br>How do we define the 'basic' standard of service? Everyone's perception on service are different. Some has high expectations, some has average, but how do we gauge?<br><br>Very often we took service for granted and it's a must. In actual fact, service  is a two-wayed flow, you give they show, they give you show. As Singaporean, we don't have the culture in showing appreciation and often we just grumbled that we ain't been taken good care enough. But how about changing positions in a moment of thought? Me believe that there are some black sheeps in all trades and industries, but they are only a minority. Yet we use this minority as a backlash and views as the problem.<br><br>When me trains and teaches my students, me always instil in their thoughts that 'customers ain't always right, what right is that you are doing what you've been taught, trained and performed.' Me encourage them to look on themselves and do self-reflections every day by thinking of a few points:<br><br>"How do I wanted to be served?"<br>"Am I ready to serve?"<br>"I want to give my best in serving!"<br><br>Another point me like to touch on is that we kept complaining that these servers in the service industries are not doing their job, especially in the sales. Very true that we need to give service in the industries, but think of the fundamental point in their job: Are they employed just to give service? They are employed by the companies to bring in revenue and sales, that's their job. They have to ensure that, and secondary to their job will be service.<br><br>Of course with GEMS movement, our focus on service is emphasized. And in a likely alignment, most companies adjust their core business focus with the incorporation of service factor. Still, we have a long way to go. Countries like Japan and Hong Kong, service is already a culture that comes naturally. We can do it but it's going to take quite some time before we reach the cultural point.</div>

Where did we get this mentality that customer is king and can do what she likes?<br><br>Recently, I took a call from someone who bought an defective product imported by my company. I offered to replace the product even though it was either the retailer's fault or he got it from a dubious source - he was unable to name the retailer. Still, that guy was not happy. He straightaway asked to talk to GM, demanded compensation and threatened to take the matter to CASE. At that point, I raised my voice, ticked him off good and ended the call.
