            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by gasband:</div><div class="quote_body">Consumers play a part too. Ask yourself when was the last time u reward a courteous service personnel with tips or a complimentary letter or even a simple thank you. I dare say many consumers take GOOD SERVICE for granted and complain when given bad ones. Ask yourself first, what have you done to deserve GOOD SERVICE? Just because you are a customer? Anyway I am not in a service line but i believe I made that fellow's day when I say thank you for clearing the table at the hawker centre or when i wrote an email to the HQ to compliment an excellent staff at Esso Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim. What have you all done?</div></blockquote>There is another view to this. When you join the service sector, what does this signify to the customer? It signifies that you represent customer service, you represent the company's policy of good customer service. Therefore, when a customer enters a shop, most will have that basic expectation to the service. Providing good service does not equal customers must praise the staff. It means that the staff has probably fulfilled the expectation and nothing more.<br>Providing excellent service, yes, then the customer should praise the staff for exceptional performance.<br>Basically, what I am trying to say here is, no one forced these people into the retail service sector. If they choose to go in, then they should have a certain level of service. Attaining that level of service does not mean customers should praise this person, since that is the minimum expected of the staff anyway. Attaining something further (such as going out of the way to ensure a customer is happy) is something else.<br><br>Example of good service: bus driver smiles, greets you, friendly. Nothing more (this is basic standard, which most drivers don't even meet)<br>Example of excellent service: I once boarded the bus and my gal fren was on the other side of the road already. Then I realized my wallet is with her, I said sorry to the driver and alighted hurriedly, rush across the road to get my wallet, not expecting the bus to wait. In the end, the bus driver waited, and even smiled and said it was alright when I re-boarded the bus. That was excellent service and I commended him to SBS.<br></div>
