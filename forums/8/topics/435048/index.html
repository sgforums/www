              <p>I doubt the government has much say in universities. Polytechnics have their syllabus closely monitored by MOE. Universities pretty much do whatever they want. At least that is the case with the CCA branch in my uni, versus that in the poly. We pretty much run everything the way we want, while poly students have to answer to the school for almost everything.</p>

              <p>I doubt the government has much say in universities.
              Polytechnics have their syllabus closely monitored by MOE.
              Universities pretty much do whatever they want. At least that is
              the case with the CCA branch in my uni, versus that in the poly. We
              pretty much run everything the way we want, while poly students
              have to answer to the school for almost everything.</p>

              <p>i think that this kind of management is only suitable for up to secondary sschool. In tertiary educational institutions, the staff and the student body should have a voice so that neither one becomes tyrants.</p>

              <p>Oh I see. Honestly, I have no idea whether it can genuninely be
              set up in polytechnics or not. I am only providing my observations,
              and I think it will be hard to get approval for setting up such
              clubs in polytechnics.</p>
              <p>Simply put, I believe political clubs can have a presence in
              schools, but not form an official affiliation with polytechnics.
              Somehow this makes me think of politically-related student
              riots.</p>
              <p>All in all, I think it is a cool idea. Good luck trying to get
              it set up though. =)</p>

              <p>haha, but there will be at least one lecturers attached to the cca and he would be able to prevent this crap. besides, they are students afterall, they would not do such things that could potentiaally get themexpelled.</p>
