              <p>btw, what dumbfuck will not take a wallet when he/she sees one.

              <p> I suspect the reason why they didn't pick pocket the wallets is becos, the wallets were at the bottom of the purse! And naturally the phone sits on top of it.. Maybe that's why</p>

              <p>If you are really almost certain, then dont have any doubts, be more assertive, use your physical force. Grab his hand, restrain him, and take his bag or whatever to look inside. Also search his body and the pants pockets etc.</p>
              <p>Be more assertive because when a theft took place, somebody just declared war against you. You need to step it up and be more violent.</p>
              <p>But remember the key word....."if you are almost certain"</p>
              <p>The key is also to watch the person you suspect. If he show any sign of nervousness, especially when u ask him, that is confirmed.</p>
              <p>Remember these steps....because it is likely you will encounter something like this again...whether it is wallet, or HP, or something else.....it is bound to happen again in the future....and u need to act fast.</p>

              <p>Yes of cos. Problem is I am not certain. The friend that saw that guy who bent down is not certain either. That's why we're kinda' restricted. The 2 friends who lost their phones actually went to confront the couple.</p>
              <p>Friends : "Did you see our phones?"</p>
              <p>Couple : "If we see it, we'll tell you"</p>
              <p>I've no idea why my friends actually ask that but I thought it was pretty obvious they won't admit if they were to be the thieves. If I know and SAW who took it, I'll just confront immediately. If the thief doesn't wanna comply, I'll kick his ass.</p>

              <p>sorry but nowadays thieves are smart. Hmm I really don't think my friend drop her phone. Like I've mentioned her purse is the twist to lock and twist to unlock kind, it's already close to impossible that the phones were to drop out. If the contents in the purse where to drop, the purse should be opened when she reach for her phone?</p>
              <p>My friend was high, dancing... and if someone were to TOUCH her purse, you think she'll realise? I think if I were to touch her waist, she won't even feel anything.. let alone her PURSE?</p>

Like I've mentioned her purse is the twist to lock and twist to unlock kind, it's already close to impossible that the phones were to drop out. If the contents in the purse where to drop, the purse should be opened when she reach for her phone?</p>
              <p>My friend was high, dancing... and if someone were to TOUCH her purse, you think she'll realise? I think if I were to touch her waist, she won't even feel anything.. let alone her PURSE?</p>

              <p>ok... u have a point. her purse wld've been opened. it must suck to suspect someone and not be able to confirm your suspicions.</p>
              <p>wld it be better if ur fren had jus insisted tt he saw the couple pick up the phones? (even tho he didn't) and informed the bouncers? at least tt wld've warranted a search... of course, if u can't find the phones, u wld have to really apologise to them... :/</p>
              <p>i tink when such things happen it's better act quickly and ask for a search to confirm it? at least u might get ur things back, and u wld've prevented others fr having their things stolen as well.</p>
              <p>fr another point of view, have u considered tt maybe the malay couple left hurriedly cos they were freaked out by u and ur friend? personally, i wld be freaked too if two guys came up to me randomly and insisted tt i had stolen smth fr them...  </p>
              <p>jus a thought, in case a similar incident happens... dun confront the pple directly, but go straight to the pple who have the right to search. and have ur suspicions confirmed.</p>

              <p>yah... in fact not only in clubs, wherever you are, you always have to be alert and more sensitive towards your belongings.</p>
              <p>We did inform the bouncers and we told them who we suspect took it. The couple was already nowhere to be found after my friends confronted them and by the time we inform the bouncers n securities, they were gone. There was little I could do for my friends but to comfort them.</p>
              <p>In fact, I didn't agree what my friends did (confronting the couples). Esp when they aren't even 101% sure they are the culprit. I mean, I wouldn't want to cause inconvenience. Clubbing supposed to be a fun thing. I wouldn't want mine to be destroyed either.</p>
