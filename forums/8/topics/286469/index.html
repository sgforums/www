            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I went to Zara Ngee Ann City yesterday and wanted to buy a business shirt..after a long time, I took a $89.90 shirt go fitting room try it out..it is Medium size..I try liao but sleeves too long..so I go try Small instead..but again, sleeves is too long..somemore their shirts very funny, only can choose size but cannot choose sleeve length..so it's like even if the shoulder is just nice, sleeves too long/short, you also LAN LAN..<br><br>So I asked one of the staffs there: "Do you do alteration for sleeve length if it's too long?" The staff said: "Yes, we do provide alteration service. Usually you can collect your shirt after 5-7 days." Then he added: "But you will have to pay $10 for the alteration service."<br><br>I hear liao I immediately SIAN JIT BUA..WTF is this?!?! Pay them to alter it for me? I go some of the other shops outside, buy liao ask them alter also FOC..I think alter Topman shirt's sleeve length is FOC de..<br><br>I was damn pissed already..so I asked the staff why need pay..then he say is because Zara don't have in-house tailors so they have to out-source it to tailors outside and they have to pay the tailors and in turn we have to pay Zara..this is ABSOLUTE RUBBISH..<br><br>THREE reasons why I say it's absolute rubbish:<br>1) I have to pay for alterations just because Zara Singapore does not have<br>their own tailors? What has this got to do with me? It is not MY<br>problem that Zara Singapore does not have their own tailor, so why<br>impose extra charges on customers for alterations? Is it customers'<br>fault that Zara Singapore does not have their own tailors? No. So why<br>do we have to pay?<br><br>2)  Zara's business shirt only have sizes like: S, M, L, XL. There is<br>no measurement for sleeve length, so I can only choose from 'S', 'M',<br>'L', 'XL' etc. Even companies like G2000 has measurements for sleeve<br>lengths for their business shirts. So when Zara Singapore does not<br>give ME a choice to choose different sleeve lengths, they SHOULD be<br>prepared to do alteration for me and WITHOUT a fee! It is not as if I<br>am given a chance to choose my sleeve length, so if I can't choose my<br>sleeve length why do I have to pay when I request Zara Singapore to<br>alter it for me? It is THEIR fault and not MY fault that the sleeve is<br>too short/long for me. So Zara Singapore SHOULD have the COURTESY to<br>alter it for customers FOC.<br><br>3) I am prepared to pay $89.90 for the shirt, not $8.99. A shirt that is<br>this expensive, and I still have to pay for alterations? I can get<br>cheaper shirts outside and still get free alterations!<br><br>Zara's clothes are nice, but their services aren't..deeply disappointed this time round.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

The staff said: "Yes, we do provide alteration service. Usually you can collect your shirt after 5-7 days." Then he added: "But you will have to pay $10 for the alteration service."<br><br>I hear liao I immediately SIAN JIT BUA..WTF is this?!?! Pay them to alter it for me? I go some of the other shops outside, buy liao ask them alter also FOC..I think alter Topman shirt's sleeve length is FOC de..<br><br>I was damn pissed already..so I asked the staff why need pay..then he say is because Zara don't have in-house tailors so they have to out-source it to tailors outside and they have to pay the tailors and in turn we have to pay Zara..this is ABSOLUTE RUBBISH..<br><br>THREE reasons why I say it's absolute rubbish:<br>1) I have to pay for alterations just because Zara Singapore does not have<br>their own tailors? What has this got to do with me? It is not MY<br>problem that Zara Singapore does not have their own tailor, so why<br>impose extra charges on customers for alterations? Is it customers'<br>fault that Zara Singapore does not have their own tailors? No. So why<br>do we have to pay?<br><br>2)  Zara's business shirt only have sizes like: S, M, L, XL. There is<br>no measurement for sleeve length, so I can only choose from 'S', 'M',<br>'L', 'XL' etc. Even companies like G2000 has measurements for sleeve<br>lengths for their business shirts. So when Zara Singapore does not<br>give ME a choice to choose different sleeve lengths, they SHOULD be<br>prepared to do alteration for me and WITHOUT a fee! It is not as if I<br>am given a chance to choose my sleeve length, so if I can't choose my<br>sleeve length why do I have to pay when I request Zara Singapore to<br>alter it for me? It is THEIR fault and not MY fault that the sleeve is<br>too short/long for me. So Zara Singapore SHOULD have the COURTESY to<br>alter it for customers FOC.<br><br>3) I am prepared to pay $89.90 for the shirt, not $8.99. A shirt that is<br>this expensive, and I still have to pay for alterations? I can get<br>cheaper shirts outside and still get free alterations!<br><br>Zara's clothes are nice, but their services aren't..deeply disappointed this time round.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </div></blockquote>Typical SG whinner.... Not happy don't buy. I don' think their company policy is unreasonable!</div>
