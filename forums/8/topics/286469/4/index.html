I get free alteration service and even if I need alterations in the future, they alter it for free and as many times as I like.

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't recall many stores having shirts with differing lengths just for their sleeves... It depends on the cut of the shirt, and where the shop comes from... European stores like Zara make their shirts in relation to the avergae European, which is probably taller than most asians... So when their clothes come into Singapore, it seems like the sleeves might be too long, and have to be altered...<br><br>And why not pay to get it altered? Just because other places do it for free, doesn't mean its a given across the board.. The company might have their reasons for charging... Sometimes, those in-house tailors are their own staff, who have large numbers to do, and might rush with the alterations.. sure, you don't pay for the alterations, but you might end up with slipshod workmanship... Rather than be the usual Singaporean and complain about it, thinking everyone owes you a living or something.. why not give it a try? Spend that $10, let them alter for you, then if the workmanship isn't better or you feel its still not worth it, then don't buy from them... Sometimes, free things aren't always better...<br><br>If you want better quality, better service, please be the kind of customer who deserves it, and not the kind of customer who thinks that they are entitled to it...<br><br>I can't really comment much on other stores, I personally prefer Raoul when it comes to business shirts... esp when its their warehouse sales.. lol...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

U find their alteration service too ex, then bring it out elsewhere and get it altered.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm actually i don't see any prob with ZARA charding for alteration.<br><br>It's like how prices of the same item can be different in different brances of NTUC simply because of LOCATION and different fixed costs like the cost of rent in different places.<br><br>ZARA is from spain and although I guess most people would like them to have in-house tailors here but I can understand it if they choose the "franchise" method to open shop here to push their clothes to singapore without increasing costs like having to hire a full time tailor.<br><br>Having an in house tailor would probably increase their costs and lead to higher prices for the clothes ANYWAY - except that you won't SEE this cost because it will not be charged separately. Likewise, when you pay for the clothes from G2000 for example, the entire price of the garment INCLUDES the cost of the in-house tailor - regardless of whether you use the service or not.<br><br>Basically, every company has its costs and all costs will be factored into the final price of the product. ZARA is expensive but generally this is because they are from Spain and the cost of setting up a branch so far from home is expensive - driving costs up.<br><br>Example: If McDonald's tomorrow decides to decrease the price of all the value meals by $1 you would cheer and be happy right? But on the side they would tell u that because the value meals are now cheaper, if you want chilli sauce or wad sauce is 10cents each to cover the cost of reducing the value meals.<br><br>in the long term if this is permanent, someone will go online and complain like this:<br><br>"McDonald's sucks.... it's absolute rubbish that I have to pay for chilli sauce when Burger King and KFC and LJS and every other fast food outlet gives it for free. I have to pay for the sauce just because they cut prices on the value meals? What has this got to do with me? It is not MY<br>problem that McDonald's decided to do that, so why<br>impose extra charges on customers for chilli sauce? Is it customers'<br>fault that McDonald's prices its value meals close to making a loss? No. So why do we have to pay?"<br></div>
