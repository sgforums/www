              <p><br>Korean are fierce pples, they dun hv much courtesy as the jap and we do, they are rough pples, they can go riot, fighting and shouting as normal as we chit chatting here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another thing is that they are very co-operative among themselves, they protect themselves within their own gangs very well. We are more individualistic, that is where we lose out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Once in America, i was having lunch and a group of korean tourists came in and occupied my good seat like nothing is happening, then i went to the toilet, omg, they take turns and make sure all of their gang who need go toilet get in first before i get a chance. Rude and selfish they might be, but i admired their team work.</p>

              <p>There's a diff between North Koreans and South Koreans.</p>
              <p>South Koreans are more refined. They are civic-minded, gracious, hygenic and orderly, unlike most S'poreans. If a seat or table is reserved, they will never take it, or even flash a wad of notes (thinking that money talks) just to get the seat/table. </p>
              <p>North Koreans are more chor lor. The N. Koreans will sit with one leg up like ah beng.</p>
