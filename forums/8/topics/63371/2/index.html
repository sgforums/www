The food was all ready liao, the smell was terrific.  She was sure he'll like the food.  She prepared all his favourite stuff.<br><br>Then it was 6.30 liao, the bf still not here yet.  Nmind, mebbe peak hour traffic dats why he is late.  So she started to go the bathroom, and arrange he hair nice nice.  She even spray a bit of perfume.<br><br>7.10pm.  Sun just set, sky's getting dark liao.  Her bf still not here.  She'll starting to be a bit sian, the food getting cold liao.  She's starting to be a bit angry, even though she knows it's not nice to quarrel on an anniversary night.  She picked up her phone and sms her bf, telling him if he dun come within 10 mins, she's not going "give him" tonight.<br><br>7.45 liao.  Sky all black black liao.  She could see the other chalets already having their bbq.  some are families, some are friends.  They're all having fun, chatting and playing.  Some look over at her, wondering why she has all that food out there, but is all alone.  She look at her phone again, no reply msg.  She tried calling her bf phone, but nobody pick up.  She left a voicemail to scold him, she's really pissed liao.<br><br>8.30pm.  She dowan to sit outside liao, ppl look at her until she paiseh liao.  She went in, sat on chair.  She phoned him again, no answer.  So she sttod up, and went to sit by the bed.  She stare at the path outside hoping the bf will appear, but he didn't.  She stand up again, walk around a bit, and call him again.  Still no answer.  She started to be very worried liao.  Could something have happened to him?<br><br>9pm liao.  She called his office, the security guard ah-pek said he saw him leaving at 5pm liao.  She got very worried liao, so she called his house.  His sister picked up the phone, then told her she hasn't seen him this morning.  But before she hung up, the sister said he called back just before eight, saying he won't be back tonight, don't wait for him.  The ger felt a bit better now, mebbe he had to go entertain client last minute wif boss.  She decided to wait a bit more for him.<br><br>10pm liao, most of the other ppl's bbq finish liao.  She was thinking whether to bring the food in or not.  Sikarli now then he arrive, still got time to eat a bit.

She's feeling all confused right now, she's angry at him for being late, but worried wat's happened to him, yet also sweet that he's putting in so much effort.<br><br>Suddenly the phone rang, and she ran to pick it up.........<br><br>******************<br><br>The next day, the ger was found dead in the chalet.

            <div class='col-md body'>There was an error in the first post, stating that the 'woman' is a 'girl'. Well, no wrong for her gender, but certainly gives people the impression that the said victim is a 'young teenage girl', which is not true.<br><br>She is at athe age of 32, if I'm not wrong, and is an insurance agent.<br><br>The whole episode can be seen as this: she was supposed to be meeting her LOVER. Not bf, or friends or other people. JUST she and her secret LOVER.<br><br>Obviously, it was meant to be a secret intimate event, 'cause presumably, the guy could either be her colleague, or in her case, her Customer. Many such cases are happening, when the client is a Rich, Wealthy man who spends huge bucks on pretty insurance or property agents, and relationships are formed, despite the fact that either one or both parties are married.<br><br>In addition, they coud be facing a break-off also, with the man being the one asking for it, but not the lady.<br><br>Thus, the whole event just turned nasty when he couldn't turn up, leaving the poor lady to face up to her dire state and lots of food.<br><br>Reality sunk in, and pain is felt<br><br>She ended her life there and then.<br><br>Case closed.</div>
