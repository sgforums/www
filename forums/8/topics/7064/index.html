            <div class='col-md body'>Poor LittleMan,<br><br>haven't you learn from your lesson ? NEVER engage in a discussion with the low intellectuals, when they can't have their way ah, they will either call you ugly names or ask you to leave lor. If i did not remember wrongly, Illegal Operation is one of those who you once had a heated discussion with .... kekekeke .... he taking the chance to get rid of you kekekeke .... so smart of him hor. Now you know why so many hate LKY ? Cos he too smart ah sometimes act stupid is good.<br><br>You should not have get yourself engage in the "JC and Poly" thread lah, there are so many poly students here, it is very jia lat for them to know the truth after spending 3 years there you know ? Hence they take it very personally lor, and it is easier to chase away the person who tells the truth than to face the truth.<br><br>Can't people discuss with the brain and not the heart ? Adam&amp;Eve ah, you should not call people names leh, LittleMan gave way to you on that liao and you still rub it in. Wau raoz, I really wonder if our Singapore's Speaker's Corner (aka Hyde Park) can be a peaceful place ..... what if everyone resort to personal attack like Adam&amp;Eve .... hmmm ... chaos<br><br>But LittleMan ah, don't go lah, I tried so hard to bring you back leh, and people like Tommy, iamabird and collette also like u to stay right ?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Belittled (edited 24 April 2000).]</div>
