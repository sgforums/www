But ask yourself this: Are u willing to be a commited pet owner? Keeping a pet is a BIG RESPONSIBILITY. Be it a cat, dog or hamster..its still a LIFE.<br><br>I must confess, i wasn't responisble enough. I used to bring him down for walks daily in my old house. But when I shifted house, there's no longer places for him to run about outdoors (I stay in a busy part of S'pore, heavy traffic ) so i stopped taking him for walks altogether. As a resut, my dog grew fat n unhealthy from lazing around all day.<br><br>Besides, u should take your pet for a checkup at the vet's every half a year. It's to ensure that ur dog is fit n healthy. I didn't do that, and I deeply regretted that now.<br><br>Do not assume ur dog is healthy just because he LOOKS healthy. I've learnt that lesson the PAINFUL way.<br><br>Although I cannot erase the guilt of neglecting my pet dog, I've learnt something from my loss.<br><br>BE RESPONSIBLE...<br><br>OR DO NOT KEEP A PET!<br><br>Thanks for all ur condolences.

They simply try to get our attention by all means (for dogs, its constant barking and whining ). Most of the time, we simply ignore them or worse- beat them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  My dad used to cane my dog when he's a young dog. But we were much more tolerant towards him during his final years. He's a faithful friend...loyal n loving to the end despite how its owner treated him<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
