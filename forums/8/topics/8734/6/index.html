Now there are liposuction, gym, and even plastic surgery.  Singaporeans waste so much money to fund shopping malls like Takashimaya (which has to be expensive to maintain, true???) to buy clothes, shoes and cosmetics, can we forgive ourselves for still being ugly???<br><br>now there is a movement too to validate ugliness.  what is going on, what's so good about retro ... retro... (what do you call a step back, ah?)  retrotract???  we should strive to be clever, to be rich, to be good looking!  doing so is not being superficial, it's achieving perfection, it's an advance, it should come naturally to us.<br><br>anyone?  comment?  please? but. don't. answer. in. short. one. words. or<br>a oneliner that does nothing to this clever discussion.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>naive, who said anything about being tainted?!  why is it so bad to demand physical beauty while it's alright to say that one will only marry a responsible man.  after all, both are transient qualities, even good men can be corrupted just as age can ruin good looks.  also, both have the capacity to keep us happy, why thinking that physical beauty is more important gets us labelled shallow?<br><br>If being ugly is not a sin, what about being pretty?  if it is alright to say that one is ugly, why can't one say that she/he is beautiful without incurring snide remarks?  Thinking of it, it is much acceptable to anounce that you are kind or patient or understanding, and still it is not cool to acknowledge that you think you are handsome.  why?  why?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yes, precisely.  being beautiful does not guarantee guys kissing your feet.  there are people out there who think that other qualities are better than beauty, i am for that but i want to convince them that putting beauty first is not shallow at all.<br><br>why won't you be jealous of someone who's kind?  i am jealous of sweet girls, i in fact did proclaim my hatred for goody two shoes because i knew i could never be like them, hey, i know it's wrong and i did think people who like nice girls were stupid but i solemnly tell you, i have changed my mind.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wah, one vote and I am saying that NG and NKH is ugly??? Hmm.....didn't know the consequence of that vote. Can't really be the judge since I have not seen both in person, so I guess that I have to disqualify myself from voting then,  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>But as they say, beauty is never skin deep. We need not only view beauty with our eyes, because we can too with our hearts. I don't see a halo over Sparkle, but that doesn't stop her from looking like an angel, Maya Marmalade and Tettie honey, needless to say, do not qualify for the simple word beauty too, for they are understatements when used to describe these two chiobabes. Good looks, nice character, pleasant heart, how else to define true beauty?<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

I don't mean to use someone who thinks she's beautiful everyone's salivating over her.  i mean, it's alright if i say i am a patient girl, i am kind and generous, but people will scoff if i say i am beautiful.  why not?  i didn't mean that i am beautiful and all of you should worship me, it's a fact and it's a plus point...much like the characteristic wise plus points.<br><br>well, luckily people have different tastes so some rare occurence like revvy think that i am beautiful while others prefer claudia schiffer (huh? compare urself w/ claudia ah? alamak!).  hmm, i think if a number of people (excluding ur mom and probably lying boyfriends) say you are pretty and you think you are pretty than you are pretty.<br><br>am i talking in circles?<br><br>NG KAI HOE<br><br>sorry for the caps, just wanna attract ur attention and i dun have a pic of my armpit to flash.
