            <div class='col-md body'>You chaps want to talk about ugly???<br>I have lived with that title since the good doctor delivered me from my mother's womb and say a hasty prayer...those that banish evil and protect one self. He thought he had delivered a monster.<br><br>The Elephant Man looked like Richard Gere as compared to me and i looked so hideous during childhood that my mum had to tie a rat around my neck in order to tempt the family cat to play with me.<br><br>I am so ugly during my formative years that the local denigrates shouted to my mum whether it is fun having sex with Swamp Thing whenever she brings me for a meal in the coffeshop.<br><br>I am so ugly that during my primary school days that I need not put on makeup and costume when the class carried out the play "Phantom of The Opera". No prize for guessing who I played. Form Teacher remarked that I gave him a poor name. He definitely looks much better than I do...with the mask on.<br><br>I am so ugly in the secondary school years that the poor school keeper (God bless his poor soul) had a major heart attack when he saw me leaving the school compound after a late night ECA. He thought the devil had came to claim his soul and he was shouting Allah Allah as he ran and ran...before collapsing from the inevitable constriction of the arteries to the heart.<br><br>I am so ugly in my JC years that I had to stuff 100 bucks in my front pocket to tempted some cheap thrills from my female classmates. That year, P&amp;G did a roaring business selling their disinfectants and surprise surprise...their major customer is not the hospital but - - JC.<br><br>I am so ugly in the Army days that I had to sleep in a separate bunk...all by myself. My section complained that they are having constant nightmares sleeping with me together...that somehow my face is the precursor to their dream turned sour. Needless to say, I was excused from the field trip. The OC said that he had enough rumours of ghosts spreading in the platoon and he doesn't want the Medical Centre over worked with fainting soldiers out in the field. Hell...I don't even need the camouflage stick.<br><br>Ugly??? Take a queue number my dear prodigal.
