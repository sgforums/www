            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Maya,<br><br>Looks like I am in too late to debate with you on who is uglier and why sin is linked so closely to facial appearances. NaÃ¯ve prove to be a more adept proponent of beauty is societyÂ’s fault and such. Given the country she is from, we can safety assume that fault can be found anywhere as long as it is not in me! Just kidding naÃ¯ve, just pretty fed up with the American exchange student in my political science class. I can understand that the good U.S. of A is the only superpower left and this is the end of history as far as they are concern and blah blah blah. Great country and all but do go easy on the evangelist tone and you might want to check your humility level. God, I thought only the French were such dicks.<br><br>Sorry for the side tracking there. I believed we are debating if being ugly is a sin and naÃ¯ve mentioned that itÂ’s societies that groom us into such mindset. I tend to agree with her. Civilisation tends to straitjacket humans into social creature and beauty is but one way in which people used as a gauge how far civilisation has come. A Babylonian might condemn his neighbours as barbarians simply because they do not wear fanciful clothes like them and that they did not keep proper facial hair. War and politics aside, Â“proper appearanceÂ” is the norm of civilisation and it is no wonder that major capitals of the world is also the fashion capital of the world. Paris is not the only place that brings us liberty, equality and fraternityÂ…it is also the place where beautiful ladies and handsome gentlemen gather.<br><br>On a more basic nature, it is a well known fact that humans crave beautiful things and it has been since the cavemen collect pretty stones and all the way to the siege of Troy, all because of a beauty by the name of Helen. We can thus assume that since beauty is so desired by humans, it would make the most sense that ugly is naturally consider a sin. Have we ever heard of Attila the Hun and Hitler mentioned as gorgeous men? Age aside, great tyrants throughout the centuries have more or less been consigned a pretty ugly mug. Check out those picture history books if you donÂ’t believe me. While you are at it, you might want to see how they portray those Â“heroesÂ”. Gosh, I had no idea Alexander was such a hunk! Of course, I can see that you do not need looks to be appreciated like Plato and Einstein. However, how many ugly people can profess to have the intellect of those 2 I mentioned above? Does give you some idea if Stalin was brutally traumatised when he was young, having all those little kids at his village calling him pockmarked face and such.<br><br>All in all, society, parents and friends have demanded facial perfection from their loved ones. Perhaps the word demand is too strong, WISHED would have the more appropriate word. Looking good helps in ways that you can never imagine and it is an asset that will hold you in good stead. Starting on a level playing ground, a pretty boy will tends to score more points that his less prettier counterpart. I can hear people calling me shallow and mumbling to themselves looks donÂ’t last and that character is the ONLY thing that count. Well, I wouldnÂ’t deny that, but then again, we donÂ’t exactly look for beauty in old folkÂ’s right? Regardless of how many posturing you might have over this issue, we canÂ’t deny that BEAUTY is definitely an asset. Youth and beauty, ah, the twin pillar of the human locomotive.<br><br>So is ugly a sin? Well, it would definitely make you less Â“equalÂ” and most likely you have to struggle more than your contemporaries in making your mark or living in this world. Makes more sense too, that people often equate lack of beauty with character. After all, if this titanic struggle doesnÂ’t make you a Â“betterÂ” person, most likely nothing else will. Yes, being ugly makes you more at a disadvantage, HOWEVER, it will never be a sin to be ugly. You are not sinfully ugly if your are born with a smart mind or with a sliver spoon in your mouth. Again, if you are just an average ugly, fret not. You will develop something called Â“characterÂ” that will hold you in good stead through life. Of course, as for being recognised for your effort is something else.<br><br>LetÂ’s proceed into the 21st century and see how far the concept of beauty had advanced. The value of beauty has not decrease with time and with more and more R&amp;D devoted to the perfection of the human race, I can safely said that we are no more different from the Romans in wanting beauty. DonÂ’t believe me? Make a survey of what people want to change in them with the aid of genetic biology. Why, the face of course! And while you are at it, can you help trim my ass and less fat off those tights too! We still love beautiful people and dream of being on the same pedestal with them.<br><br>What about being ugly? Well, they didnÂ’t call this the pluralist civilisation for nothing. Everything is special interest nowadays and who have the largest group of members in their association. Nope, not the workers (their century has passed with the collapse of the Berlin Wall). ItÂ’s the union of ugly people. Yes, the average ugly people are sick of being unrecognised for their character and will strive to be identified. Talk about tyranny of the majority! Now we have to tread carefully when we mentioned the U word.<br><br>And what we have now is the manifestation of this subculture. Being pretty is nothing. We must have character and it is much cooler to say I looked like Frankenstein than Calvin Klein model. And those who dare to defy this trend will result in major ostracising from their peer and labelled as show off and lacking of character.<br><br>We are beginning to see a shift about peopleÂ’s attitude to looks. Beauty is still much sought after product, that I cannot deny, but so is her opposite. There are fewer stigmas associated with being ugly in this age and have we perhaps reached equality in looks?

            <div class='col-md body'>Sure, there are disadvantages for being ugly, as stated above by hata.  But there are also disadvantages for being beauitful.  Such as, unwanted attentions, jealousy among peers, being label as a snob and such...<br><br>Did we reach a equality looks? Maybe, it seems so on the outside, but is that what we really feel?!  Indeed it's cooler to say that you look like Frankenstein than a Calvin Klein model, but ask yourself deep down inside, "would you rather have the look of a model than Frankenstein?" of coz rt?!  I mean, who doesn't want to be pretty?  Are we really humble when we claim to be?<br><br>Why is it not correct to admit/say that you are beautiful?  Because of the reactions of your peers.  1) they will think that you are rude, for not being humble (when the majority of the people are humble and you are not, then you are considered an outcast.  Just like when the majority of the people are adverage looking and you are above you get extra attention) 2) you are actually undermining the judgement of people. (when you say you are beautiful,  peers will feel insulted.  If you really are beautiful you will make a statement without having to open your mouth.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, is being ugly a sin??? This is actually very much dependent on a person's attitude towards being ugly. Edison or Einstein would never even bothered if they had the face of the Phantom, but for people who are used to beauty, I guess even having a red hot chilli pimple might be sinful, hehehe.......<br><br>Anyway, Naive mentioned society in this, and all I can say is, isn't beauty itself defined by society as a whole??? And as it is, you are either pretty or you are not. Lying in between will mean nothing. People like to see things in black and white, even when the object in question is grey, they would try to determine if the grey tends more to black or white. Humble or not, there will be the next concern on whether or not you will be ostracised (is this the spelling for it, lazy to check), for trying to be special. We have all been taught that humility is a good thing and being proud is bad. So we are normally careful when making such statements in fear of being judged by the watchful eyes of people around.<br><br>Aiyah, tired liao, will go on tomorrow.....zzzzzzz........<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

We are born with our looks, and to judge a person on something that is beyond his/her control would thus be deemed shallow. Character traits, on the other hand, can be moulded. Nobody is born to be a mean and inconsiderate person, we can choose whether we want to be the nice guy or the bad guy, which is why it seems more ok to describe yourself based on character traits, rather than based on your looks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Finally, the 1000th post, I did say i want to write something special to me because these 1000 posts contain a mixture of my deep thoughts, triviality, anger, joy, sadness, naivete and undeniably a large investment of time.<br><br>I am glad I've been here, I've told everyone else that I almost have no friends in the Uni or in my old hall but it's so easy to get along with you people, maybe because I can only see your words here.  It has been very fun exchanging all those posts with you and I have learnt a number of things, not only of human nature but also some new knowledge, points of view and delightful writing style.<br><br>I notice something too, except for 1 person, whomever said "goodbye" always ended up posting again in some future (dig dig).  I won't say anything then.  You'll see me in ICQ, you can call me if you have my number, and I'll still love going out with you.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Au revoir</span><br></div>
