            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Azurewind:</div><div class="quote_body">That local workers who work at the tertiary sector give bad service to the locals, and give better service to the foreigners. This is a severely overrated statement.<br><br>Has anyone thought about how the local people treat them? How demanding they are?<br><br>I personally work at Sony, being 16 and a part-time staff. I don't give preferential treatment to ANY of my customers.<br><br>Just today, a customer, who ATTEMPTED to buy a particular item, raised his voice at me. For what reasons, I have no idea. At our shop, the policy is very simple. Pay for the item, we'll test it(cameras, laptops, televisions and videocameras)for you and upon request, we can skip the testing. Other products are NOT tested. If there's anything wrong with the set, bring it down to the main branch at Orchard Road. Otherwise what's the warranty card for?<br><br>This customer, requested to test the item BEFORE payment. I refused. Reasons for refusal: The item until paid for, is still our product. If the customer tests the newly opened product, and at the last minute refuses to purchase, how are we to sell the set as it is already opened and tested? Is it fair to tell the next customer:"Oh we've tested it, product is definitely working"<br><br>Payment by credit card from my knowledge is only complete upon the owner's signage on the receipt to acknowledge the purchase, if otherwise, the transaction can be void.<br><br>In my situation, the receipt was printed, in our shop, there's another written receipt that we write down so as to keep track of models sold, and for the customer to present the receipt as a proof of purchase should anything happen. He stopped me from writting the written receipt. He demanded that I test the product, but he hasn't signed the printed receipt. This means, the product is not owned by him yet.<br><br>I refused to test the product, he asked why and was kindly referred to my boss. To which I don't know what words were exchanged. He came back, asking to check again, this time raising his voice towards me. At this point of time, my mind is registering: "What the f**k?! Did I offend this son of a b*tch?" He repeatedly raised his voice to demand the product to be tested, and demand that I do not start on the written receipt.<br><br>Concurrently, my colleague seeing this happen, told me to void the receipt. I didn't. I replied to the customer, albeit in a loud manner, that I'd test the product while his friend, said blatantly: "They just want your money"<br><br>With all due respect, this product which he have opened without my acknowledgment, is a sign of disrespect not only to me, but to our shop. Should he as an ADULT whos is in his late forties to mid fifties be tainting the new product with his fingerprints without paying for it, be doing? This mind you, is a LOCAL customer. Already taking advantage of me being younger is not enough, raising his voice is over the God damned line.<br><br>Is this how an adult should behave? And people are writing to newspapers complaining about the local services here? This is reasonable? This is fair? Most people in Singapore, though my native country, have become too selfish to realize their own mistakes and not spare a thought for others. It appears that most acts of kindness in our country today are just false facades to save their own pride. </div></blockquote>You were not wrong....but you were not fully right either. In service line, it is not just doing what is right, but doing what is satisfying. You have the core knowledge in your work, policies and product knowledge - that is a good thing to be proud of.<br><br>Using these values, you need to apply and adapt it to suit your customer. Your policies are standard, all-encompassing but your customers, like yourself, are unique and have different requirements and understanding of what 'good service' is during 'their days'.<br><br>So how to bring both objectives together - helping push your products and brand name, and matching customer's satisfaction? For one, being a hard-nose/head/d**k won't help.<br><br>Sony is not selling low end gra-and-go electronics like those in NTUC or Carrefour so there should be some premium, in price consumer pays, quality of products, and in service.<br><br>With your caliber, I am sure you will go far. Speak to your manager/supervisor and see if the team can come up with a plan-B for such scenario.<br><br>Sharing my experience:<br><br>I once wrote off Sony products because having bought some many items over the years, some were truely quality products that last and outlast, while others were lemon. In the end, I went for its competitor and became a faithful  supporter.<br><br>One day, my old Sony Cubic Micro Hi- Fi bought 10 years ago broke down. Instead of buy a new set, I sent it in for repair. I wanted to salvage it as I love the look, quality and sound so much. All new hi-fi don't seem to match up to it...<br><br>Deep inside, I was telling myself how stupid I was cos 'Sony is going to chop a n arm and leg of me because 10 year old parts is more ex than a new set, idiot. Sucker'! But you know what? The repair came in less than $200 and the service dude at Sony Bishan was pro (england not powderful but pro nevertheless). I walk out a fully satisfied customer and renewed supporter of Sony!<br><br>Now, due to cost cutting and mass-production, there might be lemons among the apples but the entire process made my shopping experience enjoyable. I feel that it's worth the time and effort.<br><br>Azurewind, you are an ambassador of Sony and getting too politically correct will not help. Some old farts will be stinky. Dun take it personally. They are not there to hurt you. They just wanna buy and fark off. Learn to 'mold' them positive by your service and endearing offers to help.<br><br>The hard part is to write a book on what good service is. Also, if your top is crap, you might be crap influenced too.<br><br>All the best!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After reading the posts on the first few pages here, I've concluded the solution below would be fair to both the providers and the consumers.<br><br>1. Provide a test set that is identical to the actual product for the consumer.<br>2. If the consumer likes it and wish to purchase it, then pay for it.<br>3. The consumer should then get the actual product and conduct another test on it on-the-spot - and not bring it home to test. If there is any defect, or in any way considerably different from the test set, he/she should explain to the provider and request for an 1:1 exchange, obviously. If nothing else, just say "thanks", give a smile and leave the shop.<br><br>So a diagram of the above would look something like:<br><br>Test -&gt; Pay -&gt; Test Actual -&gt; Smile and go<br></div>
