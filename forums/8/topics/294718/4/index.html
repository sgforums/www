            <div class='col-md body'>Seems like we all got different views on this.<br><br>On the point by the TS, i feel that since it's company policy, then u should abide to him unless u ask ur supervisor/higher authority for permission to test it first, then u will be able to overwrite company's policy and u should have asked ur supervisor/boss to stay with u throughout the whole transaction.<br><br>On the point about Ang Moh's are better customers than us Singaporeans. Here's the reality, most Sgreans come to the cashier with a black face. 1 in 4 smiles at u and gives u the cash properly with 2 hands, while others just throw on the table. Ang mohs tends to be better customers due to the fact that they do "trash talk" to u and when u greet them, they greet u back as well. They have a smile on their faces and they take ur greetings warmly. Bcoz i'm working as a sales assistant also, i encounter all kinds of customers. Typically Sgreans come to the counter, ask for discount, throw the money/card on the table, get the reciept and leave. There are rare cases of good customers but i see an improvement with each passing day. thats y i said 1 in 4.<br><br>Regarding the car deal written by Beggar, u questioned pple buying a car but have u bought one urself? Sure you know that u have to make a deposit first, get a loan from the bank to settle the remaining payment each month b4 getting ur car? then the car will be deliver to u? Yes u are right that we test the car b4 we buy it just to check the performance, but the test car is just STRICTLY for testing only. About the part of driving the car out of the showroom when u buy it? LOL, thats bullshit! 100%!!<br><br>So u are saying dealers also have to abide what customers want? Dealers also need to protect themselves. What if customers keep coming in to test new products, open it and test then don't want to buy? So every product will become used products? Yes both consumers and dealers need protection, different things have different policies.<br><br>So let me tell this to all customers/cashiers alike, treat someone with respect first before getting it back regardless whether u are a customer that has a right for good service or a cashier that gives out good service.<br><br>With proper respect towards one another, surely things can work out.</div>

This is a severely overrated statement.<br><br>Has anyone thought about how the local people treat them? How demanding they are?<br><br>I personally work at Sony, being 16 and a part-time staff. I don't give preferential treatment to ANY of my customers.<br><br>Just today, a customer, who ATTEMPTED to buy a particular item, raised his voice at me. For what reasons, I have no idea. At our shop, the policy is very simple. Pay for the item, we'll test it(cameras, laptops, televisions and videocameras)for you and upon request, we can skip the testing. Other products are NOT tested. If there's anything wrong with the set, bring it down to the main branch at Orchard Road. Otherwise what's the warranty card for?<br><br>This customer, requested to test the item BEFORE payment. I refused. Reasons for refusal: The item until paid for, is still our product. If the customer tests the newly opened product, and at the last minute refuses to purchase, how are we to sell the set as it is already opened and tested? Is it fair to tell the next customer:"Oh we've tested it, product is definitely working"<br><br>Payment by credit card from my knowledge is only complete upon the owner's signage on the receipt to acknowledge the purchase, if otherwise, the transaction can be void.<br><br>In my situation, the receipt was printed, in our shop, there's another written receipt that we write down so as to keep track of models sold, and for the customer to present the receipt as a proof of purchase should anything happen. He stopped me from writting the written receipt. He demanded that I test the product, but he hasn't signed the printed receipt. This means, the product is not owned by him yet.<br><br>I refused to test the product, he asked why and was kindly referred to my boss. To which I don't know what words were exchanged. He came back, asking to check again, this time raising his voice towards me. At this point of time, my mind is registering: "What the f**k?! Did I offend this son of a b*tch?" He repeatedly raised his voice to demand the product to be tested, and demand that I do not start on the written receipt.<br><br>Concurrently, my colleague seeing this happen, told me to void the receipt. I didn't. I replied to the customer, albeit in a loud manner, that I'd test the product while his friend, said blatantly: "They just want your money"<br><br>With all due respect, this product which he have opened without my acknowledgment, is a sign of disrespect not only to me, but to our shop. Should he as an ADULT whos is in his late forties to mid fifties be tainting the new product with his fingerprints without paying for it, be doing? This mind you, is a LOCAL customer. Already taking advantage of me being younger is not enough, raising his voice is over the God damned line.<br><br>Is this how an adult should behave? And people are writing to newspapers complaining about the local services here? This is reasonable? This is fair? Most people in Singapore, though my native country, have become too selfish to realize their own mistakes and not spare a thought for others. It appears that most acts of kindness in our country today are just false facades to save their own pride. </div></blockquote>i tell u i understand the problem u face cos i also selling electronics good involve ur brand sony also<br>no one will pity u "elite" buying things is like choosing wife.<br>good service no complement bad service complait letter come worst of all<br>a customer call mi : a low class beggar,earn commission is like begging for a living really customer is a ass sometimes</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singaporean instead of thinking of improving services they blame on the ppl. If the Service provider don't take smile back at you do you THINK you have the mood to smile back at them again? But I can't face the fact that most Singaporean have that "You owe me a million dollars" looks or "You have kill my whole family" look.  Regarding about Ang mo being polite so you sales person are polite. Let me tell you this. In overseas, from what i observed. It is ALWAYS the service provider who take the initative not the other way round. But I'm ok with it that i smile at them since I have adapt their culture and I like it. The problem is that fellow Singaporeans just give me that Super black face.I don't understand why. Is it so hard to say thank you but looking at someone eyes and smile? What the point that i smile at my own fellow man and yet as a customer service provider you don't look at me and give me that fark up look. Seriously, regarding about Singaporean having lotsa request and being kiasu. I guess you ppl haven't seen the ang mo side of it. In all country there bound to be kiasu ppl just that our asian culture stay out with more. Singaporean are not the one that demand a lot. I not sure if you have friends who deliver pizzas. Some angmo just becos the poor kid was 5mins late, He just don't wanna accept the order. They are always good and bad of ppl. Why not we think of ways of improving ourselves and bring more smiles along as we go. Little by little ppl will realize that this place has change and follow suit. Instead being so aggressive upon good changes. Smile to everyone not just only IMF <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> haha<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tertiary sector refers to the service sector.<br><br>This topic is very subjective to individual views. As for me, I feel that the customer was extrememly unreasonable and inflexible. Though we may all receive different forms or degrees of services in each shop, it's quite wrong to apply one type of attitude to all the shops which I think my customer has done.<br><br>Opening up the box himself, taking out the actual set and touching it. But I feel that until the product is duly paid, car or not, it's not the customers' yet, hence he/she will let me follow the company's policy to the dot. What if the customer crashes the car before paying?<br><br>Foreigners or not, I crack jokes to my customers to let them have a better shopping experience whether they buy the product or not. I give them my advice which I've thought through, though it maybe shallow, but my customers will give me their feedback which is what I want, so I can help later customers.<br><br>True that foreigners are easier to serve, but the locals is subjective. Because of the culture we're brought up in, not all of the locals bother to smile. But they are those who smile and are reasonable. I'm think most of our mothers and grandmothers tell us, must bargain, and must make sure that we get our product in 100% working condition otherwise, don't buy or pay. Or something of this sort. However, although this sounds ironic, I find that foreigners are sometimes stubborn, unreasonable, over-their-heads and think that they know it all.<br><br>Edited: Removed a line because I felt it was inappropiate.</div>
