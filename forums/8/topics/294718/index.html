            <div class='col-md body'>Haiz. I work at supermarket selling oranges as temp job. We have stacks of boxes behind our counter, which are our supplies. In each supply box from the supplier, there are 3 smaller packaged boxes.<br><br>Another type has 5 packed boxes inside a supply box.<br><br>Then this guy comes along the first thing he did was SHOUT.<br>"EH, FRIEND, HOW MUCH IS THIS?", patting the stack of supply boxes. So i explained calmly that is the supply box, but he insists on knowing. So I multiplied the cost per box by 3. And he doesn't seem to understand for some reason. Then he asked for the other box, I told him the combined cost of 5 boxes.<br><br>Then he start shouting, comparing the prices, etc.<br><br>The policy is pay first, show us the receipt and we give him the oranges. Then he begun to make a big fuss over this, shouting, etc. Wanna call supervisor, manager, or what. I told him i'll follow him to cashier, and he paid there, and finally everything's ok. Even shook my hand for "good service" I was like "huh?".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
