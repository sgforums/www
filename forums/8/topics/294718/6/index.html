Because he was standing infront of the test model, furthermore, to fully test the product, we don't have the spare resources. Because the product, VDR-MC5, requires a Handycam, regardless of DVtape, HDD, or DVD-R/+-RW and a 12cm blank DVD of any format. What's the worst part, it requires time. We have plenty of customers, especially that it's on a weekend and Christmas being just around the corner, we don't have the manpower to handle such things which requires such an extensive amount of time.<br><br>If he didn't understand the latter part regarding time, I can understand that. However refusing to pay for the product, and then tainting it and walking away with such an attitude. Still creating such a ruckus in the process, is extremely childish. That is my perception though.<br><br>This things are quite subjective. But I want to hear more about what others think about this situation, and especially how'd they react. I think this is something we can share about.</div>

The same right appeal to us, and it will apply to us, you ask, we're not obliged to answer or give in to your demands. The world isn't fair. It's because you don't work for food or money, that you remain in the same standard as you are currently and will remain the stagnant until you die. Then you come up with your crappy philosophy that the tertiary sector is unfair. I'm pretty sure that if people can actually realize that Bush is dumb, I think they have the intellectual intelligence to realize that the tertiary sector is unfair. If it was unfair in the first place.<br><br>If it was unfair, why'd you still not bringing your case to C.A.S.E?<br><br>If everything you said were right, but thing is they are never right, wouldn't you have won the election for governmental activities? If you were so successful, why're you even a beggar? Not as a philosopher?<br><br>Tells me one thing, you don't cut it. You're useless.<br><br>And, it's no wonder you're a beggar.<br><br>No beggar follows another. Hence, your nickname/title of beggarchief, is a complete bogus. So just do us a favour, and F.O.A.D, society does not demand people of your kind who bothers, gets in the way, and drags our progress down. It's precisely because of people of the likes of you, we're stuck here. Because your intellectual level is in the negative. So if you're right at all, I think you would have realized this. In which you haven't, so don't waste our time here in the forums telling us that you're right. If you were right yet again, no one would be arguing with you.<br><br>Pretty amazing how you haven't realize this yet. Wow...<br><br>Edit: Another point to note, I think it's quite assuring to know that we don't have to work in Singapore now, because through begging, we apparently have enough money to afford to atleast go into a cybercafe, and spend our time posting in SGforums. Wow... Maybe better, afford our own computer, a shelter, electricity too! Nice.</div>
