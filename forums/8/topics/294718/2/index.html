            <div class='col-md body'>As a customer myself, i definitely will not accept a product that has been opened and tested by a previous customer before. I paid for a new product and i expect a new product, so i do not support the idea of testing the product before payment.<br><br>The thing about making the payment first is to prevent some ugly customers who refuse to buy after testing the product, even if the product is working fine. And what happens after that? You can say re-pack the product, but if you are the next customer, would you pay for a product has has been re-packed? I won't.<br><br>This case is simple. Customer pays for the product he wants. He has the option to test the product on the spot and if there are any faults, he will and should get a new replacement on the spot. No questions asked. And even if he decides to test it at home, he still has the right to exchange for another set if the set that he bought home is faulty. Simple as that. Fullstop.</div>

And once u refuse , they will blast u like there is no tml , they don't know what is business. And for TS case , i share the same sentiment as you , that guy is unreasonable , Things should be paid first before being tested. That's the company policy and customer should adhere by it. If you aren't happy about it , you can always change store , everyone have a choice. Yes and opening a product , you don't expect the next person to buy it , as it is unfair to that person. We tried to give local people good services , but what about this aunties and uncles doing? abusing it? and still wanna write to the papers about our bad services. I don't deny that there are really some stores or shop that give bad service , but customer first have to be reasonable first. And we do our job , and if you as a customer is being reasonable , and the salesman or salesgal is giving bad service then so be it , just leave the store and don't buy any product from them , and that's = No profit for them. logic?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do not disagree that foreigners/tourists/guests are served better, and especially the Ang Mo, to a sale person,  he/she protrayed them as potential buyers with certain purchasing power without an indept knowledge of our markets. Also, we do, as a country wanted to show good services to others.<br><br>Same goes to us when we visit or tour other countries, we might have certain bad experiences, but mostly we are serve well as we are foreign to them and for them, it mean money coming in. Their locals seldom shop at places where tourist roam, as they can get a much lower local prices in their neighbourhood.<br><br>As local living locally here, we should therefore purchase our goods in our neighbourhood rather than some high class place where it is mostly cater for foreigners who doesn't know the existence of cheaper goods out of town.<br><br>Today, there are a lots of shopping points and centres opening up in satelite towns around singapore to cater for local. Unless necessary, you do not have to go shopping at orchard or some high class lanes and places, for those places, i only do window shopping.</div>
