              <p>ekkekek...guess the compensation amount comes into play!!!! But we should not go there cos I still think we have a strong case cos there is not airline that allows 2 names to be registered on a single luggage and it wasn't in the T&amp;Cs that we must check in separate luggage. Also, a marriage cert may prove that we are still married and staying together?</p>

              <p>There would be ceiling for each payable category...if not everyone just buy a lot of policies and get into 1 single incident...then can claim until happy happy liao...underwriters are not stupid...</p>
              <p>ok...the contents of the luggage, inside the luggage...the point is to replace U with the value of the contents...whether there are any double policies on the contents itself would be relatively immaterial...idea is...U lost 1 item...U get back 1 item...no such thing as U lost 1 item and claim back 2 just because U bought double policies.</p>

              <p>ok...the contents of the luggage, inside the luggage...the point
                  is to replace U with the value of the contents...whether there are
                  any double policies on the contents itself would be relatively
                  immaterial...idea is...U lost 1 item...U get back 1 item...no such
                  thing as U lost 1 item and claim back 2 just because U bought
                  double policies.</p>

              <p>Er...I think if I buy multiple policies, they will pay all back....i.e. I can buy as many policy from different companies and all have to pay....</p>
              <p>Now the insurance is beating around the bush trying to siam the grey area no...had to resort to getting my agent to talk to me....told them no way....if T&amp;C dun cover, they jolly well pay.....simple as that....cos when you travel halfway and suddenly pak jian, any policies also kaput.</p>

              <p>Ah neh, forget it man. Insurance company confirm earn. The only time my family managed to "rip them off" was our trip to Hainan Island. Typhoon came and flight cancelled. So we were delayed by one day. My family of 4 each compensated $400. When we come back SG, one of the luggage was delayed as well. The luggage we manage to claim from insurance company too. Also $400. So total $1000. This is the best we ever did.Â <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>And then we realised we were goddamn lucky. The flight was delayed due to weather, so can claim from them. But I heard if it's because the airline themselves cockup or plane got problem cannot fly, insurance won't pay you. They'll ask you go claim from airline company yourself.</p>

              <p>I dont think so...also have to see if the insurance U bought is primary or secondary....meaning if they will pay on top of any current policy on a single incident.Its similar to medical/hospitalisation policies...</p>
              <p>But anyway since ur insurance company is getting ur agent to talk to U...meaning there would still be room for negotiation....so just negotiate and see what U can get lor...</p>
