Nonetheless, Education remains the key. If people can be educated on the true nature, purpose and solution regarding cancer (on all levels - nutritional, biochemical, psychospiritual and karmic; and on Rife healing technology), and on the *wrongness* of chemotherapy (including the economic-political corruption of the pharmaceutical industry), then Humanity may see a much better tomorrow for our brothers, sisters and children to live in.<br><br>Keep up your efforts (of assistantiality, of caring, of sharing) and never give up on them - someone somewhere someday shall benefit from them.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nurses are overworked and underpaid . Plus the author of the letter only stopped by and seen something for a few minutes to write a long paper on her own opinion on how a doctor is so great compared to nurses . Ever seen a doctor curt before? Alot of times .<br><br>At least the nurse said she will get the doctor.  It's not like throwing her aside and leaving the girl to die.<br><br></div>

I been in nursing and I have seen the other end where patients are obnoxious and treats us like servants.<br><br>Patience also run out in a nurse especially when one is underpaid and overworked - I remembered because there were not enough nurses on the night shift that they refused to take over from me because they said the doctor signed the order for a procedure at 9.20 pm (while I was  finishing hand over to go home) and I had to do it. So I had to stay up to 1 am to finish up . And I don't even get overtime pay in Singapore for it but a good scolding on time management even my patient tried to say it is unfair that I have to stay back and do the work.<br><br>Some nurses do their best to be nice  , and some are nasty...some just do nursing to migrate  , some are just very blunt or loud. What do you expect? Some soft spoken nurse on TV asking if you like some tea?<br><br>Get a life people - nursing is a job and because nursing has this silly image of being the caring profession - it seems like some think it is easy to treat nurses like they are maids. Met patients who can walk and like to complain that we don't fetch them their water when it is easily within reach on the bedside table.<br><br>Oh yeah u would like nurses to sit down and talk to you and be caring , right? Sure ...after we finish tons of work - paperwork, appointment making, running after doctors, giving medications, changing other patients, feeding the patient, checking the drips, recording down on more paperwork .<br><br>I met nurses who sit down and talk to patients reassuring them and then take over to find out they could not give medications on time and left other patients in a HUGE mess  because "of the poor patient who is crying" . Want holistic care? Sure after the nurse has completed her legal obligations to your care . You don't want an incompetent idiot to sit down and ignore the rest of the world and other patients who need more medical attention JUST because you want someone to sayang you poor thing.<br><br>This author pisses me off.</div>
