Sorry to hijack this thread.<br><br>The Reindeer issue. Oh yes. I remembered that one. I would suggest u go and read the thread from scratch to know the full story before u want to speak about it. No harm for bystanders to probe and shed some light on the matter, as that issue could have been solved without such a big fuss. That's boastful? Well, then that's too bad. I was just asking questions based a bystander's point of view and I was accused to be doing things I am innocent of. If u didn't steal, and I called u a thief, how would u feel?<br><br>Cycling. I encountered ferry booking difficulties when I went there the last time, so I believed it was kind of me to indicate the issue of getting 12 people to book a ferry as it would be spreading a higher cost among lesser people. Since the number of people who were able to go were all listed there, both of us knew that this ferry booking issue was going to happen. And this is being negative? Well, since u insist, so be it. Can't help it if u like to think negative.<br><br>The quarrel thingy. Oh yes. I think I know which forum u are talking about. All I am offering is another perspective. But her replies came as though I owed her something. Well, if u see it that way, not going to help u on that one as well.<br><br>The IT issue. Similarly, I am offering another perspective. If a group of users are unable to understand what a manual is trying to say, perhaps its time to review the manual. There's a difference between saying a person is creating a lousy manual and trying to improve the manual. So u can quit twisting my words.<br><br>And I think I know who u are already. I am quite surprised that u actually bear grudges for so long, and over things u don't even know much. And to someone who told me not to cross his path, I am certainly amused to know that one doesn't practise what he preaches.<br><br>I think its high time such nonsensical anger stops. I bear no malice in the first place, so I don't see why u are lurking around like a spiteful person who's looking for a quarrel over the Internet all the time. I wonder what kick do u get out of it in the first place.<br><br>If some of the words I have used are overbearing, I apologise. My usage of the English language is not what u call as expressive all the time.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

Was having a number of interesting conversations with a couple of people last night. And this is what I have learnt:<br><br>1) Never attempt to argue with someone who is dead-bias against u. He/she will bite u like a rabid dog, just to show he got sharp teeth that has nothing else better to do with.<br><br>2) Try not to communicate with a psychopath. Let the experts do it. That's why they have institutions to house them for better care and recovery.<br><br>3) A person who resorts to name-calling in any discussion is someone who doesn't have any better things to say. Learn to ignore them.<br><br>4) Scoring a victory online in any forum is as good as winning $2 in the Big Sweep. Why bother?<br><br>5) When someone is twisting facts to his/her better understanding, respect that belief. We can't change a wrapped and twisted mind. Let the experts do it.<br><br>6) The satisfaction level a psychopath can get from mutliple online personalities is something commoners like me don't comprehend. So don't bother. It could be possible that it's a disguise to hide from many enemies. Who knows?<br><br>7) Green-eyed monsters are devious creatures. They appear anywhere from within a company to a social circle. Learn how to watch out for them.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Not only women have PMS. Guys have them too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>9) Everybody has their own ways to help a friend. That reminds me of a question that was posted some time back. Would u lend money to a friend who is a drug addict suffering from painful withdrawal symthons or would try to help him/her break the habit by the fastest posssible manner?<br><br>10) And of course, not to forget.
