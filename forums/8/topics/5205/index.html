            <div class='col-md body'>Guys,<br><br>from somebody who's done it before mariage, my advice is DON'T START!!!!!<br><br>Sex adds a lot of complications to the relationship. You have to worry about pregnancy, abortion, adoption etc. And if sex is bad, it adds strain to the relationship. At least when you're married, you are committed to make it work, so both of you won't think about jumping ship. Also, if your parents disapprove and find out, there's hell to pay.<br><br>And frankly, for the girls, once you start, it's hard to stop. Your current bf will ask, "You did it with your ex, so how come u dun want to do it with me? Do u love me less than u love him?"<br><br>And if you're too good at it, your bf will wonder if you've done this a lot (I refuse to tell how many I've done it with to my bf. No point telling cos it only hurts the relationship) Or he'll start feeling inferior to the other guys before....<br><br>Also, you may have problems finding people to talk to about it. Your friends haven't done it, so they can't really advise. And to everybody else, you're not even supposed to have done it, much lest be having problems with it.<br><br>Argh..... see, so complicated. Better be 'suaku' lah. You'll have an easier time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just for a while, I thought that everyone or rather most pple in the forum are so experience in sex. Seems like not all are like that.. phew.<br><br>I feel that relationships should not be based on sex alone. It seems like youngsters these days do know about it much earlier.. good and bad also. At least it helps to educate them on what are the unnecessary issues that could arise out of one urge.. still there are some who prefer to try out for themselves to find out. Anyway, it's your life, choose what you believe is right for you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do think that sex before marriage is all right, provided its safe. I can understand purr's warnings, but sex is not bad and its certainly not taboo ( or just less taboo) anymore. Its enjoyable, I heard/ read. And if it causes problems before marriage, think about the potential harm it can cause after marriage. Haven't I seen this topic been discussed somewhere before?<br><br>But then, its up to you to decide whether you want to try it.<br><br>As well, I think young people nowadays can get info from so many places. Its like computers. Read the relevant stuff and you can throw technical terms around like an expert in a few weeks. But try to do it, and you can straight away see the difference between a beginner and an expert.<br><br>Er, I'm not slamming anyone. Its a general observational comment. I for one definitely cannot say I'm an expert. I read a lot, but in terms of techical expertise I can beat all of your naiveness added together.

            <div class='col-md body'>Ignorance is bliss. In the case of sexual knowledge, it can be quite true. Like purr, I'm quite 'well-versed' in this subject. And having gone through so many relationships (some are simultaneous), I know how sex can actualy ruin a relationship. Yet like fire can build or destroy, so can sex.<br><br>So what if you're a guru in sexual knowledge. That doesn't make you a sex god in bed. If you want to satisfy in bed, don't do it for lust. Instead it should be for love.<br><br>Rinoa, its ok if you don't know anything about sexual terms. The reason why kids nowadays know so much is that there's sex ed in sec school.

            <div class='col-md body'>One piece of advice- being a technical wizard on sex can be bad. I think most guys nowadays pick up their techniques from porno mags or VCDs. Can tell becos they try all those moves on you in the wrong way. (Dun, and I repeat, dun squeeze her like you're checking two ripe melons) Either that or they have weird ideas on what makes you feel good. (Fave eg: squirting our face/body/hair with your lovejuice. Argh...) Or they want to do some leg-breaking position. I always know it right away from the first time. Sometimes, I really try hard not to laugh or groan.<br><br>Please please ditch all those porno mags and VCD. It's much better to discover your woman by exploring, not acting out what you've seen before.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Purr.... hmm i think there is something called condom. It's around for some reason.. prevents pregnancy and those nonsense.<br><br>i dunno why singapore dun "promote" the use of condoms... but i think they should since many many young ppl in Singapore are so curious that they would be having sex around 19-24. Not to say majority, but it is a substantial number. Most probably the cost of marriage and living in Singapore is so high that ppl can't wait to be wedded first.<br><br>Like in N. America, condoms are so widely available. Schools give them out for free. because they no they can't stop ppl, so they help by promoting safe sex.<br><br>As for Rinoa, hmm... dun be surprised what an 18 year old know. With the accessiblity of Internet, it is very easy to learn those terms.<br><br>Dun start before marriage, if you start, do it "safe".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Right...In North America, it is true that condoms are easily available of some sorts...in the bookstores, toilets,etc, etc...But still the risk of unwanted pregnancies are still there...Girls as young as 15 are putting their kids to child care centres in school(which I initially thought is for the teachers kids)...and it seems like the abortion cases are simply horrible...<br><br>Well...I am not saying that it is not good to have sex before marriage but I just feel out of the sudden , our so called Asian morals have sort of gone...Its like it is always considered "chaste" and "pure"...if u keep it till marriage...but it is thru this forum or rather that I realise that it is not the case anymore...I just still can't believe that we are getting more and more westernised sexually...maybe it is just me...<br><br>I just want to know is that for gers who has so many sex partners before...it will sort of have a higher expectation of the partner they are having sexually...and still I think Love is not bounded by sex alone...it is still the feelings and chemistry that binds 2 hearts together as one.If sex brings unpleasantness, why do it then?? I still think when you get old one day where sex might pose a problem, it is the eternity feeling that is going to carry thru the married couple till the end of times...<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>.. which brings us to the inevitable discussion... What would you think of your future spouse if he/she said she did it with someoen else before? Does anyone belong to the old school of thought? Hmm.. maybe a bad analogy would be annabelle chong. How many before ?  10/20/30 ?!?! Hmm.. I'd like to hear your comments on this. As for me.

            <div class='col-md body'>It seems like youngster in our society are becoming more liberal in sex, which is kinda westernising, but I wonder how many of us still conceive the idea or hope that their wife or husband had never done it to anyone else beside themselves. If given a choice, who would you prefer, someone who had numerous sexual partners or someone innocent? Sometimes, I feel that we are contradicting ourselves.. perhaps we are still at the transition period.<br><br>Anyway, I feel that sex should not be treated lightly, and definitely not something to be done for experience. It should only be carried out with someone whom you love deeply. It's ain't a game but some beg to differ. Theorectically it should be Love then Sex and not vice vesa.<br><br>As Rinoa posted, when you are old and unable to do it.. how would you hope to carry on with your relationship?? True love would perserver.. no matter in what condition of health you are. I think it is really sweet for an old couple to still hold hands when they are out. They might have held each other hands for donkey years.. but the feeling of someone being there for you to hold on to is something really sweet.<br><br>I am a firm believer in true love.. and still searching for my one and only.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ponders,<br><br>of course I know about condoms. We use them, for goodness sake!<br><br>But the fact that not everybody uses them is due to a lot of reasons other than the lack of promotion from the govt. Has that ever occured to you?<br><br>Even if you use condoms, it's not 100 percent safe. I hope you know this too.<br><br>And as I pointed out in my earlier posting, it's not all about pregnancy. There're a lot of other considerations involved too. Of course you guys dun have to worry about anything. In fact, it's to your advantage! I'm just trying to help the ladies to get a clearer picture so they'll be able to decide for themselves.<br><br>I also dun understand why there is such a clear distinction between love and sex? Are they mutually exclusive? As if you love somebody, you dun to have to care about your sex life. One strengthens the other. And if any part of the relationship is unsatisfactory, you have to look at the deeper reasons, like is he being  self-centred. I find it very naive and idealistic to assume that becos you love each other, you dun to have to care about sex. It's not the be all and end all, but it's important too. You guys just seem to see everything in black and white. So morally certain about evrything that it's scary.</div>
