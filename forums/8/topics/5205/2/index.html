But not to have it AT ALL with your partner is difficult to accept. You really wonder if he cares or tries at all. If he doesn't, it'll show up in other areas of your lives together too. Then your relationship will eventually break down.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Asking if you could accept whether ypur partner has had mutiple partners is like asking whether you could accpet whether he's loved other girls before you (or thought he loved them)<br><br>Sometimes, we think we are in love and willingly give all.

But does that mean we treat sex lightly?<br><br>Of course, there are also those around who sleep around for the experience.<br><br>It's impt to make a distinction between the two and not assume everybody who's had a few partners is in the latter group.<br><br>BTW, even though I've done it with a few guys, I haven't done it with ALL my boyfriends. And believe it or not, I have NEVER been unfaithful to any of my boyfriends. Not everybody who's had several partner is a slut or jerk. It's not as black and white as that.<br><br>To me, it's not important to tell my bf how many I've had before, unless I have a STD. He is loving you for who you are now, not who you were in the past.

            <div class='col-md body'>I find it easy to differentiate sex and love, but I have to agree that in the process of love, sex has a large part in it.<br><br>I just want to say that although times are changing, the good thing is that we have more choices. You want to do it now or later, its up to you. No one should pressure you to do it. Of course this does not always happen, but thats the way I think it should be.<br><br>Personally, I would love to do it. My stance is that there is nothing wrong with it. As long as its safe and consensual, there is definitely nothing wrong with it. Bear in mind that I am coming from a direction of having no experience at all, so I'm not sure if I got it right.<br><br>If sex ruins relationships, the relationship would be difficult to sustain anyway, because to me sex in a relationship is important. And because its important, you cannot say that to break up a relationship with that as a reason is wrong compared to breaking up from infidality or abuse.<br><br>purr: if you are reading this, do you still need, er, resources about you-know-what? Give me a mail at pac437@yahoo.com. Its something that you might find useful for your relationship, but not that important.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks a lot for your concern pacman. So far, I haven't been pressured into anything. At least not in the beginning. It's always that towards the end, it starts feeling like an obligation.<br><br>Bad sex doesn't break up a relationship. It just shows up people's self-centredness and insecurities. These are what break up a relationship.<br><br>Thanks also for you offer to help. Right now, good sex is not so important to me. I'm very sure that he's not self-centred and that he's not using me. (There was once when he could have abandoned me and left me to face the music. But he paid for everything and got me out of the shit hole.) This knowledge helps a lot. The poor boy has his insecurities though and I think bringing up the issue has brought them to the surface. He's swamped with work at the moment too. Just bidding my time and making him feel more confident of us before I start. I'll e-mail you nonetheless.
