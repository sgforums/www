            <div class='col-md body'>Actually I would say now is not really a good time to buy a car. True that car prices have been slashed greatly now. But due to the euphoria of the low COE prices, more ppl will be trying to get a low COE/buy car next month. This will drive up COE to the previous levels of 25-30K. If you buy now, the dealer will bid a low COE amount for you, and when he fails to secure the COE for you, will keep asking you to top up. I think you should wait and see what's next month COE like before deciding.<br><br>As for a small car, I would recommend a Renault Clio. I am currently driving it and I think it's one of the better cars in the small car range. Exklusiv is selling the 1.4(M) version at only 59K.

Different dealers offer different prices for the cars. But they should be quite similar. As for your other questions.<br><br>When you buy a car, there are quite a few COE registration options:<br>1. Immediate registration - This means that they will be using a Open Cat COE to register for you and you can get your car in 10 days or less.<br><br>2. Guaranteed registration - This means they will by hook or by crook get a COE for you on the first attempt, whether by bidding or open cat one from the market.<br><br>3. Subject to 3 bids. This means that they can take at most 3 bids to get your COE.<br><br>When you book a car, you would have to pay a booking fee (usually 5-10K). You would also have to pay a COE deposit (usually 10-15K). The dealer will then proceed to bid for a COE for you. If he fails to secure a COE in 3 attempts, he is required by law to refund you the full deposit. Some even refund you deposit + interest..ask for it. Some dealers will ask you to top up for guaranteed COE if the COE prices keep going up. This is good and bad. Even though the dealer must return you the deposit after 3 attempts, this also means you lost out on interest for around 15K for that 3 months. The car prices after the 3 months may also have risen by a lot...so for some, it is better to top up.<br><br>You can bid for your own COE using any ATM. The thing is you need to pay a deposit of 1/2 the bid price plus admin fee of $2. If you failed in your bid, the amount will be re-deposited into your account. Note that cat A and B COEs are NOT transferrable and you HAVE to register a car in 6 months time after your successful bid. Otherwise, your COE becomes void.<br><br>You can secure a COE before buying a car, but most dealers will markup the price by 10-15K if you don't get the COE through them. So the best bet is to get the car through a parallel importer.<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Seifer (edited 14 May 2001).]</div>
