            <div class='col-md body'>I'm sure there has been much discussions on how spoilt children of today can be. Gone are the days whereby the image of parents with a cane in their hand ignite fear in a child. Is this a good sign??? Are the present ways of disciplining a child effective??? What would you do to discipline your child??<br><br>------------------<br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>a mixture of the velvet gloves and the ever useful rattan cane. if my kids can listen to reason alone, no cane for them but if they can't, well, a little pain won't kill them. i can remember the days when my mom caned me till i was six, slapped once by my dad in my entire life and i didn't turn out that bad or violent. and please Revelations, no mention of the slapping incident either, that was a lapse of control and i was very young then.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>oh, cannot cane until welts appear, that kind of canning is scary man. but i do like to tease my 2.5 year old nephew with the cane, he is so obedient when he sees me welding one, it's fun and i think i'm sick.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> currently i've no kids, so am not in a position to comment much, but i do detest it so when parents put down their kids in front of other people, it's so damaging to their self-esteem.<br><br>[This message has been edited by colette (edited 27 May 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Caning would only work for younger kids. What if you are trying to discipline someone who's already in 15? My mum can't do anything about my youngest sis. When she scolds her, she shouts back, I shout at her, and she shouts at me, and in the end, everybody is screaming at each other and my sis would storm into her room and turn on the music at full blast. She spends all her time on irc and chatting over the phone. I restricted her to only an hour of internet time for every hour she spends studying, but this only worked for a while coz her school gave her her own internet account. So if i don't let her use my free account, she'll use her own account and clock up a huge bill. She's failing so many of her subjects. No amount of persuation can make her study. Would caning her help? I doubt so, coz it would only make her more rebellious.<br></div>

Discipline remains a very tough thing to carry out in a family. I have a younger sister too, currently 15. And well, she is rather rebellious at times, but well, me being the only guy among my siblings, I had to be the authoritative figure. So I like to play this verbal psychology game. Sometimes I am even able to bring her down to tears. It works, not for long, but it works. But everytime I have to rethink different strategies in dealing with this. Well, the teenage years are the most rebellious years, what to do...... I was like this too, even though it was not exactly that long ago, hehehe...... seems like yesterday when I set off cold wars within the family once in a while...... quite bad of me actually, ehhehe<br><br>------------------<br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi Sparkle,<br><br>long time no see and no chat.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> 15 years olds have lots of hormones raging in them and they always find that no one understands them *hiaz* they barely understand themselves, what do they expect? iÂ’ve a 16 year old niece, so i think i can understand how you feel. with my niece, she does listen to reasons, although it wouldnÂ’t seem that way when weÂ’re arguing or when iÂ’m disciplining her, yeah, iÂ’m always the bad aunt, her mom is hopeless with her as in your momÂ’s case, they always end up shouting at each other, i guess itÂ’s a case of being too close with the people involved.<br><br>now, an aunt or a sister is different, we are younger and hopefully more tuned in to their tastes. if itÂ’s possible for you to treat her as a friend instead of a sister sometimes, she would respond positively, well, i hope because it worked for me with my niece. i treat my niece like a friend most of the time although i do pull rank with her when the need arises and she listens to my advice, whether she heeds it or not, itÂ’s another matter but sometimes, they have to learn through their own mistakes. at this age, they are fascinated by boys and sex and since such topics are taboo at home, they talk to friends and end up with lots of misguided and funny ideas. should your sister approach you on such topics, if you could talk to her frankly about such stuff, she will listen to you in future because she feels that youÂ’re treating her like an adult and youÂ’ll have more influence with her. and if she tells you that something is a secret, she means it. i made the mistake of telling my sis something my niece told me and 15 year old gals have long memories like elephants, theyÂ’ll forgive but they donÂ’t seem to forget.<br><br>in the case of your sister, you have to let her know that you care about her, (i know you care), that is why you sometimes shout at her. tell her that failing many subjects at her level, she is not doing herself any favours, surf the net if she must but make sure that her schoolwork is up to par. i let my niece surf the Net using my other internet account but luckily for me, she is quite prudent and her schoolwork is okay. if not, my sister would have my hide.</div>
