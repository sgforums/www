              <p>If you are Indonesian or have dark skin colour. You may have a hard time integrating among the locals; unless you hang out with your buddies from Indonesia and form a clique, which is what most of us here learn to do.</p>
              <p>Also you will draw flak from locals (including me) for coming over to steal our jobs! Especially if you are not a PR and haven;t done your army time.</p>
              <p>Yes it isn't very friendly at all, well mostly not. There is ageism (i read it in the paper i did!), forced cpf savings which you'll never see, and local people can be parochial. But then again it depends on who you'll be mixing with. You haven't really said what job you are hoping to do?</p>
              <p><br>If you want to make money: SIn is the place for elite high tech professional types; doctors, chemical engineers, mechanical engineers, bio-tech people etc. There is no minimum wage and PR is bloody hard to get apparently.</p>
              <p><br>If you must leave USA&lt; i may suggest Australia as a good place; it's currently going through a skills shortage and they'd love immigrants. The only problem is i think they prefer brits or europeans ;)</p>

              <p><br>Hmmm.....you are kinda true.  We mostly hear Asian girls marrying americans to become american pr.</p>
              <p>Or Asian men paying to marry a american citizen to get PR.</p>
              <p>Not much is heard about Asian females paying american men to become american PR.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But hey, since I ever did tell a female g/f to do just that Like.....maybe....last month.  So how about cutting me some slack to be the 0.01 percent of urban myth you now heard about?</p>

              <p>give a thought about shanghai, since u are bilingual, u' shld be able to get a pretty decent job there, and china's potential is so great, n working life here is still rather relaxed compared to Singapore. better still, if u can get a job that pays S$ 6-7 k equivalent in china, u'll live very well here. plus there're tons of things u can do in china</p>
              <p>minus points are a lack of singapore food if u're such a sg foodie, bad traffic, and zillions of people..</p>

              <p>Hmm.. I didn't know so many of you are so critical of your own country. Funny a few years back I watched a show showcasing Singaporean Happiness index and according to it, many Singaporeans are happy and content. Maybe things have changed lately for the worse...</p>
              <p>I am of Chinese descendant, and speak mandarin, even a bit of Tio Chiu, which should help, I do speak english with no accent as well..</p>
              <p>I am getting a lot warning signs from the forumers about the stress level, which really making me think twice.</p>
              <p>I can't stand pushy people and stressfull work environment. I have always worked with white/ caucasian and find some of them very stressful to work with. I have never worked with a Chinese boss which is why I tend to think that chinese working for chinese might be abit better, which obviously may not be true at all.</p>
              <p>Ageism is also a big fear of mine, at 37, I am not a stud anymore, and I also don't like places that disrespect the elderly.</p>
              <p>My profession is in architecture, city planning / related fields, but I am also open to ALL other jobs. I am ready to start from scratch. I have an Ivy League education, I was hoping to leverage that to my advantage.</p>
              <p>My only thing about China is that it's just going to make me live even further than my family, which is in Indo right now.</p>
