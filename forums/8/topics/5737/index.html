            <div class='col-md body'>They should not. First it looks untidy if not well kept (think Christopher lee), secondly, not all guys are suitable for long hair becoz of their face shape or watever (think Christopher lee again), although there are a few guys who can and do look good with long hair though i think the probability is about 1 in a thousand. So, chances are, guys still look the best with smart-looking short hair.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, I think boys should be able to keep long hair. Not like Christopher Lee like that one, but the boys should be able to keep long fringes.<br><br>Maybe they should make a new standard such as, the fringe cannot go any further below the eye?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I suppose it is the trend now for guys to keep long hair, even if they do look worse than they did before.<br><br>This is not a 'right' or 'wrong' issue actually. Since there is a choice, then it is really all up to whatever they want to do.<br><br>The thing is, some guys do not look good with long hair. I suppose that is what makes some people say that guys should only have short hair. They have probably seen such people and they just come to the conclusion that guys should have short hair, because the guys with long hair that they have seen do not look good with long hair at all.<br><br>And by the way, keeping and maintaining long hair is not an easy job!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>aha, just read this news form the electronic newspaper. Personally, I object this kind of shorthair rule, because when I was secondary school student, my school also has this rule, it not only apply to guys but also our girls too, it is so boring for all girls to keep short hair for several years. So I totally object this rule especial to girls. I think that it is also too oppressive to force the schoolboys to keep their hair short. After all, even if they keep long hair, they also don't look very dirty or untidy, right? and it is very common for guys to keep long hair. Although I agree that schoolboys better to keep their hairs short and neat, but in terms of freedom, it is another thing. The most important point in this debate is freedom and the restrict rules in Singapore what I want to talk about here. honestly speaking, I think the strict rules in sg give ppl a limited space to breathe.<br><br>According the newspaper, quote form a principal, he said:" students should keep their hair short in school because rules are rules. If you have semi-short or semi-long hair, you'll look like an idiot", it really shock me, rules are rules, can't be changed? I can't believe these words out form a principal. No matter how the guys look with long or short hair, it is their own business, right? as someone said above, these is a choice and freedom to them.<br><br>This news let me recalled a debate about Singapore's democracy and human right which we held in our culture studies last year. In the debate, most ppl said that  singapore definitely wasn't a democratic country, it has high "parental control" system, just like China. and singaporean don't care the human right and democracy very much, because singapore is a wealthy country, and basically, ppl can share the social wealth, and ppl satisfy to the high living standard in sg and used to the safe living environment under the strict rule. So singaporean don't require very much in the democratic and liberal issues.  That's our opinions to the democracy in sg.<br><br>Forgive me and feel free to correct me if I said something wrong above, because I am not a singaporean and I haven't been to sg, I don't know much about your country. Just the Internet brings me close to u ppl through the forums and the electronic newspaper.<br>Democratic and liberal issue may be a boring topic, but I really want to hear your opinions in this aspect, because I did very bad in my assay writing about this issue in my finial exam last semester. so much wisers in this forum, enlighten me, pls<br><br>What 's your opinions in your country' political system, and what is your future expectation to the democratic development in your country. According the needs theory, when the basic living requirements are satisfied, what's the next thenÂ¡K.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The choice to keep long hair or not is up to the person involved.<br><br>If I want to keep long hair and look bad that's my decision, what business is it of yours? Schools are way to strict regarding hair length. Granted that Singapore schools would like there students to project a clean image, but a certain leeway should be given. I'm not talking about letting guys sport shoulder length hair but around the earlobe should be quite ok.<br><br>Agreed that most guys with long hair don't look very nice, 'cause most Singaporean guys have slim, long faces. Long hair with broad, angular faces looks much better.<br><br>As for girls, I feel that if the hair style suits you, it doesn't matter if its short or long. However, I draw the line at Armani.<br><br>Long hair or short hair, guys should look like guys and girls should look like girls, unless you're planning for a sex change sometime in the future. =)<br><br>Just my two cents worth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>a person's hair length is basically something up to us to decide about. whether i want it long or short is honestly, no one's business! afterall, it's MY hair what... but, despite this being a basic 'human right', i think schools have the right to dictate what kind of hairstyles we should have. why? i feel that it's very pointless: is keeping long hair that important? that essential? your hair length is basically an issue of vanity, afterall, how many guys you see keep long hair to make a statement? other then "i'm damn sibei cool and hip hor?" i may be making an unfair generalisation here, and at the same time making a dig at those bengs out there  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> (you know who you are!) but my point is, is leaving your hair long really such a problem? i personally find this school rule pretty acceptable, especially when you consider how 'dirty' long hair looks in school uniforms unless the guys tie them up... if we can't even keep to such a simple harmless school rule, then what will happen to discipline? there are big fights, and there are small ones... a piece of common advice is to pick your fights. save your energy for bigger ones instead of nitpicking on such issues. is there really the need to do so?</div>

I mean if it's a proper school, then they have the right to want to preserve the image of the school since Singaporeans tend to look upon long hair males as Ah-bengs or wusses.<br><br>So does long hair generally not suit guys at all or is it cause Ah-bengs have spoilt it just like they've spoilt D&amp;G and some of the car models out there?<br><br>In this day and age, isn't it okay for guys to keep long hair? (as long as they look ok in it) I think in the cyber age, lotsa things should have become the norm now... butches all over, faggots and all that... long haired males are the least 'provocative' of some of the other nonsense that has sprouted in this era....<br><br>So is it the long hair itself or is it the way most guys carry it off?
