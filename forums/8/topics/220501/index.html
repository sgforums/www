            <div class='col-md body'>it could have turned ugly had he drew his revolver...<br><br>sigh.. how are ppl supposed to trust CISCO in ensuring the security of sensitive commercial and industrial premises?<br><br>What's next? A Cisco van drive into M'sia with loot?<br><br><blockquote><br>Nov 16, 2006<br><br>Armed Cisco guard caught shoplifting<br>Jurong hypermart security squad nabs him as he walks out with 3 DVD players<br>By Ben Nadarajan<br><br>AN ARMED and uniformed Cisco guard was arrested for shoplifting on Tuesday morning after calmly strolling out of a store carrying three DVD players.<br><br>The officer, in his early 20s, had walked into the Sheng Siong Hypermart in Jurong, dressed in his uniform and carrying his revolver in a holster.<br><br>A few minutes later, he walked brazenly past two female employees and out of the rear delivery entrance carrying the DVD players, together worth about $200.<br><br>According to security supervisor Tay Swee Teng, when he was first approached, a few metres from the rear entrance, the man told them he was a police officer and that they 'cannot touch me'.<br><br>Mr Tay asked the officer to show him a receipt. When he was unable to produce one, he claimed he was going across the road to withdraw money from an ATM.<br><br>However, the ATMs are located at the front of the store and the back door was off-limits to customers.<br><br>Mr Tay, 43, said the man then tried to run off, but was surrounded by five supermarket security officers, who escorted him to the main office and kept him there until the police arrived.<br><br>While waiting inside, Mr Tay said the officer was gesturing wildly and scolding the staff. He also allegedly told them: 'I have a gun.'<br><br>However, he never drew his revolver.<br><br>Mr Hoon Hock Kwee, one of the five internal security<br><br>officers who assisted in Tuesday's arrest, said: 'I could not believe my eyes when I saw him just walk out like that with the boxes. I thought for a while that he was on official business, but I realised that if he was, I would have been informed.'<br><br>Mr Tay was also shocked at the officer's audacity. 'He was too much. He treated our team as if we were transparent and looked through us.'<br><br>Police officers later removed his revolver and took him away in a police car, but not before giving him a jacket to wear over his uniform.<br><br>A Cisco spokesman confirmed the person arrested at the supermarket along Yuan Ching Road was one of their employees.<br><br>'We take great care in checking the background of our employees before they are employed as security officers,' she said.<br><br>The men who stopped the Cisco officer were part of Sheng Siong's newly formed security squad set up last week in each of its 17 supermarkets here to tackle shoplifters.<br><br>Its human resource manager Norman Teng said shoplifting was a big problem for the company.<br><br>On average, its employees catch two shoplifters a week at each outlet, he said.<br><br>benjamin@sph.com.sg </blockquote></div>
