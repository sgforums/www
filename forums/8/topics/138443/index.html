            <div class='col-md body'>The Gahmen has decided to raise MinistersÂ’ salaries in order to help citizens get accustomed to widening income gaps due to globalization.<br><br>The move was made after Labour Minister Lim Boh Heng said that Singaporeans cannot avoid seeing the wage gap widen because of global economic conditions.<br><br>The latest Gahmen household expenditure survey reported that between 1998 and 2003, the income of the poorest 20 percent of Singaporeans fell by 3.2 percent, while the richest saw their income rise by 1.1 percent. Last week, it was also reported by the StateÂ’s Times that both bankruptcy and the growth in number of local millionaires were at an all time high.<br><br>Â“We canÂ’t hold back globalization,Â” said Mr. Hang Cheng Pai, a spokesman for the Ministry of Manpowerlessness. Â“Neither can we practice protectionism. So people must just get used to this. The Gahmen is aware of the problem, and intends to take a leading role in helping the citizens adjust.Â”<br><br>And so in an act of supreme leadership, Cabinet Ministers will initiate an initial pay rise of 10%, subject to increase depending on circumstances.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s a painful decision, but they have no choice,Â” said Mr. Hang. Â“It is being done for the good of the people. If we donÂ’t practice at home what is happening on a global scale, Singapore will be finished.Â”<br><br>The Cabinet will be taking even more steps towards tackling global economic issues, such as purchasing overseas homes, sending their children to schools abroad, and taking more holidays.<br><br>In other news, the NTUC is demanding that workers in Singapore stop referring to it by mixing up its letters so that it begins with 'C' and ends with 'NT'.<br></div>
