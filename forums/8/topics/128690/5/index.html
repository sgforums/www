The company send you out to another company<br>whether they take you in or not is no longer the company problem. Can loose the job at this point or they take me in (which I doubt), then in 1 years time, they will stillr etrench you cause your job is now moved to India. Its not "correct" to call it retrench, to the top management, its call right sizing and focusing on core competencies. So other than sales/marketing, the rest of us IT folks in an IT company are no important.</div>
