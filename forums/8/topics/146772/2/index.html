Today, we celebrate our Nation's 40th birthday, 40 years of independence.<br><br>Very often, I see people keep saying "NS is a waste of time". I used to think the same, but I have changed. I just ORD btw, working under some stupid superiors or some scholars with no leadership.<br><br>Our duty in NS may be boring, useless, educate us nothing and etc. Remember President John F. Kennedy said, "Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country". Can Singapore celebrate another National day if we do not have army(SAF)? SAF has bring security and economic stability for Singapore, it's not the work of some stupid regulars, LTC,COL,BG,MG,LTG and etc. It's the work of many generations of NSF! Be proud if you can serve your HOME and for those who don't serve NS, respect NSF please.<br><br>Lastly, we cannot protect what we do not own. This is OUR land, our forefathers had left for us.<br><br>Just wanna knock some sense into boys who cry NS is a waste of time. Happy national day.</div></blockquote>kiss mi (_i_)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>While many guys complain about NS, do you guys have any idea gals do look up to guys who serve NS?  Between a guy who has completed NS vs a guy who has not (probably waiting for enlistment), there is a very clear distinction between them in terms of the way they work and look at things.<br><br>When I was a student, I have male classmates : some have completed NS before they continued their studies, some have not and will serve NS only after they graduate.  Somehow, we the female could see the difference between those who have already spent 2 1/2 years hardships and tough trainings; and those who have yet to go through that.<br><br>You see, those who have ORD tend to have this higher level of confidence what they speak.  They are also more organised and mature.  In many areas, I hate to admit this, these guys can do better jobs than their female peers.  You guys may not realise this change and growth that have occured in you, but the gals are quite observant in these areas (maybe gifted or 6th sense???.... hehe).<br><br>I think last time there was this Army advertisement that goes like : Army makes you a better man.  There is some truth in it, I guess.<br><br>So guys, nobody can change the fact that guys have to serve the country for that period of time.  While we all try to understand the hell-like life that you may have, there are also some good (though may not be many) that NS has done to you.</div>

I feel that our citizens lack of identity, we feel inferior because our country is small and we must be mindful not to offend other nations. However we must admit that we are part of the country and people carry the identity of the country. If all of us love Singapore, can you imagine how great this nation will become? Even great nations like U.S., Britain will admire our country.</div>

Ya, we may not be able to win the war if it ever starts. We may even die and lose our country!
