To be equal to the male counter-parts.<br>There are of course many factors which involve men's duties to protect our country.<br><br>But, the question here being that, when all is well and good. Ladies find men whiny and immature. They are assuming their powers as Women's Rights - They can argue their ways and their rights without considering other issues at hand. eg. My boyfriend earning lesser than me.<br><br>When there is unstablity in our nation(touch-wood), women will all be helpless and look upon men. In sense of military and wartime duties.<br>Have they lost their rights and power? We'll see about that.<br><br>I personally feel very turned off by this two faced attitude from (let me carefully say)most Singaporean girls.<br><br>Appreciate guys who are doing/did NS and called to serve the nation.<br>With these small gesture from female counterparts. We will in turn will feel better and at least there is 'another' reason to protect the nation.<br><br>:::In short. We wish for Sg ladies to appreciate and support us.

            <div class='col-md body'>Alot of people with extreme bad feeling towards SAF....<br>I guess its always good to look deep into the picture and understand the whole situation rather den on the superficial and seemingly bad conditions ie<br>GF run away, cheap labour, waste of time...<br><br>My 10cts worth...does going to school take up any of ur time...<br>Will ur GF run away when u r in school?<br>It dosent pay (literally) to go to school..Some might hate school...but i always believe the good things dont necessary have to be enjoyable...<br>U dun have to like working to work. U just have to do it...<br>Serving army just means spending my wkdays in camp...<br>Even if some people feel that they gain nothing from army, listen carefully as it says SERVE ns..<br>Worse case scenario as compared to a student who hates school but is forced to go to school...U will always make lifelong frens...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>WO AI XING JIA PO</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My two cents.<br><br>I used to think that I've could have done much more things with my 2.5 years.But when I look back,I think that perhaps NS was a necessary evil.And perhaps besides all that backsniping and lousy experiences many of us went through, it did teach us one thing, which is if you want something done, you gotta do it yourself and you gotta make your own plans for it.<br><br>I saw many things in my service that shifted that hate into something of a grudging acceptance, something which all sane beings would do in order to leave it alive and well to move on with life.So in a nutshell, NS is not something I would volunteer but since you are in it, try to make it work for you.You can learn and maximise your time while inside, and even if you didnt learn anything, at least I'm sure you learnt the art of warfare known as wayang and chao keng <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Today, we celebrate our Nation's 40th birthday, 40 years of independence.<br><br>Very often, I see people keep saying "NS is a waste of time". I used to think the same, but I have changed. I just ORD btw, working under some stupid superiors or some scholars with no leadership.<br><br>Our duty in NS may be boring, useless, educate us nothing and etc. Remember President John F. Kennedy said, "Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country". Can Singapore celebrate another National day if we do not have army(SAF)? SAF has bring security and economic stability for Singapore, it's not the work of some stupid regulars, LTC,COL,BG,MG,LTG and etc. It's the work of many generations of NSF! Be proud if you can serve your HOME and for those who don't serve NS, respect NSF please.<br><br>Lastly, we cannot protect what we do not own. This is OUR land, our forefathers had left for us.<br><br>Just wanna knock some sense into boys who cry NS is a waste of time.
