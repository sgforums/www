As many of us still conclude NS is a necessity for Singapore, thus anything that is deem necessary wouldn't be called wasting of time. There are still people who feels "ns is a waste of time", also know the importance of NS for Singapore and I wouldn't doubt their love for our country. I am really just targeting at people who goes around and complain about NS. I admire those who endure in silence, cheers. No need to close this thread, because all the flaming can just aim at me, I will not bear any grudge. =)</div>

Have  heard your camp mates say their gf also 2-timer them when they were in NS? When the guy is in NS, their gf are vulnerable to be preyed upoun by other guys given the female emotional mentality and fickle mindedness.<br><br>Guy just want to have some fun but in the end they will love only one girl. Most of them are like this anyway.. That is the  male mentality of the species. But girls are different matter. ......u let them slip they are gone forever.<br></div></blockquote>Haha, i suppose you're right. But it's just that the guys in my camp are especially  nonchalent about their relationships with their gfs whilst serving NS. If anything, NS does develop a fair amount of independence. Some more then others, obviously.<br><br>Thus, the urban legend about women dumping their boyfriends in NS is somewhat exaggerated, don't you think? At least it appears so to me amongst my circle of friends.<br><br>Those who were serious about the relationships actually managed to keep it going for all 2/1/2 years. Post NS, some get married, others break up. But that's very normal, no?<br><br>So yah, NS dosen't really cause quite as much relationship problems as one might think. The ones I know who got dumped, were probably going to get dumped anyway. so... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> it's quite funny how folks (both men and women) use NS as an excuse to dump each other.<br><br>Oh well... I wouldn't blame my gf problems on NS. But I never really had to contend with that... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Life's too short to worry about such things, i suppose.</div>

That should be done away with or hold it once every 2 years...I mean what is the point of it?<br>It just ruins our lives when the companies dont want to hire Singaporeans but rather opt for FT or females because of reservist liability. And worst still, that Ippt RT training is taking up all the valuable "promotion hours" u can put into the company.<br>It is affecting the economy itself why dont they get it , damn mudercorks idiots!

Treat NSFs as proper human being, give them the due dignity and respect<br><br>3. Regulars e.g the high ranks, take on a more main role, while NSF take on the supporting role, currently its the other way round,in some camps.

            <div class='col-md body'>SAF is a place to waste resources, our tax payer money. the money tat go into the pocket of regulars but they in turn dun appreciate n keep treat NSF like shit. Without all the NSF MEN eg, clerks, drivers, storemens, clerks, medic etc. SAF can't operate, regulars and officers also cannot work but they r the one tat dun appreciate the shit job we did. Hence this type of environment n working culture worth our precious time to serve or not. Its not something do with the country its the problems with SAF.I hate to serve SAF but not the country.</div>
