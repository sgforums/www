Between a guy who has completed NS vs a guy who has not (probably waiting for enlistment), there is a very clear distinction between them in terms of the way they work and look at things.<br><br>When I was a student, I have male classmates : some have completed NS before they continued their studies, some have not and will serve NS only after they graduate.  Somehow, we the female could see the difference between those who have already spent 2 1/2 years hardships and tough trainings; and those who have yet to go through that.<br><br>You see, those who have ORD tend to have this higher level of confidence what they speak.  They are also more organised and mature.  In many areas, I hate to admit this, these guys can do better jobs than their female peers.  You guys may not realise this change and growth that have occured in you, but the gals are quite observant in these areas (maybe gifted or 6th sense???.... hehe).<br><br>I think last time there was this Army advertisement that goes like : Army makes you a better man.  There is some truth in it, I guess.<br><br>So guys, nobody can change the fact that guys have to serve the country for that period of time.  While we all try to understand the hell-like life that you may have, there are also some good (though may not be many) that NS has done to you.  </div></blockquote></div>

I am not promoting NS or encouraging people to sign on. I just want to convince people that NS is not wasting our lives. Hmm, I think my mistake is the strong language I used in the topic. LOL. Anyway it's getting healthy feedback, you see the point. There are a lot of people trying to encourage those who are serving NS and those who served NS.<br><br>Once again, I apologise for the topic. It's just that I see too many people whine about NS, it's very discouraging for the boys and also to those who are currently in the force.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Unlike many others, i can't say that i have been abused by the SAF (not on a regular basis anyway). My unit can be described as 'enlightened'. Having said that, i still think NS is a waste of my time.<br><br>I am in a foreign university now and sometimes i really think it is a curse to be born singaporean. My fellow students are largely aged between 19-21. People my age are in the work force, and are on the way up the corporate ladder already. Comparing myself to them, i can't see my NS experience being of any benefit to me. Whatever i might have gained from the army, they have gained from having worked in the industry. Oh, and they were paid much much more than me as well.<br><br>Reservist is another waste of time. No doubt, my reservist liability is seen as a liability by potential employers.<br><br>Conclusion: NS == Waste of my time.<br><br></div>

How many "employees" is that?<br>Coz one can play with the foreign workers easy by applying regulation if hard times come, but not with the citizens, right?<br>Btw:  Spore army has been "designed" by Israelis... and surely its not only the nuclear weapons that protects Israel... thats more the USA.<br></div>

The Kuwaiti Army was quickly overwhelmed, though they bought enough time for the Kuwaiti Air Force to flee to Saudi Arabia. The heaviest fighting occurred at the Emir's Palace, where members of the royal guard fought a rear guard action to allow the royal family time to escape. A cousin of the Emir, who commanded the guard, was amongst those killed. Troops looted medical and food supplies, detained thousands of civilians and took over the media. Iraq detained thousands of Western visitors as hostages and later attempted to use them as bargaining chips. Hussein then installed a new Iraqi provincial governor, describing this as "liberation" from the Kuwaiti Emir; this was largely dismissed as war propaganda."<br><br>You want this to happen?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
