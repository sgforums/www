There are so much dirt in NS, and if we all go compile our own experience into books, there might be not enough paper pulp to last.<br><br>Thats where the wastage of time comes.

They are also more organised and mature.  In many areas, I hate to admit this, these guys can do better jobs than their female peers.  You guys may not realise this change and growth that have occured in you, but the gals are quite observant in these areas (maybe gifted or 6th sense???.... hehe).<br><br>I think last time there was this Army advertisement that goes like : Army makes you a better man.
