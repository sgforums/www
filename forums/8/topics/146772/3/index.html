It's really a grey area, while we need talents and still need to satisfy people like you. We need politicians who can solve problems! Not people who just cry out problems and wait for answers, because we already knew the problems. I won't stop you if you think your suggestions(laws) are not even ridiculous.

One can love Singapore, and willingly make whatever sacrifices that the country asks of him, but that still does not prevent him from thinking it's a bloody waste of time.<br><br>I wouldn't presume to know what makes a nation tick and what makes a nation great, but I shouldn't think that it's the citizen's love for the country. By your argument, Al Qaeda members love their cause with a *passion*, but that does not mean that we look up to them.<br><br>It's blind faith that makes some people immature and silly.<br><br>Personally, I for one, think that asking for 2/1/2 years in one of the prime period of my life can genuinely equate to a fucking waste of my time. But that does not mean that I didn't enjoy NS, nor do I think that it's a bad idea. I just feel very handicapped by the fact that my peers who did not have to serve NS have moved much faster ahead of me, and *especially* handicapped by the fact that foreign nationals my age would have had graduated and most likely have worked for 2-3 years by the time i graduate. These are the people that I compete/have to compete with in the same job market.<br><br>btw, you claim that your english is poor. then might i suggest to you that you find some other ways to articulate yourself better? largely because forummers can only reply to what they read, and personally i think you are coming across as someone who's very juvenile in terms of maturity.</div></blockquote>It's the most conveninent way for me to express my thoughts, I won't get published on ST. LOL It's the same argument, we shouldn't be too self-centred. You find it waste of time because it takes away your prime and you lag behind your peers. In a whole picture, NS brought security and economic stability, hence MNCs are still coming into Singapore. Thus generating more jobs, economic still having healthy growth. In whole, Singaporeans benefit indirectly. To serve NS is a noble thing, we are protecting the land our forefathers left and securing the future for generations to come.<br><br>Okay, I think we have an obvious outcome.<br>People who find NS a waste of time kinda think about only themselves, don't you reckon? Okay, I can't change ppl's opinion. Let's just enjoy freedom of speech for now.<br></div>

While I sympathise whatever case you had, NS is still not a bad thing even due to your case! We need to be a little less self-centred. Foreign talents? It's really a grey area, while we need talents and still need to satisfy people like you. We need politicians who can solve problems! Not people who just cry out problems and wait for answers, because we already knew the problems. I won't stop you if you think your suggestions(laws) are not even ridiculous. If you think it's feastible, why not suggest to any MP? Otherwise you are just sitting back and not doing anything constructive for OUR country. Infringing some copyrights<br><br></blockquote>first of all my topic was related was related to NS, and NS is related to the law itself...as for welfare it is a must, just as a minister always try to explain why they shld be paid high salaries for serving the country. It is ridiculous to say i am out of topic.<br><br>Yeah most, if not some of my suggestions are ridiculous, but it is to rebuke some comments made by some forumners earlier, simple common sense would make it easier to figure out<br><br>As for foreign talents, i do not need to say much more.There are various websites that state extremely important points about it. They are better in this area of argument than me. All I need is to say: do we need to have that many foreign construction workers? are you really sure there are not many singaporeans willing to be construction workers?<br><br>oh btw how much are you paid to say this<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">? i also wanna join!<br><br>shush oops...i edited it! i am sorry! !! help!!!</div>
