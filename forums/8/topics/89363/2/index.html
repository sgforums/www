I often find myself having nothing to do and is forced to work under a superior who is of lower qualitications and lower charisma than myself. Instead of helping out in solving problems at work, i find that i have to create some trouble so that i can remedy it and thus make belief that i am actually working. I also realised that i have to pretend to be working very hard with tons of workload by staying over night often but actually i can afford to do this coz i will be fetching my son long after office hours.<br><br>The other thing is the f uckin g company got no nice nice girls for me to see and touch u know. It has been many years into my marriage and i am getting very itchy here and there, esp my c ock. Spending 8 hours solid in the company without some elements or dirve to make me there realsolid sometimes is a very solid problem u must know.<br><br>I also realised that the reason why i took up this job is due to the interviewer. This HR lady from your company is so shiok that i went to the toilet to mast right after the interview man so hard can still remember that feeling oh my lordy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>My resignation will be with immediate effect and i sincerely hope that the HR and Finance department will negate the penalties for having to pay a 1 month's salary for not fulfilling my 1 month in advance notice prior to resignation.<br><br>To all you fu cking idi ots have a nice blo ody Friday.<br>F uck off for now.<br><br>sincerely<br>mr <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>P.S - if you intend to make me stay, let me pick a lady colleague from the company and let me f uck her in front of all the top management staff (including the CEO), must be a virgin okay <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Use to be like that also. But after a few years, you realize that sometimes you feel like owning a house, car etc. And it is difficult to own one without loan. So, unless your earning power is very high. Or you do not mind wait long long. Then, no problem. But if intent to get any of these in the next 5-10 years, then, my point remains. Anyway, glad to see another financially conscience person. Many people nowadays do not know how to spend within their means</div>
