            <div class='col-md body'>Just a thought people....and this is a question for both sexes....how does a girl indicate that she likes a guy ?<br><br>For guys, maybe can tell of your experiences ? This would indicate the trend towards more boldness for girls probably...rather than meekly admiring a guy from a distance. It's also a good indication for guys to look out for possible "signs" from a girl.<br><br>Is it what she says (implying or in a subtle way ?)....or what she does ? Maybe how she looks at you ?<br><br>As for the ladies, please comment on how u would attract a guy's attention and maybe even what kind of guys attract you.<br><br>Hope to hear from all of you soon....that's what a forum is about ! *Grin*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have an idea from some experiences, but not much.  Usually it is the very physical things like she's extra nice to u or always likes to talk to u when she has the chance.  Does she approach u when u see each other?  That's one sign.  When u sit around with other people, if her knees are pointed in your direction she's interested...no questions asked...that's THE final way to know.  To test it out, move a bit to her left or right and eventually she will adjust herslef to face her knees towrds ur direction.  That's if she's attracted to u.  Why is it such a no-brainer that she likes u if she does this?  Because it's such an unconscious thing for people.  We don't automatically sit and think about how to aim our knees (maybe for girls wearing skirts who are self-conscious)....But believe me,...<br><br>...The knees will lead the way...:-)<br><br>But behind it all, sometimes u can just feel that she likes u.  This is the difficult thing to describe so I won't.  U just...know...and siomehow u just feel that she does...<br><br>If ur the low self-esteem type like I used to be, u might lose the opportunity by making excuses for these feelings...ie...<br><br>"I'm just being paranoid"<br><br>"It's just my imagination"<br><br>"It's because I'm desperate"<br><br>"I'm putting too much meaning into little things"<br><br>Other people have other excuses, but as cliche as this may sound....sometimes, it pays to listen to your gut feelings...<br><br>Then again, u could be wrong and you'd get egg on ur face.<br><br>The worst thing to ruin it would be to lay a fat fart in front of her...:-)  She definately will point that knee somewhere else.<br><br>Happy Hunting.:-)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've heard all sorts of different signs a girl shows when she likes a guy, but knees pointing is definately something new. Maybe now we'll see guys focusing their attention on the knees of girls they like rather then their more.. ahem.. desirable assets. : P<br><br>Being nice to you doesn't necessarily mean that she has taken a liking for you. She might just be treating you as a closer friend, someone she can count on and rely on, but not someone to fall in love with.<br><br>The key is not too think too much about what she has said, what she has done and wreck your brain over it, thinking of all the possible hidden meanings.<br><br>Let your heart lead you, not your mind.<br><br>If you insist on looking for tell-tale signs, try these:<br><br>1) physical signs of affections, an occassional hand on your thigh or arms, sitting closer to you given the opportunity etc..<br><br>2) care and concern, appears to have taken great pains to note what you like, how you are feeling, cheer you up when you're down, moral support, being there for you<br><br>3) the eyes!! how she looks at you, does her face sort of brighten up when you're around<br><br>But of course these are like probably in the advance stages.. where she has definately taken a liking to you and is going all the way to hint it. Some girls are more subtle, try asking them out on a date, just a simple movie, or help get a present for your mum/dad/grandpa/brother/sister whatever.. (just create a lame excuse) if she agrees to, you've got a chance, if not... might as well look for greener pastures elsewhere!<br><br>cheerio!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>haha, i thk enigma's on the right track.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> it's the way she looks at you, the way she talks to you, the qns she asks. a gd way to find out is observe how she treats you when you two are with a grp of frens, inclding guys of course. physical affection is a gd sign, but does it only apply to you, or everyone else? watch the way she smiles at you, or does she stare at you whenever she thks you're not looking? casually ask her out, but dont make it sound like a date. ask her out to watch the latest movie, go for a play, your fren's gig, shopping.... the lamer it is the bigger a risk you're taking of course. but if she agrees...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>i guess if i like a guy, i'll look into his eyes alot. lots of eye contact while talking/walking/doing anythg. and smiling.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> heheh.. i smile alot ard the guy i like. but this may differ frm girl to girl. some girls smile alot ard everyone.... or she might have struck lottery or smethg tt day........<br>but remm, nothg turns a girl off more than a guy who thks she likes him. sometimes even if it's true, but definitely worse if it isnt. even if you have a feeling she likes you, dont make it obv. always make it seem as if you're making the first move no matter how obv it is, it'll make her alot happier.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> it's the whole ego thg: isnt it wonderful when the person you like not only likes you in return but makes the first move?<br><br>[This message has been edited by ataraxia (edited 30 October 1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree wholeheartedly with Enigma and ataraxia...it's a kind of gut feeling that you fell that something is not right, sort of like the danger tingle that Spiderman get, except that this is the pleasant kind of danger...all I'm saying is trust your feelings, and test the waters with the toe before you plunge into the unknown depths. That's to prevent blundering into embarassing situations...<br><br>For me, I tested the waters by asking my girlfriend to accompany me, talking in a pub at HV till it closed. Then, as I was sending her home, I grabbed her hand, and she didn't pull away...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Good luck, and good hunting!!!<br><br>Cheers...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Then a question comes to mind, how come some girls are "hot" towards a guy and at times "cold"?<br><br>I had this experience where once I accompanied this gal out shoping cos she was new to the country. She bought something which needed assembly. So I helpped her assemble it (but first I had to return home to get my tools cos she didn't have any).<br><br>Then while I was assembling the thing, she came over and sat beside me and placed her head on my shoulders.<br><br>I was like thinking this could have been the start of a beautiful friendship *smile*<br><br>But as things were, the next day she treated like nothing happened. I was like quite fed up with the false signals (there were more than this incident) that I decided I had enough with her so I just stopped calling and going out with her and I guess she too did the same.<br><br>So the question is why do girls do that?<br><br>[This message has been edited by DangerGuy (edited 30 October 1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, i guess many gers are confused themselves as to how they feel abt a certain guy sometimes, which cld explain the mixed signals. sometimes after making the "first move" she cld have 2nd thoughts after tt or cld be just plain embarressed. when in a situation like this, i guess you cld either just go w the flow, letting her take the lead, or, talk to her abt it? the 2nd choice wld definitely be a lot riskier, so i thk it's only applicable if the girl's been very obv.<br>does this ans your qn? *grin*<br><br>[This message has been edited by ataraxia (edited 30 October 1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ha ha  ha!!!  I crashed and burned many times, but the one time that it meant anything, I never even said a word or did anything...al I was doing was being her friend.  I really cared about her and she even told me that she loves me..blah blah blah, but I still never tried anything...even let her sleep on my single bed with me quite a number of times...never touch man.  Even let me see her upskirt...I stare, she don't mind.  still never touchSee her in her bra and panties as she pose for me, stillnever touch.  I really didn't think that I gavce any signals that I liked her.  I really wanted to be nice to her because so many guys had been so bad to her...Her last BF tried to extort money from her after they broke off...came to our school and I refused to let her give...and he hates my guts now because I gave him the evil eye the whole time he was there...never bother to look up at me...:-)<br><br>Anyway, for some strange reason, as I was eating in the canteen at school, she comes down looking all pretty and ruffled up, sits down in front of me  in front of all my friends, and decided to leave all tact with her when she left her house and proceeded to tell me that she doesn't like me in *that way*, that we could only be friends...blah blah blah...I just slowly ate my lunch as if nothing happened and just totally ignored her while all my friends just sat there motionless and jaws gaping.  When I got up to leave, I never said a word to her and friends suddenly came up to tell me that everything was going to be fine...It will  get better, just foorget her....As if anyone of them knew I liked her...Just because we spent every waking minute together doesn't mean we're BF/GF....<br><br>Anyway, it was really strange because I had never even asked her about it or even hinted.  I was just there when she needed me.  that's how we get paid for our kindness brothers.  If I knew it was going to be like that, I would have just jumped her bones when I had the chance...many times, and I knew she wouldn't have stopped me.<br><br>*_____*-add ur own foul language.<br><br>That was one of the single most embarrssing thing to ever happen to me.  In front of everyone in school some more.  Next day, everyone was talking about it....man, it's a good thing my skin is thick as hell or else I wouldn't be able to face anyone.<br><br>DAmn it...still get worked up when I think about it.  It was really screwed up.   I agree with u guys here....Women, make up ur mind!!!!!  Not only do u shatter our hearts, u shatter the very thing that makes us men...our ego.</div>

They tear your heart to shreds with no mercy and even though they know you are in pain, don't show any emotion at all. When they decide to make it clean with you, there's little regard for your self-esteem or feelings. Does it hurt them as much as it hurt us? Or is it something they are just so good at doing?

            <div class='col-md body'>tt's a pretty sad story... how embarrassing!! but IMHO, i thk it might be because after being soooo obv and all, she still didnt get a response frm you, positive or otherwise. and i guess tt's an even bigger blow to *her* ego. i mean, for you, a ger just told you she didnt like you, but for her, after making so many blatant moves she not only didnt get the guy she wanted but he practically didnt react at all.... in this kinda situation, when a girl's ego is badly bruised and she feels "cheated"... sigh. "hell hath no fury like a woman scorned", even if the woman only thks so. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> us gers can be very vindictive if we want...<br><br>eck:<br>heyyy, unfair generalisation! are you sure ALL women are like tt? breaking off is usually just as hard for the ger as it is for the guy unless the guy's really a total jerk. they usually fret and worry over it for days, thking of how exactly they're gonna break the news, etc. so when they finally do it, they usually do it quick, fast, and "clean", so they wont have to worry anymore. if they become emotional, say everythg nicely and sweetly, guilt wld have a chance to set in and all her "plans" wld be ruined..... afterall, guilt is one of the best thgs to use against gers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>well, this is what i feel and maybe other girls might have a dif opinion/POV altogether...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To ataraxia : To borrow a quote from you, "hell hath no fury then a woman scorned" I think you pretty much answered mine and your question  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I'm not implying nor saying that women are vicious and vinidicative in all aspects. My point is why do women have to be so cruel to guys emotionally? We are often torn up inside and totally F-ed up but still have to keep a strong front.<br><br>Juz because we don't show it doesn't mean we don't hurt... Anyways.... that is beside the point, I think you have answered my question well. Just wonder if there's any other POV's from other girls.<br><br>And BTW, what's tt???<br><br>------------------<br>Why? Why me?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I too wonder if females mean their words when they say 'I love you'. Maybe they do, but they can't really make up their mind about certain things. For I, same as firewire, crashed and burned several times before. Sometimes its just like the normal crashing and hurting yourself in the process but sometimes it have to happen when you're speeding down a long deserted road thinking nothing can ever go wrong when a tank appears out of nowhere and trash compacts your "car".<br><br>I knew this girl quite long ago. Through some friends I came across her, at first I thought she was like any typical girl. But after a while I got so much attracted to her and I think vice versa for her side, but thats just my point of view. We went out on countless dates. On one particular time, around 2am near starbucks cafe we just sat around and chit chatted. We talked about many things, and later she mentioned that she notices alot of guys likes to stare at her when she dances. I asked her why, and she took a few steps backwards and started dancing infront of me. No wonder she gets stared upon when she dances, she was absolutely mesmerizing and sexy utilizing every curve and asset of her body to the dance. I smiled and laughed harmlessly but silently and she asked why did i laugh, i answered that i was puzzled why she did that right infront of me and she said she feels completely at ease with me and hugged me. Thats when we developed a bgr.<br><br>About a month after, she requested a breakup because I did not pay enough attention to her. True I was really busy and didnt have much time to go out with her or anything like that but we managed to sort things out and everything was fine.<br><br>Several days passed by when she approached me and told me shes confused because she knows another guy but dont know who to go with, me or him. I told her I'll give her some time to sort things out and she can tell me who she wants to go with and i'll respect and accept her decision.<br><br>Another week or so passed by when she broke another piece of news to me, that she had sex with this guy. But then I have fallen so deep into this relationship that im prepared to overlook it if she still wants to be with me.(you can call me a love fool) She says shes sorry and she'll remain to me faithful.... but thats not the end of the story.<br><br>Weeks drift by and so did she, shes been avoiding me for quite sometime when finally i managed to confront her and ask her whats wrong. Thats when she broke the last piece of news to me that shes still with that guy and its not possible anymore between us.<br>Crying inside me, I wished them the best and left quickly before i lose the handle of my emotions.<br><br>Anyone thinks im really dumb still to wish them the best? I think i am though. Anyway i've gotten over it<br><br>Bottom line is, i wish that girls will make up their minds and set their priorities right first...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To DangerGuy,<br><br>First time replying, I think I need to tell you. What you did isn't right. The answer is best shown by a this low-IQ person, Forrest Gump.<br><br>The girl in the movie, Gump's childhood friend, never returned Forrest Gump's affection for her. But guess what, did Gump ever said "to hell with her!" ?? In fact, what I saw really touched my heart. Gump never ever wavered, and never ever gave up. He never ever act 'tao' at his girl, even though she had ignored him or didn't keep her promise, or didn't reply his countless mail from Vietnam.<br><br>Man, how can he do it? I thought, he's stupid! No, he's right. You should never treat  your friend like that, eye for an eye. If you're sincere in your love, will you be willing to sacrifice for her? Love has got to be kind, I mean that's obvious right? all you need is a pure heart.<br><br>Decide that no matter how your girl (The one you're eyeing) is gonna ignore you, just take in your stride, don't retaliate. Be yourself, and be nice to her, and I think she'll appreciate you, slowly, even though you're not going to be her stead. I know that's gonna be a painful. Even if things don't turn out as you wish, she may still be a good friend to you after all.<br><br>relationships take time to build, and you shouldn't have stop goin' out together just because you're fed up? that's kind of selfish. Learn to be more giving than receiving. If in the end, she says stop, well just shrug your shoulders, and start with someone else. As long as you know that YOU did NOT compromise your good character because someone didn't treat you the way you like, you actually end up being a better person in this way.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think that most times, people make decisions on how they feel...and getting ditched for another person is really not a doozy...:-)  Forrest Gump was a bit simple...Yes he felt pain and emotional pain also, but I think that being simple has it's advantages.<br><br>For "simpler" people (I won't use the politically correct name because I feel that it makes it more obvious and ur just patronizing them,...)They have a one track mind.  If they want something, they will just go after it and usually pain doesn't register to them as effectively as most other people.  Most probably forrest didn't realise why he kept getting dogged by that girl.  it probably didn't register that the pain she was causing him meant that she didn't want him around.  Also, we can't spend our entire adult life pining after one girl who keeps ditching us...it's just not realistic.  Most people would have a better chance going out and trying with someone else...<br><br>Just my humble opinion.<br><br>But that's a sad story none-the-less LindaRae.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Jeshua,<br><br>I don't disagree with your view that love has to be unconditional. But one has to consider several factors before you can classify it as love.<br><br>In the show, Forest Gump grew up with that girl, she was the one that gave him confidence and all. She supported him when he was bullied, so that really is no doubt why Forest fell in love with her.<br><br>But in real life does that happen often? Everytime we even question the very existence of "Love at First sight", it brings to light one thing, there really is no such thing. Firstly, Love is an emotion that is bred between two individuals. In fact the so called love at first sight thing should be more appropriately phrased attraction at first sight.<br><br>So until that particular girl would be willing to open up herself to allow love to even grow, there really is no love, just attraction. Moreover, she was on the rebound of a relationship, which makes more sense to even avoid getting emotionally attched to her. In fact after that incident, she got attached to one of my friends......<br><br>So the arguement of love being there to conquer all is not one which I can follow unless there already exists a love between her and myself. If she was there to support me all the way just as the girl in the Forest Gump movie did, through thick and thin, I would have no doubt of giving her that unconditional sacrifice.<br><br>So the move I made at that time, I guess saved both of us much heartache and I still believe it is the correct decision.<br><br>Cheers!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Madzzie,<br>No I did not retaliate in anyway because I always hated showing my feelings to others especially if the situation is the result of that person, then i definately would not say anything to him/her. Its like a ticking timebomb event, most of the anger hatred and sadness stays in and never comes out. Though I havent came to the point which i explode yet and i dont think i ever will.<br>Yes, I'll sleep with her if i know that she truely still loves me.<br><br>The weirdest incidents always happen to me, but it doesnt seem too appropriate to post on this topic. When the topic comes I'll share my memories with you guys and gals out there.<br><br>Regards,<br>Llyndarae</div>
