            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, think there's too much here to look at. I would just take the easier way out &amp; give my opinions on musicwhiz's original posting.<br><br>How a girl indicates that she likes a guy?<br>Personally, if I'm on friendship terms with that guy, I would call him up more frequently. Even if just to chat about mundane everyday happenings. I would also tend to over-utilise his pager. Leaving silly messages about small things I felt like sharing, or simply wishing him a good day blah blah blah. Also, the thought of him would constantly pop up in my head, making me smile unconsciously to myself, sometimes leaving me in a most awkward situation. Due to these constant thoughts about him, I would ask him out more often (against my ego's will that is). Even short meetings eg. for lunch, would satisfy my soul a lot. Haha..and to say the truth, most of my gal friends feel this too <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>But on the other hand, if I don't really know that guy, I would be much more held back. Nevertheless, I may drop hints here &amp; there to unleash my emotions occasionally. I would pay more attention to his life. What he enjoys doing, his opinions about things, his family, &amp; basically everything about him.<br>But I would be very discreet when I try to find out about him. Guess this is to avoid unnecessary embarrassments or uncomfortable situations for both him &amp; myself.<br><br>I think many girls out there are still pretty restrained when it comes to expressing their interest in guys. I have a number of female friends who would go to any extent to hide their affections for guys. They don't dare to call the guys up, talk to the guys alone and some even run away when they see the guys around.<br><br>It is all very subjective really. Depends on how much the girl likes the guy, &amp; also her attitude towards bgrs.<br><br>What kinds of guys may attract me?<br>I would say that maturity of thought &amp; intelligence (or at least the capability to sustain interesting conversations) are very important to me. Having his own mind also appeals to me a whole lot. I would hate being constantly around someone who agrees with my every wimp. However, MCPs are greatly unwelcomed. Besides these, respect must exist for me &amp; my life. And of course, it would be suitably returned.<br><br>Don't think I would go into the physical aspects. There never existed a requirement for that in my mind to be frank. I've been attracted to guys on both tips of the scale before. Sometimes, I'm surprised by myself.<br>I guess the most attractive guys are the ones who are not afraid to be themselves &amp; do the things they feel are right.<br><br>Hope I answered your queries adequately <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's a list<br><br>Wide, easy smiles accompanied with a relaxed face.She blushes<br>frequently and her skin tone become redder.<br><br>She maintains eye contact throughout and her pupils are dilated (they<br>become larger). She would often blink more frequently than usual and her<br>eye lashes flutter. You might even notice a sparkle in her eye. The eyes are<br>windows to the soul Andrea one of the most accurate ways of telling if she is<br>attracted to you.<br><br>Subconscious biting of the lips or showing of the tongue, wetting her lips<br>or even chewing her fingernails.<br><br>While talking, she is slowly stroking her cocktail glass (or any cylindrical<br>object) up and down with her thumb and index finger. (reveals what she is<br>thinking of, if you get my meaning) She might also be fiddling with her<br>jewelry.<br><br>She starts sitting up and her arms aren't limp. If her crossed leg is<br>pointing in your general direction and rocking back and forth.<br><br>She adjusts the tone and pitch of her voice to match yours. In fact, any<br>sigh that she is mimicking you can be taken as a sign of interest. For<br>example, laughing in unison or crossing her legs if you've crossed yours.<br><br>She winks at you in the middle of a conversation or even from a distance.<br>This means she really is interested in you. Even exposing the palms of her<br>hand facing you show that she might be interested in you as it has been<br>proven to be a subconscious sign telling you that she has nothing to hide.<br><br>She twirls her hair around her fingers or perhaps strokes her hair lightly<br>with her hand while maintaining eye contact.</div>
