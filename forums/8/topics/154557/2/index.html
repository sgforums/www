Why?? the answer is this :<br><br>we were once under the British; our parents told us that white is more superior....<br><br>Now-------&gt; This should be changed. In this old day, we called Britain, THE GREAT BRITAIN. Now we call it, britain as it is NO LONGER GREAT!!!!<br><br>So, our asian girls should change their mindset. If you really love the person for who he is, that is great.... so so please do not live in the past!!!!</div></blockquote>I was brought up to think white skin is nothing great - they are as human as we are ,  just a lil bit too liberal with physical contact . My dad hated the british and he still dislikes them - he calls 'em bastards. That is why he gets along with the irish - he reckons they had alot of gumption to fight the brits for independence. In general , if you are white and you work with my father , you won't have an easy time dealing with him.<br><br>Why do we even care that an asian girl go out with some white guy? oooh Big HOO HAA...wah lau like my mother ....<br><br>The girls make their own choices - if they want to be a white man's whore - it is their choice. If they want to meet a genuinely nice white guy - it is also their choice. If they want to marry asian - also their choice. Want to fool around with asian - also their choice.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it's a cycle. On one hand, most ang moh's arrive in asia and are usually a bit lost. They go to a place that feels "western", an example of which would be Clark Quay. Or their officemates tell them to go to Zouk or Attica. And what happens there? SPGs throw themselves at them, which usually results in lots of sex, with the SPG telling them all sorts of sweet B.S. just to keep their sugar-daddy. So what are these ang moh's supposed to think?? "Shit, I've died and gone to heaven! All these girls throwing themselves at me!!". This then leads asian men to think the ang moh's are just horny, and leads the ang moh's to think the asian women are easy. It's just what they got exposed to!!<br><br>If an asian man went to europe, and felt a bit lost, then went to a bar and had white women throwing themselves at him, he'd think the same thing.</div>

S.</div></blockquote>Ah I had an interesting discussion about that with my ang moh friend. He knows how liberal western culture is and he doesn't really like it but he tolerates it .<br><br>His parents were childhood sweet hearts and they are still together after 40 over years. He was brought up in a stable and loving home so he is looking out for that type of future like his parents had.   Not all ang mohs are all about free sex and all . Just that when they are teenagers , peer pressure gets to them about sex and drugs and every sh*t choice. Once they settle down , they are perfectly ok.<br><br>Well  , if you know you are not as romantic as an ang moh , start reading up on how to court a girl instead of sticking to old traditional ways of waiting for momsy to do matchmaking . Times have changed, move on with the program</div>

Oh wait , genocides of native americans until the war of independence where the americans continued what the british started . They also created a lawrence of arabia to split the arabs up but it failed and Lawrence of arabia went into disrepute because he was one individual 'non loyal' british subject who did something according his conscience for the arabs. Oh yes who created the palestinian israeli conflict by carving up palestine.  Northern Ireland is occupied by a majority of  those of english and scottish descent . Ireland is occupied by irish - wait no wonder northern ireland doesn't want back into ireland. Ask any irish republican what they think of the brits - they will tell u they are bastards - in fact I know a few irish who hate being called pommies (prisoner of her majesty - degradatory term for brits in australia now) because they are not part of the commonwealth and they are a republic now. The scots and welsh were also oppressed by the brits .<br><br>Who surrendered singapore to the japanese because they were short sighted not to use tanks? We got freed because americans drop bombs on the japanese.  Then the british comes back and tries to push those who suffered under the war about like their servants.<br><br>Come on lah , the british are no saints. I don't exactly condemn them but I won't praise them either. Factually , I would say they did so much for the world , they messed it up in total.</div>

I don't think we can ever resolve it, but i just would like to give my honest opinion on these things.<br><br>First of all, i would admit that i DO like white men a little more than Asian men, i also like hispanic men, basically, women like men! To me, i was lucky enough to find a nice decent white man as my boyfriend but i didnt go to some club to pick em up or anything, not in a SPG way. Im sure there are people who walk along the streets thinking that i am a SPG but those people dont know who i am or what i do. Only people who know who i am will not label me as that.<br><br>It does hurt that some insensitive singaporean people call me SPG just because i have a white boyfriend because these shallow people just cant even fathom the fact that we can be in love. Is the world just too cold or too harsh that you feel that ALL white people go around shagging every weekend in clubs, pubs, etc?<br><br><span style="color: red;">Again, i cant blame people's opinion on that because its girls like Au Revoir who give girls like me a bad name. </span><br>Simply put, white men, asian men, black men.... they are all the same. There are sooo many chinese guys who also do the whole one night stand thing, and any othe race as well. Is it because asian men feel inferior to the white men that make them spout remarks like "You're only going out with him because he has a huge Cxxx?", "You're only going out with him because he's rich", etc...<br><br>this is just soooo not true! There are white people who work hard in Singapore and they arent rich, or are struggling to pay their bills and stuff. I know one of such people. White men are not necessarily rich Bianca, and they are not always attractive!<br><br>It is really upsetting to read such horrible comments about white people because my boyfriend and i have penpals ive known since i was 15 who are white. Those people u meet in clubs, read about in newspapers with a sick shallow lifestyle are just a minor fraction of the other white people who are sitting at home instead.<br><br>To me, to find someone who finally understands you, loves you in the way u want to be love, shows his/her affections the way u like it, respects you for who you are, is then worthy to be my boyfriend. NOT his skin colour.<br><br>You can be asian/white/hispanic/middle-eastern/black.... you are all the same, u are all the HUMAN RACE.<br><br>Grow up Bianca, the only way to get rich is to study hard, work hard and work even harder. Being rich isnt a one way ticket to happiness.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

It had to fight a few countries at once during WWII do u think that SIngapore would be that important?<br><br></div></blockquote>what about the genocide of millions of indigenous populations around caused by the brits?<br><br>Ho ho ho ...uk is made up of scotland and wales ...want to know how to british suppressed em , hunny? They raped their women and oppressed /killed the men  - so that they have get lil half breeds running around and not objecting to their rule. That is why northern ireland never wants back in into main ireland - too many british/scottish descendants there.<br><br>What about the opium war ? wait ...now they are having problems with heroin junkies everywhere ...retribution came hard ...retribution came fast.<br><br>What about the carving up of the middle east which gives us the middle east conflict?<br><br>Want to tell my dad why the british had segregative laws in their rule of singapore? Yellow skin backdoor ....white skin big nice entrance . Some restuarants are white only ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> . Why do you think people wanted independence from them since you think they are so great?  .<br><br>OH ya ...british took away the war compensation paid by the japanese to singapore, and placed it in their coffers . EXPLAIN THAT!<br><br>So don't BS me . For every good they did , they did equal or more bad with it in the world.  Oh ya , it is very good if you are  anglo saxon in those good old imperialistic  days .....too bad  if you are irish/scottish/asian.<br><br>If you want to be nationalistic about uk - go to uk forums and declare your allegiance to uk. Here I prefer facts.  British Imperialism caused enough trouble, they are still being bastards with their foreign policies as well. Look at Iraq !<br><br>The difference between you and I  - I am no white worshipper - I treat them as I would treat other singaporeans , like fallible human beings they are . You seem to worship the ground they walk in unfortunately.<br><br>So by defending uk so much  , you are actually contradicting yourself.  There is no equality for you - you seem to think a white country is the basis for the world getting better and ignoring the problems caused by the Imperialism of Britain.<br><br>Now China , opium war - boxer rebellion country , who was carved up by european countries who unfortunately cannot colonise the chinese , since OUR culture is so ancient - is faring pretty well to become a soon to be superpower ,  for a country who wasn't under british rule.  Singapore could have been worse off without the british but it could have been better off as well ...that is something no one will ever know .  Don't bring africa up ....u see africa getting any better? That is one heck of a lousy answer ...uk paying off african debts...who dabbled with africa in the first place ? MOST OF THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES including your precious UK.<br><br></div>
