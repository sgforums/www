            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I am getting soooooo tired of this whole debate on the whole SPG issue. I don't think we can ever resolve it, but i just would like to give my honest opinion on these things.<br><br>First of all, i would admit that i DO like white men a little more than Asian men, i also like hispanic men, basically, women like men! To me, i was lucky enough to find a nice decent white man as my boyfriend but i didnt go to some club to pick em up or anything, not in a SPG way. Im sure there are people who walk along the streets thinking that i am a SPG but those people dont know who i am or what i do. Only people who know who i am will not label me as that.<br><br>It does hurt that some insensitive singaporean people call me SPG just because i have a white boyfriend because these shallow people just cant even fathom the fact that we can be in love. Is the world just too cold or too harsh that you feel that ALL white people go around shagging every weekend in clubs, pubs, etc?<br><br>Again, i cant blame people's opinion on that because its girls like Au Revoir who give girls like me a bad name.<br><br>Simply put, white men, asian men, black men.... they are all the same. There are sooo many chinese guys who also do the whole one night stand thing, and any othe race as well. Is it because asian men feel inferior to the white men that make them spout remarks like "You're only going out with him because he has a huge Cxxx?", "You're only going out with him because he's rich", etc...<br><br>this is just soooo not true! There are white people who work hard in Singapore and they arent rich, or are struggling to pay their bills and stuff. I know one of such people. White men are not necessarily rich Bianca, and they are not always attractive!<br><br>It is really upsetting to read such horrible comments about white people because my boyfriend and i have penpals ive known since i was 15 who are white. Those people u meet in clubs, read about in newspapers with a sick shallow lifestyle are just a minor fraction of the other white people who are sitting at home instead.<br><br>To me, to find someone who finally understands you, loves you in the way u want to be love, shows his/her affections the way u like it, respects you for who you are, is then worthy to be my boyfriend. NOT his skin colour.<br><br>You can be asian/white/hispanic/middle-eastern/black.... you are all the same, u are all the HUMAN RACE.<br><br>Grow up Bianca, the only way to get rich is to study hard, work hard and work even harder. Being rich isnt a one way ticket to happiness.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do agree that white guy like to think asian girls are easy targets to fool around with.  I too see many asian girls feel proud to have white ang moh as BF.  Why?? Why?? the answer is this :<br><br>we were once under the British; our parents told us that white is more superior....<br><br>Now-------&gt; This should be changed. In this old day, we called Britain, THE GREAT BRITAIN. Now we call it, britain as it is NO LONGER GREAT!!!!<br><br>So, our asian girls should change their mindset. If you really love the person for who he is, that is great.... so so please do not live in the past!!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, true also about personality. I used to be against this..but like they say..sometimes the more u are against it.. the more it will come. My older sis gonna get married with a white guy. They been going out for like 5 yrs n now engaged.. man.. i have to admit that no other asian dudes have ever managed to get along with my sis. Coz they always tell me they feel inferior. Well wish u all the best UKDECAY  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
