            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm,i think that it is possible ,but very hard to survive as a full time sportsman as the pay is quite low,somemore i know that a lot of sportsman wanna be full time,but can't because of the bread and butter issues  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">))</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That may not be true, I know for sure that bowling can and will bring prestige to Singapore.<br><br>It is really based alot on technique and not so much of size which us Asians lack of tremendously. I believe that Singapore could do very well in bowling and beat the Western counterparts even.<br><br>As soon as it is an official game in the Olympic Games, I'm sure Singapore will be able to add to that famous Weightlifting silver medal!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>------------------<br>Masturbated once and fucked twice - Story of Man United against Real Madrid</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that it is hard to be a full time sportsperson here. why so? The govt or sports body give an allowance but then again, it is only so far as you can deliver results and how sure can we be that we will be able to deliver for a long period of time against competiton locally and against foreigners? The income stream is too unsteady. Once you do not meet the criteria, you are out with nothing. In our society, not many of us can afford that kind of risk whereby you may be suddenly left without any allowance and job as well as lack of good qualifications(because of commitment to training) to help you get a job.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My fren is the first professional tennis player in SG...and having an economics degree...he is having a pay of 3000 SD being a full time player...it is the passion of the sport rather than the monetary gains and the training as well the pressure is so excruciating...really tough...<br>It really depends on the realm of the sports arena..if anyone really bothers to support our homegrown sportsmen</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well recently just two days ago there news on Karate team of Singapore who are heading for the world championship to be held sometime in 2002. There are certain sports in singapore that most of us have not heard about.<br>As to the question " Will sportsmen/women survive as a full time? Maybe in the Future..give about 5-10yrs time.. In the yeasr 2010 singapore might be inthe world cup who knows</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Professional sportsmen? I think u know who shd comment on this...=)) hehe<br>From "friend" who trains at a professional sports academy in the states, spore really has no future in sports. Mebbi it also depends on certain sports...<br>My "friend" trains tennis with the andre agassi's coach. But due to his size and physique, it is only natural that we sporeans will lose out to others.<br>It just depends on what sport you want to participate in. Something that doesnt require physique, we might have that chance. For ex, table tennis, bowling....<br>Sports like tennis, rugby, soccer....NO HOPE.<br>Unless we import foreigners.<br>It's just the law of nature, no one can defy that. Some ppl r gd in this n others r good in other stuff....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Government not very supportive in term of sports. Those sportsmen/sportswomen cannot concentrate on full time training like some other country. They need to work in order to survive and use their personal time for training. Money will only be rewarded when they won in competition.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The fact is that more most sports that don't bring in the medals,it is next to impossible surviving by being a full time sportsman/woman as if you dun bring in the medals,they dun give you the cash,simple logic  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">))</div>
