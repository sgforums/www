The phone itself costs around $600 (as they order in bulk of XXXX units) Shipping averages on $27.50 per phone. Customs duty/import tax comes around the 30% of the phone.<br><br>Being an electronic good, the threat of rapid depreciation is there. I rather sell at a price people are 'comfortable' to part their money with rather than jacking the price up that only a selected few can afford it.<br><br>Who do you think will sell more iphones?
