            <div class='col-md body'><strong>S$47.00 one-way<br>Depart at Grand Copthorne Waterfront Plaza at Havelock Road</strong><br><br>Unless the coach offer fantastic services like inside bus attendent or built-in toilet or plasma TV etc, it is just way too expensive!!! Even take from Beach Road also cost Sing dollars ard 25 - 30. Go Larkin JB is Ringgit 25 - 30.<br><br>Those who want to save trouble can start off from Singapore. Those who want adventure and save money can take 170 from msia customs to larkin bus terminal and then purchase tickets there.<br><br>If your trip clash with holiday, it is advisable to buy tickets much earlier and maybe refrain from taking bus from Larkin cuz it will be so packed and price will jack up so high without control unlike Spore which is controlled in a way.<br><br>Alternative is to take train from Tanjong Pagar station. Try take express service line but then from KL railway station to Puduraya bus terminal a bit distance away and further from the B. Bintan/Times Square area.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You can try Transtar if you don't mind the cost, S$56 (To) &amp; $39 (back), stops at Pasaraykat bus terminal, just behind Bukit Bintang.  If you know the way, you can walk, its about 15-20 minutes (for my pace, about 10min) to Marriot/KL plaza (opposite Regent hotel), Sungei Wang plaza &amp; Lot 10 is nearby.  Coach with attendance and serve 1 meal + drinks. Individual console, more like business class airline seats, you select your own movies, cartoon, KTV video, massage chair, 16 seater coach, 2nd link way, etc.....  Was there last Nov. with this coach, not bad except for the price. no SURCHARGE during peak    (www.transtar.com.sg)<br><br>Some one mentioned about the Copthorne hotel bus service, it had already shifted to Copthorne Waterfront hotel in town. you can also check out the website.           www.aeroline.com.my (or sg).<br><br>5 Star also offers such services (~S$90 return), but the time is fixed (enquired during NATAS fair), this is a new service, likely, I believe are other such luxury service which I saw at NATAS fair but wasn't that interested due  schedule of departure.<br><br>I took this coach instead from Global holidays at Novena Square, just trying out and also save me some $200 in coach cost.  they charge $30 single and $50 return to KL stopping at Bangsar LRT.  No surcharge for peak or school holiday &amp; eve of holidays, travel by 2nd link way.  There is also a seating lounge for travellers both in SG &amp; KL office (some light makan + drinks).  The only catch is, you need to find your way to KL hotel, which I thought initially kind of hassle, but after the trip, realise not that difficult to get taxi either.  Average fare to KL Bukit Bintang where I stayed is ~RM10.  I pay extra cause I had my mum-in-law, wife &amp; 3 kids with me.  You are expected to pay extra for luggages, etc.. just like old time SG in the olden days, always ask for meter charging.<br><br>For the adventurous one travelling during this holiday season, I would suggest, taking single trip on any coach service, but travel by Transtar on the return (S$39) because its more worth it than the 26 seaters, which charges at $26 (S) &amp; $52 for return but comes with surcharge $10/trip.  I hope my info still not out of date.<br><br>Kontsorium charges $45 return to KL only to Pudu station but with $3 fuel surcharge, not sure its for both way or per trip, trip stopping at hotels and else are priced differently<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe if your intention is to save money to spend in KL and Genting then a comfortable no frills bus coach is ok already. If so many stops along the way and got food tv etc are actually counted into the hefty ticket price of S$40+.<br><br>For me I prefer to save my money to spend more in KL rather than fork out for a too luxurious bus coach trip.

            <div class='col-md body'>Forgot to mentioned that Global holidays only charges 50% for children, which I think none of the coach agents offer such discounts.  In fact, all will charge adult fair for children.  I am not advertising for them, but I think it serves me well and I don't mind going with them again.  However, it does not mean global holiday package is cheap, you are you own judge and do your home work before making any decision.<br><br>Sorry, I got Konsortium name wrongly. below is their website:<br><br>www.konsortium.com.sg<br></div>

More like marching or even faster than marching.. can you imagine I walked from KL Plaza to Chinatown in just 17 minutes.. last month when I was there.... not that I enjoy doing it.. I perspired so much and soaping wet.. but due to lack time and I did some searching find short cuts around.<br><br>for me, budget is one main concern, so I would rather spend more in KL than in coach.  Besides, I do bring along a portable DVD player along, but guess of no use on the coach.  This is due to vibration  on the road, the sytem could not track the sudden vibration due to travelling.. so in the end.. ha..ha.. I learn my lesson.  Why do you think Shinco came out with a portable player that only comes with HDD and not disc player.. that's precisely the reason.<br><br>My portable players are meant for my children to be entertained to beatr their boredom during the stay....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You can go from JB if you like and the best place is from LARKIN (not Karlin) and 44 seater buses cost RM21 upwards.  I prefer the 25 seater "VIP" buses at least cos they are more comfortable and they cost RM30 upwards.<br><br>If you are going from Singapore you are spoilt for choice.  In my opinion, Beach Road is the best departure point (I live in the east) mainly because you can have your pick of bus companies from Sri Maju, Transtar, Five Star, Grassland, Konsortium and many more...  Just go to Golden Mile Complex, (you know the place which is like little Thailand) and ask.  Prices start from S$27 up for 25 seater bus.<br><br>Also note that prices depend sometimes on demand and supply.  Do not be surprised to be quoted a higher price during peak periods such as now which is school holidays.  Also buy your return tickets early ... sunday afternoon tickets back to Singapore are always quickly sold out.  AND DO NOT BUY FROM road side peddlers promoting their bus tickets ... You risk being stranded at JB or Woodlands instead of Beach Road and they never leave on time.  Sometimes, they wait till enough passengers before they leave... If you are desperate, give it a shot.  Better to take a schedule bus to JB if tickets to Singapore are sold out.  Very easy to get to Singapore from JB right?<br><br>I prefer to skip the hassle of going to JB (Larkin)  The savings is not worth the time wasted.  Also, I prefer to depart around midnight cos I sleep in the bus. I find travelling in the day a waste of time and the trip is longer cos of heavier traffic.  Expect a 5 hr trip (give or take) depending on traffic and causeway situation.<br><br>I go up to KL at least every other week and my preference is Sri Maju and Konsortium cos they leave exactly on time and I find them cheap, comfortable and reliable.  Of course there are the "Premier" buses as well like Nice and Transtar .. "nice" but not necessary for me.<br><br>Staying in Bukit Bintang area is your best bet ... lots of choices Eg: Federal Hotel, Radius International, Allson Genesis, Regent, Hotel Istana, and even budget hotels like Katari &amp; Pudu Hoste near Pudu Bus Station where most of the buses bring you.  Bt Bintang is also the most happening place for shopping, makan and pubbing etc but I wouldn't know much about this cos I go to KL as part of my job.<br><br>Any search on the net will give you lots of info ... there are even backpacker guest houses which are really great at Tengkat Tong Shin Area behind Bt Bintang Eg Eight Guest House, Green Hut, Red Palm etc  Prices start from RM 20 for a dorm room bed and RM 60 for a double room (2 persons) Cheap and clean if you just want a place to sleep.<br><br>Hope it helps ... PM me if you want to know more<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aye..<br><br>Few years ago, I took a shared taxi for RM120 only 31/2 hour journey, with two friends. For only afew SG$ more.. why suffer on a bus. Even brings you to where you want to go.. if its not too far along the Taxi route.<br><br>Cheap food.. yeah.... Esp loved their version of Bak Kut Teh served in a large pot..  and must try their street side TomYum Soup with live prawns (only 40RM), even supply tissue. Had it in 3am. Shiok.. spicy like hell.<br><br>Plenty of street-walkers for entertainment. Had a pimp who show us and arrange everything for us. Their service seemed to be easily available.. don't need tour guide. Ensure protection from police and thugs also. The itinery was superb.. Four days of pillaging. All for RM3000+ for 3 dude. Cheap considering the nature of this expedition.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

There is an attendant, a built-in toilet and plasma TVs. Via the Tuas 2nd-Link by the way.</div>

The trains now are fully airconditioned, and very well insulated from outside noise. Definitely quieter than the air-coned SBS buses.</div>
