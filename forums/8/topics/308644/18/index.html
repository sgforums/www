              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Many of you fail to realize the importance of a relationship and kept going after each others throat to justify the relationship worth.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The relationship between a man and a woman is sacred. It is the union of 2 different genders from different blood. The man and woman will leave their own family to form their own cell. With this new union, these 2 persons share their possessions, burdens, feelings, bodies &amp; talents.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">When the time of adversity strikes, the two will react as one to defend each other and keep each other afloat. When the time of delight comes, both must share the luxury within themselves.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">When one falls down, the other will go and assist the other up. This is when couples stick together even when one is on prolong illness which can potentially drain the couple’s finance. Therefore no matter how bad the situation is, the couple will stay knitted together.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">If anyone need the other half to be attractive or rich, then how shallow can they go. For when the time of adversity comes, you will be jettisoned off the raft selfishly.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I have had my own fair share of being looked down upon during my army days. And how people changes their attitude when seen with my current achievements. These are not people whom you should bother. For a relationship has never and will never become a transaction.</span></span></p>

              <p>Me and friend had this discussion and we agreed that women here are moving backwards in terms of equality.</p>
              <p>At a training program where we both attended, there were presentations to be done. And when it was our turn to present, the ladies in our groups (3 of them) tasked us to present. And the reason they gave us was "Because you all guys mah!"</p>
              <p>Damnit! Does that mean you girls should stay back at home and cook for us, don't go out there and work? Why? Because you female mah! Dumb cruts.</p>
              <p>But yea, the previous date I had, we went out pretty often, not once during dinner did she offer to pay. She feign ignorance when I requested to go dutch.</p>
              <p>Local women demanding? Well maybe not all of them. But most of them are. I know of this girl who doesn't bring her wallet out when she goes out with her bf, and her reasoning was that he will pay for everything. Nice! real nice, don't you guys want to be girls? Mutiple orgasms, monthly excuse to get mad for no reason, lots of clothes to buy!</p>

If a good-looking, well-dressed and eloquent foreign guy walks up to you, an Sg girl at the pub and strikes a conversation that makes you laugh and feel good (and being rich, he picks up the tab over 2 weeks) and asks to be your bf, would you agree to go to his place, a 1st-class hotel or even his boat when he suggests it?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #339966;">No wait.. there will always b 60 percent of guys still willing to give in. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #339966;">Reason? because there will always b girls who make use of their pretty looks and make use of guys to do this and that. ANd there will always b guys who think that by doing this they will win their hearts.</span></p>

If a good-looking, well-dressed and eloquent foreign guy walks up to you, an Sg girl at the pub and strikes a conversation that makes you laugh and feel good (and being rich, he picks up the tab over 2 weeks) and asks to be your bf, would you agree to go to his place, a 1st-class hotel or even his boat when he suggests it?</p>

              <p>for the guys , do you think they deserve to criticise our expectations ?</p>
              <p>they go around having flings , there are abuse cases , there are male chauvinists .</p>
              <p>but on the other extreme , there are guys who stay faithful to one girl , gives her his everything and wishes the best for her .</p>
              <p>similarly , there are girls like that . those who go around cheating guys of their feelings and money , while others who gives her all in every relationship she has and not expecting any returns .</p>
              <p>every individual is different .</p>
              <p>your expection may be different from hers .</p>
              <p>how can people just generalize .</p>
