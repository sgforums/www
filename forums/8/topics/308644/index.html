              <p>Women are indeed strange creatures. They lobbied for equal rights. They fought for equal opportunities. "<em>Down with male chauvinism!</em>" So much rhetoric, so much furore. Yet, it begs one to ponder on a question: So why is the Women's Charter still in place then?</p>
              <p>In Norway, a 2003 law requires every publicly traded company to have a certain number of women on its board or risk being shut 
              down. News abound that women were being appointed as directors, whose qualification is simply being, well, women.</p>
              <p>Singaporean men are willing to marry foreign brides. But are Singapore women ready to marry foreign men? Cut out the expats, that is.</p>
              <p>Perhaps men will have the last laugh after all.</p>

              <p>Why compare? Are we Danish, japanese or others?? So if u guys like foreign women, go ahead, date and marry them. No one can or is going to stop you. We can find foreign guys too ya. Foreign guys treat us more equally, good gentlemenship, romantic, and most importantly, they do not harbour a male chauvinist culture like our locals do.</p>

              <p>with the issue on mind for debate, however, i must say that please bear in mind dat we do not generalise all singapore women.</p>
              <p>When girls are more "spoiled", you cannot run away. This equats to the upbringing of girls in our today's society.</p>
              <p>When sending ur gf home, carry their bags for dem, carry their shopping stuff are seen as gentlemanly actions, however i must say too much of it will spoil everything. Guys must noe how not to overdo it and girls must noe where is their limit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so what</p>
              <p>"<em>If they are some babe (I mean, real one, not self-proclaimed), they can expect that</em>."</p>
              <p>does it mean a so called real "babe" can do this? it just shows the character of a spoiled girl, which unfortunately, guys often goes with their lust rather than heart.</p>

              <p>Exactly.<br>what it shows is the hypocrisy and shallowness of a guy who think that way.</p>
              <p>It is quite sad isn't it if he lets a girl's looks govern his own behaviour. It is as if he has no idea or any principles of his own behaviour.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>that's why it is important for girls to find a guy who treats PEOPLE well. not just chiobus.</p>

              As long they can live on their own they will ask the men "wat else can u give me?". On equal term mean she also can have sex partner. Strong minded career woman don't need a weak man, they rather dun trust love with career come first. 
              
              But many had forget wat couple can made a diff, mental support. 
              
              SAD will bring unbalance in mental deveplment at mid 40-50. That kind of support which friends and family can't give can bring about mental breakdown if one needed.
              
              So don't think that success is everything, lonely will kill u slowly.

              <p><br>In a femine world, we gals like to be dated by guys, however dating is alway misintrepreted by guys as something successful, to us, it is only an invitation, and when u invite someone, do u expect that someone to foot the bills or rather treat him/her as your guest who is good enough in accepting your invitation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, in my experience, local guys expected bigger return in dating, to them, it like an investment, a return of being their steady gf, care for them, love them and even sex with them. And when they failed in their investment, they go lame, depressed and start blaming we local gals as not up to mark or up to their expectation.</p>
