              <p>Question: If SG womens have <strong>expectations</strong>, is it reasonable to have <strong>demands</strong> on them too? Case in point: National Service (NS).</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Extract from <em>Wikipedia</em></span>:<br>" Some countries that draft women include <strong><span style="color: #333399;">Cuba</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color: #333399;">Israel</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color: #333399;">North Korea</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color: #333399;">Libya</span></strong>, and <strong><span style="color: #333399;">Eritrea</span></strong>. In 2002, <strong><span style="color: #333399;">Sweden</span></strong>'s
                  government asked the army to consider mandatory military service for
                  women. Some have considered the practice of excluding women from the
                  draft unfair, because they feel it goes against principles of equality.
                  Some simply argue that women can be militarily useful, and that
                  excluding them places an unnecessary limit on resources. During World
                  War II, women were drafted into the armed forces of the <strong><span style="color: #333399;">United Kingdom</span></strong> and the <strong><span style="color: #333399;">Soviet Union</span></strong>. The <strong><span style="color: #333399;">United States</span></strong> came close to drafting women into the <span class="mw-redirect">Nurse Corps</span> in preparation for a planned invasion of Japan; the Japanese surrender made this unnecessary. "</p>
              <p>Since <span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Singapore</strong></span> is facing a shortage in boys for our national defence, perhaps it might be a good example to follow our neighbour up north and start having female conscripts too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="icon_neutral.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: The last time I checked, women from those countries are still the child-bearers. So ladies, the <em>I-have-to-bear-child-and-what-have-you</em> stance isn't so strong anymore.</p>

              <p>opening the door for women is perfectly fine. guys shld always let the women go 1st n not walk behind the women. last but not least look in the mirror ask yrself what quality women have 2 demand all these. this a realistic world. n some women like to create drama mama sometimes 2 get attention inferiority complex make issues big want guys 2 fawn upon them.</p>

              <p>The primary reason why sggals are being termed as selfish, high expectation and all is perhaps our failure to see the larger picture.</p>
              <p>In every society and culture, there are bound to be jerks who ruined one's life financially and psychologically. Such undesirable act will then be spread like wild fire among the locals which eventually evolved into social norms -- e.g. we associates PRC as conman, Thai as transsexual and ... the list goes on.</p>
              <p>Besides, using "in general" as an argument to term sggals as "bad" people is not justifiable. Worst still, saying foreign girls are generally better is utterly rubbish.</p>
              <p>Y? My questions to u are:"how confident are u that u won't get conned by a foreign lady? how confident are u that a foreign lady won't squander all ur hard-earned $$? how confident are u that a foreign lady won't place high expectation on u?"</p>
              <p>I agree that we guys shouldn't become slaves of gals but occasional pampering is essential to keep the r/s fire burning. Ultimately, u want a gf who cares for u, and in turn u treat her with everything u got right? BUT BUT is this gf easy to find? It is obvious right. U say u can find this kind of girl oversea but how sure are u, given the great difference in the culture and lifestyle? </p>
              <p>So guys, especially Catknight, its time to wake up from ur fantasy that sggals are bad and foreign are good. U will never know that a sggal with genuine heart is waiting for u.  </p>

              <p>Who should be blamed here? U are just simply blinded by love. $60 just to go out with a girl? If u ever want to date a gal, make sure go Dutch first. If she turns off, ha good for u, otherwise ur wallet one big hole.</p>
              <p>I once spend $90 at waraku with a girl i like but it is a date plus "thanks for recommending job to me" dinner. Somemore, she got insist of footing her portion but i refused cos i wanted to thanks her for the recommendation. Though the initial intention is a date.</p>
              <p>Learn to identify good gals and treat them well when u ever gotten one. It is like striking a $1 million toto trust me.  </p>

              <p>see women home? if the women drunk or very late at night the guy driving its best to ensure safety see her home. otherwise women got legs dont know how 2 go hm? still small kid? if the woman stay one end of sg frm the guy n the guy is just an nsf not driving its not feasible for the guy to send the woman hm in taxi with midnight surcharge n go back hm. he can always get a cab for her.</p>
              <p>n pay 4 meals? if the guy an nsf supporting himself, still in sch or just started to work spare a thought for him he has to pay transport hp bills give parents money how much left. the woman shld not expect they always go n eat at rests. in the 1st place look in the mirror a qualified woman want to eat at rests its perfectly fine once in a while. otherwise just make do with pizza hut instead of da paolo.</p>
              <p>opening the door for women is perfectly fine. guys shld always let the women go 1st n not walk behind the women. last but not least look in the mirror ask yrself what quality women have 2 demand all these. this a realistic world. n some women like to create drama mama sometimes 2 get attention inferiority complex make issues big want guys 2 fawn upon them.</p>

              <p>All the other NSFs including myself are behind you bro. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>
              <p>But NS is just an excuse ya, after the 2 years we have the choice to work and pay for our girls or rely on her paying for you.</p>
              <p>I'm the kind who'll treat a girl very well but also within my limitations. Too bad i'm wearing green at the moment; makes dating such an uphill task.</p>

              <p>Is that all ?</p>
              <p>If we don't ask you men to carry our bags, you guys will finally be happy ?</p>
              <p>That's an easy one.</p>
              <p>When you are broke, why do you ask the girls to suggest a place to have their meals ? Wouldn't it be better if the guys initiate a place within his budget to have the date ?</p>
              <p>So when you are broke,do you let your girl know you are broke ?</p>
              <p>Or do you expect the girls to ALWAYS think you are broke ?</p>
