              <p> </p>
              <p>however, my gf understands tat a line has to be drawn...for eg...she doesnt ask me to carry her stuff if they arent too heavy...there have been many times when she chose to carry her own bag n to go back hm alone...usually she would go back hm alone when she knows i would miss my last bus if i sent her hm or if i needed to get hm early...we r both students so we understand each other's financial constraints...hence, for meals we usually go dutch unless its during birthdays or special occasions...</p>

              <p>It boils down on the individual relationship la. If both are willing parties, let them be lor.</p>
              <p>But i personally feel that, if guy offer help once in a while, den good lor, its a bonus. But if never offer, den girls don be so weak, carry yourself la. Handbag also not say very heavy. But grocery this type hor, it can be very heavy at times, so guys must zi dong help carry.</p>
              <p>As for paying for meals, at the beginning, I think its best to go on dutch if students unless its some rich people you are dating. Once in a while, guy pay for girl, girl pay for guy, settle. Don't be so calculative all the time.</p>
              <p>The statement that singapore girls go for rich/ foreign guys, too over generalising liao la. I'm a girl, and i think that as long as the guy is filial, cannot gamble and smoke, and have reasonable income to support a small family, can already. Too handsome later outside got a lot of problem one, and sometimes, take a good look at oneself, not pretty, what makes you think you can get handsome guy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"> Financially, after all, girls nowadays are most probably going to work in the future, so if its a double income, there shouldnt be any problem if both knows how to spend wisely. But a mcp is a big no-no.</p>

              <p>Yo, just thought i gave my opinion here.</p>
              <p>Like someone said earlier, I think it is in nobody's interests to turn this article into a battle, ST's study probably involves a subset of the population, and is not too representative. Even if it is representative, it's not "right" or "wrong" to disagree with the representation.</p>
              <p>The handbag issue: If a lady detests the idea so much because of equality or image issues , then it's simply a case of the wise guy not holding the bag. If she thinks it's thoughtful, or sweet of that guy to do so, then the smart guy will do it to score some points.</p>
              <p>The differences between men and women, SG or not, have always created tension between the two gender, but precisely because of the differences, the two gender attract one another.</p>
              <p>Girls like suave, sensitive and thoughtful yet macho men, and guys like sweet, adoring, pretty girls.</p>
              <p>Totally nothing wrong with that.</p>
              <p>The two gender are never equal, and will never be. Guys should accept that, who wants girls behaving like men anyway? Feminists who advocate for gender equality, probably will like certain things excluded, and i have no issue with that, but then some guys will disagree.</p>
              <p>Guys who hate girls who insist on being heard and respected, but lust after them anyway, cannot win. A change of attitude is recommended.</p>
              <p>Girls who find many guys too ungentlemanly and insensitive, just have to look elsewhere. No complaints about that either.</p>
              <p>Personally, I find opening a door for a girl, pretty or otherwise, a gentlemanly act. I also liked paying for bills during dates during dating times. I actually felt good doing it. Even though things between us may not work out in the end. But that's just the way it is.</p>
