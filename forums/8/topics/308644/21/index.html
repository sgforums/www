              <p>I think hor, nowadays, both guys and girls think too much.</p>
              <p>The guys who bitch about paying will most likely end up with foreign wives. Whining is not going to get them anything of standard. The girls who complain that Singaporean men are sub-standard are probably fantasizing bumping into a White Prince Charming around Clarke Quay. Doesn't happen that often, really. Singaporean women are to Ang Mor men what Vietnamese women are to Singaporean men.</p>
              <p>Hey, I don't believe relationships are about money, and neither does my partner. When I first started dating my girlfriend, I spent around $3K on our first three months alone. After that I went to school, and went totally broke. I thought that would be the end of us. The cliched No Money, No Honey. Yet, she's still around and loves me just as much, probably much more now than in the past. In fact, the situation is reversed. She's now drawing $1K monthly as a nursing student under a hospital bond and she pretty much insists on paying everytime we eat out. Me? I get by with fifty bucks for two weeks. I try my very best to pay but sometimes, I just can't. She understands and it's not an issue for her. For her, the more important issues that should be closer to our hearts is the time we spend together, my fidelity to her ;), the future we plan together.</p>
              <p>My girlfriend is a wonderful Singaporean woman. She is three years older than me. She can easily get a guy who drives her around and spends loads of dough on her. But she knows that pretty much noone can love her as much as I do. Her last boyfriend before me was a supervisor at her working place who used to drive her around for lunch breaks. Me? I was at the same company.. sweeping floors and doing other saikang for $5 an hour. I don't have anything close to a car. I sold my bicycle away so that I could afford giving her a decent anniversary present for all the unconditional love she has shown to me. Her family was shocked that she could be dating such a loser. I'm not even good-looking! But she has stood by me, ever loyal, for more than a year and I am very thankful for her patience with my shortcomings.</p>
              <p>There are good local women out here, men just have to try harder. Vice versa.</p>
              <p>Have a nice day.</p>
