            <div class='col-md body'>Just some Friday afternoon thoughts after reading EcKÂ’s reply to my posting in the Â‘What is it with butches?Â’ discussion thread. Hope to gather some opinions.<br><br>1. How would you feel and react if a _close_ friend tells you he or she is gay?<br><br>2. Would your friendship with him or her be affected after that?<br><br>3. Would your reactions be different if you found out about it through a third party?<br><br>4. Would you rather not know about your friendsÂ’ sexuality?<br><br>5. Have you ever suspected any of your friends to be gay? If yes, what arouse your suspicions?<br><br>6. Do you think the public is more understanding and accepting of homosexuality now? Or is it just a case of I-donÂ’t-care-as-long-as-they-donÂ’t-bother-me syndrome?<br><br>Hope I donÂ’t get bashed for this. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>------------------<br>'yah, it's just a phase --- those terrible guilt and struggles in life before finally coming to terms with yourself and admit that you are GAY'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm, for me..... i guess "lesbianism" and homosexuals, or even bis, are very acceptable.<br><br>1.if my close fren was homo (i'm wracking my mind to thk of any possibilities) it'll be more of a "why the hell didnt you tell me earlier?" more surprised than shocked. i'll prolly play 20 qns and drill him/her on why, when, how etc.. when he/she found out? how she/he knew? anyone they're interested in etc...<br><br>2. i guess it's pretty obv tt our frenship wldnt really be affected.<br><br>3. if i found out abt this thru someone else, it'll prolly be more anger than anythg else, "why didnt he/she tell me first?" then either confrt him/her or wait till she/he spills the beans depending on what exactly the 3rd party said.<br><br>4. erm, it's more like you wanna say you say, dun wanna say dont say lor.<br><br>5. hmm.. not exactly, cos most of us always have crushes on other gers. more like envy than anythg else though..<br><br>6. i guess rite now the general attitude is one of indif. which i guess is much better than blatant discrimination......<br><br>hmm, answered all your doubts yet?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks to EcK and ataraxia for their opinions. ItÂ’s interesting to note how different their views are.<br><br>Judging from the number of responses this thread has generated, I think I have to agree that generally the heterosexual population canÂ’t be bothered with this taboo subject. ErmÂ… perhaps Â‘as long as she is not my daughterÂ’ or Â‘itÂ’s not my husband whoÂ’s having an affair with a man behind my back when he says he has business meetings at nightÂ’.<br><br>Both EcKÂ’s and ataraxiaÂ’s responses addressed my dilemma as to whether I should or should not tell my close friends about my sexuality. On the one hand, I feel that oneÂ’s sexuality is a very personal issue and thereÂ’s really no need to mention it at all (although it is almost always assumed to be heterosexual). But on the other hand, I feel as if I am keeping some dark, in-the-closet Â‘secretÂ’ from them, especially during times when they start exchanging Â‘pointersÂ’ in front of me --- Â‘11oÂ’clock, blue spaghetti strapÂ…Â’, or prompt me with that Â‘whoÂ’s that chio babe you had lunch with at the arts canteen yesterday har? Girlfriend issit?Â’ question.<br><br>And friends shouldnÂ’t keep secrets from each other, right?<br><br>OkayÂ… I know you are going to say individuals have the rights to keep secrets. Fine. _If_ that secret will never be known to anyone else. But I know someday this Â‘secretÂ’ _will_ be let out of the bag through this someone who knows this friend of this third cousin of my hostel mate who saw me going to this *hic* gay pub along Mohamed Sultan when she was at Madam Wong, to Â‘warn my hostel mate that I may do something funny to him at nightÂ’!?! Perhaps I exaggerated a bit. And of course, going to a gay pub or mixing around with gay company doesnÂ’t necessarily imply that you _are_ gay. But when that happen, I donÂ’t wish my friends to feel angry, like what ataraxia said in his point 3.<br><br>If I should tell my closest male buddy, I face the Â‘shit-is-he-hinting-to-me-he-has-fallen-for-me-and-wants-to-fuck-my-assÂ’ problem, like what EcK feels. IÂ’m sure no matter how I try to convince him that we are just pure buddies, he will always have that uneasy feeling in his stomach after I come out to him. Volunteering a massage after a game of basketball just doesnÂ’t seem to be a simple gesture of friendship anymore. And chances are, the friendship will be affected in the long run, and we will be reduced to mere acquaintances.<br><br>Perhaps IÂ’m being paranoid here. But I can tell you the dilemma to say Â‘yesÂ’ or deny profusely when someone asks you Â‘are you gay?Â’ is very real. And in this discussion I have not included the social prejudices and family trauma I have to face upon coming out.<br><br>It feels totally suicidal not to have anyone to share these pent-up emotions with. It feels absolutely daunting not knowing how your future would be in this discriminatory world, no matter how well you do academic and otherwise. It feels like an amputation of the heart not knowing whom you can love, unlike your heterosexual counterpart who can tell a guy from a girl immediately.<br><br>In the meanwhile, I shall continue to keep the distance from my University classmates, live my assumed straight persona, brush aside the next stereotypical gay remark I hear, and wait for the day when homosexuality gets the approving nod from the public and the tons of closeted gays can let go a sigh of relief and step out of their double-locked cupboard. I wonder if I will get to see that dayÂ…<br><br>Heck! As if anyone would care anywayÂ…  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>------------------<br>'yah, it's just a phase --- those terrible guilt and struggles in life before finally coming to terms with yourself and admit that you are GAY'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Welcome aboard, 7th Son!<br><br>I really admire your courage to voice out that you are a gay. No discrimination, but I really think that you are brave. This forum cound be a place for you to speak out, when you feel nowhere else to talk about your own issues.<br><br>Nope, I am not a gay, and I don't think I will become one either. I do have lots of gays/les friends around me, so may I answer your questions ...<br><br>1. My answer is "So?"<br><br>2. Apparently not<br><br>3. Yes, of course. This will become an issue of not being trusted, not because of gossip or rumors thing.<br><br>4. Nope, why?<br><br>5. Friends are friends, no matter their "sex", they still are friends. Friendship should be measured by any other factors except "sex".<br><br>6. Yes, it has become more and more publicly accepted, but not totally. Not as compared to San Fran or Paris.<br><br>I sure will have this funny feeling that "will this friend admire me?" But that could be overcome by the power of being frank. I would tell him in the first place that I would not become one, and hopefully that message would get accross to him. As a friend, he should understand this and should not even think about pastering me. If he does, he would become the one that ruins the friendship, instead of me. I am not pushing responsibility here. If I am putting effort into a friendship, why does he want to destroy it?<br><br>I do go out with Gay/Les friends to gay/les pub and disco. Why would that make me a gay? In fact, we saw young gals holding hands while walking along shopping center, does that make them a les? But this society is still unfair, while gals can do that, guys will never be allowed to do that, u will get lots of wierd looks if so. There is nothing much we can do about it at this time, things have to be changed gradually, and soon there will be one day when public would openly accept the existence of gay/les. That does not mean everyone will turn into either one.<br><br>So, nothing to be worry about. If this friend of yours can't accept you, there would be others that would.<br><br>Cheers ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To answer 7th Son, these would be my replies:<br><br>1) I would be rather shocked because I inherently suspect everyone is heterosexual. If it was a guy I would be wary because I am afraid he might think I am gay too. If it was a girl, I will probably ask her why she does not like guys.<br><br>2) If a guy, yes it would be slightly. I would be afraid to discuss such stuff which is very strange to me. I cannot really understand why some people are homosexual so I am afraid I cannot relate. If a girl, then I can still be friends, but I will still keep the fact in mind.<br><br>3) Yes. If I found out through a third party, then probably it won't affect me that drastically. Also, teh third party may not be so credible, so I am not inclined to believe everything I hear, therefore it will not affect the friendship adversely.<br><br>4) Nope. I very much wish to know if my friends are straight or not. It would be a very important aspect of a friend which I feel I should know about (if we can trust each other as good friends).<br><br>5) Yes. Because of feminine traits in a guy (the girlish kind of behaviour), also the fact that he never had any girl friends before though he is good-looking. Plus the fact that he told another friend that he may never get married.<br>Another friend of mine I may suspect too because he never seems to get serious with girls, always treats them as friends. Also, he is quite touchy with his closer guy friends...but all this is not a really good reason to suspect also... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>6) Society is not tolerant about this. A lot of Singaporeans are still ultra-conservative. It is the case of as long as it does not affect me I don't care kind of attitude. I agree with 7th son on this.<br><br>Hope that answers your questions. Have a nice day !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To 7th Son,<br><br>Hey man, just let go of ur frustrations here...It's what I do because I can't talk to anyone else in real life...Tehat's why u see my posting about feeling drepressed and shit everytime I come back from an outing/pubbing/disco...ha ha....It's a good place to do so...and it's quite effective, because when u write ur feelings, u start to let go of the tension...and added to that is the fact that people in this forum try very hard to keep civility and a modicum of respect for other's views....so it's an ideal place to say what u wanna say...<br><br>As for ur questions:  Wel, it wouldn't really matter.  I don't see why it would matter at all...unless I was somehow homophobic(which I guess I'm not).  But I would be a bit annoyed that my good friend didn't tell me earlier...but usaully I'm perceptive enough to know or have a suspicion of it....So my freinds don't really have to reveal anything to me...and even if and when they do, I wouldn't be shocked as I already suspected..<br><br>I do have a few friends(very close guy friends) who I really think are "in the closet"...or at least they are BI-sexual...I'vre known for a long time, but I'm still ok with it...But I do sometimes feel uncomfortable when they start to get tioo physically close...i mean the occasssioal arm around my buddy whilewe're secretly planning something mischevious is ok, but sometimes, some of them get a bit too touchy...which really bugs me out because I kinda know....Even if I didn't know, I would probably think that they were anyway.  Yes, sometimes the hugs and arms across the shoulder lasts a bit too long or is a bit too frequent, but for the sake of our friendship, I let it go...Also, I wouldn't want to ask them because it is a very private matter and it should be on their own terms if they want to come out and not because I or any one else suspects them.....<br><br>As for how the relationship has changed...well it hasn't and won't ever.  I still talk to these guys the same way...I still ask them if they think that chick I'm eyeing is fine or not...Or...man, her breats are bulging!!!  and sometiems I also make coments about other guys...whtehre they r good looking or not....just as observation and not to please their taste or whatever.  I  think that as long as I'm comfortable being with them and our relationship doesn't change, they should feel comfortable whether I talk about guy things or not....But then again, I think that my friends know that that I wouldn't care whatevr way they went...it just doens't matter to me...as long as we can still hang out and go chick hunting or pubbing/dico, or mall hopping.<br><br>I tend to think that most singaporeans wouldn't care...The more educated ones don't really have anything to fear from it...and if one day ur friends leave u, then shame on them...u move on to better people.<br><br>BTW-I would feel really strange tho if we went to an all gay pub/disco...mainly because I just like to look at women too much...I just wouldn't have fun...I went to Sugar(Whiz- it's a pub next to Wong Sans:-) last year and it was all guys there.  I didn't mind that, but Mine eyes weren't appeased....maybe because I'm a closet perv...ha ha..:-)<br><br>Take care</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi 7th Son,<br><br>My advice for u is to just be yourself. I believe everyone has the right to be whoever they wanna be... it's our rights as individuals so just hang in there my friend... =) and to answer your questions:<br><br>1. No feelings... fine by me =)<br>2. None watsoever<br>3. I would actually rather know from my friend so tat I know he/she can trust me with his/her secrets but the answer to the question is no.<br>4.Doesn't rather make any difference<br>5. No... I think it's not really my biz<br>6. Generally I think the world is now more understanding towards homosexuals but I think in the case of Singapore it is more of a "i dun care" attitute!<br><br>Final words.... it's not your fault whether you are a homosexual or not.... it doesn't matter whether it is a choice or not.... just be yourself or whoever u wanna be....and not let anyone or anybody put you down in any manner..=)<br><br>Cheers!<br><br>------------------<br>Have a nice day!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow, this is interesting. Basically there is nothing wrong with before homosexual. They have the right to choose who to love. It is just that WE cannot accept the idea of having the same sex loving the same sex.<br><br>Somehow one will tend to hold back if he knows that this person is a gay. So he will not try to be too close to him. In most cases, its everyone's reaction.<br><br>But as long as he don't try to make any funny moves on you, then  probably it will just fine. We do have one gay in camp. Walk and talk and reaction like a WOMAN! What to do, he even told me before that he like this guy. They are quite close. Best of all, he hope to snatch him away from his gf, so what do you guys think? But one thing for sure, that guy is definitely a straight guy. So somehow their got into a really really bad quarrel-or-dunno-what-happened and treat each other like they killed each others ancestors!<br><br>Most of us just ignore him as long as he dun make any funny moves. Somehow if a good friend is a homosexual, I might have some difficulties accepting it but as long as he don't try any special moves on me and he knows I'm very happy with the opposite sex, everything should be fine. But you will start thinking "oh-my-god".<br><br>Probably people find it easier to accept the opposite sex of being homo than its own.

            <div class='col-md body'>IÂ’m not too sure how many of you realise this, but even in the gay community, there exist several types of gays. I shall attempt to broadly classify them into 3 categories:<br><br>1. The conforming gays. These are the ones who are exactly the same as their heterosexual counterparts except for their sexual orientation. They are totally transparent amidst the heterosexual crowd and even fellow gays find it difficult to spot them. They tend to deny profusely that they are gay and will defend mercilessly when others challenge their sexual orientation. They shun out-and-loud gays, even more so than the straights, for the redundant fear of being found out. They are also usually the ones who laugh the hardest at their friendsÂ’ tasteless gay jokes. Most of the conforming gays are tragic figures who remain in the closet and live miserable guilt-stricken lives, regretting what they did only just before their last dying breath. Sadly, they are also the ones who usually succumb to social pressures and end up lying at the altar and marry those poor unsuspecting girls. And chances are, this kind of marriage will fail after the first child when the wife realises that her whole life is ruined by that hapless bastard. And the poor kid from that broken marriage will grow up to become yet another gay basher.<br><br>2. The flamboyantly charismatic gays. These are the ones who make the best friends for anybody once bias and prejudice are thrown away and one gets to know them well. For they encompass the best of both genders. They are sensitive, witty, compassionate and extremely talented. However, their sometimes not-so-subtle cross gender behaviours usually irk the straights and the conforming gays. Hence, they often remain as the misunderstood hedonistic bunch. But please note that they have no inclinations at all to become the other sex. Their thoughts are exactly the same as their heterosexual counterparts.<br><br>3. The cross-dressers, transvestites and transsexuals. The most unfortunate bunch that gets misunderstood, ridiculed and shunned the most. They feel very strongly that they are born in the body of the wrong sex. They think and act like the opposite sex. Cross-dressers usually do not have the desire to change their sex while transvestites may eventually opt for a sex change operation.  Strictly speaking, transsexuals should not be considered as gays as they have undergone a sex change operation and hence should be considered as the opposite sex. And there are no significant differences between cross dressers and transvestites.<br><br>I know I exaggerated a bit in my description, but I guess the general idea is there. Of course, there are many other in-betweens, but IÂ’m sure you all can figure those out yourselves.<br><br>------------------<br>'yah, it's just a phase --- those terrible guilt and struggles in life before finally coming to terms with yourself and admit that you are GAY'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From the responses, I see that should your gay pal comes out to you, the he-better-not-get-funny-with-me fear is very real, especially for guys. Frankly, that is why I hesitated so long as to whether I should tell my friends, especially the guys. While I understand your fears, I canÂ’t help but to feel tickled.<br><br>I canÂ’t say for all gays, but at least for myself, I would _never_ go after a straight guy, because I know it will only bring me heartaches since nothing will come out of it. The only reason if I come out to any of my friends would be because I do not want to keep anything from them. Nothing more than that.<br><br>Of course, a gay may come out to a guy to Â‘test waterÂ’ as to whether he is gay as well. But most likely he will back off once the other guyÂ’s heterosexuality is made clear. It is difficult to spot a fellow closet gay, so please try to understand if a gay use his coming out to Â‘test waterÂ’.<br><br>Dun worry, I wonÂ’t make funny moves on any of you guys on the 20th.

            <div class='col-md body'>Coming back to choices. The point I made about Â‘If homosexuality is a choice, doesnÂ’t that make heterosexuality a choice, too?Â’ is really a tongue-in-cheek statement. IÂ’m sure none of you _choose_ to be heterosexual. You all are just like that naturally. Same thing here. Liking another male is just a natural thing to me, whereas liking another female is _unnatural_! GrossÂ… I hear some of you say in disdain. WellÂ… ItÂ’s up to you to swallow that bitter pill. Many things are relative and there arenÂ’t absolutes. Open your mind and be receptive to things that may seem weird to you.<br>___________________________________________________________<br><br>Â‘But if it is a choice, why do people choose to take the more difficult one,<br>like ataraxia was saying? unless it's not a choice...Â’<br>___________________________________________________________<br><br>Precisely. Sexuality is never a choice. One only realises his or her sexuality. Since young, we are brought up to believe that there is only one social norm. Cinderella is not rescued by a charming princess, nor is supermanÂ’s lover a male Louis. Hence when you realise that you donÂ’t conform to the social norm, you start wondering whatÂ’s wrong with you, and the internal struggles begin. That is why the gays are the only ones who have sexual confrontations. A straight guy need not have to realise that he is straight, for heterosexuality is the de facto sexuality. He is brought up to know that he is straight. Only his poor gay brother has to find his own way.<br><br>But there _is_ a choice. Although one cannot choose his sexual orientation, he can choose to deny his sexuality and remain in the closet, or choose to come to terms with himself and be true to himself.<br><br>But that is as much choice a gay has, and I chose the latter.<br><br>------------------<br>'yah, it's just a phase --- those terrible guilt and struggles in life before finally coming to terms with yourself and admit that you are GAY'<br><br></div>

I see it already...If u ever lookback just a decade ago, it was worse than now...now people are discussing it more openly and candidly...of course it must continue and the gay people have to speak out more often...<br><br>for if noone speaks, then noone hears...<br><br>Cheers to u 7...let's meet on the 20th:-) and u can join in and make fun of my stupid star tattoo...which I'm sure everyone will be talking about...or at least wondering why this idiot got such a dumb tattoo for....ah those ang moh people...crazy one...sigh..ha hah...<br><br>:-)  Happy happy sunshine.</div>
