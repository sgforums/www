              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: center;">He took no notice and went on to have his shower .</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: center;">And the waiting begins.....</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: center;">''Hey Kris ! What are you standing there like a tree for ?  '' Saren called out.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: center;">Dude ! It's your chance, she's pretty! '' Saren joked</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: center;">''Ah shut up dumbbloke . You are distracting me, i don't wanna miss her '' Kris whispered fiercely.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: center;">Plop...plop....</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: center;">'' Okay. She's coming. Good luck Bro . '' and Saren sped off in the direction of the pool .</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: center;">As Kris stood alone there, he wondered what would be the reaction of that girl when she saw him standing beside the door .</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: center;">Millions of scenario were just flashing through his mind and only stopped when she stood in front of him.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: center;">She was expressionless.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: center;">''Er.....'' Kris began .</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: center;">He stopped, it was only then Kris had a real good look at the girl and he realised that she looked real cute.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: center;">All of a sudden ,she turned and ran away .</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: center;">He realised she dropped a torn piece of paper as she was running away .</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: center;">As he picked up the paper, he read the words haphazardly scrawled on the piece of paper ....</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: center;">'' John , I am going to kill myself...</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: center;">Christina''</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: center;">Without thinking, Kris threw the paper aside and chased after this girl who called herself Christina.....</p>

              <p style="text-align: center;">It was already
                                                  the fifth time Kris felt his mind wandering to Katy, the girl who had
                                                  left him only at the pavillion today, with only her crumpled script
                                                  left behind , and is now laid on Kris' table .</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">Kris
                                                  took the script and turned it over and over in his hands, wondering
                                                  exactly why Katy had left only this script behind , of all other things
                                                  possible .</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">Frustrated , Kris threw the paper aside and tried to focus on his chemistry revision .</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">'' Eh... what's that ! Why didn't I see it before.. ! '' Kris wondered, as he quickly reached out for that scrap of paper .</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">'' It's gone now.. weird...''</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">Kris
                                                  brought the paper under the light, and to his utter amazement, he saw
                                                  faint pencil markings, which have been erased away....</p>

                                                  What the... Katy you.. ! '' Kris muttered , exasperated , and yet,
                                                  there was a feeling akin to a flower blooming, right inside his
                                                  heart...</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">Kris squinted and wrote down the erased words .</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">It read '' Hello dummy ! If you see this message then you are either very clever or very lucky !</p>

Fine . Follow me .'' Kris said reluctantly .<br><br>Kris
                                  lead Katy to the balcony beside the Art Room, which no one visits
                                  during recess because it is too far away from the main buildings .<br><br>'' Katy, why did ask me  to bring you here ?

Didn't you say that you hated me six months back?'' Kris questioned .<br><br>'' Kris... I said what I said on the spur on the moment.. surely you know that by now ?

                  back from Malaysia . My mother then called your mother and asked if she
                  could let me stay at your house for a week ! '' My things are all in
                  the spare bedroom already ! ''Eve replied with faint smile on her face.<br><br>'' You- WHAT?'' Pure shock registered on Kris's face.<br><br>Kris ran to the phone and his hands fumbled with the phone. After several minutes, he managed to get through to his mother.<br><br>'' Ma ! Eve staying here for the week ? ''<br><br>''
                  Ya la . Cannot ah ahboy ? I very busy, anything else anot ? By the way,

                  treated, but one thing he was sure. He did not like her anymore. Eve
                  was just a friend to her.<br><br>'' Yes a friend, just a friend only. '' Kris reassured himself.<br><br>' Sorry. Need the washroom. Be right back.

              in his room, his knees felt like buckling as he thought of the
              reprecussions of the scene that Katy saw. However, in another corner of
              his mind, he was sure that it was not Katy, just some salesperson who
              vaguely looked like her. 'Why the tears then?!' , the question that
              repeatedly shot through his mind.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">He decided, he would ask her tomorrow... ! </span><br><br>With that, Kris calmed himself down and dropped into sleep akin to a stone dropping into a river.<br><br>'' Katy.... hi...''<br><br>'' What !

''<br><br>The alarm bell rang.<br><br>Kris eyes flew open and his heart was still beating very fast even although he realised that what happened was just a dream.<br><br>Blinking a few times, Kris sat up and looked at the clock. The clock wrote '' 3: 50 A.M ''<br><br>'' Is Katy awake..? '' Kris wondered, and started towards his phone.<br><br>Kris held the phone in his sweaty palms.<br><br>His mind went blank. He had no idea what to say to her.<br><br>Kris searched through his mind once again to look for directions in the Youtube Instructional videos he always watched.<br><br>Nothing.<br><br>Feeling helpless, Kris threw the phone onto the bed and forced himself to sleep.<br><br>Kris stared at the clock again.<br><br>'' 6:00 A.M ''<br><br>Kris had not slept at all.<br><br>He immediately got up and prepared for school to avoid Eve and Katy.<br><br>10 minutes later, Kris was already on his way there.<br><br>All
              of a sudden, it started pouring and Kris opened his umbrella, as he
              headed towards the overhead bridge, he saw a cardboard box title'
              Please Take Him. Thanks You ! ''<br><br>Feeling curious, Kris peered inside.<br><br>To his surprise, it was a dog, soaked wet from the rain with the bridge offering barely any protection.<br><br>Kris stood there for a moment and decided to place his umbrella above the box, so that the dog won't get any wetter.<br><br>For the rest of the distance, Kris ran as fast as he could to prevent getting more water seeping into his clothes.<br><br>Upon reaching school, no one was in the canteen and he sat there and waited .<br><br>'' Oi Kris... wake up.. ! '' Kris heard a vague voice calling out.<br><br>Kris
              opened his eyes and got the shock of his life when he saw his
              classmates all standing around, Ms Tan was walking towards them at a
              rapid pace and reaching them soon.<br><br>'' Go and change ! Why you so wet ! '' Nicky chided and held out a set of PE clothes.<br><br>Kris
              took it and ran to the bathroom, ignoring the muttering and questions
              of his classmates, and he noticed that the rain hasn't stopped yet,
              when he ran towards the bathroom.<br><br>When he reached the table
              where he had fallen asleep at, he discovered that the group still
              hasn't dispersed and tiptoed to see what was going on, all he heard was
              another person getting wet.<br><br>It was Katy, and the girls all
              searched their bags for some clothing to lend Katy, and Kris just
              watched on as the group of girls followed Katy into the washroom to
              help her dress up.<br><br>Kris had a feeling akin to sinking to the bottom of the ocean when he realised that he was being ignore by Katy.<br><br>The day ended uneventfully as he was ignored the whole day, in which Katy ignored all his attempts to start a conversation.<br><br>Kris thought of the dog and hurried off to look for it after saying bye to Nicky.<br><br>As
              he approached the dog, he saw two umbrella instead of one, and it
              warmed his heart to realise that someone else had also placed their
              umbrella there to help the dog .<br><br>He quicked his pace and picked up his umbrella and kept it while taking out his handphone<br><br>'' Hello, SPCA ? There is an abandon dog at street 51 , jurong west, under the the overhead bridge near Jurong Point. ''<br><br>'' Ok, we will collect it as soon as possible. Thank you. '' the cool misty voice at the other end of the line responded.<br><br>Picking
              up the other umbrella, he examined it and discovered that it was
              branded ' Katy' with the address which was similar to his.<br><br>It hit Kris why Katy was wet when she came to the school today.<br><br>He saw a glimmer of hope of being able to talk to her and rushed back to Katy's house with the umbrella.<br><br>'' Dingdong'' Katy's house alarm rang.<br><br>The gate opened and Katy was standing there.<br><br>''Katy, your umb-'' Kris stopped as Katy wanted to close the door.<br><br>He reached out and stopped the gate from closing.<br><br>'' Was the dog the reason why you were so late today ? '' Kris questioned.<br><br>'' Oh, so that umbrella was yours. '' Katy responded coldly.<br><br>'' Here'' Kris handed over the umbrella to Katy.<br><br>''
              Katy please don't close the door what you saw yesterday is not what you
              imagined it to be and that girl is just at my house because she is
              staying at my house due to the H1N1 thing in which she had to be away
              from her mother and so I hope that we can be back to what we were
              yesterday and that you can forgive me ! '' Streamed out of Kris mouth
              in rapid-fire succession, as he was afraid that Katy would close the
              gate at any moment.<br><br>Kris's face turned red.<br><br>So did Katy's.<br><br>'' Ok. I believe you.'' Katy replied and closed the door.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Taking out his phone, Kris finally knew what to type in .</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">'' : ) '' </span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">and he clicked ' Sent''.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Kris waited outside Katy's house .</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A second later, Kris's phone vibrated and he opened the message with trembling hands.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">'' : ) ...''</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">With that, Kris felt as though a huge burden had suddenly disappeared from his shoulders.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">'' Hey Katy ! Shall we go to school together tomorrow? '' Kris shouted at the door, happiness evident in his every note....</span><br><br><br>

              <p>Haha the story is creative enough. The best part I like is that it's not too draggy (you don't have to keep guessing too long), the pace keeps the reader interested. Let's face it, the fact that people bother to read all the way to the end of chapter 2 shows that your story is worth reading - instead of clicking the 'back' button.</p>
              <p>I hope your story continues. I also want to know what happens to Katy and Kris.</p>
