Both would take turns to so call rule the country.. Voting has been made Compulsary in Singapore. Does anyone think that If Voting Isn't Compulsary-would any party would win the elections independtly. They would have to form up a coalition party..<br>If that happens then we can find the exact effiencies of the Govt... I am not trying to say that the Govt has done nothing!<br>What I am saying is that In politics there are some capable and some incapable ppl..<br><br>As to what Moose has mentioned, With every individuals vote, what changes the way it is now!!!

Then we make no difference from countries with bad political reputation.<br><br>------------------<br><strong>*<span style="font-style: italic;"> No FeAr</span> *</strong></div>
