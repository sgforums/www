The testosterone produced by the testes therefore does not have an effect on the body but it is aromatized to estrogen in fat cells via the enzyme aromatase.

Since she does not have any endometrium or other female organs to maintain, oestrogen levels not really of a concern ba?

Generally the younger generation is more accepting of transgendered people as compared to the old; western societies too, are more accepting as compared to Asian societies.<br><br>Another factor would also be because most people do not know the reason why some choose to change their sex. An example would be this conversation which I often have with many guys.<br><br>Him: So, you used to be a guy?<br>Me: Umm...yes.<br>Him: You mean you chopped it off?<br>Me: Well, not yet, but I'm going to in a few more years.<br>Him: WHAT? ARE YOU CRAZY? HOW CAN YOU EVEN BARE TO CHOP IT OFF?<br>Me: Maybe you like it, but I for one, am completely disgusted by it, and I hate it with all my heart.<br>Him: My gosh, but why? It's...it's...part of who you are.<br>Me: *laughs* Hardly; in fact the whole time I thought it had a mind of it's own.<br>Him: Are you serious? How the heck can anyone hate it?<br><br>Blah, blah blah blah blah.<br>You all get the point right?<br><br>Most guys will never understand how someone else could possibly hate his own dick, while most girls too, will never understand how another girl could hate her boobs. Even I myself don't know how FTM transsexuals can want to have a dick. Heck, they're probably wondering at the same time why the hell I'd want to be a girl for. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
