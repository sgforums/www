            <div class='col-md body'>There seems to be alot of confusion in this thread over the forms of intersex. Here's a brief distinction (although by no means comprehensive):<br><br>Androgen insensitivity or testicular feminisation syndromes: They look like normal females with b_reast and female genitalia. In fact, they look better than 'normal' females because they are taller, no axillary and pubic hair (no need to shave ever) and many end up as show girls. They only realize there is a problem when they do not have menses (a blessing for many girls). They do not have internal female organs (ovaries, uterus) but have normal v_agina and v_ulva. They are XY and have atrophic testes in the abdomen, which should be removed to avoid cancer. They should be raised as girls and the family told they are girls who cannot have children due to a congenital abnormality. They won't be able to compete in the Olympics as women though, 'cos their genetic sex is male but such patients would be better off told they are female from the start.<br><br>Congenital adrenal hyperplasia etc.: Due to an endocrine problem (lack of an enzyme), girls are born with ambiguous genitalia with a prominent 'penis' (actually big clitoris). They have uterus and ovaries and are XX. The endocrine problem can be life-threatening and should be treated. They are raised as girls. They will undergo puberty like normal girls once they are treated.<br><br>Klinefelter syndrome (XXY): They are born as boys with a penis but the testes are small and usually undescended (not in the scrotum). They are mostly infertile and have reduced testosterone production. The testes should be removed to avoid malignancy as they are usually non-functional anyway. They do not have ovaries and uterus. Most are raised as boys. If they are to be raised as girls they will need hormonal treatment, b_reast implants and plastic surgery.<br><br>Turner syndrome (XO): They are born as girls with short neck (and loose skin flaps at the neck region) and tend to have short stature and other phenotypic characteristics. Their ovaries are not functional (streak ovaries) but they can have uterus formation. The genitalia is female but they are infertile. Raised as girls, though infertile and need hormonal treatment for b_reast development. Many Turner patients are XX/XO mosaics (see below).<br><br>True hermaphrodites: Chromosomal orgenetic mosaicism is a rare condition where you have two or more different genetic makeup in a body. In other words, you have more than one distinct genetically distinct cell types. A common cause in non-disjunction, when the chromosomes fail to separate properly during cell division.<br><br>A rare form of mosaicism is a chimera. That can happen when two fertilized embryoes fail to divide to form twins but are fused together as one. Think of siamese twins that are joined at the cellular level...if the twins are male and female, it is possible to have some cells in the body being male, and some are female. You can get partial formation of uterus, ovaries, testes and adnexal structures. External genitalia is ambiguous. Which sex to assign depends on which sex it most resembles. Genetic sex may be a combination of XX, XY, XO, XXY. There is also antigenic mosaicism where the genetic sex may be female XX but some cells in the body express the H-Y antigen (protein) that determines male sex organ development.<br><br>Most transexuals do not have any of the above problems. The cross-dressers and transexuals we encounter tend to have a mismatch between the biological sex (which is normal in every respect) and the 'psychological sex' (they think they ought to be born in the opposite sex). So far, no convincing scientific basis to explain psychological sex mismatch.<br></div>

Please note that crossdressers (tranvestites) <strong>DO NOT</strong> have any problem with their 'psycological sex'.<br><br>Tranvestites can be seperated into two groups. The first group are the fetish crossdressers, who only crossdress for pleasure, whereas those in the second group put in effort to actually try to look like a girl, with wigs and fake boobs. Neither group considers themselves to be female, nor do they want to become one. Outside of their crossdressing, they're pretty much normal males.<br><br></div>

The thing is just that usually when I see some person post a thread in aunt agony or maybe chit chat about how their bfs left them or commented negatively for their looks, you get replies like "oh he's not loving you for who you are", etc etc, but truth of the matter is the person who replied that would do the exact same thing, and in this thread would probably say no to marrying to a transsexual unless that transsexual looks like a superstar.</div>
