Plainly put, it just doesn't work, and many have actually died/attempted sucide because they were way too miserable living as the wrong sex.<br><br>And by the way, what makes you think that ALL transsexuals HAVE to work at Changi Village? Heck, I doubt most of them want to work there either. The reason why they're there, is likely because they were kicked out of their homes at a young age by their parents, as they were forced to make a choice of their parents, or themselves, and because of that, they were unable to complete their education. With no education, where do you think they can go work?<br><br>Oh, and no, I'm not one of those street workers. I plan to get my masters after this, find a good job, and take care of my parents as soon as possible.</div>

Then I looked at her hands, I can tell that her bones are not of a girl.<br><br>But then, she was so pretty siah and I feel very comfortable talking to her.

The only problem is that once she cuts it off, the estrogen supply is cut off, and she's going to need to get her estrogen from either pills or injections.<br><br>By the way, hermapodites are people who are born with sexual organs which are 'in-between'. I think doctors will then try to 'guess' their gender, and alter the genitals to make it look like that gender. Most of the time, they base their judgement according to which sex the genitals look more like. Unfortunately, they tend to guess wrongly half the time.</div>
