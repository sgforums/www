            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore seems to be relying on more and more "imports" to bloster their teams: women's hockey, table tannis, atheletics etc<br><br>wat's next? soccer? swimming?<br><br>anyhow, all's said, i think there is indeed undue pressure on our sportsmen/women to get results. I think it all starts from the over-ratings from Timesport and the newpaper.<br><br>I agree with joycelin yeo that swimming is on the rise. At least other swimmers are starting to hit form.<br><br>Soccer has been a constant let-down. In fact, i dun think their coaches should pass arrogant remarks b4 results have been achieved. This is one area we have not learnt: mental strength and humility of a sportsman.<br><br>UK Shyam has done well...in fact i believe that despite all his problems, he was able to excel; that is the true grit of a potential sportsman destined for medals.<br><br>But i really think ppl like Ivy "i will shoot myself" singh-lim should clamp up rather than "fire away" unnecessary comments. Her arrogant remarks only served to add mounting pressure onto the netball team.<br><br>Our nation needs to rethink its strategy and mental toughness needed for sports. Monetary incentives are not the only answer. Reliable coaches and specific plans tailor-made for grooming talent in the long run should take priority. We certainly dun need flambouyant managers (or manageress for that matter) and coaches.<br><br>Perhaps Singapore can learn something from the humble Thais. They have certainly come a long way.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agreed. Long term plans should be drawn up. I believe everyone is sick of Mah Bow Tan repeatedly insisting s'poreans not to give up on goal 2010. It's pretty much a bleak prospect at best.<br><br>The s'pore netball association should also reconsider having presidents like fog-horn ivy singh-lim. Talk is cheap and doesn't improve our performance.<br><br>Then again i also feel continuity is the key to success. Too many changes will also cause an unnecessary upheaval in our system. Look at Japan. Their soccer has flourished bcoz they stuck to philipe troussier as their coach. He had a poor start but now their national team is making incredible strides into world soccer. Players like Nakata and Shinji Ono are world class.<br><br>Constantly changing the management is not the answer. But keeping to one that does not pay dividends is futile as well. A line has to be drawn.</div>
