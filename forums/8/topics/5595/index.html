            <div class='col-md body'>Well...I think childhood do really bring up to the developmental process to adulthood..It depends how old you are being seperated and how your single parent brought you up. The growing environment, peers and the way u think plays a major role..but it seems that most ppl have most phobia of getting married and getting themselves responsible for their partner so normally they prefer cohabiting cos there is not much commitment involved.<br><br>And they might have difficulty being a good parent themselves if they keep casting the shadow of the marriage of their parents in their own lives. Unless they have a clear mind of what they are into and want in a marriage as well/ Of cos,Familyu planning is defintely important so they won;t end up in a divorce. They might not have strong confidence in marriage so they will always resort to the easiest way out...like sepearation or divorce.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well...it might not be easy. I think you should find someone whom you can really devote your whole entire life on. It is YOUR LIFE!!A failed marriage is common nowadays, doesn't mean u have to follow suit...especially you will come across different woman in life and u are bound to have a few relationships. Those are just phases of life actually. Just make sure you choose the right girl and treat it seriously. If you are with a girl with a whole family, it might helps if her parents really treat u like their very own son and you might get the alternative love and attention from them.<br><br>Well..you can look me up after I grad in about 2.5 years when I get back to Singapore..Haha... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh Rinoa, you're just so kind  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Trouble is, everyone on this board is also gonna look you up when you're back in Singapore  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Sato...<br><br>Well, no matter what, don't you sometimes wish at all you have a father to look up to? As for me, I appreciate the freedom of not having one of those lock-me-up, disciplinarian dads. You know, overly-strict fathers who pressurise you, restrict you and stuff. I never knew what a curfew was. I could stay out and not bother calling back home and even so, owed no one an explanation. So perhaps in this way it is a blessing in disguise that an authoritarive figure as such is never a part of my life.<br><br>But then again, if it's strength that I need, somehow that figure isn't there to give me that support. If you're someone who's overwhelmingly popular, you will probably get that mental and physical boost from friends around you. I don't have many close friends and confidantes. So I often fight battles alone, trusting merely on inner strength and divine intervention. And I often lose, despite all that. And THAT really sux... =)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My parents have been divorced for more than 5 yrs already. I dun think that the divorce influences my growing up process in a negative way. Life was hard with me and my mum alone. It does not help that I'm an only child and my mum is not highly educated and holding 2 jobs to bring in more cash. We do not receive any alimony as well.<br>However, today even though I still studying, both of us are able to cope pretty well. I need to work to get $$ and support myself and ease the burden off my mum but it taught me to treasure things that I have more cos I know the difficulty of attaining them. I may not have much material comforts and money is constantly an issue on the mind but the whole thing taught me to be more disciplined and independant. It helped me to mature a lot in my thinking especially where affairs on the heart is concerned.<br><br>I never have any objections should my mum want to remarry. In fact I think it would be good for her to have someone to care for her if she finds him suitable. Of cos I care for her but the kind of care I can give is different from what a husband can give. I do not have a cynical view of marriage and in fact it makes me more determined to try my best to ensure my own marriage in future will work out fine. As for being scared of not being a good parent or husband in future, I think everyone wants to be a good husband/wife/father/mother. I'm worried that I may not do a good job but it is not the result of being in a divorced family. Rather I want to excel at whatever roles I undertake be it a husband, a employee or anything else.<br><br>Jasonnex, I do not have many close friends as well but think quality is more impt than quantity. Battles may be tiring and discouraging when fought alone but I think success taste sweeter when you obtain it through yr own efforts and strengths.<br>I used to find it hard to tell friends or other adults when they ask about my family but now, I think that there is nothing wrong. If one despises me purely because of my,then I think I'm better off w/o that job or friend.<br><br>Just my pt of view.....<br><br>[This message has been edited by light (edited 05 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, in many ways, I think Light kinda listed out my thoughts =) It's like in our situation money certainly worths a lot more than its market value. And it's like you really can't afford to like, go to a club and spend $50 for that one night. Well, probably you can, but it's like you just realise how pointless that is at the end of the day, and you wish you've had just stayed at home and saved it up. And this guilt feeling just lingers on.<br><br>And because my dad wasn't working, there wasn't any alimony to speak about. However, we've had generous donations from relatives and that sort of pulled us through this entire decade. Even I'm glad to have found a benefactor to see me through university life  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
