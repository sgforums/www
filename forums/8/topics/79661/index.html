            <div class='col-md body'>Yah...it's true that what an individual see, think, feel is indeed shaped by the deep rooted culture, moral and social values, etc....so, what's the point you're trying to bring up then?<br><br>As for the killing issue you brought up, was killing in ancient normadic tribe deemed respectable? I've not read up on this topic...but i gathered that it ought to be the MOTIVE behind the killing then that made it respectable and honorable an action to do. What I meant by motive was that either they wanted to protect their territory from enemies, to provide food for their family, as an sacrifical act in honor of their tribal god or something.....Hence, the people then, aka society, would naturally view killing as respectable. If a killing was done for no valid reason whatsoever, the society back then would unlikely condone and validate such mindless act.<br><br>So, is society wrong (is this what you meant in your subject title? )? No right nor wrong. It depends on what is the issue at hand.<br><br>At the end of the day, ppl are guarded by their conscience too. That's why there are instances where an individual seeks to do what he deems right, despite risking judgement from the society, correct?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Of course. All sorts of beliefs, society rules and morality are based on nothing but humans' own way of thinking. For example, homosexuality and incest are something gross to the common population out there but aliens in outer space could have thought it's something cool and thinks being heterosexual and a non-incest relationship is so uncool and morally wrong!<br><br>It would be funny if aliens decided to attack planet Earth to cleanse us of our 'ill-thoughts' based on their own sense of rights-and-wrongs.

            <div class='col-md body'>As wat the others have said, there's no right or wrong.<br>From this understanding of how most of the ppl in the society is shaped by the social norms, we can be rest assured that even when we do things very differently from what everyone is doing or when everyone seems to disagree with you, it still does not mean that you are wrong.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes...I agree with torx. Humans couldn't governed themselves individually that hence the need for term society to be established.
