            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I think its understandable to be disappointed that someone you love cannot know your needs and desires without you asking. I'm sure a lot of males feel loved when that is done to them.<br><br>Let me just say that I recognize the need for hints. Its non comittal and its not considered that you have spoken about something when you hint. e.g. you try to hint interest in someone and they hint that they are not interested--- no one is rejected outright, no one is hurt permenantly, embarressment is kept to a minimum.<br><br>But I have to ask: why test? Do we have to pass a test in order to be eligible to be loved back? Don't you think we have the right to get offended that all the affection that the guys have shown is not enough?<br><br>For that last question I can accept that not all guys show enough affection. From what I heard that is a very important part of being in a relationship, so on that aspect, I'll make no excuses.<br><br>On the other hand I'm sure its exasperating to be told that guys don't love the girls enough when in actual fact the guys have sacrificed a lot, e.g. being late for work because they were accompanying their girlfriends for breakfast; for not being able to join the cousin's birthday dinner because they wanted to catch a movie with you know who; for not having enough money to buy that CD that they wanted because they have used all their income for the necklace that their woman liked. The ladies might not know this because their men are unlikely to want to talk about this stuff, yet this is often how a guy show their love, through silent sacrifice. Its a guy thing.<br><br>Incidently, you don't see any hints in this thread do you? Someone announced in no uncertain terms that girls want to be understood. That wasn't a hint, that was a message. I just found it amusing that now no one can claim that they became understanding by themselves and had to be told to be understanding. Oh well. Irrelevant point.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, well said. Good point as well, about guys being quick to give solutions. Perhaps because of this action/ reaction response we tend to focus on solving individual problems rather than looking at it from a step back, to see the hint that it was meant to be.<br><br>On that last point though, in my opinion I think its not that unreasonable to expect a bit in return if you have put out a lot. For one thing, it sure helps to keep the motivation up so as to continue giving. It would be only fair as well, since a relationship is a 2 way process, don't you think?</div>

Good point as well, about guys being quick to give solutions. Perhaps because of this action/ reaction response we tend to focus on solving individual problems rather than looking at it from a step back, to see the hint that it was meant to be.<br><br>On that last point though, in my opinion I think its not that unreasonable to expect a bit in return if you have put out a lot. For one thing, it sure helps to keep the motivation up so as to continue giving. It would be only fair as well, since a relationship is a 2 way process, don't you think?</div></blockquote>hehee yeah...in a relationship there is no right or wrong, is how you handle it,but nevertheless..although guys are hard to understand i still love them  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Find time to realise that there is one person who mean so much to you, for you might wake up one morning losing that person who you thought meant nothing to you</div>

This is becos u guys matters alot to us, we put our hearts and souls in this relationship, and what we want in return is just some understanding, i truely believe that understanding a person is not easy, however you can always try to understand her,<br>Bear this in your mind, if a girl makes such a big fuss over you, you should be glad, that shows she values you...<br><br>This is my own opinion, but i must say, htere are exceptional case too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Find time to realise that there is one person who mean so much to you, for you might wake up one morning losing that person who you thought meant nothing to you</div>
