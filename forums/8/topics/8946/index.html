However if you were to put yrself in the shoes of the guy, are you sure that you are able to catch the hint from the girl everytime? I think all of us have lapses not matter how caring or sensitive. By catching hints 10 times is not able to make up for failing to catch it 1 time. The focus is so much more on the 1 time that the opposite party fails to catch the hint.<br>Furthermore another inherent problem that surfaces is that there is a tendancy to get complacent and compare. A sensitive guy/girl all along could lead to the girl/guy feeling that it is a norm rather than a bonus and special and take it for granted.</div>
