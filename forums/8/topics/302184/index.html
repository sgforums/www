            <div class='col-md body'>Well.....how much money do you really want or need? your friends are right to say that in Singapore you got to have money to enjoy a good life....but the point, is who defines good life? You have to define it for yourself.<br><br>So, if you are the type who wants to lead a luxurious lifestyle, and retire by 40, then money (and not interests) should be your priority. On the other hand if your lifestyle isn't extravagant and you don't mind working well into your late-life, then you better chose your interests. Remember, the amount of money one WANTS is a hell lot more than the amount one NEEDS.<br><br>one more question.......is life sciences your cup of tea? How can you be sure you wont feel the same about working in life sciences like how you are feeling working in a bank? Whats your age btw?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How old are you/profession/education level?<br><br>I'm determined to make it into investment banking (IB) solely because of the monetary rewards, and the many doors it'll open up for me. None of my banker friends, and their acquaintances as well, went into IB because they love their job. It's because IB provides the best payoff/lowest risk to making big bucks. Sure the first 3-6 years when you are still an analyst/associate are hell, even the pay isn't that great.  It's when you leave the company (hopeful a bulge bracket, if not a boutique will do) after you get your graduate degrees that the path would get easier. Some would go into portfolio management, others hedge funds, the older ones would go into consulting.</div>

Only the top few will actually make it to front office trading or quant analysis. As for me, I'm only doing it for the name, then jumping ship to a music related company, since that's where my interest ultimately lies (music).
