It is anti-science, anti-medical establishment, and anti-materialism; thus, falun gong is attractive to many people who are fed up with the world as it is and their position in it.<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhistcouncil.org/lifalun.jpg"><br><br>Li Hongzhi, a former trumpet-player from north-east China, is known as "Living Buddha" to his devotees. The authorities in Beijing also have a few other names for Mr Li. They have branded him the leader of an "evil cult" and a dangerous charlatan and have ordered his arrest.<br><br>He believes aliens walk the Earth and he has reportedly said he can walk through walls and make himself invisible. Mr Li, a tallish, thickset man, was born in Jilin province, north-east China, but his date of birth is somewhat controversial. The authorities have accused him of backdating it from 7 July 1952 to 13 May 1951 so he could share the birthday of Buddhism's founder, Sakyamuni. He said that it was misrecorded in the first place and points out that millions of other people must share the same birthday as the Buddha. He claimed that he is a very ordinary man but in another interview with TIME magazine he implied that he was anything but ordinary.<br><br>Mr Li says that he is a being from from a higher level who has come to help humankind from the destruction it could face as the result of rampant evil.<br>Asked if he was a human being from earth, he replied, "I don't wish to talk about myself at a higher level. People wouldn't understand it." He claims to possess a Dharmakaya body and says in his book that the followers are not to practice recitation for the name of the Buddha. While he keeps on claiming that he does not teach a religion, actually does incorporate Buddhist elements in his teaching. For example, he tells people to visualize his Fa Shen (Dharmakaya-body) if they experience trouble. He talks about white and black karmic drops. He said that a serious student of Falun Gong should be committed and therefore cannot do other practices like reciting the Buddha's or Avalokiteshvara's name. Falun Gong Practitioners, before commencing exercises, all sit down and recite his book called "Zhuan Falun" (Turning the Dharma wheel) like a scripture. This is borrowing concepts from Buddhism and confusing people about it.<br>But while his ideas may be bizarre, his followers claim to uphold high moral standards. Falun Gong's three guiding principles are Truthfulness, Benevolence and Forbearance. Western cult investigators appear uncertain as to whether Mr Li is the benign leader of a quasi-religious martial art or the figurehead of a far more sinister organisation.</blockquote></div>
