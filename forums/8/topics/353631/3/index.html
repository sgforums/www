              <p>Hi!</p>
              <p>I just got back from holiday yesterday.</p>
              <p>I really enjoyed in singapore, so much so I want to go again hopefully later on in the year. I wasn't able to go to everywhere I wanted, I was tired from work and the 14+ hour flight to malaysia, then going around malaysia also further took it out of me. I probably wont be going back to malaysia though.</p>
              <p>I didn't spend all my time in the touristy places, in fact some of them were waste of time like the riverside area. I didn't intend on going here first, but I got lost and wound up at one end, and was hungry  so I looked for a place to eat. If I wanted to go somewhere where there were loads of white people and westernised restaurants I'd stay in the UK.</p>
              <p>I used the MRT and bus - brilliant system with the EZlink card. Found that the other tourists just used taxis, their loss. I decided to visit Jurong (alighted from Boon Lay MRT). And walked around the residential area and the shopping centre - Jurong Point, I think it was called. Also went around Ang Mo Kio (went to the zoo aswell whilst I was in that area).</p>
              <p>I went to most of the places and tried most things that people recommended in here. Thanks again. But I had to remember what you guys said. I forgot to write them down and couldnt get the wireless on my phone to join the wireless@SG service. I tried to sign up but it didn't like my mobile phone number.</p>
              <p>You know what was great - whilst in orchard road, I got stopped twice asking if I wanted to be model. Brilliant!</p>
              <p>Overall, A really lovely country.</p>

              <p>Hi, yeh sorry, I was just told go to Ang Mo Kio MRT then
              get on a bus outside the MRT to get to the zoo. I didn't know the zoo
              was in another town. Although, with hindsight, it was a bus journey and
              a half, it would make sense now that it was in another place. If I'm
              getting some things wrong, please be patient.</p>
              <p>If you're
              annoyed about what I said about riverside, deal with it, I didn't find
              it exciting as Jurong Point for example, I can just pop into Manchester
              City Center (about 20mins from where I live) and get pretty much the
              same experience (without the river though and nice weather).</p>
              <p>I
              apologise if I've managed to piss some people, but hey, I visited your
              country, I complimented your country in general, I tried using your
              public transport, as it turns out I'd like to see residential areas
              other than the normal tourist attractions, I spent nearly $500,
              including the hotel, is that too fucking cheap for just under three
              days for you? I'm not an expert on singapore, and have never claimed to
              be, FFS I had to google what "IMH" was.</p>

              I haven't been and it is a "distant" homeland (my grandmother is
              from singapore). Also, my ex was born in singapore, and talked
              about it quite frequently. Please note: I will be travelling by
              myself and travelling after next week!</p>
              <p>Thanks!</p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Singapore has a United Nation of Prostitutes that you must see to believe. They just stand along the streets of Geylang (lanes Lor 6 to Lor 22 have the most activities) openly as good as half naked.</span></p>
