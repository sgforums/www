Definitely!  Where got the guy dun have to send her home.  personally I send my GF (now X..sads...)home everytime we go out...which was quite often...Even when I'm sick I "have" to send her back...unless it's really serious, I will either just let her go back alone or We take a cab...<br><br>Dun get me wrong here...I'm not rich..In fact, I'm quite poor so money is always a big problem...She stays in AMK I stay in East Coast, so distance is still quite great...at least 45 minutes by bus..if I'm lucky.<br><br>they want you to send them home. They feel safer with someone and they obviously want to see you one last time for the night right:-)  ?<br><br>Besides man, it's our duty to do it.  Can you really live with yourself wondering if she got molested on her way back home while you went out to party some more or so that you can get home an extra hour early?..nahh...I couldn't...call me a wimp. :-)<br><br>Anyway, you get to spend a few more minutes with her anyway before you see her again tomorrow right?  :-)  That's if you enjoy her company...:-)...school work or no school work...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> a debatable issue here.<br>To send or not to send.<br><br>It may always seem like the guy's duty to send the girl back home ye know, but have u actually noticed that girls are actually takin this to bcome an entitlement of havin a bf's company?<br><br>Sending gf back home to her doorstep, the trouble taken, varies among individuals.<br>Like for me, i had to send my gf back when i'm living in hougang and she, in bukit gombak. (she's now my ex anyway <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">, but trust me it's not coz of this we broke up)<br>Initially, it was ok sending her back, it's always the case fer guys lah <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br>(SNAGs??? FORGET IT~~~ There's not many around as most are juz faked. But i am one <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">)<br>Oh well, as time goes by, it becomes a chore as getting from her place back to mine may take up to an hour plus depending on the bus driver and mrt's speed. Takin a taxi from her place to mine cost me around 18 bucks wif midnite charge. (Only take 240 when it's past midnite)<br>It's damn tiring, trust me.<br>Sure sending her back to her doorstep is very nice, sayin gdnite and a kiss goin along. (no more hanky panky, dang. her mum's waitin up for her <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">)<br>SO u have it, we compromised abt the issue of sendin her back or not as she can see how tired i am after sendin her back and the trouble taken. Send sometimes and if the time's early, make do w/o it.<br><br>If ye're a lucky guy who lives within half an hour's distance from ur gf, den u have no excuse of not sending her back to her doorsteps  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>To see a world in a grain of sand<br>And a heaven in a wild flower,<br>Hold infinity in the palm of your hand<br>And eternity in an hour.<br>-William Blake<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well...a girl will always feel happy if her bf is able to send her back everytime...but sometimes one has to be thoughtful and considerate cos my ex-ex bf stay in NTU campus which is in Tuas and I stay in the south side, so u can imagine if he were to send me back and go back to his campus it would at least take a minimum of 2 hrs to and fro. I mean i dun want to see him tired becos of the transport travelling, so most of the time, I would take the bus home myself.<br><br>I think it is not really necessary to send ur gf home everytime cos u have to see the circumstances and the right timing. Of cos, the personality of ur own gf plays a part, if she is the demanding kind then too bad. As a student, you do not have much cash about to spend, so I won't allow my bf to send me home taking a cab cos it is much too dear unless I am really sick.<br><br>In other words, you have to see how understanding is your gf and how it matters to her if you dun send her home. For me, I am quite independant, so it does not matter that much although it is nice to have a goodnight kiss on your doorstep before u sleep<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For me I'll send my g/f home almost everytime unless I'm really sick. My g/f now stays in the East and I stay in the West. The journey from my place to hers is at least 75 minutes by bus single way. And no, I do not own a car.<br>There are times when it feels tiring after a long day but it is worth it when I know that my g/f is safely back home and resting. She does not demand of me to send her home everytime due to the distance but I think that as long as I can do it, why not? The time that I save by not sending her home or going to her place to wait for her to come out is usually not used constructively anyway.(doesn't speak well of my time management huh??!!) Guess for me, I just want to spend more time with her and a way of showing that I care.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey SUEDE IS COOL! Did anyone go for their concert?<br><br>ANYWAY, its definately nice to get sent home, but frankly, i think that's only necessary if:<br>1) Its really really late at nite<br>2) Where she lives is kinda dark and creepy at nite<br>3) You guys have just watched a late nite horror flick which scared the hell out of you both! (think Sadako here...)<br><br>even if you're too tired or something, the least you could do is put her in a cab and pay for the fare, yeah but if its like mid-afternoon, its not really necessary. Oh plus, you have to be sure her parents don't hate you cos if they do, sending her to her doorstep may spell death...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> but it largely depends on the girl, as mentioned earlier. If she's one of those Kick Ass! femminist types, she probably won't appreciate you sending her home every time.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah well obviously you don't send a girl home everyday. I used to send my ex home from school every single fucking day and it became such a chore. Not because  I didn't want to,but because reality sets in.<br><br>Your gf starts expecting you to send herhome, and even when she says it's ok youfeel guilty soit's best not toallow that trend to start.<br><br>I'd like to see sending your gf more as a sweet gesture rather than an obligation. Ppl fail to remember that a r/s has to be practical and be able tooperateunder the pressures of real life! Like not allowing eiher side to interact wit the opposite sex (ie. possessiveness) is also some sort of an ideal but practically impossible.<br><br>Have a real r/s, not a perfect ideal one.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I prefer guys to send me home (unless I dun like him and he insists too much). And usually, I have two guys escorting me home,especially when it's getting late (my definition is around 11++).<br>As for my bf and me, I stay in Bishan and he stays in either Jurong or Bukit Timah. Either way, it's an hour ride. So, we take turns or he dun send me home all the way. If he is tired, I will keep him company while he waits for his bus.<br>But I agree it is kinda silly to have to send your gf home everytime you see her... afterall this is Singapore and crimes seldom happen in broad day lite.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sending your gf home is an extremely sweet gesture, and one i guess most girls would appreciate, unless her parents hate you, or worse, dont even know about your relationship. it would be very nice if you could do it all the time, but like i tell my male friends, "are you nuts??" it's kinda timeconsuming, unless you stay 2 blocks away from each other or something... or else, only do it on "special occasions", as clearly outlined in previous posts.<br><br>but... just a point i would like to bring up, my GIRL friend used to send her bf home from school everyday... what do you guys think of that?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally,I make it a point to send my gf home...no matter the time..except once we settled some business at International Plaza and I am rushing for time to get back camp(My gf stays in the West and my camp in Seletar)..I dun find it a matter of obligation but a sense of responsibility to ensure my gf reaches home safe and sound..<br><br>As for female friends...I try to send them back(normally to the 1st floor lift landing) but if the lady refuses...I dun push it...but I will ask her to call me when she gets home...<br><br>------------------<br><br>Action may not always bring happiness, but there is no happiness without action.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Look like many of us got this problem of stay quite far apart! I used to have this problem as I stay in West Coast and she's in Bedok, then I shifted to SengKang and now finally stay put in Mountbatten. So our distances get shorter each time!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Don't do it as a chore. Do it willingly and wishes to do it. Once it treat it as a chore, you will slowly lose the feeling of sending her home. One day you gonna ask yourself, why am I sending her home.<br><br>For me now, to and fro probably takes under an hour, so I send her back whenever I could,if I'm not feeling well or really busy, she will goes back on her own but at least I still send her to the busstop.<br><br>Sending other girls home is a nice gesture. It will be appreciated. My regrets is not sending 2 home when I go out with them. It shows how bad I am. Well, they say "dun have to" so I go home lor!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Or at least I wait till they board their train but it is still not good enough.<br><br>------------------<br>why, bishamon? why bish?<br>coz he's God of War!!<br>But I'm a peacelover! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
