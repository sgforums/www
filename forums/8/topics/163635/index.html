Wouldn't a lawyer better advise a client to cooperate with the police?'<br><br>Mr Wong disagreed.<br><br>During interviews, the accused could be questioned on highly confidential or sensitive matters surrounding the alleged crime, he said.<br><br>These include facts, documentary evidence, physical evidence, witness testimonies, locations and the proceeds of crime, he explained.<br><br>Absolute confidentiality is a must. 'Otherwise there is a risk of critical evidence being destroyed or tampered with, witnesses being intimidated and proceeds of crime being removed or dissipated,' he said.<br><br>The only way to prevent leaks 'is for the defence counsel not to be present during interviews'.<br><br>It would also be difficult for the police to ensure the accused is not coached on how to answer questions.<br><br>A lawyer could use non-verbal means such as 'a hand signal, a gesture or body language' like a smile, nodding his head, shaking his hand, frowning, winking and others, explained Mr Wong.<br><br>In any case, not giving an accused person immediate access to his lawyer does not violate his rights, he said.<br><br>The Constitution says: 'Where a person is arrested, he shall be informed as soon as may be of the grounds of his arrest and shall be allowed to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice.'<br><br>In interpreting this, the courts determined that this right 'is to be exercised within a reasonable time after arrest, and not immediate upon arrest', he said.<br><br>What is reasonable time depends on the circumstances of each case.<br><br>Said Mr Wong: 'We need to strike a balance between the rights of the accused person to consult counsel and the public interest in ensuring that the police are able to effectively investigate each case.'<br></div>
