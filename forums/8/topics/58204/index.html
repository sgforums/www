            <div class='col-md body'>Tips:<br><br>1) Read your tester's body language - if he is about to test your sudden braking technique, he would check out the road conditions first. So, once you detect that, be ready to ready fast!<br><br>2) In the circuit, when you stop on the slope, make sure your hand brake is concurrent with that of the pedal brake. You won't wanna 'loon' backwards. Ensure that your car comes to a stop as hently as possible.<br><br>3) Testers' always place safety first in Singapore, so if you encounter any strange incidents e.g. where pedestrians suddenly step in your driving direction, always slow down and stop!!! Even if you are driving on main road, always act safety conscious! You don't have to drive near speed limit if the conditions doesn't allow you to.<br><br>Never speed! (Note: This may not always apply in overseas practical test, esp US).<br><br>4) Pray for a rainy day. That way you can go really slow and you will have sufficient time to react if anything happens.<br><br>Bottom-line: Testers just wanna gauge if you are safety conscious and can react quickly and appropriately when situations occur without panicking.<br><br>Hope this helps!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>My tips for u:<br><br>1. Be calm and be confident. He dont want to see u kan cheong or scared cos that means u are not prepared for real world of driving.. ie not the circuit type.<br><br>2. Dress up presentable, greet him make hime feel gd.<br><br>3. Wear shoes which u use to learn so u got a gd feel of pedals.<br><br>4. Safety always, check all when neccessary, throw in a few extra but dun over do cos again he will feel u nt ready for road.<br>eg. hesitate lah, too slow lah<br><br>5.
