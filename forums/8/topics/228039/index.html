            <div class='col-md body'>By special request - my modernized version of Aesop's <strong>Two Travellers and The Bear.</strong><br><br>Enjoy!<br><br>The sky was clear blue and the sea of emerald green.<br><br>The weather could not be more perfect, but his mind was stuck in a quagmire.<br><br>For along the sandy beach there were two set of footprints, side by side. They appear to be always together.<br><br>Except in times of turmoil and trouble, in times of pain and struggle - there will invariably be only one set of footprints.<br><br>The man asked his friend, "Why is it that when during times when I have most difficulties you have abandoned me?"<br><br>His friend replied, "No. I would never abandon you. You only see one set of footprints because in times of difficulty it was I who carried you on my shoulders."<br><br>But the man was not convinced.<br><br>"If you carried me during those troubled times, why can't I remember it?"<br><br>"My dear friend, you were so troubled, how could you recall everything?"<br><br>Suddenly a bear appeared from the wilderness and walked towards the sea.<br><br>The two men retreated cautiously as the bear strutted powerfully and confidently towards the water.<br><br>Every footprint it made was deep, because the bear was heavy. Even so, when the bear walked along the water line, even its deep footprints was washed away by the crashing waves.<br><br>Upon seeing this sight, the man suddenly turned pale. His friend looked at him worriedly.<br><br>"What is the matter?"<br><br>"If you had carried me on your shoulders, why are the footprints shallow?"<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dinky1409:</div><div class="quote_body">Dont understand liao..</div></blockquote>Sorry that this story is quite cryptic.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Maybe this will help make it clearer.<br><br>Long time ago, a man was walking along a beach. He has a friend that only he can see and hear.<br><br>When he reviews his walk on the beach, he sees two set of footprints, his own and his friend's. However, during parts of the walk when he faced some troubles, he only sees one set of footprints.<br><br>He suspects that his friend abandoned him during times of need, but his friend insists that he was the one who carried the man on his shoulders.<br><br>The man was confused because he didn't remember his friend carrying him at all. But he was about to accept this answer, when suddenly a bear appeared and walked along the beach.<br><br>The man saw that the bear's footprint was deep because it was heavier. He saw that the waves could erase the footprints.<br><br>He suddenly realized that his friend could not have carried him because the footprints were too shallow for the weight of two people. He also realized that his friend could easily abandon him by walking nearer the sea, so that the friend's footprints get washed away, so only one set remains.<br><br>I apologise for the heavy use of metaphors in this story.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br></div>
