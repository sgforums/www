We both agree that DVC r a good read, yet u said n I quote "I realise that Dan Brown is not a good author because AAD n DVC r almost the same". Hello???? They r related, of cos they r almost similar in context. DB must have refined the formula he used for AAH to achieve a hit for DVC.<br><br>We can go on until forever about whether DB is good or not and u r entitled to ur opinions. All i can said is he's internationally acclaimed n a published author and u did read all his books so far. Period.<br><br>Regarding ur comment on sustainability, readers identify with a particular author's writing style, context or character. In the case of Clancy, obviously ppl like Jack Ryan n the situations he's drop in reflects a little of today's political climate. But his current problem is coming up with new "enemies" n situations for Jack Ryan to faced. As for Eddings, the world n characters  of the Belgariad and Mallorean series r wat draw readers.<br><br>Like they said, u can't expect 2b always on top n ahead of the pack. Having 2 acclaimed series shld b more than satisfactory for him. Afterall, the series didn't leave any room 4 continuation so his planning must b as such. Compared him to Raymond E. Fiest whose Riftwar Saga series r more loosely tied, enabling him 2 carry on more tales abt the world with new characters spawning from the bloodlines of the Duke.</div>

We both agree that DVC r a good read, yet u said n I quote "I realise that Dan Brown is not a good author because AAD n DVC r almost the same". Hello???? They r related, of cos they r almost similar in context. DB must have refined the formula he used for AAH to achieve a hit for DVC.<br><br>We can go on until forever about whether DB is good or not and u r entitled to ur opinions. All i can said is he's internationally acclaimed n a published author and u did read all his books so far. Period. </div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> no problem... I read crap books too...<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> what I was trying to say is, DVC is a good read. Then one stumbles on AAD and realise that the entire setting/sequence is very similar to DVC. Langdon forced out of his routine to attend an emergency, meets a girl, faces a conspiracy with deep history/religious setting, etc etc. Extremely predictable sequence.<br>The fact that I had stated that I don't think Dan Brown is a good writer should not be the reason why I stop reading his books right? I wouldn't know if they are good or not until I read them right? Maybe his next book may be a bigger hit than DVC? Why am I still looking forward to his next book? 'Cos I like the genre. And yes, you are right, he's a internationally acclaimed author. No arguments about that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Edding's Redemption of Althalus is a rehash of all his earlier characters under different names. There is a new novel, waiting for it to turn paperback...<br><br>Totally confused with Clancy's The Bear and the Dragon. Or maybe the book was too heavy, weightwise.<br></div>
