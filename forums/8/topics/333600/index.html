              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I need to send a formal letter. However, English being my foreign language, I am not entirely sure if my letter is completely free of errors and any awkwardness in wording. Could you help read the following sentences from my draft letter? These are the ones I feel particularly unsure about. If there is any awkwardness or lack of clarity, could you help provide a better wording? I need the letter to be "perfect". Thank you very much! I really appreciate it!</p>
              <p>...I am writing to explain to the GSC my graduate funding situation and to earnestly ask that GSC consider assigning an appropriate Teaching Assistantship position to me for the coming academic year. <br><br>I have been assigned two Graduate Teaching Assistantship positions in the Department of  X since 2007. Each appointment has been for one whole academic year (August 2007 to May 2008 &amp; August 2008 to May 2009).</p>
              <p>Although my appointment with X has been one for Graduate Teaching Assistantship, my assigned duties there have so far not included any actual teaching activities...</p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p>I shall, of course, continue to fulfill the obligations for my appointment with X until it terminates in May 2009.  <br><br>However, I also strongly feel that an important purpose of the graduate assistantship program has not been served by my TA experience at X, namely, the professional training which helps graduate students prepare for their future teaching and research careers. A proper teaching experience that involves classroom interaction with students will help graduate apprentices acquire the art of good teaching</p>
              <p>...<br><br>On the other hand, a lack of such professional training experience may likely put a student at a relative disadvantage compared to his peers in terms of employment opportunities. </p>
              <p>...<br><br>According to my support scheme, after the lapse of this academic year (2008-09), I will have only one year left for any Teaching Assistantship opportunities. <br><br>I understand the challenge that GSC faces in having to secure appropriate funding opportunities for all its graduate students and I fully appreciate the amount of effort GSC has to expend in this process.</p>

              <p>Yes. Were you able to see any awkward sentences? I especially had doubts over this one:</p>
              <p>"However, I also strongly feel that an important purpose of the
                                      graduate assistantship program has not been served by my TA
