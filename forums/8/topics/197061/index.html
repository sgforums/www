            <div class='col-md body'>Hi ppl,<br><br>I have recently posted here with the topic 'Victimised by Job Agency'..<br><br>http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=196548<br><br>While i am contemplating leaving the job &lt;2 months and risk paying the agency 2k, i am also considering other alternatives. Think this may be a blessing in disguise for me because i am now seriously considering abt furthering my studies locally.<br><br>I graduated with Diploma in IT from Ngee Ann and have joined my previous company (1st fulltime job) who is in healthcare. Left there only 1 month ago and for the past 4 years, i am very lucky to be involved in marketing their products and A&amp;P activities, meeting up with press and developing marketing collaterals etc.<br>Recently i joined another healthcare co (a MNC that just set up its regional office in Singapore 1 year back) but the job scope is vey different as stated in the Employment Letter. I am now very unhappy there as i really want to learn and be exposed to more aspects esp they have regional offices sad.gif<br>As i got the job via an agency, i have a prob now (please read my previous thread for more info). So while considering alternatives yesterday, i decide to go further studies if not i will forever be working and reached a bottleneck one day. Though experience is impt, but i think if i can study now, why not? Especially now i know what i want to study. Me going 26 le.. in Aug.<br><br><strong>Obtaining Degree</strong><br>I am interested in either Corporate Communications or Marketing as i believe this can build upon my work experience and they are the next best relevant courses for me.<br><br>However, i realised that the admission period for SMU is over though course starts in Aug. I have to wait another year. And i heard it's very competitive.<br>Any podders can advise? My pal who graduated from NUS said that SMU tend to be more hands-on and having related job experience may be an advantage. Well, i sure hope it is!<br><br>Also, how about SIM? Is it as recognised? Cos i know that SMU is the other Uni that is subsidized by Govt and somehow it seems to have an edge over SIM though it's pretty new. I have only these 2 schools in mind now. I wonder if you guys can advise other options for me especially for the 2 courses mentioned?<br><br><strong>Study Loan</strong><br>I read about these 2 types of loans. Tuition fee loan and laptop loan. I am wondering if bank do loan for course fees? Cos it will form the bulk of our studies. What banks are good and requirements?<br><br>Hope i can get more information and advise from fellows here <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>thank you,<br>ernie<br></div>
