              <p>Yes, but there will always be people who insist that by virtue of your skin, you should be able to speak a language.</p>
              <p>That is not something that should be encouraged. Not everyone is linguistically inclined.</p>

              <p>Agreed, this facebook threadstarter is not a snob la, the writer is just some loser trying very hard to be snobbish. If the writer's English is so impeccable, then you wouldnt see elementary grammatical errors glaring right into your eyes in the last sentence. If the writer wants to rant about good English, the writer should take in account of proper punctuation too! Which, oh, is so sorely lacking in the writer's tirade. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> So the writer must be someone of <em>"low standards"</em>!</p>
              <p>I can't believe there are such people out there who, unreservedly, make such flippant comments without a dab of embarrassment. Whichever the case, we oughn't bother because I am pretty certain such obstinate sentiments yield no fruits in the future, where Chinese takes precedence. So it will be a hard fall for the writer! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>To add, it sounds more like a whimsy bitch who is trying too hard to be an Ang Moh. :)</p>

              wow, that's a very diverse set of people. you listed. don't think the majority of people can learn all those languages. most people will just fall back on the majority and stereotypes since they can't cater to everyone. in singapore, the stereotypes will be chinese looking is chinese, and speaks mandarin, malay looking is malay and speaks malay, indian looking is indian and speaks tamil. if you see a chinese looking guy, 9 out of ten times he is a chinese, and not a ABC, peranakan or whatever.

              <p>There's no good or bad I guess. I think knowing to speak English and Mandarin is pretty much sufficient in Singapore. I think it really depends in where your living in. No point knowing korean but then you never get the chance to use it right?</p>
              <p>My mom is Indo but then I know little of bahasa indonesia. I think it's ok since I'm livin in SG and I don't really use it much, at most is to speak to some malay friends thats it so yeah. To me, we should learn a language that is useful, and not because it sounds 'cool' or anything along the lines. However, it's always good to know an additional language cuz you'd never know it could be put to good use.</p>
              <p>Perhaps for your case you could start to learn cantonese? I find it pretty useful in here. (I don't know Cantonese)</p>

              <p>Yep, I agree in general. Learning French may be fairly useless unless you plan to travel to French-speaking countries. </p>
              <p>However, French is not only used in France. A little French can get you by with the older folk in Vietnam and Laos, and they speak French in many African countries. It can also help you out in Belgium, Switzerland, and parts of Canada. A few other European countries would be able to understand some French as well. </p>
              <p>And French is one of the 3 main languages of the UN, so it helps if people want to work there or its subsidiaries like the WHO. Although personally I would choose Spanish.</p>

              <p>Yep, I agree in general. Learning French may be fairly useless
              unless you plan to travel to French-speaking countries. </p>
              <p>However, French is not only used in France. A little French can
              get you by with the older folk in Vietnam and Laos, and they speak
              French in many African countries. It can also help you out in
              Belgium, Switzerland, and parts of Canada. A few other European
              countries would be able to understand some French as
              well. </p>
              <p>And French is one of the 3 main languages of the UN, so it helps
              if people want to work there or its subsidiaries like the WHO.
              Although personally I would choose Spanish.</p>

              <p>ya, that i agree.</p>
              <p>french is the language of international law. you need to have a firm grasp of french if you ever intend to work in the statutory boards of the UN.</p>
