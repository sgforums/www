            <div class='col-md body'>Talk abt life being unfair...but hey, when was life ever fair in the 1st place? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>so learn fr these guys...in order to be so called SNAG  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><strong>Scenario 1 </strong><br><br>Dennis &amp; Sufen were at a department store. She saw a teddy bear &amp; exclaimed, "Oh! This is really cute!" He offered to get it for her, but she hesitated &amp; replied, "No....it's okay..." He shrugged his shoulders &amp; moved on to look at something else. Meanwhile Sufen stood rooted to the spot, feeling very miffed.<br><br>His Interpretation I offered to get the bear for u but u said u din wan it.<br><br>What She Means Of cos I wanted the bear, u IDIOT!! I din give u a firm "no", did I?? U would insist on getting it for me if u were sincere abt the offer!<br><br>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@<br><br><strong>Scenario 2 </strong><br><br>Cheryl &amp; Kenming were at a jigsaw puzzle store, &amp; his was abt to pay for a brand new 2,500 piece set for himself. Suddenly, Cheryl held out another box &amp; asked, " Do u think I should get thus puzzle? It's so nice, but it's expensive...."<br>"Well, u can always wait for the next sale, he replied. She refused to talk to him for the rest of the evening &amp; the next 2 days. She continued to ignore him regardless of how many times he apologized. " So, what do u want me to do?" he asked in desperation. "I can't tell u what to do, can I?" she answered.<br><br>His Interpretation I thought u were seeking advice on whether to get that jigsaw puzzle, so I gave u my suggestion. U were really angry &amp; I din know how to make up for it. So I chose to apologize anyway, but u continued to be angry regardless of the no. of times I said I was sorry. What more am I supposed to do if "sorry" isn't enough?<br><br>What She Means I was hinting that I wanted this jigsaw set, &amp; I was hoping you'd get it for me. I'm fed up b'cos u're so 'blur' u can't take a hint. If u're genuinely sorry, u would make up for ur mistake by going back to that store &amp; getting that puzzle for me.<br><br>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br><br><strong>Scenario 3 </strong><br><br>Terence &amp; Mealanie were out on a date. Slightly b4 dinner time, she casually mentioned something abt a nice little French restaurant nearby.....When dinner time came around, he asked her what she would like to have for dinner. "Anything" she replied. They ended up in a foodcourt &amp; she did nothing but to sulk over a bowl of beef noodles.<br><br>His Interpretation I asked u what u wanted &amp; u said "anything". I thought u really din have any preference, &amp; were leaving the decision up to me. So I suggested the foodcourt &amp; u din object.<br><br>What She Means I really want to have dinner at that French restaurant. That's why I'm telling u how good it's supposed to be. I just din want to say it directly b'cos it's quite an expensive restaurant.<br><br>***************************************<br><strong>Scenario 4 </strong><br><br>It was 2am. Faizai &amp; Rina had had a good time at a disco &amp; decided to call it a night. As they were hailing for cabs, Rina said, "It's quite late now, I wonder if it's safe....." "Of cos it is" he assured her. They took separate cabs home, &amp; she turned him down the next time he asked her out on a date.<br><br>His Interpretation I thought u were just asking for my opinion as to whether it was safe to go home at that hour! I wouldn't have minded sending u back if I'd known u'd wanted me to, but u seemed so self- assured &amp; independent.<br><br>What She Means I think u should be sending me home at this hour. If u had been a gentlemen, I wouldn't even have needed to drop that hint!<br><br>**************************************<br><br><strong>Scenario 5 </strong><br><br>SuWei &amp; Vishnu were planning to get their close friend a birthday gift, but couldn't agree onwhat to get. She spent hours trying to convince him that her idea of a haversack was better than his suggestion of an arcade game voucher. Finally, she said in frustration,"Why izzit always so difficult for u to understand what I'm trying to say?"<br><br>His Interpretation Why do u keep insisting that I dun understand what u've said. I understand perfectly. It's just that I don't agree.<br><br>What She Means Why can't u just agree with me?<br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br><br><strong>Scenario 6 </strong><br><br>Carl asked Fiona if it would be alright with her if he stayed at home this coming Saturday to catch a soccer match, &amp; she said,"Sure, go ahead." She was unhappy when he actually did so.<br><br>His Interpretation U said "ok", so I thought everything was okay<br>What She Means Obviously, I din want u to stay at home &amp; watch some stupid soccer match! I was just trying to be magnanimous! U should be smart enough to know that, &amp; then ditch ur game to catch a moive with me.<br><br>""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" """""""<br><br><strong>Scenario 7 </strong><br><br>Nizan had forgotten abt Yati's birthday until the very next da. When he called her to apologise, she said "It's alright.." He hung up the phone shortly after &amp; continued to watch TV. She called him back shortly &amp; started to cry<br><br>His Interpretation I thought u'd already forgiven me for forgetting ur birthday, since u said it was alrite...<br><br>What She Means It's so not alrite! How could it be alrite when u forgot abt my birthday &amp; din even bother to make up for it! I'm so upset that I can't even bring myself to explain. But u should know!<br><br>@@@@@@@@@@<br><br><strong>Scenario 8 </strong><br><br>Mary asked,"Am I fat?" Mike replied tha she was just slightly plump, &amp; she got upset.<br><br>His Interpretation I thought u were asking for my opinion abt ur body size, &amp; I was just trying to be honest.....Am I supposed to lie?<br><br>What She Means I want u to tell me that I'm the most beautiful gal in the world, &amp; I expect u to insist that u're being totally honest!<br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br><strong>Scenario 9 </strong><br><br>He noticed that she was unhappy abt something, but din know what it was. He asked her what was wrong &amp; she said. " Nothing." He continued to do whateveer he was doing, &amp; suddenly he realised that she was fuming mad. Again, he asked her why she was upset. But once again, she insisted that everything was fine.<br><br>His Interpretation Since u said nothing was wrong, I had to tske it that everything was fine. How am I supposed to know what's wrong when u keep insisting that everything was fine?<br><br>What She Means Of cos something is wrong! Of cos I'm upset! And dun tell me u dun know what's wrong! Gosh, I can't believe u're such a hopelessly insentitive creature - u greeted everyone else so warmly when u arrived, but din come n say hello to me!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh and one of the kind of gals wich i dun like is the kind who refuse to say anything directly but chooses to say things in some warped, encoded manner with meaning within meaning within meaning, expect the guy to understand wat she is saying even though its totally beyond anyone except herself to, and throws up a big fuss and a mega tantrum when the guy, unfortunately, interpreted her encrypted message wrongly.
