An organism that grows, feeds, and is sheltered on or in a different organism while contributing nothing to the survival of its host.<br><br>Been thinking.. I bet some of you guys would had thought about it too.. Humans Dont actually contribute much to earth actually, all we do is to destroy/damage the ecosystem. We cut trees, pollute the enviroment, war, etc etc.. We deplete the natural resources for our own convience sake. In short , we do nothing much but just endless destruction. In the end, we are just moving towards our own destruction too. Maybe by then we would had moved out to another planet and continue our destruction of another planet. Are we just nothing but trouble? Maybe life would be a better place without us around?<br>A penny of my thoughts.<br><br>A quote from the Matrix has inspired me to write this;<br><br>"I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species. I realized that you're not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment, but you humans do not. You move to an area, and you multiply, and multiply, until every natural resource is consumed. The only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet"<br><br>"The temporary constructs of a feeble human intellect trying desperately to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose."<br><br>Lets just set aside all religious issues to this and chat about this topic ^^<br><br>Don't flame me, i not a human hater nor anything.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

Ever heard of the situation of the mouse deer population explosion on some island, ate the island out of its plants and die starving.  It just take humans being clever enough to manipulate the environment, which could lead to death of animals.<br><br>If in the end, humans can't cope we will also wipe ourself out, after all our existence on earth is not that long either.<br><br>our existence is just a blip on earth history. u never know if 1 million years down the road if there will be any humans on earth.  </div></blockquote>hmmm as you said, the animals in the end would die and thus balancing out the equilibrium whereas humans would move on and deplete the resources for our sake of survival, those deers cant just because they cant. Humans are superior in the sense that our brains are better developed and for the sake of survival, we can create stuff or move on propagate our new offsprings.<br>Manupilate the enviroment? We are just like the deers , we deplete all our resources = death of humans.<br>Another point of view is as the grasses are depleted , the deers would slowly die off and left with a few stronger ones (natural selection) and by then, the grass would had more than enough time to regenerate.Thus causing a equalisation again.<br>Unfortunately, the resources we deplete aint gonna come back or regenerate that fast as grass.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
