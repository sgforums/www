            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>haha. interesting way of putting things. here's the full report btw<br><br><blockquote> Software pricing drives piracy<br><br>THE introduction of the intellectual property (IP) laws, as mentioned in Mr Koh Su Haw's commentary, "Cheaper software options for SMEs" (Streats, Nov 23), is intended to tackle software piracy, something the software companies themselves are guilty of encouraging.<br><br>Who wants to pay more than $1,000 for software that they use infrequently?<br><br>When you use a dedicated program in your line of work, then obviously you should be paying for the services offered by that program. But each time it is upgraded or a newer version comes out, you have to bite the bullet and buy the latest version.<br><br>If you use 10 different programs, upgrading them each time a new version comes out becomes horrendously expensive.<br><br>When I upgraded to a new computer recently, I was advised that some programs may not work with the new Windows XP Professional platform. So I bought a new MS Office Professional and a new Adobe Desktop Publishing set, and almost immediately newer versions began to appear. It's never-ending.<br><br>It's the same with MS Office, and I don't even use Word to its full extent, let alone the other programs in the set.<br><br>Open source programs and shareware are an option - an attractive option - except for the worrying question: Are they compatible with other, similar systems?<br><br>What we need is for the original software manufacturers to slash prices to a level where people would rather pay $150 for a genuine Photoshop CD than $30 for a pirated version.<br><br>CDs are cheap. The manufacturers need to learn that they can make the same amount of money by selling large quantities, without the trimmings, as they can by selling fewer of higher quality.<br><br>If they had figured that out in the beginning, maybe none of this would have happened.<br><br>Let's face it, they never lost anything to a person who bought a pirated version because that person would never have bought an original anyway<br><br>- George H Croy</blockquote></div>
