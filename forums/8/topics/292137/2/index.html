I don't like her either but what to do? keep within the rules lor. as she ownself sae, if you did nth wrong nth then nth to b scared of. but then again she's very inconsistent with her ruling.<br><br>there is usually no warning, or when there is, it's sometimes not even obvious.<br><br>its not like some better developed forums where u get a "warning point" for an offence with offence details and such.<br><br>over here, you might die without knowing what happened or why.<br><br>i used to onli surf sgf but recently started moving over to other forums already.. there are many others popping up too =) nobody's forcing u to stay here if u dont want ma.<br><br>like the saying goes, when in rome, do as the romans do. if you don't like what they do, go somewhere else.</div>

(i repeat, this is (mainly) abt the forum features, nt the mods)</div></blockquote>aiyo, u think she so free meh<br><br>she have a life outside also leh</div>
