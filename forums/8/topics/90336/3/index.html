            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Wat r u trying to say ? I am trying to say that...to explain the rain is not as simple as explaining the birth of universe. </blockquote>He is not saying tat the universe is created because of the evaporation of water, but tat universe is likely to have been created by something and not someone. It is trying to say tat there is no designer for such phenomenons, why insist tat there is a designer for the creation of the universe<br><br><blockquote>No one can prove how it come out so we can put in any crap theory we want ? No one can proof...then u put crap theory that un wan?? What the heck is this...u study science??? </blockquote>Tat is wat I think u r trying to say. No one can prove how universe come along, so we can put in anything we want like religion etc in ? Isn't tat totally unscientific ? U study science ? Please note the question mark at the end... it is directing a question to u...<br><br><blockquote>Why do u say tat the law of conservation of thermodynamic and energy is not conserved ? Why...do u READ?? do u study quantum world? Stephen Hawking is currently the smartest person on earth...and yet he cant proof the existence of universe. U can??? Of coz it is not conserve. If it is conserve...then everything is solve. Becoz in the birth of universe...no one could explain what exactly happen at time = 0, the max they can go is t = 1x 10^(-12). Law of chemistry...nothing cannot be something. So there is this problem..during the birth of universe. Nothing become something. </blockquote>U still haven't answer the first question. Why do u think law of conservation of thermodynamic and energy is not conserved ? Since as u claim stephen hawkin can't prove it, how do u know tat there is no conservation of theromodynamic and energy ? It never exist such things doesn't mean the law isn't fixed as such tat when it do exists, then it will definitely obey the laws of conservation of energy and thermodynamics. Tis is a law, it is not "something, it is a theory which is "nothing' in substance.<br><br>BTW, why do u keep saying stephen hawking is wrong about the creation of the world ? u mean u r smarter than the smartest guy in the world now to prove him wrong ?<br><br><blockquote>During the birth of universe...everything is govern by quantum law. Quantum law is extremely different from our daily experience. Pressure, forces , gravity , sunlight...or whatever..it existed after the birth of universe. It is the big bang that created all this. Whether it is something or someone...u need to read more and think more. But do remember...in the beginning ( b4 the birth of universe)...there is nothing. And nothing became something..which is the big bang. </blockquote>I thought the big bang theory is said by stephen hawking ? So is he wrong or right ? In the beginning there is nothing, so how does tat "someone" appears ? Isn't tat nothing become something too ? Since in both cases something have to appear, why not be "something" which is more simpler to pop out then "someone" who is so much more complex to pop out.</div>

By READING...i know that alot of scientist wouldnt agree with him...and he also cant proof it.<br><br>This is no philosophy...is science. Proof..equation...they are the heart of science. Not by the persuasive skill that one have....that's y i said...an in depth of science is required to discuss about this. U talk about law...law of physics. U believe gravity pull, electormagnetism force and all forces exist at the same time?? do u know why electron can behave like a wave?<br><br>U always mention something...WHAT is that something??? Nature?? what is nature then? ...is the any element b4 the birth of universe?? even to define gravity force...einstein need a 4d space time diagram. Do u know why?? is not something so simple to discuss..is not a philosphy class where by being pursuasive hence..u r right.<br><br>So...u believe there is something...( element? force??? tell me) that govern the birth of universe. I thought the birth of universe is the beginning of everything. Are u trying to say that those forces already existed b4 the birth of universe?...if u do...i do not wish to further discusss with u. Read more and come back For u info...each forces ( like electromagnetism, electrostatic.....) do not EXIST as the same time.</div>
