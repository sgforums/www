            <div class='col-md body'>To whom it may concern,<br><br>I am wriiting to thank you for bouncing my check with which I endeavored<br>to pay my plumber last month. By my calculations, three nanoseconds<br>must have elapsed between his depositing the check and the arrival in<br>my account of the funds needed to honor it. I refer, of course, to the<br>automatic monthly transfer of funds from my modest savings<br>account, an arrangement which, I admit, has been in place for only<br>thirty-one years.<br><br>You are to be commended for seizing that brief window of<br>opportunity, and also for debiting my account $30 by way of penalty for<br>the inconvenience caused to your bank.<br><br>My thankfulness springs from the manner in which this<br>incident has caused me to rethink my errant financial ways. I noticed that<br>whereas I personally attend to your telephone calls and letters, when I<br>try to contact you, I am confronted by the impersonal, overcharging,<br>pre-recorded, faceless entity which your bank has recently become.<br><br>From now on, I, like you, choose only to deal with a<br>flesh-and-blood person.<br>My mortgage and loan repayments will therefore and hereafter<br>no longer be automatic, but will arrive at your bank, by check,<br>addressed personally and confidentially to an employee at your bank<br>whom you must nominate. Be aware that it is an offense under the Postal Act<br>for any other person to open such an envelope.<br><br>Please find attached an Application Contact Status form which<br>I require your chosen employee to complete.<br>I am sorry it runs to eight pages, but in order that I know<br>as much about him or her as your bank knows about me, there is no<br>alternative.<br><br>Please note that all copies of his or her medical history<br>must be countersigned by a Notary Public, and the mandatory details<br>of his/her financial situation (income, debts, assets and liabilities)<br>must be accompanied by documented proof. In due course, I will issue<br>your employee with a PIN number which he/she must quote in<br>dealings with me.<br><br>I regret that it cannot be shorter than 28 digits but, again,<br>I have modeled it on the number of button presses required of me to<br>access my account balance on your phone bank service. As they say,<br>imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.<br><br>Please allow me to level the playing field even further. When<br>you call me, you will now have a menu of options on my new voice mail<br>system to choose from.<br><br>Pease press the buttons as follows:<br>1. To make an appointment to see me.<br>2. To query a missing payment.<br>3 . To transfer the call to my living room in case I am there.<br>4. To transfer the call to my bedroom in case I am sleeping.<br>5. To transfer the call to my toilet in case I am attending to nature.<br>6. To transfer the call to my mobile phone if I am not at home.<br>7. To leave a message on my computer, a password to access my computer is required. Password will be<br>communicated to you at a later date to the Authorized Contact.<br>8. To return to the main menu and to listen to options 1 through 7.<br>9. To make a general complaint or inquiry. The contact will then be put on hold, pending the attention of my<br>automated answering service. While this may, on occasion, involve a lengthy wait, uplifting music will play for the duration of the call.<br><br>Regrettably, but again following your example, I must also<br>levy an establishment fee of $50 to cover the setting up of<br>this new arrangement.<br><br>Please credit my account after each occasion.<br><br>May I wish you a happy, if ever so slightly less prosperous,<br>New Year.<br><br>Your Humble Client<br></div>
