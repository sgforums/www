            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Mum screams:<br>It's been 7 months since my girl died.<br>I want answers. NOW!</strong><br><br>BY ANDRE YEO<br>Nov 17, 2000<br><br>THEIR daughter's death is a mystery.<br><br>The 10-year-old girl died in April apparently after falling from a block of flats in Hougang.<br><br>Her parents have been waiting for answers since. Yesterday, they <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">thought</span></strong> they were going to get them at the coroner's court.<br><br>But when the case was adjourned for police to complete their investigations, the girl's Taiwanese mother turned hostile and aggressive, waving her arms in the air and shouting.<br><br>"Arrest me! Go ahead! Arrest me!" she screamed in Mandarin outside the courtroom, thrusting both arms forward.<br><br>The ruckus drew as many as eight police officers to the scene. They advised her to calm down and explained to her husband that they could arrest his wife for unruly behaviour. But the enraged woman didn't care.<br><br>The 40-year-old housewife, and her jobless Singaporean husband, 46, wanted to be known only as Mr and Mrs Yeo. Their daughter, Yeo Tuan Wei, 10, was a pupil at CHIJ (Ponggol).<br><br>They arrived at the court yesterday with two male friends, around 2.30 pm.<br><br>The case was to have been heard before state coroner Chay Yuen Fatt yesterday.<br><br>But Mr and Mrs Yeo were told that it had to be adjourned because the police had not completed their investigations.<br><br>"Seven months already," Mrs Yeo was heard saying, her eyes red. "How long must I wait?" Mr Yeo added in English: "They can't tell us to come here, then say they have not completed their investigations!"<br><br>They went back to the courtroom and vented their frustrations in front of six police officers and some 15 people, who were stunned.<br><br>Said Mr Yeo: "We can wait till midnight, even 3 am!"<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Because of the commotion, other cases were postponed. People left, but the couple stayed on.<br><br>With a piece of tissue in her hand, Mrs Yeo screamed: "I want them to hear the case now! I'll wait! Even if it takes all night!"</span></strong><br><br>Staff members stood by, amazed and embarrassed.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Then, at 4.30 pm, a court clerk told the couple that Mr Chay would see them. But Mrs Yeo would have to remain calm.<br><br>Before the clerk could finish her sentence, Mrs Yeo shot back: "What is she saying? Tell her to speak in Mandarin!"<br><br>Mr Yeo tried to pacify his furious wife but she insisted: "I didn't shout. That's how I talk."</span></strong><br><br>They then entered Mr Chay's chambers. At 5 pm, Mrs Yeo emerged and continued to complain loudly.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">"I don't care anymore! I want to go back to Taiwan."<br><br>But moments later, she said: "Seven months already, and they still can't decide. I will stay here."</span></strong><br><br>She still refused to leave the courtroom. Five police officers stood nearby, advising the couple to leave, as the courts had closed for the day. After a 15-minute stand-off, Mrs Yeo finally got up and left. But not before shouting: <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">"We are Taiwanese! We shall do it the Taiwanese way!"</span></strong><br><br>Speaking to The New Paper outside the court yesterday, Mr Yeo explained why they were so upset.<br><br>He said: "We still don't know what our daughter was doing at that block of flats and how she fell. We don't even know how many floors she fell.<br><br>"We have been waiting for answers for seven months, and nothing has been solved yet. We are suffering."<br><br>The case has been adjourned to Nov 23.<br><br>*********************************************<br><br>Extracted frm today'z New Paper. I saw it and found it damn ridiculous so I posted it up.<br><br>My personal opinion: a person has to go one day. Whether he/she is 2 years old or 222 years old. There has been a death in my family before and I understand the grief that ppl went thru, but is there a need for such dramatics??<br><br>And tat crazy woman, she think she Taiwanese she big fuck lah?? (N/B: Read those highlighted partz) She buay song she can go back to Taiwan to settle her daughter's death. THIS IS SINGAPORE. WE SHALL DO IT THE SINGAPOREAN WAY!<br><br>They've caused much frustration to otherz who had made a wasted trip. Juz because of them, others have to give way to them! If they think they are suffering, den those in the Air Crash of SQ006 and the Silkair Incident have to go Luan Pia liao!!!<br><br>Also the way she talk to the poor clerk, "What is she saying? Tell her to speak in Mandarin... I didn't shout. That's how I talk."<br><br>If I am the clerk, I'll say these words to her.<br><br><strong>FUCK YOU! NAH BEH CHEE BYE! U UNDERSTAND THESE OR NOT??</strong>   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>[This message has been edited by jeff007 (edited 17 November 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't be so quick to judge. Put yourself into the shoes of the Taiwanese parents. They have lost a child and till now the cause of the death is not known. It takes time for people to come to terms with death, and in their grieving process, they may become emotional and irrational. Sure, their behaviour may not be appropriate, but do have a heart and don't be so quick to condemn. (Moreover, we can't discount the effect of sensationalism in this article, can we?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is certainly not the time for nationalism.<br><br>Have we already began to realize that our tabloid has shifted its attention from the crash and the tragedy of it all, to SIA, its fantastic track record, and its bravery for accepting responsibility. Of course, it has also began to dwell on the safety of Taiwan airport and its authority's supposing  accusations of SIA and its pilots.<br><br>Now that nationalism has set in, our people too, began to exhibit this strange behaviour of slamming anything taiwaness.
