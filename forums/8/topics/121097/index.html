            <div class='col-md body'>Ooooh, nostalgia.  When I was in my early 20's, I always backpacked to Thailand (because that was the furthest I could go without flying, which was expensive during those days).<br><br>I would stay in guest houses which at that time cost S$3.50 a night.  I could wear very comfortable but ugly and baggy clothes, wake up each morning, don't brush teeth, don't comb hair, don't wash face, don't use deodorant, etc etc....and I would fit right in! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>It was just enjoyable being a bum, it was a joy feeling bored, it was a pride doing nothing.  I also discovered that I was interested in things which I never thought I was before - like history, culture, learning new languages, visiting museums, etc.  There was time to stop and smell (even scrutinise) the roses.  Basically, after getting used to the stress and uncertainties of travelling this way, it was stress free, really away from it all...away from anyone I knew, away from anything mainstream.  It was freedom.<br><br>Whenever I felt guilty for being a bum, I would look around me and there would be a few hundred more bums from everywhere in the world, just being carefree and laid back, doing nothing.<br><br>I also did some crazy things which I can't talk about here (nothing obscene though).  And yes, I was lucky enough to meet foreign chiobus, but none lasted very long.  Even got punched up by a foreign chio-bu before. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Now, I'm lucky enough to be in a job which requires frequent travel, mostly around Asia.  But its just different from the feeling of freedom of backpacking.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When I backpacked to Thailand, I used to take the bus from Golden Mile Complex.  During those days, the bus would depart at about 2 pm (nowadays, its later in the afternoon)....and we would go through the Causeway (no 2nd link then)....and onward through Malaysia.  As the bus got further from Singapore, I could feel my stress diminishing.<br><br>I always looked out for the final approach to Haadyai (through huge flat land, farms, etc).  And the bus would always pass that stretch as the sun was rising.<br><br>And during those days, there was no control at the Malaysian/Thai border.  We didn't have to line up individually to have our passports stamped while entering Thailand (Sadao Pass immigration).  The  bus guide would bring it all to immigration while we waited around just outside the immigration hall.  And there, some pimps would come and try their luck on us....they spoke Singaporean Hokkien, Teochew, Mandarin, English, Malay, etc.  And of course Thai (they were Thais).  Damned capable.  Wonder why they don't go work as translaters instead.<br><br>Pimp:  Ah hia, ai char bor mai? (brother, want girl or not?)<br><br>Me:  Mai. (no)<br><br>Pimp:  Lai lah. (come lah)<br><br>Me:  Mai lah. (don't want lah)<br><br>Pimp:  Anh chuah mai? sao lian eh, pi pi, cheng kih eh.  (why not? young one, cheap cheap, clean one). ~~~ yeah, oh sure <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Me:  Boey sai, wah si hong kar (cannot, I'm Christian) ~~~ actually I lied.<br><br>Pimp:  Hong kar ah si lang mah!  (Christian also human what!)<br><br>Nahbeh!!  No way to escape from them.  Everytime gotta entertain them till our passports were done, then I'll say bye bye and board the bus.  I always got targetted before often, I travelled alone.  (Only four times did I travel with a partner).<br><br>And all this while, the architecture was changing too.  From modern Singapore to JB.....then to modern KL.....then to northern Malaysia with its small Malay-style houses and charming small villages....and when you reached the Malaysia/Thai border, the houses suddenly had more and more Thai influence.  Even in Haadyai, there was some Malay architectural influence.  Then in the train from Haadyai to Bangkok, the architecture changed even more....from small town style Haadyai to metropolitan Bangkok.  The buildings got taller, the temples got grander, etc.  The countryside atmosphere started disappearing to give way to more city-like landscape.<br><br>In 48 hours, one passed by so many cultures and lifestyles.<br></div>
