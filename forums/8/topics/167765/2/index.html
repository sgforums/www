            <div class='col-md body'>I believe current Man U success was due in large to Park Ji Sung playing. He is small size but fast on feet and vision too. His quick incisive short pass or penetrating pass that break the offside trap which Rooney and Nistelrooy can capitalise and score.<br><br>Let's see why not Alex F pull Park out for one month and see how Man U fare. Most likely Rooney will have to be individualistic or turn provider instead of scorer. In my mind, Alex F is wise to buy an Asian player like Park for his team.<br><br>But inside me I think Alex maybe giving more chances to white skin boy instead of Asian? Only when he see his match going to be stale mate or lose then he will introduce Park?<br><br>I believe besides Rooney, Park is also a good buy for Alex. Asian players like Park, Sun Jihai, Nakata, Mido and others are showing EPL that non European players have what it takes to play too and they do play well indeed  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

As far as i know, park gives a good game everytime he plays but fergie keep refusing him 90min of game. Not as thou his unfit or wat.<br><br>And rooney definitely is a gd player. But i tink more consistency from him shld be expected.<br><br>Not sure if u guys agree but don u all find Ronaldo less of an impact this season. I believe 1 main contributing factor is not letting him roam on the wings. He seems to be packed to the center (probably tactical reasons) but it aint working out for him.<br><br>he needs to run with the ball more and draw more fouls.</div>
