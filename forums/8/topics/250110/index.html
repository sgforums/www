            <div class='col-md body'>Like TS said, "conscription" don't have to be for military purposes. Actually research has shown that mass conscription has other positive social effect such as a better integrated society. The key is actually in the first 3 months of BMT where everybody goes tru more or less the same thing and people walk out of their comfort zones. NS also provide some form of national education. If we don't want to waste people's time, maybe we can consider slotting the NS in between results waiting period and let them go tru a "summer camp" like kind of BMT. Then next time just call them up in between school holidays for some sort of training. But then, this calls for more detailed research to look into the feasibility.<br><br>Just my 2 cent worth</div>
