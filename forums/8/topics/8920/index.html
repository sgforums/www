What should i do? He knew i hate it but he said he love it and not willing to give up because of me. He even told all the girls that he is still single.  Please advice me what should i do next.

            <div class='col-md body'>think real carefully before you commit your life and love to him. it's not reasonable behaviour for him to respond thus to your concerns nor should he spend so much time chatting up strange gals from IRC, much less telling you straight to your face that he will not give it up <strong>just</strong> because of you and that he's still single. men like that will stray without a qualm, i should know for i was unfortunate to have dated one before.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NaiveGirl,<br><br>perhaps because i'm much older and thus see things differently. i'm maybe a romantic but i'm also a realist, a pragmatic one at that. yes, i could sacrifice and bear with him but resentment will set in, why make myself more miserable? jealousy and insecurity are terrible things, they eat into one's soul, destroy and corrupt one eventually, if not utterly, in the end.<br><br>perhaps being the martyr is rational for you, but it's definitely not for me. for i'm selfish and i believe that no one loves me as much as me, save God of course.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm.. do you honestly think that you can live with someone who loves himself much more than you ? From wat i read,the impression that your man gives me is that he is a very selfish person. When you are in a relationship, its not about you only, whatever you do, you should think for your partner, obviously he is not, my suggestion is that you leave him, maybe if he understands how much you mean to him, he will change, if not, its better off without him.<br><br>------------------<br>Find time to realise that there is one person who mean so much to you, for you might wake up one morning losing that person who you thought meant nothing to you</div>
