              <p>After the collapse of institutions such as Baer Stearns and
              Lehman, I think there is so much less certainty on the financial
              system globally, much less the US. </p>

              <p>When you simply print more money without actually having earned it, it loses its value quickly.</p>
              <p>As Nellie pointed out, inflation will set in very quickly when you do that.</p>
              <p>This is precisely why ZImbabwe recently introduced a 100 trillion dollar note and they have an inflation rate of 89.7 sextillion percent.... they tried to get out of their economic woes by simply printing money.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>As far as I know, Singapore can print money as well. However, printing money will just accelerate inflation, as having more money chasing the same amount of goods will force people to raise prices. Think about it like this: If everyone got $100,000 tomorrow, would prices rise, fall, or stay the same? If all those people went out and spent just a portion of that $100,000, businessmen would realize that they need to raise prices before they run out of products to sell. Thus, you have inflation and the $100,000 that everyone received doesn't actually change the real wealth of anyone.</p></div>
