            <div class='col-md body'>Boarded this cab frm yishun with my other 3 frens, initially wanting to drop off at 4 diff locations.. after 5 min decided to change my mind n wanted to drop down along wif my fren..<br><br>Upon reaching the 2nd destination after the first and second fren had dropped off, i asked whether the taxi could drive me to 2 more locations (at that time 3rd fren still wif me in the cab). He grumbled that he had already stopped the meter. We apologized and he continued with the meter.<br><br>Reaching the 3rd destination, i was about to tell him to drive off to the final stop when he suddenly complained that we are so fickled minded. I asked him if he wanted to continue driving me. He had the cheek to tell me that either i get off the cab or restart the meter. I was totally enraged and decided to get off..<br><br>Although my frens and I were partly at fault for not informing him earlier, his attitude totally pissed me off.. Along the journey, he was speeding and actually dashed through when the traffic lights turned red.. twice! also taking the longer way and turning left when he was at the right lane.. Totally left me fedup!<br></div>

Oh, wait till you see yr CO really made some mistakes in mission. Then you see all the OC and PCs gather in the commander's tent.Then have to write debrief for mission...haha..then you see whether we really LL or CO LL lor...CO also no choice, ask us to cover up or come up with some hen and bull stories.. then thats when CO starts his "sudden" treat for his men..cool!<br><br>aiya...so, i am saying, you might have applogise to the cab driver for the confusion, but in the end, he is not satisify, naturally will feel frustrated.<br>Anyway, you shld be grateful that you managed to find a driver willingly to drive 4 diff locations. Because they have the rights not to for more than 2 places..(if i dun rem wrongly)<br><br>Next time dun take silvercab lah...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in this case you are the one who should bear almost all the blame.<br><br>You guys got in and then change instruction only after 5 mins.<br><br>During this 5 mins,he thought his destination is set already,so he will plan according to that,and it is likely that in these 5 mins,he has already accepted a next passenger on call around that supposed final destination you told him.<br><br>Now you change your mind and if he had really made a promise to pick up on that next passenger on call,he can't cancel that and will have to made do with his promiss to pick up that passenger according to a certain range of expected time for him to reach there.You said that he speed thru 2 red lights,shows that he is trying to get rid of you fast so that he can made do with his promise for the next passenger.<br><br>Of course he has a right to be angry with you.When he grumble,i doubt you answer him back in any polite manner,more likely in a guai lan manner which make him more pissed and then demanded you get off or he restart the meter.<br><br>Common lah,if you yourself go out to work,your boss give you an assignment already saying this is the deadline,then after you have done your planning well,the boss  changes the deadline resulting in it affecting your other assignments,dun tell me you will not be angry and if you complain to your boss,he tell you why,cannot meh? you will be happy ah?<br><br>so wake up your own fcuking idea lah,being the customer does not means you can do anything and expect to get away with it just cos the other party is bounded by his customer service policy.<br><br>In the first place,you do not respect the notion of customer service,so do not expect the customer service provider to respect you.Get this right you were not asking for customer service,but slavery to me almighty king service,something that is way beyond what customer service should provide already.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes i agree, both at fault also. Must inform him immediately when you get up cab.. but ya he is rude also la..<br><br>Just feel that shouldnt post him taxi number here just because he is rude.. coz these taxi drivers are also earning rice bowl for their family.. no matter how rude they are, they are still providing a service to us. I've had my fair share of bad xp with taxi drivers before also  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">, but really, there are also good ones i met before.<br><br>If becoz he is rude, we post him taxi number here, it might affect his business lor   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> .. i mean he didnt do anything very jialat to deserve having his number posted here, seriously</div>

Instead, he felt the obligation to go ahead with the 3rd destination nevertheless, but I guess he also felt it was really unfair to him. It is unfair, because he could have taken another passenger or answer a call for cab during the time when he was stuck with you in the cab.<br><br>On your part, you could have asked him to restart his meter, that could have been better since you were the ones who changed your decisions about destination.<br><br>It's not about customer service anymore... it's about interpersonal interaction.. Courtesy begets courtesy, and one good gesture deserves another.<br><br>And in case you swear at me about not having met one taxi driver like what you had; trust me I have had my fair share of worse-off drivers.<br><br></div>
