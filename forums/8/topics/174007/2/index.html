            <div class='col-md body'>It's partly your fault. The taxi drive got to make a living and not play games with your and your friends by stopping at 3-4 places. If you want service, allow him to restart the meter or give a good tip. Don't think that you can demand top notch service just because you pay a puny fare.<br><br>The taxi drive should also learn to control his temper. Afterall, he picks up all kinds of crappy passengers and there's no need to get upset with every toad.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>It's always polite to tell the driver beforehand that you have intentions to go to 4 locations and change your mind later to alight at lesser destination. The driver might have a  advance call job to accomplished, change shift or have personal appointment made.<br><br>If he was told earlier that there's an intention to go 4 destination or less, he can choose at that moment to pick you up or reject the street job offer.<br><br>Though he is in the wrong of telling you to get off the cab at your last alighting point, I would still not blame the driver as much as driver have to drive a long time on the road, and driving isn't a relax occupation. In fact, it's stressful to drive, especially when there's more vehicles or bad weather.<br><br>Sometimes, it does help when could kindly inform the driver beforehand about your intended amount of destination.<br><br>A 2 cents worth of comment =)</div>
