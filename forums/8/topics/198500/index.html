            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmmm it actually depends lor whether your warranty is still valid or void liao . if warranty still valid usually is ard 2 to 3 days . But it no more warranty then uit will be delayed till abt 5 days or even longer depending on the availability of parts .<br>As for your contacts and date actually you can back up your contact into your sim card or mmc card together with your data . Otherwise there will not be any warranty whether your data n contact will be deleted anot . But basically i fully recomend that you backup your data and contact to your sim n mmc card as your phone may need to upgrade software where all your whatever data will be deleted .<br>How long is nokia warranty i myself not sure but it will be costly to repair if your screen or pcb is damaged . It may reach $100+ as the lcd screen for 3230 is expensive . If your handphone is obviously physically damaged , then you don't have to think because definitely you will have to pay for the repairs . If your warranty has ended or is voided because of the physical damage , the minimum you have to pay is ard $26.90 for the adminstration fees just to send in your phone even if you reject the repairs .</div>

MMC can back up your contacts too.<br><br>3) 1 year from date of purchase.<br><br>Btw, LCD are not covered under warrenty, so even if your phone is still on warrenty, you will still have to pay for the LCD costs if its need to be change to a new 1. And the LCD cost about $76 + repair charges about $24 = total about $100. How I know? Cause my N3230 LCD cracked before, and I dunno how it cracked cause it happened overnite.
