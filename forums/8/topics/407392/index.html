              <p>If Japnese did not lose the war and Nazi continue to rule Europe (which include UK and Russia). The world is likely to be alot more peaceful and prosperous today.</p>
              <p>There will will be 3 blocks of superpowers and nations;</p>
              <p>1. USA 2. Europe 3. Asia.</p>
              <p>Africa likely will belongs to Europe, India and Australia to Asia. Middle East likely to be split and belongs to Europe and Asia.</p>
              <p>What would happen to Spore? Spore will be a poor state of Jap/Asia without LKY.</p>
              <p>I dont think many Jap will live in Spore and procreate, history will repeat itself that Chinese will localise its conquorer (just like all the Qing and Yuang dynasty) and rule the entire Asia.</p>

              <p>Nah, the Japanese by now still a Monarch - Democracy state thanks to US's presence in Japan. If they had won the WW2, then China will not be under communism rule, Singapore will have a monarchy system instead of a colonial / democracy - socialist system under PAP. Maybe LKY is the head of this "province", but PAP will never be formed. All these thanks to the no need to transform into Democracy system as US cannot tell Japan what to do.</p>

              </span></p><p style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The babas, on the other hand, also known as Straits Chinese, were Chinese more in name than practice. They were the descendants of the very early Chinese immigrants (Hokkiens from the Fujian province) to the straits settlements of Malaya (Penang, Singapore and Malacca). They assimilated with both the local Malays and the colonising British, whom they especially admired. The babas developed their own culture, cuisine and language - Malay liberally sprinkled with Hokkien.</p>
              <p style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The sinkeh were the traders, the coolies and the shophouse owners. The babas became the lawyers, the civil servants and the politicians; they attended the local English-language schools run in the tradition of the UK's public schools, and Oxford and Cambridge. If the sinkeh received an overseas education at all, it was in Nanking or another university in China.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Although the sinkeh dominated Singapore's population, it was the babas who dominated public decision-making. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">In effect, a baba minority captured sinkeh Singapore, and that minority's attitudes were more those of Victorian England than China.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">It was the babas who were the framers of Singapore's rules and institutions. Many of Singapore's most prominent Chinese have had baba backgrounds.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Lee <span style="font-size: 13.1944px;">Kuan Yew, who became prime minister of Singapore aged just 35, is the most obvious example. He claims a Hakka heritage, although his upbringing was that of a baba: at home, he spoke English with his parents and baba Malay to his grandparents.<strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;"> "Mandarin was totally alien to me and unconnected with my life," Lee said of his childhood.</span></em></strong></span></p>
              <p style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">For Lee, Chineseness was an acquired skill and later a political necessity</span></span></strong>. He was not brought up as a Chinese with a focus on China, but as a baba who looked to England. He followed the conventional career path of a baba and went to London to study law. And so Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore became Harry Lee of Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge. His father had given him and two of his brothers English, as well as Chinese, names.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Did Lee run Singapore as a piece of Asia mired in Chinese ways?</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> No. He ran it in a manner to which a British colonial administrator would have aspired.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">That other great framer of Singapore's institutions, Goh Keng Swee, who rose to become finance minister and deputy prime minister, is the epitome of the baba elite. Goh was born in 1918 in Malacca, the epicentre of baba culture, into a baba family. His parents were English-oriented Chinese Methodists.</p>
              <p style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The baba influence is now more subtle, but still there.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Singapore's current prime minister Lee Hsien Loong has the strongest baba pedigree of any of the country's leaders.</span></span></strong></p>

              <p>Endangered species? For goodness sake, Lee Kuan Yew practically filled the entire cabinet with inbred Peranakans.</p>
              <p>For the last few decades in Singapore, the top positions in civil service, statutory boards, armed forces, GLCs have all along been going disproportionately to the Peranakans. That is one reason why Singapore has been run to the ground.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew worked with the Japanese Kempeitai and later the British colonizers to suppress the non-Peranakan Chinese.</p>
              <p>That's why he has always been wary of non-Peranakan Chinese and could only entrust power to his own family members and his other Peranakan cronies.</p>

His reasons for this decision were very much based on his concerns over what was happening to the Chinese community and other minority communities, in Singapore.<span style="font-weight: bold;">Non-English speaking Singaporeans, including Chinese, Malays and Indians have, he says, been discriminated against unnecessarily under the PAP policies, particularly, for example the Chinese-educated, the Buddhists, the Taoists, the Hindus and the Muslims.</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The discrimination, he says, takes various forms: Nanyang University was restructured; there is no Chinese-language business paper; there is discrimination in the intake of university students, in the engagement of university lecturers and school teachers, in the manning of positions in the army and police forces, and an absence of representation of the non-English-speaking Singaporeans in the decision-making process and in many top government posts.</span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>These are just a few examples.<br><br>"Once in a blue moon," Tang says, "when world conference on Confucianism was held in Singapore, the PAP would seize the opportunity to launch its massive propaganda to the outside world and hood winked the Chinese communities around the world, especially those scholars in China, into believing that Singapore promotes Confucianism. This is just another fraud."<br><br>Later, he adds, "Confucianism is not taught in schools – only Confusionism!"<br><br>Tang has been accused of being a Chinese chauvinist because of his comments on education and language. He has been misquoted and his words taken out of context when he tried to describe the richness that words from different languages have to offer.<br><br>"Take the word ‘equity’," he says. "That one word – you can write a book on it. You cannot translate it verbatim into Chinese. It means fairness. It also has legal and technical meanings. It means also having clean hands and a fair mind. It is not possible to translate it into one word. On the other hand, the Chinese word ‘xiao’ is usually translated as piety, or filial piety. But that’s just a small fraction of the concept. You can translate the concept, but not word for word. They distorted my view by accusing me of believing that ideas can only be expressed in Chinese. I have never [been] opposed to learning English." By knowing only English, and not knowing Chinese language, Chinese people miss out on the richness of culture that might be available to them. This loss helps no one.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> "The Chinese stand to lose by not knowing his own language and culture," Tang says. "Their loss is not a gain to the other races."</span></strong><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">His opponents had to search back as far as 1994 in order to find quotes they could use against him, and even then they had to take his words out of context in order to frighten non-Chinese Singaporeans from voting for him.<br><br></span>His views, he says, were misrepresented in order frighten people from voting for him.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"They branded me as a Chinese Chauvinist. Up to this moment, they have spared no efforts in distracting the public’s attention from my arguments in order to frighten off the non-Chinese Singaporeans.</span></strong> My candidacy for the opposition triggered off the PAP’s nerve system. I am a cross-cultured breed and can cross cultural and language barrier." Tang speaks English and Malay as well as Mandarin. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"This touches the core policy of Singapore and the PAP – ‘Divide and rule.’"</span></strong></span></p>
