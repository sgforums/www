            <div class='col-md body'>"The Christian faith is an intelligent faith; it never consists of a mindless act which is unrelated to reality..." (Rev Josh McDowell)<br><br>Original sin is the central dogma of every Christian's faith. Church tradition teaches that every man, regardless of creed or race, is born already steeped in sin.<br><br>Where did this sin come from?<br><br>The Bible, in its Book of Genesis, describes Adam &amp; Eve as having committed the first sin by a single act of disobedience towards God. As a result of this, their sin passes down onto each child born in the world.<br><br>"Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to ALL men, because all sinned." (Romans 5:12)<br><br>Even though the Book of Genesis is part of the Hebrew Old Testament (O.T), the Jews themselves have never, throughout their long history, subscribed to any doctrine that is even remotely related to Original Sin. In fact, there are many verses in the Hebrew O.T that quite flatly contradicts modern Church tradition. For example:<br><br>"The soul who sins is the one who will die. The son WILL NOT BEAR THE GUILT of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son." (Ezechial 18:20)<br><br>The Church's further stand that Jesus had died to atone for the sins of mankind also sharply contradicts this O.T verse:<br><br>"Fathers will not be put to death for their children, nor children put to death for their fathers; each is to die for his own sin." (Deutoronomy 24:16)<br><br>The confusion facing us is this: which Testament do I believe? The O.T or the New Testamen (N.T)? Oddly enough, the Church considers both to be the 'Word of God'. At this point, perhaps it would be useful to recall Jesus' own words:<br><br>"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets (he's referring to the Books in the O.T); I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them...until heaven &amp; earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law..." (Matthew 5:17)<br><br>Not once did Jesus show, do, or even say anything to justify the Church's doctrine of Original Sin. Instead, he proclaimed, clearly enough, that ALL children were born free from any sin or inquity.<br><br>"Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these." (Matthew 19:4)<br><br>In truth, if Jesus had had his way, he would have chosen not to die at all.<br><br>"Abba, my Father, all things are possible to you. Take this cup away from me; yet, not my will but yours be done" (Mk.14:36, Mt.26:39-44, Lk.22:42).<br><br>Yet the dilemma remains. Should we believe the words of the author of the Book of Romans in the N.T? Or do we accept the words of God in the Hebrew O.T?<br><br>"Everyone will die for his own sin." (Jeremiah 31:30)<br><br>Who is the author of Romans anyway? It is Paul, according to Christian tradition. Contrary to popular belief, however, Paul was not a contemporary eyewitness of Jesus' ministry. If one chooses to be absolutely  discerning, one would not fail to notice that references to Original Sin can ONLY be found in the New Testament, more specifically, in the Epistles of Paul.<br><br>These Epistles adopt a consistently sexist stand that Adam, the man, was entirely blameless, and that it was the woman Eve who was the SOLE perpretrator of the Orginal Sin.<br><br>"I am afraid that just as Eve was decieved by the serpant's cunning..." (2 Corinthians 11:3)<br><br>"And Adam was not the one deceived, it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner." (2 Timothy 2:14)<br><br>There are a number of points that must invariably be raised.<br><br>1. Does it stand to reason that the sin committed by our ancestors should condemn us (so-called disbelievers) to eternal hell?<br><br>2. Why does the O.T's stand on personal accountability contradict the N.T's stand on vicarious sacrifice?<br><br>3. If Original Sin is indeed inherited by mankind, why did God wait for thousands of years before sending Jesus to save humankind from this sin and thus make no attempt to save those who had passed away before Jesus?<br><br>4. Why did Jesus, or indeed, his contemporary Jews, not know anything about this Original Sin?<br><br>5. Is Original Sin a true reflection of divine justice?<br><br>Such a discussion is dangerous beacuse Original Sin is the central doctrine of Christianity and its crucial theme. For without Original Sin, Jesus' death would have been all for nothing.<br><br>I end with a quote from an Anglican bishop (J. Gilcrease) who left the order because:<br><br>"A God that would use His power to create human beings Whom He foreknew and predestined should be eternally tormented, could neither be wise, just, nor loving. His standard would be lower than that of many men."</div>
