In fact, the hole is recovering due to the world's efforts in banning CFCs (CFC is the main culprit for the depleting ozone layer). And global warming is due largely to the excessive CO2 generated from burning fossil fuels, forest fires etc. CO2 is capable of trapping heat in the earth atmostphere; resulting in warming whether. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Saving 10 cents is more important than your own health and the health of your children?<br><br>Whats more irritating is seeing adults, working adults being measly about buying a plastic bag just so they can save 10 cents... For wat?? So you can buy your favourite drink from the vending machine?? Singaporeans are getting too pampered... Plastic bag not free, then just sit down and whine about it... You want extra bags, go buy one packet or something... and REUSE them...<br><br>10 cents also so miserly about it... Like its $1000 like that... damn irritating..</div></blockquote></div>
