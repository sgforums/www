            <div class='col-md body'>I apologise for the heady title.<br>Anyway, in my opinion, its just a sensationalization by the media. Gender topics are always a good seller. People are always quick to gibe about the opposite party to justify themselves.<br><br>------------<br>Newpaper article 22/05/05:<br><br>Little princesses<br>By Niroshi Sadanandan and Michelle Lee<br><br>May 22, 2005<br><br>THE men are hitting back.<br>Male university undergrads - labelled as whiners by their female counterparts - have lashed out, declaring the girls as demanding and manipulative.<br><br>These young women, the men add, also know how to squeeze out tears when necessary.<br><br>This campus rumpus follows The New Paper report yesterday which said that more than 70 per cent of women undergrads polled regarded the men as immature and whiny.<br><br>Now, about 70 per cent of the 100 men polled say they see campus women as little princesses who make unrealistic demands. But the rest said the girls are not so bad and are reasonable.<br><br>Mr Melvin Lee, 23, from NTU, said: 'Most girls want their boyfriends to sacrifice everything for them - their time with friends, their weekends.<br><br>'They want to go shopping together, do projects together and even study in pairs.<br><br>'Everything must be about her.'<br><br>Mr Cheong Li Wei, 24, an NTU communications student, said: 'Some girls expect guys to treat them like princesses.'<br><br>Everything from opening doors to giving free rides, meals and expensive presents, he added.<br><br>Mr Daniel Gan, 23, an NTU engineering student, said: 'They expect guys to drop them back home each time we have group outings.'<br><br>These girls take free rides for granted, not offering to compensate for petrol or buy drinks to thank them, he said.<br><br>Even worse are those who call him days before outings to arrange transport.<br><br>Mr Jan Han, 23, an NTU communications studies student, said a male friend became both Santa Claus and maid to his female classmate because she was unhappy that he couldn't attend her birthday party.<br><br>'To placate her, he took her for a candlelight dinner, bought her a $200 ring and helped clean her home.'<br><br>Some guys blame the influence of romantic movies which lead some women to expect to be swept off their feet by chivalrous men.<br><br>Mr Gan said: 'When my friend's girlfriend went overseas for an exchange programme, she forced him to buy a web-camera so they could see each other over the Internet.<br><br>'Whenever he didn't respond to her calls and phone messages quickly, she would cry and threaten a break-up.'<br><br>Women expect men to carry their books and bags. They demand chivalry while screaming for equal treatment, said a number of male undergrads.<br><br>According to Mr Marcus Lee, 23, from SIM, most men would would do simple things like open doors and hold the umbrellas. 'But even if we don't, girls shouldn't complain,' he said.<br><br>Mr Cheong had this advice for the women: 'Even if you are a damsel in distress, don't whine about your knight not coming to help you. Chivalry should be bestowed, not extorted.'<br><br>The men also complained that women indulge in emotional blackmail and throw tantrums.<br><br>Mr Melvin Lek, a 25-year old student from NIE, said: 'My girlfriend wants me to be early or at least punctual, but it's all right if she is late. If I'm late, I'm at the mercy of her moods.'<br><br>Mr Tam Ging Wien, 23, a computing NUS student, said: 'The most frustrating thing - they don't speak their minds.<br><br>'I've had girlfriends who'd just give looks that showed they were angry but refused to explain why. That's immature.'<br><br>And women are indecisive, complained the men. Said Mr Marc Daniel Nair, 23, an NUS Arts student: 'Many girls want to have their cake and eat it too.'<br><br>Don't do - and the men are not chivalrous. Do - and the women become suspicious, said Mr Aloysius Lim, 22, an NUS Arts undergraduate.<br><br>Although most men said women were demanding, only 50 per cent felt that those demands were unreasonable.<br><br>Mr Han said many men are actually 'quite willing to be used', especially if they like the girl. He said: 'It's fine to have expectations in a relationship. Just fulfil it - if she's happy, you're happy.'<br><br>Mr Andrew Zhang, 24, an engineering student from NTU, said: 'I think that as long as it's not too much, expecting guys to give in and be romantic is okay.<br><br>'After all, it makes girls more gracious and accepting, and helps guys to behave more like guys should.'</div>
