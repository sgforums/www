This is insane event for both of them as they were just students in secondary school level.<br><br>All this were stolen without their notice, their bags were just sitted beside them... Moreover, the lighting in the LAN shop was so dark that we who just went in will have a difficult time finding our seats. The shop should install cams around the area to film down everything happening in there, instead of just giving my 2 friends a simple and irresposible answer," We can do noting about it, pls take good care of ur belonging next time."<br><br>I know that it is mostly my friends to be blame for not taking good care of their own things but does that means that the shop does not hold any responsiblity?<br><br></div>

This is insane event for both of them as they were just students in secondary school level.<br><br>All this were stolen without their notice, their bags were just sitted beside them... Moreover, the lighting in the LAN shop was so dark that we who just went in will have a difficult time finding our seats. The shop should install cams around the area to film down everything happening in there, instead of just giving my 2 friends a simple and irresposible answer," We can do noting about it, pls take good care of ur belonging next time."<br><br>I know that it is mostly my friends to be blame for not taking good care of their own things but does that means that the shop does not hold any responsiblity?<br><br></div></blockquote>regrets</div>
