When her corpse is carried out several minutes later her legs are skin tone.<br><br>The plastic explosive used on the cockpit door was C-4, and when shot, C-4 does not explode as shown.<br><br>At the start when the guys are infiltrating that building they parachute down to the roof. They are dressed in black so they can't be seen, but their parachutes are white.<br><br>When Harrison Ford tries to enter the conference room when he comes upstairs from the lower level, he first struggles with the guard to the conference room door. While fumbling with the keys, the guard "wakes up" and shoots 2 shots toward Harrison Ford, where he turns around and shoots back. Those 2 shots from the guard leave bullet holes in the conference room door (the left door), and no one in the room gets shot from the bullets. Anyway the mistake is when Harrison finally enters the room, the bullet holes disappear. Whenever the bad guys return, the bullet holes are gone.<br><br>In a scene midway through the film where Glenn Close etc receive the fax from the plane, the tracks for the camera can be seen on the floor.<br><br>The whole time during the president's escape from AF1 (the scene where he's fighting with his corrupt agent) you van clearly see trough the airplane door that there is a loop in the movement of the water. It moves for about a second, and then stops etc. etc.<br><br>In the beginning, it goes from 5 guys with white parachutes to 4 guys with black parachutes, back to 5 guys with white parachutes.<br><br>When Harrison Ford is fighting one of the terrorist guys, they go into a room with two chairs. Ford spins a chair to knock down the guy, and they keep fighting. As the go at it we see a knocked over stool with a black seat. Instantly, in the next scene, the stool is standing up, and in a perfect position for Ford to knock the guy out with.<br><br>In the scene when the Russian is shooting the 3 doors, on the second door, if you look in slow motion, you see 2 muzzle flashes before a hole is made in the door.  The same on the 3rd door. Also, when he shoots the 3rd door, he puts 5 bullet holes in it, but when he opens it to check, there are 6 holes in the wall.<br><br>There is a scene late in the movie, when they send a fax to the White House - "it's on a different line" So why don't they just use the handset of the fax machine to make a normal voice call? If the machine had no handset (can't remember) just switch the jacks of the phone and fax...<br><br>When the F-15 flies in front of the oncoming missile, this would be an almost immpossible manoeuvre. The planes would be travelling at around 500+ knots, and the missile would probably be travelling at around 2000 knots. The timing would have to be precise, not to mention being able to spot the missile, change course, set up the approach, and stop a 40,000 lb fighter on a dime (considering all this would have to happen in approximately 10 seconds or less). Almost every AAM (air to air missile) has a blast fragmentation warhead, so this would still do massive damage to AF1, even while having an F-15 in the path of it.<br><br>When the traitor first begins to shoot the 3 people, we see a close up on one of the victims (the one who gets shot in the head). If you look behind him in slow mo, you'll notice that the furniture is already red (from the blood).<br><br>In the scene where the special forces guys enter the presidential palace in Kazakstan, they go to turn off the electicity. However, the electricity goes off before they throw the switch.<br><br>When Ford and a terrorist are fighting, just before Ford knocks him out with a stool, the shot changes to their tussle where the gun is knocked away into the aisle. Watch this in slow motion and you can see the hand throwing the gun into shot.<br><br>Jumping out of a plane at 200 knots and immediately opening a parachute of the kind in the movie is probably going to break the sail, yet only clean openings are shown.<br><br>In one scene a terrorist is seen taxiing the 747 on the ground using the control column. Like most commercial jets the aircraft is 'steered' on the ground using a tiller which is to the left (or right) of each pilot. The control column is only used for take off, landing and in flight. Only excuse: The terrorist may not have known this.<br><br>Three parajumpers (PJ) get aboard Air Force One, but four leave. This is confirmed by a voice-over saying that PJ number 3 is aboard and that they are switching to receive mode (or something like that).<br><br>The in-flight refuelling hardware on the real Air Force One makes a bulge visible below the cockpit window. The Boeing 747 used in the film lacks this bulge.<br><br>When Ford and a terrorist are fighting in a side room, he knocks him out with the stool. He clearly grabs the stool by the metal legs, hitting him with the black cushion part and yet a metallic 'clang' can be heard. Even a metal bar against your head wouldn't make that noise.<br><br>A little aside - when the terrorists first strike, in amongst the confusion you can hear someone shout "get the football!" The "football" is the name used for the case which contains the nuclear launch codes, but this is never explained. It's not a major thing, but interesting to note that they included it as a little detail. Good to know a childhood spent reading Tom Clancy books wasn't wasted...<br><br>At the beginning, when AF1 is landed, and the two pilots and navigator get shot, a Russian guy takes over. AF1 is then driven around the airport. The Russian guy controlling AF1 speeds up to take off again. When he does take off he barely misses a plane that was on the ground. The next shot is from the back of AF1 and the plane that was on the ground has disappeared.<br><br>Late in the film, William Macy's air force character states he can't fly the plane, but he has pilot's wings on his insignia.<br><br>As Air Force One is taking off from Moscow, both pilots hands are shown on the throttle.  However, once the two pilots are given clearance to take off from the tower, they are seen putting their hands back on the throttle. Weren't they already there?<br><br>None of the planes used as the real Air Force One have an escape pod. President Bill Clinton is said to have remarked on this detail after seeing the film at a White House screening.<br><br>When the lead MiG-29 was about to fire his missile, before it was countermeasured by the flares, he flicks the A/G missile switch, which stands for Air-Ground, even though he had a full Air-air load.<br><br>The scene where AFC-1 is being refuelled in the air is wrong. The common practice is that the tanker is flying in front of the other aircraft. They do not approach the plane from the back, and never that low. The flight path over the AFC-1 by the KC-10 will create a turbulence which would be very dangerous if not fatal for the AFC-1. The tanker will guide the plane towards the refuelling boom. Also the guidelines to guide the refuelling boom on the nose of the AFC-1 are missing.<br><br>During the takeover scene as the last two surviving Secret Service agents are getting the President into the escape pod the first one gets shot in the back as he's closing the door behind the President and punching in (what I assume are) the escape pod launch codes. As he's falling dead the door reopens and remains ajar as the second Secret Service agent turns around and returns fire. They cut away then cut back to the second Secret Service agent continuing to return fire and all of a sudden the door is shut and locked.<br><br>The movie's Constitutional dilemma is a bit of a red herring, at least with regard to the bad guys' demand that the General be released from his Russian prison cell. The President of the United States, regardless of whether it's Harrison Ford or Glenn Close at the moment, doesn't have the *legal* power to release someone from a Russian prison. That would be the Russian president's decision, and technical questions of American Constitutional law as to whether James Marshall had presidential authority would probably have little impact on the Russian president's decision.<br><br>When they attempt to land at Ramstein AB, Germany, The base launches some F-15's, problem is, there are no F-15's stationed at Ramstein.<br><br>The weapons hold in Air Force One that the terrorists open to arm themselves has MP-5 SMGs and M4 assault rifles. Its understandable to carry SMGs in the plane, as they are designed for close quarters combat, but why assault rifles? These are designed for medium to high range combat and would probably penetrate the fuselage. Also, their recoil makes them inferior to the MP-5s at close range.<br><br>Air Force One is always escorted by American fighter planes, and although it is considered courteous for foreign countries to offer escort, offers are always refused.<br><br>When Harrison Ford is brought up to the communications room by the terrorists, his wife calls him 'Jack', although the president's name is James Marshall.<br><br>Trivia<br><br>In the scene where Harrison Ford is under the plane having the fight with the terrorist, if you listen really carefully to the music track, at one point when Harrison starts doing some damage you can hear the 7 notes from the Raider's of the Lost Ark movie. It's the "hero" or theme music used when Indie was kicking some butt.<br><br>When Harrison Ford is dangling by a rope as he's pulled into the rescue plane, you can clearly see the entire wing of the plane through his legs as they pass in front of it.<br><br>The door lock used on the cockpit is one I've seen before in a dormitory enviroment. It can be forced by simply placing enough force on the handle to snap the pin that locks the outside handle in place. Nearly all adults should be able to do it fairly easily.<br><br>Misconceptions<br><br>When the terrorists, still disguised, are going to board the plane one of the president's advisors tells them that the plane can withstand a nuclear explosion (very unlikely). Even if we take this as true, then how come the MIG's cannons cause so much damage to the fuselage? [Of course it can't survive a nuclear blast, and this is never stated. What it can survive is the EMP blast of a nuclear explosion as said by the press officer.]<br><br>At the end of the film when the President etc. are being transferred from Air Force One to the other plane, why does Xander Berkeley's "inside man" character pull a gun and start threatening everybody? All the other terrorists are dead, the man they wanted to free from prison is dead, and nobody knows he was the inside man. What does he have to gain from this? [Because there is only time for one more man to escape from the plane].<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
