It doesn't really represent how well or bad the company is doing totally.  Rather, it's what the mass or we call it market think the company is worth.  It always goes up and down. Unless you have the holding power to stay invested for years. Then don't bother about the ups and downs.....

So far I have lost more than I won.  I am being honest here.  Others might boast about how well they are doing or hide their losses. But Decipher will never do that.  I started my blog in a bid to attract more traders with a common goal, that is to grow money.  I have posted to forums for visitors who hopefully will book mark my page and comment on the charts that i posted. This way, all visitors including myself can learn from each other.  The power of mass is tremendous.  How many good counters can you spot in the market? 5 maybe on an average?  Now, if we have 100 visitors each covered and found 5 counters, we can easily spot the most common and profitable counter!</div>

A place where a trader will go there to share and pick up useful info to prepare for the session.  That is why we in SI forum call it "homework".  I am sharing all that i know and sniffed on that blog.  In return, i hope visitors will do like wise to alert the rest of the visitors via the chat box there.  This way, we can all grow money together!  As for my profile, you can click on my avatar at my blog to read about it.</div>

It's business seems to be growing and they are consistently changing their business approach while still keeping the mail revenue.  What I like about Singpost is the ability of management to grow their business knowing that emails is overtaking traditional snail mail.  Looks like worth a second look.  Also it is a monopoly of it's own when coming to national post office right?  Just like SPH...monopolise our newspaper market.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
