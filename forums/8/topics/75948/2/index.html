            <div class='col-md body'>If u ask me, 10% of your income is a lot. It is the average price singaporean pay for their housing. (Average income 1800, 3 room HDB 220,000, 99 years, each day is $6. Although u will not live 99 years the flat have resale value. 10% of income is $6 per day too, without considering bonus etc) So if u feel buying a HDB flat is expensive, think of going to church. If u listen to wat the bible say about paying 10%, it just simply means u r giving away a free 3 room HDB away to the church.<br><br>Anyway, 10% is recommendation <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">from bible</span></strong>. U can don't pay for tis, but u know God is watching u, and we encourage people to follow wat God want... BTW, although tilting is 10%, there is also the charity funds and the church building fund etc. U know, the church is the <strong>House for God</strong>, so it have to be grand with fanciful fountains and garden.<br><br>My exam is coming  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  will be back for more after it...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>10% is NOT a donation! Anything other than 10% is then consider donation.<br><br>If you are a non-christian, you will not really understand why give away hard-earn money and why is it that it is fixed at 10%. But that's bcoz you do not view that God has provided you the job and thus what amount you are receiving is from God. So, unless you see it from another perspective, you will just keep debating whether it is complusory to give 10% or 10% is too much. For information, God don't need this money. I mean if God is God, why would He need this money? I mean being God, He owns EVERYTHING. It is not how rich you are or how much you contribute that gives you eternal life. No amount of money can't buy a place in Heaven.<br><br>Having said that, certain things in life are just as rigid. No one challenge why 1 + 1 = 2 as something being narrow-minded. God said tithe 10%, so it shall be 10%. This is something between one human being and God. He must understand why he is giving this 10% and not just give. For a christian, this person see that God is the Provider of everything. Thus, this 10% is not even his in the first place. So for a christian, the perception is different.<br><br>This 10% no doubt goes to the church but it does not mean the church can anyhow use this fund. A good church that truly fears God will have a clean and unhiding record on how they manage their funds. Another issue that I want to put across is that a church is NOT a charity organisation! The money collected from the church-goers do not have to ALL go to charity. Having said so, most churches do fund charity organisations. So who is the public to go around asking why a particular church rather spend its money on building a nice building than to donate the money to charity organisation? The money collected were from the church-goers and if they trust how the church manage these money, the rest of the public has no say! Nobody can ask another person not to buy a bungalow but donate the money to the charity.<br><br>The reason I brought this up is bcoz more than often people are eyesore about large sum of money spent on building grand churches instead of using this money to help the charity especially when they know that the church get a regular intake of money i.e. the 10% from their congregation. I also realise the christian community and their churches are always a target when they talk about money and stuff. However, nobody seems to say anything when other religious institution build grand buildings, never reveal how they use their donation money or never donate to charity organisation. For information, these institutions do get lots of money too. For example, there is this new temple, which is one of the few temples where Shi Ming Yi is the abbot, have recording studios and other high-end facilities. Till date, I don't think there is any local church that could even match it. Yet, no one say anything about it.<br><br>In conclusion, I am not trying to redirect any arrows or judge as I am not in any position to do so. I just want to dispel any wrong perception people have about the infamous 10%!</div>

I think the way to put the recommendation is probably harsh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Of course the church cannot force members to tilte fully 10% .

Then where had they spend the money ?<br><br>All I can say is, the priest or father of the church r not earning the average 1800 per month of wat singaporean should be earning. They probably earns much more than tis ! I knew of a father having a mansion and a posh car. In fact, which father actually lives in a small 3 room HDB ?

I do not support them either  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  But at least for chinese temples, there r not such things as members going to church and being asked to tilte.
