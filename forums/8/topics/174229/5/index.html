Like that the water flow out but the fishes stay in. The snails you have, are those painted very colourful one? Ohh yess, the fan tail guppies really colourful, when it swims, the tail move like a flag. Market sells one each for 50 cents, but if you go to some aquariums they sell for $2.50 each!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Cos they might not last long in a ray tank leh..<br><br>Mine hardly ever glided about in the tank... it was almost always at the bottom. But yes, it's very interesting to watch them capture live baby catfishes.. They will pounce on the catfish suddenly and cover it, like a piece of tablecloth.. Then with the catfish trapped underneath, it will slowly try to capture the struggling catfish with its mouth.<br><br>Btw, i think the undersurfaces of stingrays look kinda cute... As though got 2 vertical slit-like eyes and a mouth... like some cartoon face.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
