Some aquarists introduced these catfishes into their rivers after they outgrew their fish tanks at home. In the riverways, these walking catfishes have been accused of destroying the ecosystem by their aggressive cannibalistic behaviour, feeding on other fishes... this problem is compounded by the fact that they reproduce so quickly.<br><br>And when the rivers dry up or when food is depleted, these walking catfishes simply slither out of the rivers, cross the land in search of new rivers/waterways to inhabit (and destroy).<br><br>And biologically, they are perfectly capable of living out of the water for very long periods at a time. This is because they have an accessory breathing organ in their heads, allowing them to breathe atmospheric air. And in fact, their gills are poorly developed. Thus even when in water, they have to come up to the surface to take gulps of air periodically, and will die if not given the chance to do so. As long as their skin remains moist (they do not have scales), they will not die on land.<br><br>Very fascinating creatures.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
