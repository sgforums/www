Small doses can kill them. There are only a few items out there that can be used.<br><br>They can tolerate a little salt but please don't use too much and dissolve the salt before pouring it in because the salt crystals can 'burn' the ray.</div>

It's always certain that the first ray you have WILL die.<br><br>So far we have burnt $303 on dead rays.<br><br>1st Ray - Died from wound infection from Sucker Fish<br>(Sucker fish became Luohan fodder)<br><br>2nd &amp; 3rd Ray - Suspect something in the water. They died after 1/4 tank  water change despite us treating the water before adding it in.<br><br>4th Ray - No idea why it died cos the other rays in the tank are ok.<br><br>Anyway the remaining 3 rays we have are greedy and healthy and very playful and have grown bigger. They should stay that way unless something unexpected happens.<br><br>......................................................................................<br><br>His friends' Experience<br><br>1st Friend:<br><br>1st Ray died due to poor water conditions. Didn't buy anymore rays<br><br>2nd Friend:<br><br>1st &amp; 2nd ray died due to poor water conditions<br><br>3rd died due to unknown reasons<br><br>Rest are ok now though<br></div>
