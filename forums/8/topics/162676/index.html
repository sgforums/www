            <div class='col-md body'>1)SBGI- Straight Blast Gym International (www.jagsport.com) Quek Kon Hui<br><br>2)MMA Academy - BY Darren De Silva, i heard quite good<br><br>3)Farrer Park Boxing Gym- By some Ang Moh who won Submission grappling contests, www.contactkinetics.com<br><br>Full Name: Quek Kon Hui<br><br>Jonathan:<br><br>Give us a brief introduction as to what Mixed Martial Arts is.<br><br>Kon:<br><br>Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) combines various combat sports including Thai and Western Boxing, Wrestling, Judo and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu into a competitive format which resembles a “no- holds-barred” fight. These competitions are increasingly popular in North America, Brazil and Japan, where mega-production MMA events like the Ultimate Fighting Championships (UFC) and PRIDE regularly take place.<br><br>Jonathan:<br><br>Give us a brief introduction of yourself.<br><br>Kon:<br><br>Well I’ve been in martial arts for awhile and have trained in a variety of arts including Muay Thai (Thai boxing) and Western boxing, Judo, Jeet Kune Do and some Kung Fu.<br><br>Jonathan:<br><br>When and why did you pick up MMA?<br><br>Kon:<br><br>I think it was just a natural progression from what I was doing already. I was looking for a sport that combined all the ranges of combat into a format that is as close to a real situation as you can get. MMA seemed the obvious choice since it incorporates all the ranges and you’re dealing against opponents who are fully resisting your technique. There are no fantasy scenarios here as in many traditional arts. You either knock, choke or tap the other guy out, or he does it too you. It’s as simple as that.<br><br>Jonathan:<br><br>When and why did you decide to become an instructor? What is your motivation?<br><br>Kon:<br><br>Totally by accident! I hooked up with Matt (President of the Straight Blast Gym) while he was holding a seminar in Thailand. Prior to this, I heard plenty of good things about SBGi and seen some of their material on tape. Needless to say when I heard they were putting on a seminar in Thailand, I jumped at the opportunity! Things sort of evolved from there.<br><br>As far as representation in Asia, there are only two SBGi affiliates; here in Singapore and one (recently) in Korea. In the short time that I have been associated, SBGi has become like a family to me. They’re one of the most innovative MMA gyms out there and I’m immensely proud to be part of the group.<br><br>Jonathan:<br><br>Have you ever competed? If so, what's your best result?<br><br>Kon:<br><br>I have competed in a variety of combat sports like Kickboxing, Judo &amp; Submission Grappling and still continue to do so. Winning at times, losing at others, but to tell you the truth if it was solely about winning or losing I don’t think I’ll be having half as much fun doing this!<br><br>Jonathan:<br><br>What's your typical training routine and diet?<br><br>Kon:<br><br>I teach about 3 times per week and sometimes more so it’s difficult to maintain much of a steady training routine. Instead I make it a point whenever possible to train along with my guys while I’m coaching them.<br><br>Jonathan:<br><br>Do you incorporate any other form of training? Do you take any supplements?<br><br>Kon:<br><br>I do plenty of yoga/pilates and some weightlifting. Not a bodybuilder sort of program but focused more on strength and power. In terms of supplements, I occasionally take some creatine and protein, particularly when I’m training hard.<br><br>Jonathan:<br><br>How does MMA training improve fitness and conditioning? Does it improve the mind as well?<br><br>Kon:<br><br>The nature of this sport requires a high degree of cardio vascular endurance, strength and flexibility, especially if you want to do this at a professional level. I encourage my guys to keep an athletic mindset, try to cross-train and adapt best practices from other sports. The better shape you’re in, the better you’ll be able to perform.<br><br>MMA and especially Brazilian Jiu Jitsu has often been referred to as a chess match. Train in this sport long enough and you’ll quickly realize that being able to out think your opponent is just as important as knowing the technique. It is as much of a mind game as it is physical activity.<br><br>Jonathan:<br><br>Will training MMA give me a "ripped bod"? (Heh heh, sorry, but I have to ask!)<br><br>Kon:<br><br>Will just working out give you a “ripped bod”? It depends on your diet and training regime! Same with MMA.<br><br>Jonathan:<br><br>How effective is MMA in a nasty situation?<br><br>Kon:<br><br>Anywhere from being not effective to very effective. I’m still working on mastering the art of bullet dodging LOL<br><br>The best strategy is not to get into these situations in the first place. And if it takes a simple “I’m sorry” to avoid an altercation…well, that’s good enough for me.<br><br>Jonathan:<br><br>Any future plans for MMA in Singapore?<br><br>Kon:<br><br>Continue what I’m doing now to spread the MMA &amp; BJJ gospel to even more people.<br><br>Jonathan:<br><br>Thank you for your time. Last words?<br><br>Kon:<br><br>There’s a common belief that you have to be “hard-core” or incredibly fit to participate in MMA. Truth is anyone can do this in a safe and fun way. The SBGi curriculum is purposely built around models that are not based on individual characteristics like size, strength or speed; all the attributes that a professional athlete may possess over your average Joe. These are the heart of our training methods and in line with our philosophy that anyone should be able to do this. Whether you’re 15 or 50, training for fun or professionally, whatever your training goals may be; you’ll find something here!<br><br>If you're interested in knowing more about MMA or Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, call or email:<br><br>Kon<br><br>Tel: 9677 1737<br><br>Email: hheadz@hotmail.com<br><br>For more info on the Straight Blast Gym, please visit www.straightblastgym.com<br><br>Source:asiabodybuilding.com</div>
