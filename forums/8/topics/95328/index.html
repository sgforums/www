So, a lot of university students are shut out.'<br><br>Those university graduates who do manage to find work are often disappointed by their pay checks.<br><br>A study by China's Beijing University says entry-level wages have fallen to an average of US$200 ($33<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> a month, down from US$250 one year ago.<br><br>What is more, many of the jobs available are seen as poor careers, or offering little chance of advancement.<br><br>Some graduates use a Chinese proverb to explain the dismal employment situation: Too many monks, too little porridge.<br><br>Graduate Xiao Li spent six months looking for a teaching job in Beijing until she settled for a lower-paid position in southern China.<br><br>'Now everyone wants a stable, well-paid job that suits them, it's just impossible!'<br><br>The government has promised to ensure that 70 per cent of nearly three million graduating students will find jobs this year.<br><br>But they are competing with about 24 million urban job seekers.<br><br>And the job market is expected to get worse next year.<br><br>A record number of new graduates, approximately 3 1/2 million, will enter the job market next June.<br><br>Beijing's Ministry of Personnel statistics show that 2.8 million students graduated from China's 1,683 universities and colleges this year, according to the South China Morning Post.<br><br>Miss Xiao Li said that job interviews are more difficult now.<br><br>'We have more written tests, and companies often require second or<br>third interviews.<br><br>'You've got to go through a complicated testing process before you are given an offer,' said Mr Liu.<br><br>He now works at Junhe Law Office, one of the leading legal firms in China.<br><br>Another graduate, also named Liu, from Tsinghua's School of Policy and Management, faced the same troubles.<br><br>The 24-year-old wanted to work in China International Capital Corporation, but failed the interview.<br><br>'I got nervous at that time. Very nervous. I don't know why,' he said.<br><br>'Maybe I wanted the job too much.'<br><br>To solve the problem, some education researchers say the Ministry of Education should stop expanding college enrolment numbers.<br><br>But Mr Wan Keliang, vice-chairman of the policy research department of the Chinese Ministry of Personnel, does not agree.<br><br>He admitted unemployment was increasing, but said it didn't mean that there was an oversupply of college students.<br><br>'In the US, people who have received college educations account for 35 per cent of the whole population, and 23 per cent in Japan. In China, the rate is only 5 per cent. So in this sense, China still lacks college students,' he said.</div>
