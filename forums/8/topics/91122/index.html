            <div class='col-md body'>I wonder why no one mentioned sunei wang and BB Plaza. You can pick up lots of great bargains there. Its a treasure trove there so you really have to take your time to shop.<br><br>I don't suggest Mid Valley because the brands they carry are 80% similar to Singapore and more expensive!<br><br>For Times Square, you have to look. In fact I prefer Times Square to Mid Valley but you can get really good bargains there as well.<br><br>If you are moving out of KL city to the shopping centres outside like Mines City, you can pick up some great bargains too.<br><br>Petaling Street is good but it can be a bid shady there so do be careful of your belongings as there are lots of pickpockets there.<br><br>As well, if you have ladies with you, remind them not to be careless with their sling bags due to the snatch thefts going on. Its not as simple as snatching these days. Some of these thieves are really black hearted and stab you first.<br><br>Just be alert and enjoy your trip there. If you can check out their night life. Its very vibrant over there. You can go down to Jalan Ampang for the more upmarket night spots or their version of Holland V at....oh gosh I forgot the place...errr let me find out and I'll post again.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well for eating,you must make a trip to Jalan Alor and Jalan Tinkat tong shin (Just next street to Jalan Alor), That is the KL street hawker street that become vibrant at night, very good place for dinner or supper. You can also find good food at Jalan Imbi (Close to Bintan walk).<br><br>If u are at KLCC Suria (Petronas tower Shopping center), go to the basement and look for this rotiboy bakery. A must try over there is the roti bun. This roti bun sell so well and so fast that they have to keep baking it on the spot and pack it into the paper bag piping hot. Take note that it is not displayed for sale on the shelfs ,you will have to join the queue and ask for this roti bun at the counter, you will then see that it has just being baked out continuously and is being packed into the bags as people queue for it.The taste is really superb.<br><br>Try getting yourself a map and walk around to experience more of the real side of KL than the commercialized side.<br><br>If u are planning to go up petronas tower, take note that it is closed on monday. On other days they have limited ticket given out free.If i m not wrong, they start to give them out at about 9 am.<br><br>For shopping, would advise on Sungei wang,bukit bintan center, petaling street and Low Yat plaza. KLCC Suria, mid valley and Berjaya Times square will just give u shopping that can be infact done in singapore but at roughly the same price or even more expensive.  Low Yat Plaza (just beside Sungei wang) is the place to go for electronic and computer stuff, it also has a entire floor almost dedicated to handphone accessories.Berjaya Times square also has a inbuilt theme park, you may like to check it out if u can afford the time,but personally most of the rides there are pretty toned down. Berjaya Times square maybe very big but it is in fact an uncomplete shopping centre even up till now.Quite a lot of stores are yet to be occupied and the upper storeys are also totally still under renovation.It was still in that condition when i went there 2 weeks ago.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>as a malaysian, i highly recommand 2 places for you to go and eat that is unique to malaysia.<br><br>First is the hokkien mee at petaling st. (chinatown). Its diganolly(sp?) across from the coffee bean. Opens from night till 3 in the morning. I'd just stick to hokkien mee as its their speciality. Just make sure you order a pot of tea to wash down the oil  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Next i'd recommand going to eat the beef ball noodles. Also near china town. Its across from the RHB bank. Just ask around for directions cuz i'm not to sure my self.<br><br>this is what it looks like from the outside<br><br><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid137/p912ecaae843f38460282b2b885b5c843/f7435702.jpg"></div>
