              <p>Tactful way to do is to approach him.</p>
              <p>If you feel uneasy, bring along your colleague (suggest 1 will do).</p>
              <p>Tell him that we (not say only you) saw him taking upskirt pics.</p>
              <p>Ask him to delete the upskirt pics on the spot, if not, will bring this matter to HR.</p>
              <p>Do it tactfully, dont ashame him, give him room to react and to respond.</p>
              <p>I am sure he will take you and your colleague advise seriously.</p>
              <p>Do it now.</p>
              <p>More upskirt will be taken and he might landed himself a very serious trouble with the law.</p>

              <p>If you don't report him, you're saving his future but ruining other peoples future. Would you rather save one person or save many others.</p>
              <p>Don't confront him 1 on 1, its stupid. He can delete all evidence and infact might even turn the tables around and sabotage you.</p>
              <p>Just pretend nothing happen but alert a senior female collegue, someone from the management. Then plan on how to nab him. Don't alert the snake.</p>
              <p>REMEBER #1 rule in this world. Always have your own backside covered.....I though they emphasis this in the army frequently?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!</p>
              <p>Oh yea, if you successfully nab him, don't forget to claim credit for it. This will put you in the good books of your superiors, who knows you might even get employee of the month. If you successfully manage to nab him, you can also use it as your trump card cause now everyone in the office will think highly of you.</p>

              <p>I think next time you spot your friend doing this, immediately approach him like giving him a tap on his shoulder and say "Hey, how ya doing?"... then after that you immediately give him a shocked face, like what the fuck are you doing? I cant believe you actually got a fetish for this!!</p>
              <p>Then your friend would probably feel embarassed and sorry for his actions and know that it brought him shame and things like this, hopefully he would wake up his ideas.</p>
              <p>Maybe one day, after this "incident" you should also try to have a talk with him on this and hopefully to guide him on the right path.</p>
