            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone.<br><br>I hope that all the people who attended (you know who you are) had a good time ...relatively or otherwise.  I am also glad that you all thought that it was a success.<br><br>For a moment there, at around 2:30 pm, i thought that the rain would sure spoil the BBQ.  Daakr and I were completely soaked to our underwears (my case...my boxers) adn had to fight the torrential rain and flood from getting all our precious food and equipment wet.<br><br>I am quite well known for attracting bad luck so i naturaly thought that something would happen today.  But during the course of the morning and early afternoon I changed my mind becase it was so damnz sunny and hot...untilll.....*rainz*<br><br>And there I stood wondering to myself why this kin dof thing always happens to me (being har don myself again)....It rained and rained until finally it completely stopped at 6pm....divine intervention?...i dunno...hmmmm.....couldn't be beccause i was just cursing God a few hours ago for bestowing the gift of bad luck upon me.  But it went well and Dakar managed to get both pits "FIRED up" before people started streaming in....one by one..hahha...<br><br>AS each person walked intot he grounds of our campsite, I felt more and more at ease and my mind was assured that what i had planned for so many short days would be fruitfull.<br><br>THE FOOD:<br><br>I tried to pick a selection of food that was differetn from the usual that you would normally get at the typical bbq outings....got quite a good scolding from tet for spending so much on such "exotic" foods like the italian sausages instead of the run of the mill hotdogs...although we did get those also.<br><br>We had smoked/grilled/steamed fish and although the portion was small, tasted quite good...or so I thought...but seeing how the girls kept feeding my food to the cat, i knew that it was a total disaster..:-)<br><br>We had fish balls and Thai fish cakes. Tetrumon chicken and Spicy Szechuan chicken...Satay and potatoes and super burnt corn....grilled beef slices and 3 different types of Ang mor sausages....along with Willa Salad (potato and garden salad), and Eck ice.<br><br>Truly a very strange concoction of foods to select from.  Something that I hope is a bit mroe memorable than what you might be used to.<br><br>$$$$:<br><br>I apologize to people for having to collect donation money to the bbq fund.  If i was rich I would have paid for it myself..I hope that you understand why I need to do so.  And if you think that I could have made the price lower by buying cheaper items...have some consolation in that I shouldered a large portion of the bill that, even after collection, made me a LOT more poorer than when I first woke up this morning..hahahha<br><br>MUSIC:<br>Thanks to whoever brought hte tunes...I dunno who because i was really to busy with other things...It was very much appreciated and I'm sure the people BBq-ing next to us enjoyed our selection of Sparks disco music....:-) hahahah<br><br>PEOPLE:<br>The turn out was exatly the kind of number I was envisioning.  Perfect. Although I would have liked to have seen more people turn up...old stalwarts like kaihoe and newer breeds like msseus and whoever else was supposed to come but later changed their minds because of the rain.<br><br>THANKS:<br>Many thanks to Chief for having this forum and channel for us peopel to interact and meet new friends so that we could get to the stage that we are at right now with each other.<br><br>Many Thansk to Dakar for being my right hand man during the whole course of the Organisation from planning thru execution of this outing.  In fact i feel that it was Dakar who made it happen...from his booking the pits to him buying the satay and preparing the fire and then later working as a part-time cook. Hope the chicks dig ya man.<br><br>Many thanks to Tet for working so hard to provide us with enuff chicken to feed 300 people...the chicken was grrrrrr-eat!!!!<br><br>Many thanks to Willa aka FreezeW for taking the time to fix up the potato sald and garden salad  sot hat we have more than just meat to eat.<br><br>Thanks to ECK for his great understanding on this outing and his help all the way until 2 am....I know you had plans to leave earlier, but thanks for staying so long..You're a great pal.<br><br>also dun forget to thanks ECK for being full time kopi shop cook.<br>*sees eck wipe face with his towel around his neck*....<br><br>Thanks also to Sunny for coming down 3 hours earlier to help us to set up the whole thing....IYou were a great help man.<br><br>Thanks to Lexx for collecting money for me...I didnt have the heartt o ask myself...::-) Great job Lex!!!!<br><br>Thank everyone else for even turing up and mingling witht he crowd....<br><br>WILLA&gt; I am sorryt hat I couldn't get any chance to tok to you, but I had to make sure that people were fed and everything was moving correctly...I still habve ur tools...get htem back to you when i call u later or next day....<br><br>Thansk to Ariex and Callan for scaling the fish and gutting it.<br><br>I hope that I didn't miss anyone who was directly involved in the bbq.<br><br>My apaologies to all the people, new and old, that I dissed tonight for not spending time with them or talking to them mroe....I thinkt hat I was just too busy trying to make things run smooothly with the food and everything......hope y'all can understand....:-)<br><br>Now I just feel so tired... very very tired...<br><br>Will got o sleep  now..<br><br>Thansk everyone!!!!!  ur the best... Couldn't have done it without you'all.<br><br>[This message has been edited by firewire (edited 20 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No prob wansai..<br><br>As long as everyone is happy, I will be Happy too.<br>Juz make sure2 the Next BBQ that we will have... YOu all inform me earlier.. so i can book a pit so that Bochup, Shiok .... and so on don't have to walk 1 1/2 hours to reach..<br><br>And have sufficient time to budget check and proper organising.<br><br>THis is strictly a BBQ that organization only started 3 days back on wednesday..And for a BBQ to be organized in such short a period of time. I would say it is a HUGE success.<br><br>Thanks to:<br><br>1) Firewire who started the ball rolling and came out with his own money to pay for the things first.<br><br>2)Tetrumon who marinated the chicken's veiny arms..and broke the bone to facilitate the BBQing and made it easy for all the whack the chicken.<br><br>3) Willa, Your Potato salad is nice too, and your other salad provided hours of enjoyment to Lex, Tet, Claire who spent time looking for the shrimps..<br><br>4)Callan n Ariex who helped in descaling the fish(although the fish is a huge failure.. ended up cat feed)<br><br>5) EcK our dear old Satay man with Yellow towel who stood there for hours cooking.. and not eating much.(In case you all dunno .. He is also the hero who brought us the ice blocks that cooled out things.)<br><br>6) Lexelle who met me the night before the actual BBQ and Help me came out with the shopping list and brought the Ice box which kept our drinks cool(although we only used it at 9++ and all the drinks were not cool yet when everyone wants a drink, but that's our fault coz we only remember about putting the drinks in when chief told me abt it)<br><br>7)Sunnyday who turned up at 4++ in the middle of the rainstorm to help us and ariex who also turned up quite early and help with the firing of the pit as wansai calls it.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Serps who brought the marshmellows<br><br>9) Petridish for helping our poor guest by going to fetch them to and Fro the Hawker Center.<br><br>10)Kelvin who took care of Pit 73 on his own when i took a break.<br><br>Anyway, Thanks to all. The BBQ won't be such a success if not for all your Rain or Shine we will be there attitude   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>A final thanks goes to Wansai who is alot poorer(due to last minute organization)<br><br>------------------<br>To luf someone is nothing, to be luf by someone is something, to be luf by the one you luf is everything.....<br><br>[This message has been edited by DaKaR (edited 20 February 2000).]</div>
