            <div class='col-md body'>Well...I was just wondering since ppl like to judge others interms of their first impression, do u always think that beautiful ppl are open minded, and liberal and flirt a lot compared to those ordinary gals who wear conservatively and looks nerdy?<br><br>Hmmm...as far as i observed, ppl in the clubs or "happening area" are mostly well-dressed and "looked happening" as well...Frankly, I think it is a rather misconception cos there are gers who looked liberal but are actually not and ordinary looking gals who looked studious or nerdy may not be goody goody as they seems...<br><br>Issit true that guys are intimidated by gers who are good looking, smart and has lotsa  admirers?<br>And have u all met ppl like does not seems what they really are, interms of looks, like the example I stated in the header?<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I do agree in general that pretty girls are usually more open(not necessarily a flirt!) and hv more frens... thats actually a norm of the society that people who look good will hv more people wanting to be their frens... thats the reason why these people will become more open, becos they get more chances to deal with different types of people.<br><br>I dun think intimidated is the right word to use... rather the guy may think twice before approaching the girl becos of the number of admirers, becos more competition mah...<br>as for people who does not seems what they are... sorry... I dun think I hv such frens... or they appear as what they are to me, even though other people may feel otherwise...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming?

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi hi....Never....not all pretty grls are very sociable but they haff more oppotunities to be than the ordinary ones unless the ordinary grl got lots of charisma and spunk.<br><br>I dun know about others but I get intimidated by pretty grls...especially if they know a lot of guys around her...I think...What makes u think u can get her or even be able to get her attention when so many guys want her and so many obviously better looking?!....<br><br>also shy shy lah...cannot.:-)<br><br>I do know people who aren't what they seem to be...but girls fall for these types very easily...I stay clear from them as much as possible tho...dun want my life to be mixed up wiff theirs...bad karma...and poor grls who fall for these types without knowing...or willingly do it...<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I guess the most obvious way is to notice their dressing? Even if its not 100%, I think it makes up abt 80%. There can be pretty girls who dress up conservatively and look nerdy too ya know. And ordinary girls looking havoc.... so i dun think thats true.<br><br>As for pretty gals... its not just pretty gals who get all the attention rite? An ordinary gal who knows how to carry herself well and dress nicely will attract just as much attention if not more.<br><br>But it'll be hard to approach a gal who has lotsa guys swarming around her... unless u are purely treating her as a friend then its no problem. But if u are interested in being more then friends then of course I'll think twice.. coz.. how to beat the compettition?<br><br>It all boils down to self confidence in the end lah.<br><br>------------------<br>Why? Why me?<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I think pretty girls are flirty only if I see them in pubs or clubs. Normal pretty girls I see in NTU or Orchard will not make me assume anything about them. I mean..as long as none of them actually flirts in public, I will not have reason to judge anyone based on looks.<br><br>But it is true that I think nerdy under-dressed girls are more unlikely yo flirt and all that. It's just the image thing...<br><br>I agree with Rinoa in that people aren't always what they seem to be. I have seen this more than once too...but I will need more exposure if I can conclude anything  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>And yes..I get intimidated by pretty women because as firewire says, there are better male "candidates" and so they would be eligible for her (I think) and so I would have no chance. It's just a matter of not banging your head on the wall.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I have met people like what you mentioned....so decent-looking girls and guys who suddenly light up a cigarette or start swearing foul words.<br><br>Cheers !</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I guess it's hard to judge nowadays since even normal girls are starting to get more provocative in their dressing. So it is hardly a factor to determine their 'looseness'. Still, like I never agree with the 'women who dress sexy deserve to be raped' crap, I would strongly advise to pay heed cause some other guys do believe in that.<br><br>Anyway, yeah, to a certain extent, the way they dress kinda does seem to reflect their openness. And the places they frequent too. Nowadays, there is no need to go down to Boat Quay and Zouk to babe-watch... Yesterday I saw these 3 girls at Wisma McDonalds... all them 'hiao'.. sashaying their brown hair, one even kept touching herself up in the mirror on the wall, looking at her teeth, smiling at herself, doing her hair while queuing at the counter... WAH LAU.. can't stand these kinda of vain Ah-Lian types...<br><br>Oops... digressing..anyhow, I don't know anyone whose actions differ from the looks... all my friends look exactly what u expect them to be ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Hee... and oh yeah, I do feel intimidated by girls who have lots of guys after them, esp. those who drive 3000GTs and own 4 cars etc... *hint* *hint* I prefer simplicity in my relationships and friendships...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> But of course I will not forsake a prospective good friend/partner just cause she has lotsa admirers..<br><br>Cheers.<br><br>------------------<br>Is it cold in here, or is it just me?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well...it is just that i have heard of this ordinary ger who has 3 bfs at the same time. And who says ordinary gers can't be flirts!!The art of flirting, ppl say is the way to go thru the guys weaknesses...hmmm...I wonder what would happen if her bfs know about it...The worst thing is her character sux too...dunno why the guys like her too...*puzzled*</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Actually I think ordinary looking gals still can flirt around.  It is the art of conversation. Its normally through conversation that one gets attracted to the other. But then of course the good looking ones will definitely get the attentions first but how you progress onwards depends on their PR skills. Personally i get intimidated by gals who r good looking since they have so many guys swooning over them, they won't give a damn bout me but smart gals, i kinda admire them.....not intimidated.And I think that appearance can be decieving coz my fren's parents tot that i am those goody type of guyz but then......u noe the rest.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>girls wearing to kill(as riona uses) are normally quite open minded cos they should know the way they dress are bound to attract a lot of attention. but whether they are easy will be difficult to tell, u may ran the risk to have five fingers print on your face by asking them if u can sleep with them.<br>as for u're friends, riona, maybe the guys also have a few girlfriends, so they're equal.</div>
