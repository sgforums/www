            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm... I think the question is:<br><br>Would a casino built here in Singapore make people who do not usually gamble to go gamble??<br><br>My guess is that people who do not believe in gambling in the first place would not gamble whether we have the casino or not.<br>And those people who will patronise the new Singapore casino will be those who are already going to Genting every weekend to gamble.<br><br>So i seriously dun think the Singapore casino would encourage new gambling, especially since they're going to have super expensive membership fees that will probably deter new gamblers anyway.<br><br>The new casino will just serve to channel the gambling revenue that now goes to the Malaysian govenrment to the Singapore government.</div>
