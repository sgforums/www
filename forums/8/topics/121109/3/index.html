If we were to vote for the opposition candidates in the few contested GRCs and they win, this will mean a few more opposition voices in parliament while reducing the ruling party's share of the vote. If we can do this consistently for the next couple of elections, more will be encouraged to go into opposition politics and we will slowly but surely chip away at the ruling party. Two things will happen, one is theat the ruling party will be shaken from its complacency and perhaps make a greater effort to represent the voice of the people instead of dictating to it, another is that a viable opposition movement will take shape and perhaps topple the incumbents by representing the voice of the people(ironically this was the original idea behind the formation of the pap) It may take several decades, but Rome wasn't built in a day!
