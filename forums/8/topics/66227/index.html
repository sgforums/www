From the way I see it, the government is just some sort of like SAF's style (In terms of admin and guidelines &amp; not necessarily the practical sense). If they have to take CHANCES, they'll rather SACRIFICE OUR FREEDOM and 'luxury'. Like what Bear has suggested, many of the cases of 'opening up' are either by 'force' or just acts as a form of 'control' to EASE 'tension' among general public... To get people 'satisfied' at least FOR THE MOMENT.... As soon as things are 'under control', 'things' starts HAPPENING again.... This is NOT an old trick...

Or else there's a danger of strawman.<br><br><blockquote>This is what is Inculcated into us from young, n is expected to pass on to our kids.

In defense, it can be said that the state of affairs during post-independence years necessitate it. I'm not an expert on politics or economics, but I think the gahman need human resources in certain industry, hence the rigid system and "boring" degrees in local universities. Taiwan and HK are countries with quite different state of affairs during our post-independence years, and I don't think we should compare with them so directly.<br><br>Digressing a bit, what did SM say about SIA and Cathay? He mentioned some differences between the two airlines right? Stuffs Cathay can afford to do but we cannot? Or our pilots think themselves big fark and refuse the wage cut?<br><br><blockquote>Mr Sim himself said that it would be impossible to acheive that in sg due to the levels of approval that need to be obtained.

And if you realize, China also has red tape, but people can still pull strings, maybe bribery, to get the job done. I'm not saying Creative did that, but it's good to realize some reasons behind the perceived less red tape.</div>

Look at the bigger picture instead. I dun mean to prove that im in anyway a wise person or watsoever. We try to lay out the facts. The govt has a hard position, which opposes many of us. Always.<br><br>First of all, why do we need govt?<br>A healthy society definitely needs rules and regulations to function well.

Nope. this is when the need to create harmony comes in. There are still disputes existing in each society that are not under crimes to be settled. Through wat? The statutory law. We need to appreciate this.<br><br>There is only a govt forming saying a hundred pple. And how many opinions do they have to seek to pass down a satisfying law to all? 100 vs 3 millions? It's never too easy to satisfy all. See the beneficial side of every legislation.<br></div>
