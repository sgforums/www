Did you even stop to read your post before posting? If not please read through it again.<br><br>Have you used a single positive adjective to describe the coming marriage? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> If you claim to value your r/s wif her so much(as much as ur freedom) why can't you see it from a slightly more positive light? Eg. getting to grow old with her, having her by your side more often, having kids, helping each other grow into better people etc.<br><br>Please don't be a knucklehead. You already know the answer to the question.</div>
