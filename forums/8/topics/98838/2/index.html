            <div class='col-md body'>Actually that so called singapura cat can't be found in singapore at all. In fact if you want to buy it you have to import it from america. And one of this can cost up to 2000USD. I rather spend S$1000  on a Maine Coon or S$600 on a Norwegien Forest Cat. Anyway those cats in the zoo are rented from a couple of Singapura owners here. Will be here for sometime before they are taken back. The rational behind it? The whole world is calling up on Singapore to enquire about the Singaura Catsa nd the problem is, since it is not exactly a local breed, we simply can't supply them with any information. So thats why they got a few cats here.</div>

This name has been there for many years already.</div>

No inbreeding like those peds. So they dun see the vet that often. Peds, like persians, often have problems like sinus runny nose etc. But people want peds because of certain features that are attributed to them. But as i say lah, whether it is a ped or a mix, the most important thing is that you must love them. Otherwise they will add on to the population of strays.</div>
