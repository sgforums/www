            <div class='col-md body'>Alright...I'm happy that we're getting so much response now...It's a good idea to meet at COFFE CLUB EXPRESS as we can get to  know each other better in a quiet and relaxed atmosphere with hot chicks sitting the next table away.  But then again, I'm sure the hornier one among us will be more interested in gawking than talking:-) he heh...just kidding..<br><br>To Whiz,<br><br>Unfortunately, most places are smoky.  I personally don't smoke and find it quite disgusting to do so, but other people do and they have addictions to it...In light of the fact that the majority of youths smoke, we clean breathers have to live in their society...so to speak...IN any event, most night spots are smoky, but I guess u get used to it, and going once in a while isn't going to kill anyone...Although my eyes say otherwise..:-p</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Um...how about we show genuine interest in the outing and post replies here, but when Chief and the rest Emails us, he could tell us a different location, time etc...??<br><br>In this way, we can "fool" any New Paper people or other curious Singaporeans. I agree the media may want to "spy" on this meeting because of the tabloid news that's already been generated. Maybe this is a good idea ? What do you all think ?<br><br>Anyways, I have a genuine interest in meeting up, as long as it's a big enough group and it's in a quiet and comfortable setting as mentioned before.<br><br>To Firewire:<br><br>Thanks for telling me about most nightspots, I guess I'll have to take a chance there. I used to go Hard Rock Cafe for my friend's Birthday Party, but after they converted the place into a dance floor, it got really smoky. Not surprisingly, I left 10 minutes into the party because my nose couldn't bear the smoke (have a sinus problem u see....)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I also agree that such places probably can kill a guy...sometimes University girls are enough to give a guy nosebleed + heart attacks too, so I perfectly understand !!

            <div class='col-md body'>OK....i'm putting up this post to provide answers to the deluge of emails i've received about this whole thing. as well as put in my two cents worth of bullshit <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Firstly due to the fact that the O's and A's are in progress we will be leaving for the clubs and pubs onli at 10 or 11pm. i suggest turning up for the gathering at the Coffee Club and skipping the rest if you cannot or care not for the clubbing and pubbing during this exam period. Madz and Chief are interested primarily on meeting the supporters and we wanna make it a fun nite.<br><br>Secondly, there will be no age meeting for the earlier gathering at a kopi place. Bring a fren or two who'd like to participate in the social event. Just remember to pack the joint! The age limit to go clubbing for guys is at least 18 but just in case try to look older (this means dressing up a wee bit)for girls its a minimum of 17 cause the bouncers are far more lenient when it comes to pretty girls (b@st@rds...) Again if u want to go clubbing or pubbing please dress up and dress appropriately..its good for morale <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">Please be fun and sociable. try to smile and if u can laugh. if u onli listen to Alternative please dont heckle the dancers among our group or the music. Otherwise be realli friendly laugh and smile and offer Chief lots of praises and Madz lotsa sex<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>No we won't be paying for you ppl, we'll be going dutch. Remember the Coke is flat and expensive and you have to pay for plain water. Cover charge to enter clubs can range from $20-$65 dollars depending on where we finally end up bring at least $50. No consumption of E's or marijuana if u do, then please excuse the boycott.<br><br>Try to bring a camera or two with film inside, so that we can have a lotsa pics to put up. Brush your teeth, put on cologne and we'll see u there!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Chief:<br><br>Please ensure that there will be photos about the event to be posted on the jcgirls website.  I am interested in how's everyone look like in real life, particularly the girls. (hint hint for the photo shoots!).  Haha!<br><br>I won't be able to make it, 'cos I live far far away from Sg.  Only an airplane could me take there.<br><br>Arrgghhh!  I am missing out on this whole thing! Damn!<br><br>Anyway, have fun.  Don't forget about the photos!<br><br>Best regards!</div>
