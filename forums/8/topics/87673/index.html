He paid the fine, which he described as sup sup sui ('a small amount' in Cantonese). It was just a fraction of what he had paid his lawyers, he told reporters.<br><br>Both sets of feuding neighbours do not think this will mark the end of the saga which had, at one stage, drawn people from across the Causeway to visit Everitt Road to witness the shenanigans.<br><br>Over the past decade, police had been called in several times as neighbours trained spotlights and video cameras at each other's homes, took photographs and traded barbed comments and lawyers' letters.<br><br>After several magistrate's complaints were filed against Chan, the warring parties went for mediation and agreed to a truce last January. It was promptly broken.<br><br>Mrs Angela Gan, 39, one of the women whom Chan insulted, said yesterday that she and her neighbours will continue to train their cameras on the Chans.<br><br>'It's been so many years. I don't think the verdict will change the situation,' she said. 'Whether it will change or not depends on the other party's behaviour, personality and attitude. Everyone makes mistakes, it's whether they are able to learn a lesson.'<br><br>Both sides had submitted video recordings to support their case.<br><br>The ones tendered by the prosecution showed Chan calling Mrs Gan a 'pervert' and a 'bitch' and making an obscene gesture.<br><br>Mr Koh was not convinced by Chan's argument that he had been provoked by Mrs Gan. Chan did not look angry at all in the video and could be heard laughing, he added.<br><br>He was also satisfied that Chan was indeed faking masturbation and not just 'wriggling his left arm to improve blood circulation', as he had argued during the trial last month.<br><br>The retiree was also caught on camera telling another neighbour, 24-year-old Ms Bency Chua: 'Butch, put the camera between your legs.'<br><br>Said the magistrate: 'He had employed words and actions weighted with sexual imagery to cause distress to the two young women.'<br><br>The defence also produced footage of their neighbours shouting at them.<br><br>Chan's daughter, Soo Yin, a teacher, said that the Gans pasted on their gate caricatures depicting her father as a pig and herself as a rabbit.<br><br>Pleading for leniency, Chan's lawyer, Mr Lee Yih Gia, said his client acted in response to the history of animosity between him and his neighbours.<br><br>Outside court, a cheerful Chan said: 'I fought the case... to show Singaporeans that my neighbours are not angels with halos but ordinary persons with horns too. Like me.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Copyright @ 2004 Singapore Press Holdings. All rights reserved.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>additional note to the report:<br><br>WHEN IS AN INSULT AN INSULT?<br><br>THE question was whether the prosecution had to prove that the accused person intended his words or behaviour to be insulting, or cause harassment, alarm or distress.<br><br>No, magistrate Alvin Koh decided when he convicted Chan Cheng Khoon under Section 13B(1) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act.<br><br>It is an offence to use insulting words or behaviour 'within the hearing or sight of any person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress'.<br><br>The magistrate relied on an English case from the 1970s to get an interpretation of 'insulting'.<br><br>A man who interrupted a Wimbledon tennis match by stepping onto the court, blowing a whistle and throwing leaflets around was cleared of a charge of insulting behaviour.<br><br>The House of Lords ruled that dictionary meanings of the word 'insulting' were not helpful. Lord Reid said: 'There can be no definition. But an ordinary sensible man knows an insult when he sees or hears it.'<br><br></div>
