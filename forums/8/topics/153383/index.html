            <div class='col-md body'>from a fellow forumner :<br><br><a href="http://forums.hardwarezone.com/showthread.php?t=1112062&amp;page=1&amp;pp=15" rel="nofollow">http://forums.hardwarezone.com/showthread.php?t=1112062&amp;page=1&amp;pp=15</a><br><br>An email to Malaysian High Com. Fellow hardwarezonner any chance that the malaysian side will take action?<br><br>To Whom It may concern:<br><br>On 17th September 2005, my friend and I, 2 Singaporeans, were travelling in Johore Bahru.<br><br>On our way back to the checkpoint around 8pm, along the stretch from Caltex petrol station, we were halted by a Malaysian male, Chinese, around 30+. He told us that couple of days ago there was a fight around the area near the checkpoint and his 'brother' was stabbed, now warded in hospital.<br><br>He claimed that his 'brothers' around the area claim that we looked identical to the assailants during the scene of the fight and happened to recognise us today. He also claimed that initially when we walked pass he wanted to slash us as revenge but just wanted to double confirm if he really did slash the correct people as he keep claiming that he is not a crook. Shortly, another male subject came along.<br><br>Both of them threatened and demanded that we follow them to a nearby coffeeshop all the stretch down from the checkpoint for verification with their 'boss' if not they are not going to let us go and if we do try to run, they have people along the whole stretch of road and opposite standing by. Fearing that we might be harmed as we are foreigners in Johore Bahru, we reluctantly agreed to their demand as safety was our main priority and our conscience was clear.<br><br>My friend and I were brought to a coffeeshop operated by a group of Indians. After some talking, they seeked 'financial assistance'. They asked if we had any cash but we do not have much. They extorted to check our wallets and their jestures frightened me and my friend. I was forced to surrender my remaining SGD $40 and a Motorola E398 mobile phone w/o local service provider SIM card. My friend also was forced to surrender SGD $10, RM $10 and a Sony Ericsson K700i mobile phone w/o local service provider SIM card. Initially, they tried to ask for our credit card details and even wanted us to give them our passports as they said Singapore passports can fetch a high price however we refused to give in.<br><br>The 1st male subject that I mentioned earlier handed us a piece of paper stating his name as Ah Keng (verbally he told us he is called Ah Keong) with a mobile no. 016-757-0089. He wanted us to go back to Singapore to bring back another RM $3-4k in order to redeem back our handphones. After which he let both of us leave the coffeeshop unharmed.<br><br>When we went back to the checkpoint, we asked the customs officers on duty if there is any police station in the vicinity. They only told us downstairs and refuse to render more assistance to us. Traumatised by the earlier incident and we do not know the way around, we decided not to stay in Johore Bahru any longer and left for Singapore.<br><br>We headed to Police Cantonment Complex as soon as we cleared Singapore immigrations to lodge a report and sadly, we were told by the officer on duty that Singapore police force is unable to intefere in Malaysia's domestic affairs. We tried calling the number given earlier by the subject and was dismayed to know that the line was invalid. We even tried searching for Johore Bahru's police headquarter's telephone number on the Internet however the line gave an engaged tone or a voice automated system. We do not understand the Royal Malaysia Police Force and the automated voice system as it is all conversed in Bahasa Melayu.<br><br>My friend and I hope that the local authorities in Johore Bahru can follow up on this unfortunate incident based on the report we made with Singapore police force and take appropriate actions. If required, we can fax over the police report for your kind perusal.<br><br>Thank you and may you understand our plight.<br><br>__________________<br><br>it's the 2nd similiar incident already ... so people going to JB .. be careful of urself</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>by the way the police station is directly opposite the custom on way home.  or just after the  underground after customs.  when go malaysia or JB, always remember, if anything happens a guest will be at a losing end.<br><br>thats the difference between singapore and malaysia/indo/thailand etc.<br><br>The way the authorities functions are different.<br><br>whenever i go, don;t show off anything like fancy hp or showoff body language.<br><br>always used crowded places.   Know where is the police station.<br><br>Many of these daylight roberies occurred because victims stand at the wrong place.  The moment cross customs, proceed out to the other side quickly and head staight to city square.  never hang "outside" the customs, especially the taxis or buses.<br><br>There are many such robberies over the years.  Nothing much can be done except, just use roads or passage which lots of people used.<br><br>i have been JB many times so far OK even in late nights or quiet lanes., but does not mean i will not get rob, there is NO gaurantee.  don;t bring a loaded wallet, just enough cash and etc to get by and writeoff.<br><br>by the way, where is the alarm siren.  the one that scream when a clip is being pull off.<br><br>i will even be more extra extra vigilant in my next trip.   There is no gaurantee.<br><br>thanks for those that continue to such threads.<br><br>it sure does more good.<br><br>It is just anyone bad luck to run into these robberies.  not to mention car jackers.<br><br>so much for their buy malaysia welcome.</div>

Why? Because you dun speak Malay. And once you speak to them in impecable English, they not happy already, so naturally they won't bother to help you at all. Sadly, this poor service of the Malaysian Police is prevalent in all ranks. My advice to you is that next time, get a Malaysian friend to accompany you when you are visiting Malaysia or go in big groups about 5-6 ppl. When those gangsters see you alone or as a pair looking lost, they will target you because you are not familar with the place or ppl there. Then bring litle cash and dun wear branded stuffs or carry branded goods, just act poor like someone pointed out.  And also they recognize Sinaporeans through the language(there is no accent in Singaporean chinese language and speaking too much English also tell tales. After customs, walk with the crowd down the underpass straight to City Square. Don't stop or talk to strangers. Ignore them when they try to accost you., much less follow them and give others the misconception that they are your friends. Shout for help if necessary if they truy to drag you by force. In a nutshell, never follow them. Just cary on walking. They are still not so daring as to snatch your things in public because along that stretch always a lot of ppl such as taxi-drivers and the ppl generally loathes snatch-theifs because they have caused several deaths. So chances are they more likely to help you.<br>And I would think you should know better than to think that Sinagpore police can help you in such matters.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>so guys, stay away fr there</strong><br><br>Actually say back msia guys also cause the jam at causeway mah. They worst it is 5.5 day week cuz they come inside spore dig gold leh. For us spore guys go JB we is go inside throw gold to them leh. That is a very big difference. One is to steal wealth away the other is to give wealth to the other.<br><br>So choosing the lesser evils, I think go in give wealth is less evil cuz it help the JB state get more prosperous until their other brother see already eye red hahahaa......  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That's scary man... I can imagine how helpless the 2 were when in that situation. I had drove to JB on a few occassions too, damn... I was "rob" by their traffice police in broad daylight. Openly asking for S$200. Gave them $100 instead and was told to put the $$$ under the drivers' licence before handing them the $$$.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>With their "gangsters" and their "crooked tp", haiz... how to help boost their economy?
