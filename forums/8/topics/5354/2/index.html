            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa: Many thanks, but I'll take a raincheck. I'll depend on my own efforts for the moment, and thats the story I'm sticking to. That said, I think getting to know girls(and guys) through relatives is just like getting to know people through friends. Just be honest about getting to know people first and don't expect fireworks the first time all the time. Knowing people should be enjoyable, not pressure filled.<br><br>Luf: I agree. that's why I try very hard not to do that. Its a conscious effort you know. Thats why I'm so tough. HAHahahahah.<br><br>Bishamon and zappy125: Yes, agree to both. But I think if we analyse too much we'll take away the fun and excitement and meaning of it all. So I'll lighten up, and enjoy the trip.<br><br>tictac: I think the rules that apply to us apply to ladies as well. It will be unfair to both of you if you settle. And when I say settle I don't mean that there's anything wrong with that person, just that he/she wasn't what you wanted in the first place. The sad thing is, if you wait, there is a small chance you might never get to where you want, if a family is what you are after. If you don't wait, you might mess things up. Sucks right?<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 25-11-1999).]</div>

I do believe in the midst of us there are some good lookers too but with real ink and substance.I respect ppl who dun go all over flaunting their looks and body but use theit intellect to impress ppl.This is what I call a real gem and talent...It is in here that our comments are valued and not judged according how we look like...real cool!<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm..long time since i read this thread...in fact was just talking abt such matters with my sis just 2 nites ago...<br><br>Frankly, you put a model in front of me say she will be my gf, i will be in 2 minds abt this...my primal instincts would be to say "yes!"...but my brain would tell me, heck, i dont even know what kinda gal this is, and like rinoa says, (i can see with and hear with my own eyes and ears as well), goodlooking pple often take so much for granted cos they're priviledged, they arnt the sort who are considerate or have much of a personality..basically most of these goodlooking pple have the same mentality and character...<br><br>Dont get me wrong, i dont blame them for being as such; its just that being born the way they are, they nvr needed to think for others...<br><br>I mean we are all born as such, it isnt becos we're nice or not that determines our looks...but WHY?? do early fairy tales often have heroes and heroines whom are described as beautiful and goodlooking? why are we exposed to goodness being linked to physical beauty?? Even in typical Soaps and Serials, the good guys look great and the bad ones look ugly...ever though abt this??<br><br>Yes, as babies, it has been shown in medical research that we do have a better response to better looking pple, but what typical society does is to instead of discouraging such association, encourages it by linking up goodness with physical beauty??<br><br>In a sense its not really our fault for prefering better looking pple, its just something to grow out of?</div>
