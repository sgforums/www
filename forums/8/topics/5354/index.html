            <div class='col-md body'>Yup, I certainly do agree looks do matter. Firstly, its the first impression that you form of the person. Just like a fresh orange that looks dirty and rotten.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah i would tend to agree with EcK abt this,<br>well Rinoa i used to and still think that most as in like 9.5 out of evry person has looks figured into the relationship equation somewhere...you say u dont...u mean you totally dont care abt it at all? well, if its true its great that u're one of those rare pple that lighten my cynicism of humans...(I dont doubt you btw, i dont know you so i'll take it for the truth)<br><br>As for what u have to say abt the modelling world well i'll have to say that yeah i was once like this, that i would really like to have a model gf, probably not just for her beauty but also for the prestige...i think many, if not most of us ordinary guys would have felt this in one way or another at some time in their lives...<br><br>Fortunately, i appear(at least to myself) to have outgrown that hormone bursting period, overcome my own inferiority complexes enough to not need the prestige thing though i believe many old rich men still keep such young "vases" for such a reason?<br><br>Still though i must say that for a relationship i would very much like my gal to be attractive in my eyes, though not necessarily in the conventional beauty sense...<br><br>I speak to my frds and sister abt these,as well as listening and reading abt others' opinions and they say well they only need the partner to be "kan de guo yen"(lookswise) , meaning that he/her needs only be soothing to her/his vision. Of coz the person must be nice larh.<br><br>Basically i believe i can represent it in another way, that they dont NEED a super chio or yan partner(like 7.5 and above upon 10), and a 6(in their eyes) will probably suffice. I myself feel this is so...in fact since i look very average and have a quiet lifestyle , a too pretty gal( whom usually would be more socially active) would probably gimme insecurities as well, not just internally, but from the looks she gets from others...<br><br>What do the rest of you think??<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personal opinion. In a word, yes. Just like you yourself referred many times in your latest reply about how your friend is not cute enough to date you model friends.<br><br>Many people have already said before, that initially looks are important, but in the long run its the compatibility of personality that determines whether 2 people stick together. So, you have to ask yourself, are you in it for the short term, or are you in it for the long term.<br><br>I am NOT trying to por the models. I believe that someone can be drop dead pretty and be a good person as well. No, I'm not talking about myself, but I think there are such people about. I'm sure many people reading this bulletin board knows such people.<br><br>Then you might ask, why? Why are looks important? I don't have the answer. I guess people just like looking at beautiful objects. But fundamentally its about 2 people relating to each other. Good for you if that other person has looks.<br><br>I'll end with something that I wish I had the guts/ opportunity to say to a pretty girl:<br><br>You don't have to be ashamed of your beauty, you don't have to worry about people acknowledging your beauty. Its your fortune that you are blessed as such, so treasure it.  You have the right to be treated with respect, you have the right to be valued for yourself as a person. You have the right to tell a sleaze bag to piss of and get bent. However, don't abuse it, because if you do there are other people that deserve it more than you do. And most importantly, be nice to that not so good looking guy who is probably a shy person who has mustered up all the courage he could to talk to you because he is captivated by your beauty and would like to know you.<br><br>So there.</div>

One quality girl is all you need not the quantity. If a girl like u becos of your sports car, u can forget about her. Well, I admit that I am a sports car lover but definately that "someone" that I am looking for does not need ot have a sports car to impress me. Still character stands out. Similar interests to share and to enjoy each other's company, not afraid to show each other's weaknesses is what i call "click".<br><br>So, not all girls go for looks and cars.

            <div class='col-md body'>Notice the guys wif fast cars and string of cashncards get pretty model gals?<br>Rinoa is right to an extent.<br><br>Is true that every guy wants a model gf( if put one infront of you, you dun want, meh?)<br>as a trophy gf I know many of my frens who have gone out wif this sort.It doesn't last long, trust me, if the relationship is only based on looks or money.<br>I know we should appreciate our own gfs, however plain they are because looks will never last and it's the character that matters.<br>But who can stop us from stealing a sideway glance at a model-like babe when she walks past? We all like to look at nice things.<br><br>My gf may not be a model, but she is very sweet and kind and not as materialistic as all those model-like babes who are used to guys pampering them whenever they ask for it and I tell myself this is all that matters.</div>

Its just that noo matter what I believe there is so much evidence to the contrary and seemingly none to support it. Perception lah.<br><br>Don't get me wrong though. I'm not going to scratch every sports car I see. They are still nice.</div>

I'll need both your license plate numbers, so just give me a mail when you people buy your fast cars.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>That thing about guys getting desparate though looking for a mate though, I'm really paranoid about becoming like that because to me it seems that you might want to settle for anything that comes your way and its not fair for the other person if down the track you change your mind, even if there is nothing wrong with the current partner. I'm not saying it won't work, I'm just pointing out that it can happen.</div>
