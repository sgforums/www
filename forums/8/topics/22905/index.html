            <div class='col-md body'>Some church members are not happy<br>BY SETO NU-WEN<br>Jun 8, 2002<br>EVERY Sunday, for 18 years, he has been attending services at the New Creation Church. Mr Lee, who didn't want to give his full name, said he contributes about $50 to $100 at the Sunday offerings.<br>On top of that, every month, he makes sure that 10 per cent of his salary, about $1,000, is given to the church as tithe.<br>About a month ago, during one Sunday service, he said he was taken aback.<br>He received news that the church, through its business arm Rock Productions, had just bought East Coast Recreational Centre for over $10m.<br>It has since been renamed Marine Cove.<br>Mr Lee, a 48-year-old businessman, said: "I was upset because the members of the congregation were never consulted about this decision.<br>"We were told about it only about a month ago but the decision to buy it was made at the end of last year.<br>"Every month, I willingly give 10 per cent of my salary to the church. But right now, I'm concerned about the accountability of that money." Services are held three times a week at the Rock Auditorium, which is leased by Rock Productions from Suntec City.<br>Another church-goer, who wanted to be known only as Mr Chung, told The New Paper: "As far as I understand, the church management has been scouting for a place to build a proper church.<br>"But in this case, the purchase of East Coast Recreational Centre was for investment purposes. That brings into question the management's priorities.<br>"Is the need to spend $10m on investment more important than building a proper church for our services?"<br>Mr Chung, a 28-year-old lawyer, said: "The least that the management could do was to seek some views from the members of the congregation.<br>"Instead we found out much later. Some church attendees I've spoken to found out only when they read it in the newspapers."<br>Like Mr Lee, Mr Chung said he gives 10 per cent of his salary as tithe every month.<br>He declined to disclose the amount, but he said that, combined with his wife's income as a sales executive, the monthly contribution was "considerable".<br>Ms C H Tan decided to leave the church a few months ago.<br>The real estate agent, who is in her 30s, said: "I began wondering: Where does the money go to?.<br>"Now I find out that the money has gone into a business arm and investment. Where is the accountability to the members of the congregation?<br>"That's why I decided to leave. I had lost my faith in the church and its management."<br>However, Mr Lee is not thinking of leaving.<br>He said: "I have nothing against the church or the religion. I am a staunch Christian.<br>"I have no problems with giving a portion of my salary to the church.<br>"I just expect the money to be used for church purposes - like its daily administrative processes, supporting its full-time staff and donating to the needy or members of the congregation who need financial help.<br>"But when a church decides to form a business arm and go into a commercial direction, then I think something is not right."<br>ROCK PRODUCTIONS IS A SEPARATE ENTITY<br>MAJOR decisions are taken at the church's annual general meetings, its secretary, Mr Matthew Kang, said.<br>The meetings are attended by the church's registered members.<br>He said: "Registered members of the church are those who attend our care groups or serve in our ministries. Such membership is open to all who attend our services."<br>Mr Lee and Mr Chung are not registered members, and neither was Ms Tan.<br>In an earlier interview with The New Paper, Rock Productions manager Jack Ho said the original plan was to build a church on the site of the East Coast Recreational Centre.<br>But after several rounds of applications, this was not approved. He added that they are still looking for a proper site.<br>Responding to the issue of tithes, Mr Kang said that "tithes are very personal".<br>He said: "We don't impose an amount, nor do we force or pressurise members of our congregation to give a certain amount. We don't discriminate against those who don't pay tithes.<br>"We also don't keep a record of who pays and who doesn't. If members want us to keep a record so they are eligible to register as a member, they can fill up a form."<br>Mr Kang is also a non-paid director at Rock Productions and a shareholder trustee of the church.<br>He added: "We would like to make it clear that even though Rock Productions is the business arm, it is run as a separate entity.<br>"Any transfer of funds between the church and Rock Productions is provided for in the church's constitution.<br>"This constitution has been in effect since the church was formed and may have been amended over time but each amendment was approved by the Registry of Societies (ROS).<br>"Once a year, our accounts are audited and submitted to the ROS."<br>But what happens if Rock Productions runs into bad investments? Will the church be liable?<br>Said Mr Kang: "We have not encountered this before.<br>"So far, we haven't received any complaints about our purchase of East Coast Recreational Centre."<br>The New Paper sought the opinion of an experienced corporate lawyer.<br>He said: "If Rock Productions runs into trouble, only its shareholders are liable, not the church.<br>"This is because the company is registered as a separate entity from the church."<br><br></div>
