            <div class='col-md body'>i wonder y people like to compared, its easy to find people worse than u, but its even easier to find people that are better off then you. I always believe in this : live within ur means and you will be happy. y envy ur buddies who are making 10k a mth??juz admire and salute them for having the guts to start out on their own, cus for every success story, there are countless that have failed. For me, i come from an average family, i figured out that unless i strike TOTO(the chances are 1 in 5864443200), the only way for me to break out of the 'poverty' cycle is through education, hardwork, perseverance, and perhaps abit of luck. I didnt like university, but that thought motivated mi all the way...I have a feeling that many who had similiar experiences as mi will no doubt agree with mi~~<br><br>cheers<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
