Is it supposed to be just a money-spinning tool which you can't be bothered with?<br><br>2) Can you enlighten me as to how you view forumites here, i.e. the people who are actually supporting the forum. Will you give a damn if they were to voice some dissatisfaction.<br><br>I have no time to think of a third. Busy busy. Do take your time, and don't type nonsense Jason my little boy.

            <div class='col-md body'>Jason,<br><br>*sigh*  As a friend, I am telling you that it's morally wrong for you to refuse to remove tet's picture.  Why? Does it really draw traffic into this forum? Or you just want to see someone hurt?  Does it really have to end up in a law suit? I really don't know your intention.  Are you really a proud man as you claim to be? That's why you refused to give in to our demands for the removal of the picture and the explaination on why the threads were move?<br><br>You have already admit to me that you are bias and the reason on why you moved the threads are because of your relationhsip with FireIce.  Why can't you just make it clear to everyone else here?  As promised, I will not post the log.  During our chat on IRC last night, there are many things I suggested that you can do to remedy this situation.  And I don't think it's so hard to do.<br><br>You mentioned that you are disappointed in me for whatever I did to you.  Again, I must stress that I am not targetting you or FireIce, just the situation itself.  I am personally more disappointed in you.  As for me, I am speaking up for something I feel is unjust, for you...you are hiding, avoiding, ignoring, and hoping that this issue will just slowly die down.<br><br>This is not how it suppose to be.  If you really want to end all of this now, speak up and give forumites here and explaination.  You are wrong, but if you can admit it I am sure people here can understand.<br><br>If you have noticed, I have already stop most of my post in this forum about freedom of speech, hoping that when weekend comes you will be responsible enough to give a clear explaination, but I guess I am really naive.  Part of me really wish that you didn't approach me last night on IRC, then I will not see your true colors.<br><br>Part of a honest friendship is not just to be there to pat you on your back when you did something good, but also to let you know when you did something wrong.  You might not be happy about me posting this, and you might not even consider me as a friend from now on, but I can tell you that I am not doing anything wrong.  If our friendship is that fickle then I can do without it.<br><br>You always know where to find me if you need advice and I will never turn my back on you, but you must understand what you are doing is not right.<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...sting like a bee...<br><br>join me @ #sgclub</div>
