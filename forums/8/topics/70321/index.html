            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE: From 2006, there will only be one admission exercise for Junior Colleges and Centralised Institutes.<br><br>This will be after the students receive their 'O' level results.<br><br>All students will start their pre-university courses only in mid March.<br><br>Second-year Junior College student Ong Bing Ding spent his first 8 weeks of pre-university education at Jurong Institute.<br><br>He failed to get into Anderson JC for the first 3 months based on his preliminary exam results.<br><br>But his 'O' level results were good enough for JC but he then found he had to attend make up lectures and adapt to a new environment.<br><br>"When I came in as second intake students there're people who're already in the 1st group and they have their own group of friends. (Especially during the orientation, which is a period to find friends, I really need to know them but) it's very difficult to break into their cliques," said Bing Ding.<br><br>Every year, some 20 to 50 percent of first-year JC students like him move from one college to another.<br><br>This - dubbed 'churning' - is dreaded by students, teachers and parents.<br><br>Principal of Anderson Junior College, Tan Tiek Kwee, said: "A lot of hassle. You'll find that schools have to conduct 2 admission exercises. The first intake comes in, the teachers have to conduct subject-combination talks, and then the time table is also drawn up. After 3 months, we have to do the whole exercise again and we have to revamp the time-table again just for the 3 months.<br><br>"If you have only one intake, teachers will not have to conduct these additional lesson, at the same time they can start off at the same pace because earlier during conduct of normal lessons, the first intake of students will be at an advantage. They already have got some knowledge so it's quite difficult for teachers to peg their lessons at the certain level to benefit both first and second intake."<br><br>Now, the Education Ministry has agreed to make the changes.<br><br>From 2006, Year 1 students will be admitted in the 10th week of the year.<br><br>There'll only be 3 terms for JC 1 students - but they'll have a longer 3rd term of 14 instead of 8 weeks.<br><br>Year end holidays will only start just before Christmas - and stretch 3 weeks into January.<br><br>It will also result in changes to the JC 2 curriculum - it'll start later - the end of January.<br><br>What it all means is this - students will still have a 79-week course and 23-weeks of school holidays but spread out differently over the 2 years.<br><br>Students will also sit for the 'A' level examinations 2 weeks later and results will also be released 2 weeks later.<br><br>One teacher welcoming the changes is Jason Tan.<br><br>Because he can now holiday during the off peak season in January.<br><br>"The biggest bonus is to the singles or those without children because we've always been restricted to peak holiday season for our travel," said Mr Tan.<br><br>Holidays aside, students feel it's fairer to have entry selection based on the common 'O' level exams and not the differing standards of Secondary schools.<br><br>"The prelim results depend on different schools and they have different standards so it's not quite fair to the students who go into the other JC for the first 3 months.<br><br>"If everything was taken from the 'O' levels, I think it'll be much fairer and there'll be not much hassle switching JC and getting accustomed to a new environment," said Cheong Li Chang, a JC 2 student who was transferred from Catholic JC to Anderson JC last March.<br><br>"We will not face the fate of separation from our new friends and all that because after coming here for the first in-take, we've already bonded with our class and we've orientated ourselves to fit into the culture. To face a sudden change, it's really quite disruptive and scary," said Jasmine Khoo, a JC 1 student at Anderson. - CNA<br><br>[/quote]<br><br>no more "first 3 mths" experience liao - the honeymoon period.<br><br></div>
