At times when thing is free, it lost its meaning because one may never cherish it. Grooming is essential at least once a month &amp; Vitamins i use Vital Energy cost $56 will last 2 months. Food &amp; Snacks i use Eukanuba only. I will spend at least $100 a month on my pet, at times more depending on my mood. Well its really up to individual as long as you are happy with it. Different people have different needs. I am only quoting a rough cost for example, end of the day its up to you what you want. You may like laksa, i may prefer pasta so whats there to bother. Amusing aren't you? SPCA Miss Deirdre Moss, the last time i saw her was in the early 90s when i participated in some of their events. Well did'nt know Vet got provide such services, i seriously doubt their professionalism now. Hmmm now i have to trace my thoughts, does it mean if my friend is a lawyer i get free legal service? I seriously doubt so, if there is such free service do let me know, i am sure Legal Aid also charge a monetary sum. I wonder if Charity Organisation operate for free? From what i know, they aren't, part of your donation go in their paycheck &amp; upkeep. This is the Real World you know, its harsh but life goes on... whether you like it or not. So stay cheery...stay happy...send my regards to your pet...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

As long you are financially able &amp; your family are agreeable, i don't see why not. Its fun to have pet, i love animals. Been keeping pets almost all my life other than dogs. I bought my 1st puppy when i am 7. Subsequently i kept other pets too from normal ones to rather exotic ones. Buy or get a young puppy will be better than adopting an adult dog as its hard to train them as their character has already settle down. I wish you good luck.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, you can certainly try Action for Singapore Dogs. Website has been given earlier. There's a network of fosterers and who knows, you may be able to find one you are looking for.<br><br>I don't see the sense in buying purebreds from pet shops and pet farms when there are so many abandon dogs around. Someone is going to tell me that purebreds are more loving towards their owners??? That's BS!!!!! Are mongrels any less than purebreds?<br><br>We all know that SPCA and AVA put down dogs because there are simply not enough space for them all. Give an abandon dog another chance.</div>
