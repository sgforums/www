            <div class='col-md body'>Hi All,<br>Be careful where you park your car. This is a true incident. $44 shock for man who parked for 3 hours HE parked for nearly three hours. His bill? A whopping $44!<br>He later found out it costs $16 an hour to park there. That's even more expensive than parking in the Central Business District. (See report at the bottom of the page.)<br><br>When repairman Tan Cheng Kiat, 50, drove to The HarbourFront (next to what was formerly the World Trade Centre) on Feb 27 to repair telephone lines in that area, he didn't count on paying for parking. Previously, he had parked his van for free in the<br>open-air parking lots facing the Singapore Port Institute (SPI) building. That same carpark, managed by Temasek company Mapletree Investments, started using the new Electronic Parking System - the same technology as the well-known ERP system - on Feb 17. So imagine Mr Tan's shock when he was about to leave after spending two hours and 45 minutes inside. He said: 'I was shocked that I had to pay $44 for parking! I thought I<br>had read wrongly. And I didn't have enough money in my CashCard.' Mr Tan claimed he did not read the sign beside the barrier which displayed the parking charges. He went to look for the management to see if the system had computed wrongly. Unfortunately, the amount was right and he was told he could pay by cash instead.<br><br>Mr Tan said: 'They gave me a receipt which I claimed from my supervisor. He was shocked when he saw it. If I knew it was so expensive, I wouldn't have parked there.'<br>When The New Paper went to the same parking lot last Tuesday, the parking sign beside the barrier clearly indicated that for cars, the rate was $4 for every 15 minutes or part thereof. For taxis, it's first half-hour free and $2 for every 15 minutes or thereof. For coaches, buses and baggage trucks, the rate is $2 for every half-hour or thereof. Most of the private cars we saw stopped in their tracks when they saw the hefty parking charges, and reversed out instead. Insurance agent Mr Edwin Chan, 32, said: 'It's ridiculous! I<br>couldn't believe it when I saw the charges. Luckily I stopped to read the sign, otherwise, it would have been a very painful experience.' The parking rates at the HarbourFront Centre (previously known as the World Trade Centre), a short distance away, were<br>cheaper at $1 an hour from 7am to 5pm. Mapletree Investments said that particular lot<br>primarily serves coaches and taxis which pick up passengers disembarking at the nearby<br>Singapore Cruise Centre and is not for cars to park. Said a spokesman: 'Cars can go in to drop off or pick up passengers. And we give them a 10-minute grace period. The high<br>rates are to discourage people from parking there and clogging up the road while the<br>coaches are waiting behind.' They used to clamp private cars in the past but felt that was too labour-intensive. Added the spokesman: 'We have received some complaints about the new system but by and large, people are aware of the rates. Our intention is not to trap motorists.'<br><br>Case: Fees are fair<br>THE Consumers Association of Singapore (Case) feels it's fair to impose high parking fees for cars at the HarbourFront. Executive director Mr Seah Seng Choon said the<br>high charges were imposed to free the space for coaches and taxis and discourage motorists from parking inside for long. But he felt more could be done to warn motorists.<br>Added Mr Seah: 'If the management is of the view that it's meant for coaches and taxis, there should be a big and prominent sign that cars shouldn't park there. 'Or better still, divert them to alternative and cheaper lots. 'In this way, the motorists would take note that these lots are not meant for them.' PARKING AT CBD CHEAPER WE did a quick check at several parking carparks in the expensive CBD area during office hours. Some of the more expensive ones charge about $4 an hour during office hours - a far cry from The HarbourFront's $16 an hour. At Caltex House and Six Battery Road at Raffles<br>Place, the rates were $4 an hour and $2 per half-hour or thereof. COUPON LOTS And that is expensive compared with URA's coupon parking lots in the CBD area - which are $2 an hour. Normal coupon parking at HDB estates are $1 an hour.<br><br>This parking rate is the same as the one in Bukit Timah Shopping Centre where the Beauty World is. Outside parking is much more expensive than the carpark. $16/hr.<br><br></div>

(See report at the bottom of the page.)<br><br>When repairman Tan Cheng Kiat, 50, drove to The HarbourFront (next to what was formerly the World Trade Centre) on Feb 27 to repair telephone lines in that area, he didn't count on paying for parking. Previously, he had parked his van for free in the<br>open-air parking lots facing the Singapore Port Institute (SPI) building. That same carpark, managed by Temasek company Mapletree Investments, started using the new Electronic Parking System - the same technology as the well-known ERP system - on Feb 17. So imagine Mr Tan's shock when he was about to leave after spending two hours and 45 minutes inside. He said: 'I was shocked that I had to pay $44 for parking! I thought I<br>had read wrongly. And I didn't have enough money in my CashCard.' Mr Tan claimed he did not read the sign beside the barrier which displayed the parking charges. He went to look for the management to see if the system had computed wrongly. Unfortunately, the amount was right and he was told he could pay by cash instead.<br><br>Mr Tan said: 'They gave me a receipt which I claimed from my supervisor. He was shocked when he saw it. If I knew it was so expensive, I wouldn't have parked there.'<br>When The New Paper went to the same parking lot last Tuesday, the parking sign beside the barrier clearly indicated that for cars, the rate was $4 for every 15 minutes or part thereof. For taxis, it's first half-hour free and $2 for every 15 minutes or thereof. For coaches, buses and baggage trucks, the rate is $2 for every half-hour or thereof. Most of the private cars we saw stopped in their tracks when they saw the hefty parking charges, and reversed out instead. Insurance agent Mr Edwin Chan, 32, said: 'It's ridiculous! I<br>couldn't believe it when I saw the charges. Luckily I stopped to read the sign, otherwise, it would have been a very painful experience.' The parking rates at the HarbourFront Centre (previously known as the World Trade Centre), a short distance away, were<br>cheaper at $1 an hour from 7am to 5pm. Mapletree Investments said that particular lot<br>primarily serves coaches and taxis which pick up passengers disembarking at the nearby<br>Singapore Cruise Centre and is not for cars to park. Said a spokesman: 'Cars can go in to drop off or pick up passengers. And we give them a 10-minute grace period. The high<br>rates are to discourage people from parking there and clogging up the road while the<br>coaches are waiting behind.' They used to clamp private cars in the past but felt that was too labour-intensive. Added the spokesman: 'We have received some complaints about the new system but by and large, people are aware of the rates. Our intention is not to trap motorists.'<br><br>Case: Fees are fair<br>THE Consumers Association of Singapore (Case) feels it's fair to impose high parking fees for cars at the HarbourFront. Executive director Mr Seah Seng Choon said the<br>high charges were imposed to free the space for coaches and taxis and discourage motorists from parking inside for long. But he felt more could be done to warn motorists.<br>Added Mr Seah: 'If the management is of the view that it's meant for coaches and taxis, there should be a big and prominent sign that cars shouldn't park there. 'Or better still, divert them to alternative and cheaper lots. 'In this way, the motorists would take note that these lots are not meant for them.' PARKING AT CBD CHEAPER WE did a quick check at several parking carparks in the expensive CBD area during office hours. Some of the more expensive ones charge about $4 an hour during office hours - a far cry from The HarbourFront's $16 an hour. At Caltex House and Six Battery Road at Raffles<br>Place, the rates were $4 an hour and $2 per half-hour or thereof. COUPON LOTS And that is expensive compared with URA's coupon parking lots in the CBD area - which are $2 an hour. Normal coupon parking at HDB estates are $1 an hour.<br><br>This parking rate is the same as the one in Bukit Timah Shopping Centre where the Beauty World is. Outside parking is much more expensive than the carpark. $16/hr.<br><br></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> ......</div>
