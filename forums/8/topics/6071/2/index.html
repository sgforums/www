            <div class='col-md body'>Cyberlove? I am still waiting for someone to prove it to me personally.*LOL* Cyberflirting? yes. Cyberlove? That's a no-no for me. I dun really believe in it yet. Yes, I have seen examples, but with my character, it is almost impossible. To me, falling in love with someone you have never seen in real life, or truly know irks me. I have met people on the net. And their personality is most of the time, a big difference.<br><br>I am not saying that everyone is faking themself behind the screen. It's just that to me, the virtual world like it's namesake, is unreal. Eg. I have been emailing this gal from Sweden, yes, we got along quite well, we have mutual topics to discuss, I sent her cards on holidays, and sent her gifts for Valentine and her Bday. But that doesn't mean I am really into chasing her, to me it's more like a friendly kinda thing. I too do not have hope of her being whom she express herself to be when I met up with her, just so because, I think it is too unreal. To commit to someone I have yet even seen, is truly uncomprehensible to the logical me.<br><br>But if say, I meet up with her, and then we fall in love, now that's a different story, some of you may still call it cyberlove. But to me, love only begins when it started, not before that. I claim to be a romantic perosnal, but I believe in real life romance, not romancing my Monitor. I guess I am just not romantic enough to believe in cyberlove, yet.<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 worth</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>WEl..i agreed cyber world is not a good place to fall in love..The insecurity ...the missing of each other is so unbearable at time..<br><br>But come to think of it..Not all...i feel tht pples who fall in love in cyberworld are more simple pples..They normally don't go for look and are more sensitive to Inner beauty then external look..<br>As long as the look is normal i think most of them will hit off easiler.. Pples in the real world are more on the physical look than Cyberworld.<br>If u r able to maintain a good relationship b4 both of u meet, I think the relationship will be a good chance to go further..<br>Normally i personally feel tht it's the characters and inner beauty tht's really attract each other....Tht's wht i always think...But i got to admit that..we still got to face the real world..<br><br>Anywya, there is actually a case recently abt one couple who married thru' internet without knowing the look ..Only on the wedding day itself...Things tht seems impossible are coming back noe..........<br><br>[This message has been edited by patie (edited 08 February 2000).]</div>
