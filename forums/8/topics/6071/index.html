I know that it is something almost impossible.

            <div class='col-md body'>I would think that it depends on the two people who met on the net, whether they want to be lovers in real life. I have met many cyber people in the net, but did not made it into lovers, and similalry, there are other people who managed to do that. It is really up to the two people.<br><br>As my famous saying goes, people are either meant to be together or they are not... So, cyberlove is something that is really subjective. Similarly, cybersex is the same thing as well, because it really depends whether the person is really dreaming or not... We really don't know what is happening on the other side of the screen, and that can be scary at times...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, firstly, I would like to know how do u guys define cyber love. For me cyberlove simply means falling in love with the other party via the cyberworld. No real life contact, just e-mails, chats and phonecalls.<br><br>Falling in love over a virtual personality is that easy. Falling out of love after you meet them would even be easier.<br><br>------------------<br>Why? Why me?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cyberspace has a very strange effect on many people. Many people can be very out-spoken in person in the cyberspace but in real person they are very shy!<br><br>For cyberlove, it happen this way too. Many can find chatting partners in the cyberspace but when they meet up, they normally get disappointed with the person due to many other reasons. But I won't say that cyberlove won't work out coz that's why I found my ger .... it all matters on how each individual takes it and their mentality.<br><br>------------------<br>why, bishamon? why bish?<br>coz he's God of War!!<br>But I'm a peacelover! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From this novice's point of view cyberlove is the discovery of love through the internet, which I think is absolutely possible.<br><br>The internet is another way of meeting up with new people and communicating with them, and when you do that, there is a chance that someone takes your fancy and from there love can develope.<br><br>I suppose some might question the ultimate outcome of the relationship, but I think the fact is that there was love in the first place. Perhaps this love is  between people with a different understanding of each other resulting from communication through the internet rather than face to face, but nevertheless, love.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey i have experienced CYBER LOVE<br>K so like i had been chatting to this gal on irc for 3 months and we were really hitting it off and she was comming to sydney to study (which is where i study). We were in love even b4 i met her, exchanged pics talked over the phone,irced everynite for bout 4 hours for 3 months.<br>Then finally when i came back to singapore to meet her things were a little rough at first but well after the initiasl barriers were taken down everything was fine.<br>And we are still in love right up till now. In total its been bout 6 months.<br>Its quite nice to be able to transcend someones looks and body language and love their personality b4 u love the person. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
