            <div class='col-md body'>Yesterday evening along Joo Chiat Road at 5.45pm, I witnessed a car - I think it was a Peugeot, the car plate number is SG*810*T - knocking into a stray dog. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>The car was turning out from the car park and the dog was directly in its line of vision, directly in front of it. Yet the car showed no sign of stopping even though it was going at a slow speed. It did not even bother to horn to warn the dog out of its way! And it just knocked into the dog just like that! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Luckily the dog was not knocked <span style="font-style: italic;">down</span> and was not visibly injured and ran away quickly after letting out a loud yelp.<br><br>Please!

            <div class='col-md body'>The car was in a road where there were no other cars behind. It was just a small road leading out from a carpark. And he was moving at such a slow speed that braking would have hardly caused any accident.<br><br>While I do agree it's senseless to brake to spare the life of an animal and in turn cause other kinds of traffic accidents, depending on situation motorists (bikers and car drivers all alike) should make a good effort to see what is the best way they can avoid collision with the animal on the road while preserving traffic safety. After all, it's a LIFE and not just a road obstruction.<br><br>Dogs and cats are animals, but human beings are animals too. Community animals share the space we live on. Just because we're more intelligent and have made the Earth habitable for humans doesn't mean we own entirely the rights to the lands originally for all animals to roam on. They have as much right as us to use the lands. And us, being more intelligent beings who are able to think, react and respond rationally have the responsibility to watch over those who're unable to do so, like how a perfectly healthy human being would take care of a crippled man.<br><br>The responsibility of taking care of the community animals should fall on the community of human beings, ALL of us and not just those in societies that protect the rights of animals or those that take care of strays. When a only limited number of people undertake communityanimal-care and support animal causes, those who are adversely affected by community animals should do something positive about it instead of questioning what the societies have not done, or even not been able to do due to limited resources.</div>
