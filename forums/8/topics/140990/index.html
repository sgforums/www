Maybe when poly was created during that time, it's intention was quite different from that of JC. It's aim is to produce graduates that will be deployed to the working world right after they finish their studies and NS if applicable. JC on the other hand was meant as the only way to enter the local University in this route.<br><br>The only constant is change so now I think Poly has evolved and that the distinction is getting blurrer.  There are now more places in Uni for Poly graduates. In fact, I heard there are actually courses not offered in Uni but only in Poly. Some kind of specialisation field I guess.<br><br>Maybe we can take the debate to say ITE vs Poly? Differences?</div></blockquote>the intention of having ITE is to supply cheap labour to the market and also to provide a route to those who have nowhere better to go after poor 'o' level results.<br><br>but that does not mean that ITE students wont be successful.<br><br></div>
