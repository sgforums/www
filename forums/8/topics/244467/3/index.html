            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by crabx:</div><div class="quote_body">When i was younger, I was studying in a boy's school (both primary and secondary)<br><br>I dreaded PE lessons as I did not like being sweaty and icky sticky under the hot son. Particularly I was afraid of playing soccer! I had a phobia of soccer!<br><br>Especially during primary school (pri 4,5,6), whenever the PE teacher decided that there was nothing important to be taught and wanted to let us have some fun on our own, he would let the class play soccer.<br><br>To many guys, it was as ecstatic! But i was afraid of playing soccer! I was quite small in stature and I was scared of tackling the ball for fear of being tripped or kicked in the legs. I was also frightened of receiving a ball coz i was afraid of the ball being kicked into me, worse still the ball might hit my stomach, groin or face!<br>And oh, the grass field is sometimes wet and muddy with puddles due to the rain! I didn't want my white canvas shoes to be stained with some disgusting mud! I hated the field and always had to look where I tread or place my foot upon.<br><br>So whenever there was soccer playing, I wasn't moving much. Where majority of the team players were around the ball, i was at the background away from the limelight. Trying my very best to be as far away from the 'dangerous object' and 'rampaging crowd' as possible. Whenever my friends wanted to pass the ball to me, i would purposely avoid it coz i didnt wanna be hurt! I didn't want myself to have the ball at my feet and then suddenly rampaged by the other team players.<br><br>Therefore, before the start of a soccer game during the team selection, i would normally be the left out people as no one wanted a lousy player. Amongst the soccer team outcasts were some classmates just like me or those on the obese side.<br><br>Then the pe teacher would slot me into some team, and then to be greeted by moans of disatisfaction of having received a 'liability'.<br><br>Since my classmates knew i was afraid of playing, they would sometimes decide to change the rules of play a little. Instead of the normal soccer where the objective lies in kicking a ball into the goalpost of the opposing team, i became the new target. With an universal signal given halfway during play, I would then suddenly find myself being like a magnet to the ball!<br><br>These mischievious kids would then start to kick the ball towards me, since it's now 'kick the ball at (my name) time'. I would have to look out for the ball charging at me. Then i would freak out and run to the PE teacher to tell them of the evil these classmates are doing. But he would nonchalantly give me the 'OH RLY?' or 'You r so annoying!' look. Only after a few pleas would he go over to tell those rascals off.<br><br>Therefore if the PE lesson was to play soccer, i would go to the PE teacher and tell him i didn't feel like playing or feign sick. But he would see through me and tell me not to be a sissy and go play, or instead run around the field 10 times, your choice.<br><br>So during the 1/2 hour of PE lesson felt like a torture to me! Oh how i hated soccer and thankfully not every lesson was a soccer game.<br><br>Fortunately, i am no longer in pri or sec school anymore. Gone were the days of terrifying soccer games. I could never play soccer in my life and will never bring myself to.<br><br>I feel much better after confessing this story online. I will have more stories about my other fears... but till then, signing off. Hope to hear some feedbacks from u guys.<br></div></blockquote>HAHHA..TS, u very funny leh.. like that also wan to confess ar.. nothing wrong ma.. hahaha... aiya.. i think u should jus try to compromise la.. try to overcome the feeling lo.. or else next time sekali u badminton also scared of the suttlecock.. hahahha... aiya.. actually i also didn't play those ball games 1 la.. i dun understand y it's so much fun to my friends leh.. i prefer skating, badminton and cycling.. nicer ma.. hahha.. then some more those ball games so many rules.. damn irritating.. hahah.. but the main reason that i dun play them is because i am damn idiot in those games.. i have no sense in them.. hahahha..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
