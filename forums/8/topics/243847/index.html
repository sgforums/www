            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Singapore shrinking</span><br>With alarmingly fewer babies and more elderly, UN paints a stark picture for Singapore</strong><br><br>Wednesday Â• March 21, 2007<br><br>Jasmine Yin<br>jasmine@mediacorp.com.sg<br><br>This is one ranking where Singapore would not want to be so high up the list.<br><br>Unfortunately, while it is behind South Korea, it is way ahead of other Asian contenders such as Malaysia and Hong Kong.<br><br>A United Nations report looking ahead to the years between 2045 and 2050 lists countries whose natural populations will grow most slowly. In fact, they will actually shrink.<br><br>So acute is Singapore's shortage of babies that there are only four countries in the world whose natural populations will fall at a faster rate. They are Ukraine, Bulgaria, Belarus and South Korea.<br><br>Even Japan, which has long struggled with a lack of babies, will shrink more slowly than Singapore.<br><br>This is "not a good thing", noted Environment and Water Resources Senior Parliamentary Secretary Dr Amy Khor, who sat on the committee behind the Baby Bonus package of pro-family incentives. She said that this finding "serves to confirm what we already know and have been trying to tackle".<br><br>Aside from the Baby Bonus Â— introduced in 2001 and enhanced in 2004 Â— the Government has been trying to attract more immigrants, added Dr Khor, who is also the Southwest District mayor.<br><br>Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng recently said Singapore has to attract immigrants to keep the economy humming.<br><br>Mr Wong, who chairs the National Population Committee, estimated that 10,000 to 12,000 new citizens a year is a "good number" to attract.<br><br>According to the report, by 2050, Singaporeans are projected to live up to the age of 84.6 years Â— 4.6 years more than the average life expectancy now. Japan, Hong Kong and Macau are the only Asian countries where longevity will supersede Singapore's by 2050.<br><br>Macau, Japan, South Korea and Singapore will also have the top four oldest populations in the world by 2050, with the median age ranging from 53.7 to 55.5. The median age is expected to rise by at least 12 years between 2005 and 2050 in 37 developing countries in Asia.<br><br>Ageing is most advanced in Europe, the report noted, and by 2050, the continent will have twice as many older people Â— those aged 60 and above Â— as children, or those below 15 years old. This combination will pose "major challenges for the social and economic adaptation of societies".<br><br>Population ageing is "accelerating" in Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean.<br><br>In Asia, by 2040, the older people will outnumber the children. And, globally, by 2045, there is likely to be more older people than children "for the first time in history".<br><br>This is the "consequence of the long-term reductions in fertility and mortality" in the world, the report said.<br><br>Africa is the only region with a relatively young population. Its elderly people will be "far below" that of children in 2050, it added.<br><br><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/pda/178572ag.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.todayonline.com/pda/178572ag.htm</a><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ask them to revise the law and lower down the legal age to have sex, since there are so many cases of teenagers being pregnant nowadays. Or make polygamy legal again.<br><br>Even wonder why in the older days, people can have a lot of kids? Beside the fact that was not much entertainment back then, other than piaking whole night long, it was also because the medical was not as advanced as now. So in order for them to have someone to take care of them when they grow old, they will want to have more kids, so that there will be a chance for a few children to grow up. This is the survival plan for all living things in the world.<br><br>Also in the olden days, people had the mindset that having a baby boy is way better than a baby girl, as they want someone who can carry on the family line, who can take care of old parents. A baby girl is a lability to them, which a good case study is to look at India. So, they will keep trying till a baby boy is born into the family.</div>

Or make polygamy legal again.<br><br>Even wonder why in the older days, people can have a lot of kids? Beside the fact that was not much entertainment back then, other than piaking whole night long, it was also because the medical was not as advanced as now. So in order for them to have someone to take care of them when they grow old, they will want to have more kids, so that there will be a chance for a few children to grow up. This is the survival plan for all living things in the world.<br><br>Also in the olden days, people had the mindset that having a baby boy is way better than a baby girl, as they want someone who can carry on the family line, who can take care of old parents. A baby girl is a lability to them, which a good case study is to look at India. So, they will keep trying till a baby boy is born into the family.</div></blockquote>You serious you want 2 wives  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Double the headache wor~<br>If they actually fight for your attention is one thing but if they actually get along and you get henpecked by 2 women  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>
