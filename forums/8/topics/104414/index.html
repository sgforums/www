You'll freak her out. Its better to greet her at same place neutral, at the same bus stop or whatever.<br><br>Anyway, don't follow girls home to know them better. Its super freaky!!!

            <div class='col-md body'>alright. if u want give me a call after my exams. I wanna be a stalker/PI, plus i need a job. The idea is, i tail her and find out all the stuff she does, schedule and shit and stuff. I tell u. U make urself scarce and suddenly try and fit urself INTO her schedule. I.e. if she is in a club, u join the club. That's how girls like it, always they like "we were in the same ABC together... we were in this together etc etc blah blah blah"<br><br>YEAH!<br><br>or get devil to do it hehe<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So you mean I get a nice card follow by a short note telling her what happened that day and I don't mean any harm to her and give a brief explanation???If I go knock on her door,would she scream at me or even call the police etc???Maybe I should get the card with short explanation all written plus my email address,but of cos I hand it to her in person,more sincere.What do you suggest.,wait her downstairs the blk or go to her house to pass her the card???Thks for all those advice.By the way I don't mean to be a stalker or anything like that,just that that day a little nervous in wanting to know her...sigh no choice first time going after female.Just have to cross my fingers hoping she will talk to me as a friend. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>for god sake! dun give her a card or knock on her door to introduce yourself. c'mon lah, just put yourself in her shoes. imagine one day, a stranger knocks on your door and pass you a card and wants to make friend with you. what will be your reaction. for me i will be scared/shocked, thinking that she is crazy.<br>my advise is, try to look out what time she left for work, then meet up with her at the bus stop. but dun never talk to her during the first few meetings, no matter how desperate you want to introduce yourself, but make sure that she sees you. after some meeting, try to look at her and keep your fingers crossed that she looks back at you. when she does that, offer a smile.<br>if she smiles back at you, friend, you are there liao. the next meeting you can approach her and start a conversation.<br>but if she just ignore your smile, then forget it lah, she is not the least interested in you........</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I offer to you...the 3 sec rule...lets hope it helps u as much as it helped me<br><br>The point of the 3 sec rule is to propel you to approach women fast enough to keep your internal voice from talking you out of it and avoid hesitation. You do not want a woman to see you hesitate. The longer you hesitate, the more insecure you appear. Also, hesitation creates an added sense of nervousness to your mental state - a personality trait you do not want to portray when approaching women.<br><br>Even if you can't think of any way to initiate a conversation with a woman, whatever you do, don't break the 3 sec rule! Act in 3 seconds as the default rule, even if you have no idea how you will continue. If you don't have an opener or opening line in mind by the time you're in front of her, at least just say "Hi". If you act in 3 seconds, she will notice it, no matter where she just came in from or where you came from or how you passed by each other. She will see the spontaneity and decisiveness in your approach and it can only work in your favor. If you wait, hesitate, then decide to approach, you are in a weaker situation. Hesitating will give your self-doubt a chance to create imaginary bad outcomes and add unneeded insecurity to your approach.<br><br>With the 3 sec rule, you don't need to wait for eye contact or for her to notice you or for an opportunity to present itself. You simply see something you like and you go right up to it. You are also doing yourself a favor by following the 3 sec rule. In three seconds, you have no time to become nervous, self-conscious, sweaty, shaky, lacking confidence, quality, power, or assertiveness, a weakling around women, a pariah to beautiful girls. Even if you start sweating, or getting shaky or stutter while talking to the woman after following the 3 sec rule, you weren't that way when you initiated contact. The first impression is what counts. If that first impression of you is of a confident and spontaneous man, her feelings for you will be positive from the start, which greatly the minimizes the chance of you turning into a pile of jelly while talking with her. It sets the pace and helps keep your inner voice at bay, allowing you the chance to keep up your confidence.<br><br>cheers...</div>
