IBM brand, 5 years old. izzit condemn liao? or izzit power supply siao liao? what vga card?can be the problem?<br><br>bring go back shop?<br>the problem happen so infrequently, how to tell uncle to pinpoint the problem?<br><br>i have another 3 HDDs, 2 IBM 4.2gb and 1 quantum 15gb. i tried swapping them and formatting it using the win xp boot up cd, but they would always hang halfway, i think too long nvr use, or too fragmented. after installing xp on my 1st HDD, i plugged in the other 2 IBM HDD as slave drives and formatted them, this time with no problem. haven't try the quantum one yet.</div>

"<br><br>guess youe way of trouble shooting is no very wise, you just added oil to the fire and i guess it may be just a very simple problem only.<br><br>i would like to know more of the stuff leading to your computer failure after 6 months o inactivity.<br><br>need to know, is this a bundle PC? if yes, what brand and model. If no, did you build it on your own or got someone else to biuld it for you? of the configuration above, any hardware that you added to your system pior to the startup problem you encountered 6 months after? since you are using a P3, does an ABIT P3 board supprts DDR, and correct me here (anyone) if i am wrong but i doubt DDR rams are supported in P3s, only SDrams are employed. If your ram are of different type, i.e DDRs and SDrams (which ever concerned, be it the 256 or 128 pc), chances are they will not work on your computer. In additioin, if your PC is 133, or 100Mhz, it will be wiser to get the appropriate SDram for the bus speed. Your GeForce card may have drivers with it. Did you install the drivers from the drivers CD, and did you uninstalled the drivers from your previous card ( ia m assuming that you upgrade to a Geforce). Drivers may cause conflict with one another. GeForce card with DDR? Did you tried to use a high-ended card (too high ended i presume, for a P3 to handle). remove your IDE CD-roms (iomega or sony, one at a time) when you trouble shoot - a rule of tthe thumb.<br><br>still i suspect it is the problem with your graphics card and/ or RAM.<br>hope these help.</div>

If no, did you build it on your own or got someone else to biuld it for you? of the configuration above, any hardware that you added to your system pior to the startup problem you encountered 6 months after? since you are using a P3, does an ABIT P3 board supprts DDR, and correct me here (anyone) if i am wrong but i doubt DDR rams are supported in P3s, only SDrams are employed. If your ram are of different type, i.e DDRs and SDrams (which ever concerned, be it the 256 or 128 pc), chances are they will not work on your computer. In additioin, if your PC is 133, or 100Mhz, it will be wiser to get the appropriate SDram for the bus speed. Your GeForce card may have drivers with it. Did you install the drivers from the drivers CD, and did you uninstalled the drivers from your previous card ( ia m assuming that you upgrade to a Geforce). Drivers may cause conflict with one another. GeForce card with DDR? Did you tried to use a high-ended card (too high ended i presume, for a P3 to handle). remove your IDE CD-roms (iomega or sony, one at a time) when you trouble shoot - a rule of tthe thumb.<br><br>still i suspect it is the problem with your graphics card and/ or RAM.<br>hope these help.</div></blockquote>a friend in convergent systems (kingston ram importer and distributor) built the system for me in 2000 june with the geforceDDR. however after he got married and i stopped playing CS, we lost contact.<br><br>i added the iomega cdrw and 256mh 133mhz SDRAM during december 2002. used it till march 2003 with no problems.<br><br>around oct/nov 2003, i turned it back on to help do some rendering. that was when the problems happened. they JUST happened, no build up or anything.<br><br>i did remove the cd roms 1 at a time to troubleshoot. that's why i figured the sony cd rom is drawing more current than necessary. as well as why i figured the 128 chip isn't working properly. i may not be correct, but as long as it breathes and i can do my work, i am happy.<br><br>i am waiting for a friend to pass me a casing and PSU, where i will see if the sony cdrom is really drawing more current, or whether my old PSU is just old and dying.<br><br>at this moment, my current spare parts are:<br><br>2 p3 mobos wif integrated vga and sfx.

            <div class='col-md body'>many problem starts from power supply and hotspots...<br><br>cx that power supply have enough wattage to support ur system... wif so many drives and fans, shld have a 350 Watt psu at least...also rem to cx if ur com is having a good grounding by using a test-pen... poor grounding will give erratic faults...<br><br>moving parts may have cease after some time of inactive...this applies to hard disc and fans...cx ur fan rpm , it may not be pushing enough air to cool ur hardwares...<br><br>connectors may built up with oxides and together with heating, expension and contraction will degrade the connection...cx ur peripherals and repeat installation and removal to work off the oxides...<br><br>remove old anf reapply thermal paste or grease to all heatsink to give better performance.<br><br>hope it helps ...<br>cheers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
