            <div class='col-md body'>Mama always said "Stupid Is As Stupid Does." And 1994 was proof that America loves an idiot. Jim Carrey ruled the box office with not one, not two, but three rubber-faced classics (Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, The Mask, and Dumb &amp; Dumber). Seinfeld became Master Of Its Domain, proving that even a show about nothing can own primetime, and Tanya Harding taught us all the painful lesson that "Winners never cheat, and cheaters never win".<br><br>But '94 was not all folly. John Travolta danced his way back into our hearts as stone cold Hit-man Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction, while Ace of Base proved that ABBA isn't the only Swedish Super-group. George Foreman "knocked out the fat" to become the oldest heavyweight champion EVER at the ripe age of 45 and Woodstock returned Gen-X style for "Another 2 Days of Peace and Music" (Oh, yeah and let's not forget mud!)<br><br>While Gen-X'ers related to Winona Ryder and Ethan Hawke, there was always a place where reality didn't bite. Melrose Place became the guiltiest address on TV. Meanwhile, a new breed of sex symbol hit the tube, bringing in the men of NYPD Blue to conquer crime.<br><br>Also on the police blotter...two of the biggest cop chases in history. On the big screen, Keanu Reeves raced into super-stardom with the runaway hit, Speed and TV Viewers worldwide witnessed the real life drama of O.J. and his infamous White Ford Bronco. "RUNNNN O.J. RUUUNNNNN!!!!"<br><br>So, buckle up for the ride of your life, cause "Here's Comes The Hotstepper". It's I Love the 90's: 1994!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Welcome to 1995 !!!! Come on...don't be shy. tell us, tell us what 1995 will bring us...How about a new friend? 1995 gave us not only one new friend but six. Rachel, Monica, Ross, Phebe, Chandler &amp; Joey became America's best Friends. And if you were more of a family type, not to worry...Party of Five gave us the Salingers. Now what's funnier than a show about 5 kids whose parents were killed in a drunk driving accident? Come on!<br><br>And if you're feeling under the weather stop by the ER! Check out Dr. Green and his team, or even try to get a date with hot Dr. Ross a.k.a. George Clooney. But what if you feel like some adventure? Xena &amp; Hercules could use some help in their journey. Although I don't know if I would look that great in a skirt. Speaking of good legs, did we just see Mel Gibson walk by in a skirt? Braveheart topped the year's box offices, while some other warrior next door basically sunk in his Waterworld, creating the world's biggest cinematic flop ever. Sorry, Kevin!<br><br>Now what if I need a little play time? How about Toy Story - who ever said that toys couldn't speak? Woody and Buzz sure proved us wrong! But they weren't the only ones...M&amp;M's came to life in 1995 with our beloved Red &amp; Yellow, and Frogs started praising the joys of Bud-wei-ser.<br><br>So 1995, is there more? Pogs became the new marbles of the 90's and the toy of all toys was born: The Sony Playstation. And if you weren't into playing Mortal Kombat or Extreme Sports, you could enter the wonderful world of chat rooms and IM...LOL!<br><br>Will there be any scandals 1995 ? Yes? What? Drew Barrymore flashed Dave Letterman, and Hugh Grant was caught with Divine Brown...oh my! I guess they got inspired by 1995's sexy classic, Show Girls. Hot, Hot, Hot! Has anyone seen Elizabeth Berkley since?<br><br>Any music? Come on, surprise me 1995! Gimme some hits! This was definitely the year of Hootie &amp; the BlowFish "I Only Want To Be With You" was played everywhere. TLC surprised us with "Crazy, Sexy Cool" and No Doubt , Bone Thugs , or Rednex are just a few more that will energize 1995's radio waves.<br><br>But let's not forget fashion.should I go for mini skirts or plaid shirts? No? Tattoos, Piercings, baggy jeans and heroin chic were all the rage in 1995. Hmmm...seems complicated. Maybe I should get some advice from Cher, she definitely was the fashion expert in Clueless. As if!!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"Shhooooowww Meeee Thhhhee Mmmonneeeyy!!!"...This is 1996, and it's a Scream!! Whether it was Neve Campbell and Kevin Williamson making theaters everywhere safe again for horror movies...or Alanis' Jagged Little Pill shouting bloody murder for scorned lovers worldwide...you outta know that 1996 was one scary good year!<br><br>Not convinced? How 'bout Dennis Rodman in a white wedding dress? That'll keep you up nights. But Dennis wasn't the only sportsman making news in '96. A young Tiger went pro and ate the competition alive...while another man-eater, Jenny McCarthy kept teen boys up late for different reasons.<br><br>But '96 wasn't all chills and thrills, it had a warm and fuzzy side all it's own. Tickle Me Elmo had kids everywhere (and Rosie O'Donnell for some reason) giggling deliriously...while the rest of us went crazy trying to learn the Macarena. America's Funniest Home Videos made making-an-ass-of-yourself an art form and Mentos proved that the only thing worse than candy commercials are foreign candy commercials.<br><br>Still, there were many valuable lessons to be learned in 1996. The "so-money-they-don't-even-know-it" combo of Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau taught us the finer points of babe-hunting in Swingers...while Joan Osborne taught us valuable lessons in Theology (What if God Was One of Us?) The Brothers Gallagher showed us all the way to a healthier sibling relationship (see also: Bar Fights) and Independence Day rewrote the handbook for averting Alien Takeover.<br><br>Excited yet? Oh, I know...we had you at hello. Well, Come on Ride The Train but, be sure to strap yourself in because this is one Twister of a year. This is I Love the 90s 1996!</div>
