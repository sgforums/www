It is rising now, apparently because more drivers are using SMS on the road.<br><br>If you are caught phone-driving, you can be fined up to $1,000 or even be jailed.<br><br>But drivers appear to be 'bo-chap' about the stiff penalty and continue to drive with one hand on the steering wheel and the other holding their mobile phones.<br><br>Of course, the statistics do not include the many offenders who may escape detection by the cops.<br><br>Five out of six drivers The New Paper spoke to said they see more instances of handphone driving now than a year ago.<br><br>Some continue to chat on their phones for a long time even as they are driving along the expressways.<br><br>In the last four years, the number of offenders fell, from a high of 1,700 in 1998 to just 574 for the whole of last year.<br><br>The big increase this year may have been caused by people who think that it is all right to use SMS while they are driving.<br><br>But they are wrong because sending SMS is just as bad, if not worse than speaking on the phone, because users would need to look at the screen to see if they have typed in the correct message.<br><br>Police spokesman Lim Lu-Ern said: 'Using a handphone while driving distracts drivers and reduces their ability to control their vehicles and to react to changes in road situations.<br><br>'It is an irresponsible driving attitude and puts the lives of road users at risk.'<br><br>He made it clear that making a call or sending an SMS with one hand while driving with the other also counts as handphone driving.<br><br>Drivers are exempted only when their car is stationary. (See report below.)<br><br>After Singapore banned handphone driving in March 1999, the number of offenders fell in the first three months.<br><br>But by December that year, the numbers went up again, prompting harsher penalties in July 2000.<br><br>Instead of a $200 fine, first-time offenders had their phones confiscated and they had to go to court too.<br><br>They were jailed up to six months and/or fined a maximum of $1,000, and given 12 demerit points.<br><br>Repeat offenders faced double the jail term and fine amount, and could be banned from driving for up to six months.<br><br>But drivers continue to flout the law.<br><br>Manager Shirley Tan, 24, who said she had spotted many 'phone drivers' on the road, noted that the number of such drivers appeared to have increased 'exponentially' in recent years.<br><br>'Road hogs who are too slow or those who zig-zag are usually on the phone. When people SMS while exiting from the expressway, they don't pay attention and get too close to the car in front and sometimes they hit the rear,' said Miss Tan.<br><br>Another motorist, engineer Dominic Koh, 32, said many drivers did not bother to use hands-free kits for their phones.<br><br>National Safety Council of Singapore (NSCS) president Milton Tan advised drivers to make it a point to wear their earpieces before starting the engine so they don't have to worry about unexpected calls.<br><br>'They get a call, they think it might be urgent so they just pick up. Instead of pulling over to talk, they take the risk, thinking they can get away with it,' he said.<br><br>He added that it's also important to keep the phone conversation short so that the driver's full attention is on the road.<br><br>Marketing executive Mok Yee Tzek, 30, agreed because he has seen drivers with earpieces gesticulating wildly. He said: 'They are so into the conversation, their hands are anywhere but on the steering wheel.'<br><br>CHANGE OR ELSE<br><br>If drivers don't change their habits soon, even tougher penalties may be in store.<br><br>Mr Tan of NSCS advocated this when asked what would deter thoughtless handphone drivers. He said: 'Heavier penalties. That's the only way. The media has to publicise that handphone driving is dangerous and that there are penalties attached.'<br><br>Mr Mok remembered how he and other pedestrians were almost hit once when crossing at a traffic light.<br><br>He said: 'The driver, holding the phone with her left hand, just zoomed past in the second lane. We had just crossed the first lane, she missed us by a hair's breadth.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Walking and talking just as dangerous<br><br>DRIVERS may not be the only phone users who are a menace on the roads.<br><br>Taxi driver Chen Yong Seng, 44, says he has encountered pedestrians who cross the road without checking for traffic while talking on their handphones.<br><br>He said: 'They think the green man sign has come on because people around them start walking.<br><br>'But while those people dash across quickly, handphone users walk slowly because they think they have the right of way.'<br><br>The result: Squealing brakes and angry honks.<br><br>Mr Chen claims he sees at least three such cases every day, especially when he is downtown. And he says the number has been going up.<br><br>'Singaporeans like to do two things at one time, even schoolchildren are busy SMSing so they don't bother to look out for cars,' said Mr Chen, who has come close to hitting such distracted pedestrians a few times.<br><br>Teacher Eleanor Chia, 24, has also encountered phone-touting pedestrians who are oblivious to their surroundings.<br><br>While there is no law against pedestrians using handphones when crossing roads, police advised people to 'stay alert and be aware of their surroundings'.<br><br>'They should always stop, look and check to see if any vehicles are coming in their path,' said a police spokesman.<br><br>Mr Chen pulls over when he receives a call and thinks pedestrians should also stop when they are on the phone.<br><br>He said: 'Don't walk and talk. When you lose concentration, it's dangerous.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>IT'S ALL RIGHT TO USE THE PHONE WHEN...<br><br>THE vehicle is not moving. That's right, it's not an offence to pick up your phone when you are waiting for traffic lights to change, the police said.<br><br>But drivers should keep their calls short and be mindful that they should not cause any obstruction to other motorists by failing to move their cars when the light is green.<br><br>If they continue to talk after that, even when the car is moving slowly, they can be prosecuted.<br><br>The police spokesman advised motorists who want to make or answer a call while driving to ask their passengers to do so.<br><br>Those who are driving alone can receive calls with a hands-free device but should keep their responses short.<br><br>He added: 'They can return the calls or continue with the conversation at a more appropriate time. Those who want to make calls themselves should park their cars before doing so.'<br></strong></blockquote></div>
