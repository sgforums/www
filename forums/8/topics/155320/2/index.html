            <div class='col-md body'>I am not really for this system. 'O' levels is a benchmark recognised by all commonwealth countries, in other words, there is no basis for one to progress to a Polytechnic if you haven't hit the benchmark.<br><br>What if the student fails his/her Polytechnic education? It is not unusual. And so what is the student left with? PSLE?<br><br>Regarding the point about Polytechnics not having enough students to fill the intake, thats obviously off the mark. The numbers show otherwise.<br><br>Even ITEs require a certain level of proficiency in 'N' subjects before allowing entry. There must be a check and balance mechanism built into this whole scheme to ensure not everyone cruises into a Polytechnic easily.</div>
