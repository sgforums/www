              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Language in Face-to-Face Interaction: <span style="font-style: italic;">Conversation analysis</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Linguistics-oriented analysis of face-to-face interaction began with the publication of Tannen's (1984) book. Using a tape-recorded Thanksgiving dinner conversation as data, Tannen identifies "conversational style," which broadly includes linguistics expressions and interaction-managing strategies. Tannen's analytical steps are: (i) tape-recording of conversation, (ii) transcription, (iii) observation and analysis of data, (iv) hypothesis, (v) incorporation of input from conversation participants and others, and (vi) verification of hypothesis. After observing the New York Jewish style (called the machine-gun question) and analyzing how it functions in narratives, Tannen characterizes this conversation style as "high-involvement style."<br>      Given that Tannen's study concentrates on a particular occasion of talk (a single event of conversation with multiple participants including Tannen herself), in my own work (Maynard 1986, 1987a, 1989b, 1993b) I examine multiple Japanese (and American English) conversations by using video- amd audio-taped casual conversations (20 pairs of Japanese and 20 pairs of American) among college students. Both qualitative and quantitative methods are used for analysis, and both global and local levels of structure and conversation management are investigated. From the global perspective I examine thematic structure by focusing on strategies such as mode of reference and repetition which help structure the interaction-based themes of conversation. I also analyze narratives appearing in the data and show that the narrative is emergent in the conversation, and it is co-created by both story teller and story recipient. Focus is placed on interactional management strategies, turn-taking, back-channeling, and head movement. Functions and frequencies of these interactional behaviours are identified and discussed, and it is emphasized that all are significant in structuring the self-contextualization processes of Japanese interaction.<br>      In general, conversation analysis adopts the analytical method developed by ethnomethodologists. Rather than sentences or utterances, conversation analysis considers primary the units of interaction (e.g. turns, back-channels) and their sequencing in conversation. Particularly useful are related concepts of adjacency-pair, conditional relevance, and preference organization. Interaction in conversation is locally organized as a connected pair, such as a question followed by an answer. This expected preferred sequencing of action (i.e. one example of preferene organization) creates a place in the conversational sequence where a certain response become relevant. Thus, conditional relevance means that "given the first, the second is expectable; upon its occurrence it can be seen to be a second item to the first; upon its non-occurrence it can be seen to be officially absent - all this provided sheerly by the occurrence of the first item" (Schegloff 1968: 1083). The concept of sequenced and situated action is the key for analyzing conversational interaction.<br>      In recent years, some aspects of Japanese conversation have continued to be investigated. One of the topics often discussed (especially in Japan) is the back-channel. For example, Kita (1996) elaborates on back-channel-like utterances jointly sent by participants during the inter-turn pause. Ikeda and Ikeda (1996) offer a descriptive system in which different degrees of head nods as well as the duration of eye gaze are plotted along with the transcript, making it easier to describe both verbal and nonverbal behaviour.<br>      Another topic in conversation analysis involves the phenomenon of co-construction. Conversation researchers have often emphasized the collaborative nature of utterance production in English (e.g. conversation as "achievement" as explained by Schegloff 1982). Following this line of inquiry, Ono and Yoshida (1996) investigate co-construction in Japanese informal conversation. It turns out that the co-construction of syntactic units is rare in Japanese, perhaps leaving the collaboration strategies to means other than syntax.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><em>Specific interaction context</em></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Analysis of face-to-face interaction in Japanese has also led to the investigation of specific situations of talk. Three areas in particular have produced interesting results - business negotiation, conflict situation, and the invitation refusal process.<br>      H. Yamada (1990, 1992) examines communication strategies used in Japan-US business discourse. On the basis of tape-recorded multi-party conversations of American, Japanese, and American-Japanese business meetings, Yamada contrasts topic-opening strategies, talk distribution, and back-channel strategies across these settings. Using the idea of "cross-talk," Yamada analyzes data by adopting interpretive, comparative, and quantitative methods.<br>      According to H. Yamada (1990, 1992), in cross-cultural business communication Japanese and Americans optimize different cultural strengths - the Japanese strength is shown in the group and the American strength in the individual. For example, "American participants take long monologic turns, distribute their turns unevenly among participants, and take the highest proportion of turns in the topics they initiate; Japanese participants take short turns, distribute their turns relatively evenly among participants, and continue to distribute their turns evenly regardless of who initiates a topic" (1990: 271). Yamada's study illustrates the difficulties arising from cross-cultural talk where meaning-in-context is created in the mutually interactive context of culture, encounter and conversation.<br>      Jones (1990, 1992) examines how Japanese people linguistically handle conflict situations. Using audio- and video-taped conversations between friends and acquaintances, Jones identifies occasions of conflict and microanalyzes three such conversations - television debate, father-daughter conflict in a family, and office communication between co-workers. Jones (1990, 1992) reports that Japanese conflicts often occur in "ratified" situations, and when the conflict is not socially ratified, participants must work hard to rarify it.<br>      A case in point: after a few minutes of strained conversation the co-workers in conflict abruptly stopped talking and turned away from each other. But even under this circumstance, participants strove for a playful tone, introducing laughter and jokes. Co-workers placed the conflict situation into a framework of "play" by using strategies such as style-switching, repetition, parallelism, and laughter. If the conflict is still not ratified after all reframing strategies, Jones (1990: 306) concludes that "it seems ... impossible for the participants to dispute with each other comfortably," suggesting that perhaps the Japanese themselves have bought into the "myth of harmony".<br>      Szatrowski (1992, 1993) concentrates on the Japanese invitation and refusal interaction taken from recorded telephone conversations, and offers detailed analysis of 13 conversations of invitation. Using the concept of <em>wadan</em>, similar to <em>bundan</em>, Szatrowski shows that, instead of simple adjacency-pair, Japanese invitation-refusal negotiation is enacted by the invitation <em>wadan</em> stage and the response <em>wadan</em> stage, which may take several turn exchanges.<br>      Szatrowski (1993) reports that when compared with the English invitation-refusal exchange, Japanese participants rely more on their co-participants in the conversation, which results in co-produced stages. For example, Szatrowski (1992, 1993) provides interaction examples in which an invitee, whose goal may be to refuse, leaves open the possibility of accepting while developing the conversation toward a refusal. A Japanese inviter will go through several "invitation stages;" he or she shows sympathy for the invitee by always leaving some option for a refusal. In the invitee's "answer stages," he or she gradually develops a story, always gauging the inviter's response, trying to convince the inviter that he or she cannot accept the invitation after all. Through this prolonged give-and-take negotiation process, both participants successfully avoid losing "face" (Goffman 1955).<br>      The three studies mentioned above represent analysis of real-life conversation with related but differing contributions - insight into cross-cultural communication, language understood within a larger interactional frame (e.g. play), and the use of discourse units (e.g. <em>wadan</em>) for understanding the meaning of utterance clusters.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">i am not sure about this statement, but please do read this by
              Senko Maynard:</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Language in Face-to-Face Interaction: <span style="font-style: italic;">Conversation analysis</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Linguistics-oriented analysis of face-to-face interaction began
              with the publication of Tannen's (1984) book. Using a tape-recorded
              Thanksgiving dinner conversation as data, Tannen identifies
              "conversational style," which broadly includes linguistics
              expressions and interaction-managing strategies. Tannen's
              analytical steps are: (i) tape-recording of conversation, (ii)
              transcription, (iii) observation and analysis of data, (iv)
              hypothesis, (v) incorporation of input from conversation
              participants and others, and (vi) verification of hypothesis. After
              observing the New York Jewish style (called the machine-gun
              question) and analyzing how it functions in narratives, Tannen
              characterizes this conversation style as "high-involvement
              style."<br>       Given that Tannen's study concentrates on
              a particular occasion of talk (a single event of conversation with
              multiple participants including Tannen herself), in my own work
              (Maynard 1986, 1987a, 1989b, 1993b) I examine multiple Japanese
              (and American English) conversations by using video- amd
              audio-taped casual conversations (20 pairs of Japanese and 20 pairs
              of American) among college students. Both qualitative and
              quantitative methods are used for analysis, and both global and
              local levels of structure and conversation management are
              investigated. From the global perspective I examine thematic
              structure by focusing on strategies such as mode of reference and
              repetition which help structure the interaction-based themes of
              conversation. I also analyze narratives appearing in the data and
              show that the narrative is emergent in the conversation, and it is
              co-created by both story teller and story recipient. Focus is
              placed on interactional management strategies, turn-taking,
              back-channeling, and head movement. Functions and frequencies of
              these interactional behaviours are identified and discussed, and it
              is emphasized that all are significant in structuring the
              self-contextualization processes of Japanese interaction.<br>       In general, conversation analysis adopts
              the analytical method developed by ethnomethodologists. Rather than
              sentences or utterances, conversation analysis considers primary
              the units of interaction (e.g. turns, back-channels) and their
              sequencing in conversation. Particularly useful are related
              concepts of adjacency-pair, conditional relevance, and preference
              organization. Interaction in conversation is locally organized as a
              connected pair, such as a question followed by an answer. This
              expected preferred sequencing of action (i.e. one example of
              preferene organization) creates a place in the conversational
              sequence where a certain response become relevant. Thus,
              conditional relevance means that "given the first, the second is
              expectable; upon its occurrence it can be seen to be a second item
              to the first; upon its non-occurrence it can be seen to be
              officially absent - all this provided sheerly by the occurrence of
              the first item" (Schegloff 1968: 1083). The concept of sequenced
              and situated action is the key for analyzing conversational
              interaction.<br>       In recent years, some aspects of Japanese
              conversation have continued to be investigated. One of the topics
              often discussed (especially in Japan) is the back-channel. For
              example, Kita (1996) elaborates on back-channel-like utterances
              jointly sent by participants during the inter-turn pause. Ikeda and
              Ikeda (1996) offer a descriptive system in which different degrees
              of head nods as well as the duration of eye gaze are plotted along
              with the transcript, making it easier to describe both verbal and
              nonverbal behaviour.<br>       Another topic in conversation analysis
              involves the phenomenon of co-construction. Conversation
              researchers have often emphasized the collaborative nature of
              utterance production in English (e.g. conversation as "achievement"
              as explained by Schegloff 1982). Following this line of inquiry,
              Ono and Yoshida (1996) investigate co-construction in Japanese
              informal conversation. It turns out that the co-construction of
              syntactic units is rare in Japanese, perhaps leaving the
              collaboration strategies to means other than syntax.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><em>Specific interaction context</em></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Analysis of face-to-face interaction in Japanese has also led to
              the investigation of specific situations of talk. Three areas in
              particular have produced interesting results - business
              negotiation, conflict situation, and the invitation refusal
              process.<br>       H. Yamada (1990, 1992) examines
              communication strategies used in Japan-US business discourse. On
              the basis of tape-recorded multi-party conversations of American,
              Japanese, and American-Japanese business meetings, Yamada contrasts
              topic-opening strategies, talk distribution, and back-channel
              strategies across these settings. Using the idea of "cross-talk,"
              Yamada analyzes data by adopting interpretive, comparative, and
              quantitative methods.<br>       According to H. Yamada (1990, 1992), in
              cross-cultural business communication Japanese and Americans
              optimize different cultural strengths - the Japanese strength is
              shown in the group and the American strength in the individual. For
              example, "American participants take long monologic turns,
              distribute their turns unevenly among participants, and take the
              highest proportion of turns in the topics they initiate; Japanese
              participants take short turns, distribute their turns relatively
              evenly among participants, and continue to distribute their turns
              evenly regardless of who initiates a topic" (1990: 271). Yamada's
              study illustrates the difficulties arising from cross-cultural talk
              where meaning-in-context is created in the mutually interactive
              context of culture, encounter and conversation.<br>       Jones (1990, 1992) examines how Japanese
              people linguistically handle conflict situations. Using audio- and
              video-taped conversations between friends and acquaintances, Jones
              identifies occasions of conflict and microanalyzes three such
              conversations - television debate, father-daughter conflict in a
              family, and office communication between co-workers. Jones (1990,
              1992) reports that Japanese conflicts often occur in "ratified"
              situations, and when the conflict is not socially ratified,
              participants must work hard to rarify it.<br>       A case in point: after a few minutes of
              strained conversation the co-workers in conflict abruptly stopped
              talking and turned away from each other. But even under this
              circumstance, participants strove for a playful tone, introducing
              laughter and jokes. Co-workers placed the conflict situation into a
              framework of "play" by using strategies such as style-switching,
              repetition, parallelism, and laughter. If the conflict is still not
              ratified after all reframing strategies, Jones (1990: 306)
              concludes that "it seems ... impossible for the participants to
              dispute with each other comfortably," suggesting that perhaps the
              Japanese themselves have bought into the "myth of harmony".<br>       Szatrowski (1992, 1993) concentrates on
              the Japanese invitation and refusal interaction taken from recorded
              telephone conversations, and offers detailed analysis of 13
              conversations of invitation. Using the concept
              of <em>wadan</em>, similar to <em>bundan</em>, Szatrowski
              shows that, instead of simple adjacency-pair, Japanese
              invitation-refusal negotiation is enacted by the
              invitation <em>wadan</em> stage and the
              response <em>wadan</em> stage, which may take several
              turn exchanges.<br>       Szatrowski (1993) reports that when
              compared with the English invitation-refusal exchange, Japanese
              participants rely more on their co-participants in the
              conversation, which results in co-produced stages. For example,
              Szatrowski (1992, 1993) provides interaction examples in which an
              invitee, whose goal may be to refuse, leaves open the possibility
              of accepting while developing the conversation toward a refusal. A
              Japanese inviter will go through several "invitation stages;" he or
              she shows sympathy for the invitee by always leaving some option
              for a refusal. In the invitee's "answer stages," he or she
              gradually develops a story, always gauging the inviter's response,
              trying to convince the inviter that he or she cannot accept the
              invitation after all. Through this prolonged give-and-take
              negotiation process, both participants successfully avoid losing
              "face" (Goffman 1955).<br>       The three studies mentioned above
              represent analysis of real-life conversation with related but
              differing contributions - insight into cross-cultural
              communication, language understood within a larger interactional
              frame (e.g. play), and the use of discourse units
              (e.g. <em>wadan</em>) for understanding the meaning of
              utterance clusters.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Hope that after reading the above discourse analysis you will have
              a new understanding on how Japanese discourse functions :-)</p>

              <p>Last time Japan was a sovereign state paying tributes to the Qing dynasty, it was only during the Empress Dowager Cixi period where Qing closed itself in where Japan became stronger and collaborated with the western powers.</p>

              <p>ironically...many japanese do know what wrong the earlier generation did..especially those that move around the world..but wats past is past..so they rather focus their energy on being productive..like saving every single cent and gift it to the US to spend and drive the world economy...</p>
              <p>their politicians certainly do try to hide...but truth cannot be contained for long..especially in a global village and having korea and china as neighbors..</p>
