              <p>i use to live in tokyo for four and a half years, and in terms of the porn industry, i think japan has more porn materials than any other place in the world, even much more than usa which is probably far behind in second place.</p>
              <p>but the porn material is very varied, ranging from extreme hard core to more subtle and artistic, and come in various forms from AV, magazines, anime, performing arts, and whatever you can think of....</p>
              <p>but porn is ingrained in the japan mindset and culture, so it is actually very normal and acceptable part of culture. there is no shame in being part of this multi billion dollar industry. there is no stigma in having your naked pictures on the front page. my jap friends tell me its part of the culture since those samurai days many hundreds of years ago.... in fact, they only start to outlaw child porn in recent times due to international pressures.... but there is absolutely nothing wrong to have a child in suggestive poses but wearing enough cloth to cover the vital areas... so you can "simulate" porn in a child, and this itself is a very profitable business in japan</p>
              <p>if we view all the porn in world from japan's eyes, then we might all understand and accept the meanings and significance behind the industry and the art forms and the various genres of porn</p>
              <p>rape against women happens in japan as it does everywhere, but the incidence of rapes are very very low compared to many other advanced cities... so porn has nothing to do with it, even though rape porn content is very popular there and has a strong following</p>
              <p>meanwhile prostitution industry is just as big bucks as porn, and comes in many many forms such as clubs, bars, soaplands...... but like porn, it is a fairly well respected and accepted part of life</p>

              <p>As part of the campaign, Singapore was captured on February
              15th, 1942, by the 25th army under the command of General Yamashita
              . His director of military operations, Tsuji Masanobu, made it his
              personal responsibility that a terrible pogrom was carried out
              against the local population. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This operation was called
              Sook Ching (ethnic cleansing, purge through purification). Wildly

              from 6.000 (Japanese military figures) up to 70.000 (some

              <p>This massacre is not played up in our country's history by PAP
              regime.</p>
              <p>This is probabaly due to the fact that Lee Kuan Yew collaborated
              with the Japanese during WWII.</p>
