Especially for a <strong>MONK</strong>???!!! Tell me why would a <strong>MONK</strong> need that kind of salary. Do you know what is the definition of monk in the Buddhism text??? So he cilmbed high building every year and that warrant him to have a high salary??? Remember this! He is first a MONK! And as a MONK he must adhere to the rules and regulation of the Buddhism ways. Simplicity is the word for MONKS! Live a simple life. Any kind of luxury is NOT considered 'MONKISH' life.<br><br>If what was rumoured to be try that he drive a Merc then he should renounce his monk-hood! He should be taking public transport if t need arise. Not like if Singapore is very big. Getting from one destination to another wouldn't take that long. Late? How can a monk be late. His timing should be timed properly to coincide with his daily activities. The most is he should take a cab. Assuming the Merc was donated, he should not even use it! There are lots of people in his charity organization. Anyone can easily drive him to his destination on time.<br><br>So? Yes this is a modern world but his simplisitic in life must be followed strictly. Driving a merc is luxury!<br><br>Anyway it was also rumoured he is staying in a condominium too but no one can confirm. All these are yet to see.<br><br></div>

I'm not worried.'<br><br>Last night, he was spotted driving in a dark-coloured car to the Foo Hai Ch'an Monastery in Geylang East, where he is the abbot. But he declined to comment when approached by The Straits Times.<br><br>MOH said on Wednesday that Ren Ci's status as an Institution of a Public Character (IPC) would not be renewed at the end of this month. That means donations to it would no longer be tax-exempt.<br><br>Almost a third of the charity's $30 million income this financial year came from tax-exempt donations.<br><br>Ren Ci was among 12 charities under MOH that had their corporate governance reviewed from July last year.<br><br>One outcome was that Ren Ci was urged to separate the functions of the chairman and CEO.<br><br>The Venerable Ming Yi, who had held both positions, became honorary CEO, and prominent businessman Chua Thian Poh stepped in as chairman in September this year.<br><br>The ministry's inquiry is expected to take three months.<br><br>All was quiet on the charity's premises yesterday morning, though some visitors expressed surprise that Ren Ci might have been lending money.<br><br>A woman visiting a relative warded at Ren Ci's Tan Tock Seng centre said it was good that the probe was under way. 'It's a charity to help poor people, so the funds should first be used to help those in need,' said the visitor, who wanted to be known only as Mrs Tan.<br><br>Ren Ci has 120 nursing home patients and 324 chronic sick patients.<br><br>Some other charities contacted yesterday were sombre at the news of yet another charity under probe since the National Kidney Foundation scandal of 2005 triggered tighter controls on corporate governance.<br><br>Deacon Matthew Kang, spokesman for New Creation Church, said the news surprised many, but did not think people would stop volunteering or giving to the church.<br><br>Mr Alfred Tan, executive director of the Singapore Children's Society, was concerned about the impact on public trust and the difficulty of attracting people to step up as board members.<br><br>siewtha@sph.com.sg<br><br>ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY LIAW WY-CIN<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>

Profits from the business, which was run out of a Balestier address before it moved to Rochor Road in 1997, were intended to be ploughed back to Ren Ci.<br><br>But business was poor and Mandala gave up its two shop units three years ago and took a small counter at Foo Hai Ch'an Monastery in Geylang East, of which Venerable Ming Yi is abbot.<br><br>Asked about loan, Mr We said: 'It hasn't been returned yet. Unfortunately, the shop is not making any profit.' It is still running but business is 'not very good', he added.<br><br>The Straits Times understands that Ren Ci may have been making interest-free loans totalling millions of dollars to various companies from as far back as 1996. There appear to be discrepancies - of several hundred thousand dollars in some cases - between what the charity recorded it lent, and what the companies involved recorded as having borrowed.<br><br>Venerable Ming Yi had told Chinese daily Lianhe Zaobao on Wednesday that the money was mostly recovered, with only $200,000 to $300,000 still due.<br><br>A check showed that Venerable Ming Yi is the registered owner of two businesses, Mandala and Ch'an Yun Buddhist Handicrafts &amp; Trading. He is also shareholder of Savoury Restaurant, Bodhicherie Vegeatarian Food and Semco Design Communications Pte Ltd.<br><br>Ren Ci, which has 120 nursing home patients and 324 chronic sick patients, is holding a fund-raising Qian Shou (Thousand Hand) Guanyin Charity Concert next weekend, from Nov 17 to 18.<br><br>The government inquiry is expected to take about three months. In the meantime, Ren Ci's Institution of Public Character (IPC) status would not be renewed when it expires on Nov 27. This means that donations made to Ren Ci by members of the public after then will not be tax-deductible.<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited<br></div>

Profits from the business, which was run out of a Balestier address before it moved to Rochor Road in 1997, were intended to be ploughed back to Ren Ci.<br><br>But business was poor and Mandala gave up its two shop units three years ago and took a small counter at Foo Hai Ch'an Monastery in Geylang East, of which Venerable Ming Yi is abbot.<br><br>Asked about loan, Mr We said: 'It hasn't been returned yet. Unfortunately, the shop is not making any profit.' It is still running but business is 'not very good', he added.<br><br>The Straits Times understands that Ren Ci may have been making interest-free loans totalling millions of dollars to various companies from as far back as 1996. There appear to be discrepancies - of several hundred thousand dollars in some cases - between what the charity recorded it lent, and what the companies involved recorded as having borrowed.<br><br>Venerable Ming Yi had told Chinese daily Lianhe Zaobao on Wednesday that the<strong> money was mostly recovered, with only $200,000 to $300,000 still due</strong>.<br><br>A check showed that Venerable Ming Yi is the registered owner of two businesses, Mandala and Ch'an Yun Buddhist Handicrafts &amp; Trading. He is also shareholder of Savoury Restaurant, Bodhicherie Vegeatarian Food and Semco Design Communications Pte Ltd.<br><br>Ren Ci, which has 120 nursing home patients and 324 chronic sick patients, is holding a fund-raising Qian Shou (Thousand Hand) Guanyin Charity Concert next weekend, from Nov 17 to 18.<br><br>The government inquiry is expected to take about three months. In the meantime, Ren Ci's Institution of Public Character (IPC) status would not be renewed when it expires on Nov 27. This means that donations made to Ren Ci by members of the public after then will not be tax-deductible.<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited<br>[/b]</blockquote>Isn't $200 -$300 k a lot of money?  I will take my life time to save this amount !!!  sheeh......  to think that I have even donated dispite being played out by NKF !!!  this is double whammy !! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

Tell me why would a <strong>MONK</strong> need that kind of salary. Do you know what is the definition of monk in the Buddhism text??? So he cilmbed high building every year and that warrant him to have a high salary??? Remember this! He is first a MONK! And as a MONK he must adhere to the rules and regulation of the Buddhism ways. Simplicity is the word for MONKS! Live a simple life. Any kind of luxury is NOT considered 'MONKISH' life.<br><br>If what was rumoured to be try that he drive a Merc then he should renounce his monk-hood! He should be taking public transport if t need arise. Not like if Singapore is very big. Getting from one destination to another wouldn't take that long. Late? How can a monk be late. His timing should be timed properly to coincide with his daily activities. The most is he should take a cab. Assuming the Merc was donated, he should not even use it! There are lots of people in his charity organization. Anyone can easily drive him to his destination on time.<br><br>So? Yes this is a modern world but his simplisitic in life must be followed strictly. Driving a merc is luxury!<br><br>Anyway it was also rumoured he is staying in a condominium too but no one can confirm. All these are yet to see.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Quite true indeed, a monk in Sankirit is  Saha, the name given by Buddha, Disciples of Buddha like Anandna and chahkirat hv all turn to become Saha, their duties is to up hold buddha teaching, live simply and accept only foods from others. They shall preach the good of Buddha teaching and practice contention and simplicity inorder to attain Buddhahood or so call Enlightment. They shall not indulge in shows or any other acts to gain popularity or canvassing for funds or money.</div>
