One even came with empty cardboard boxes, presumably to store files. The Straits Times counted at least 10 auditors.<br><br>Ren Ci staff The Straits Times spoke to said they had not been told of the probe, but some had learnt about it through news reports.<br><br>Staff nurse San San Yee, 46, said that she was 'not worried' by the news.<br><br>Relatives of Ren Ci patients were surprised to hear about the probe. They had only good things to say about the quality of care delivered by Ren Ci's staff.<br><br>A 48-year-old sales executive, who identified herself only as Madam Lim, said her family owed the hospital about $10,000 for her bedridden older brother who has been there a few years, but that they had never been pressed to pay up. They pay about $600 every month.<br><br>Madam Lim said: 'The doctors here are nice and they take good care of him.'<br><br>Ren Ci's website said it had about 120 patients in its nursing wards and about 300 chronic sick patients in September.<br><br>Its patients are highly subsidised, and ward charges are, on average, $18 a day.<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">Charities that faced public scrutiny</span></strong><br><br><strong>July 2005: National Kidney Foundation</strong><br><br>IT WAS Singapore's largest charity that took Singapore Press Holdings to court for defamation.<br><br>However, the trial collapsed after two days when it was revealed that its then-chief executive officer T.T. Durai received an annual salary of $600,000.<br><br>Other revelations made included how Durai flew first class on plane trips, and how the charity inflated its patient figures.<br><br>This eventually led to the resignation of Durai and the NKF's board of directors.<br><br>Mr Gerard Ee was appointed the charity's interim chairman by Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan.<br><br>Its current CEO is Eunice Tay.<br><br>Durai, 59, and several of the old board members were later convicted on criminal charges of corruption.<br><br><strong>October 2005: Singapore Association of the Visually Handicapped</strong><br><br>THE Commissioner of Charities started an inquiry into the governance and financial management of the charity, which serves the blind here.<br><br>This cost the 56-year-old charity its status as an Institution of Public Character (IPC) which meant that donors could not get tax exemptions on their donations to the charity.<br><br>Over a million dollars in annual funding from the National Council of Social Service was also lost.<br><br>SAVH finally regained its status as an IPC last September but has had some trouble raising funds.<br><br>In July, it was reported that the SAVH had about three months to go before funds for its day-to-day operations would run out.<br><br><strong>August 2006: Youth Challenge</strong><br><br>THE charity, which sends young people on overseas humanitarian missions, came under the spotlight after a probe found irregularities. One of the sticking points especially was how its founder and then-executive president Vincent Lam's salary was computed and disclosed.<br><br>In 2005, he was paid $248,867, which amounted to 56 per cent of the charity's income of $442,287 for the period.<br><br>The investigation also found serious lapses in the handling of its finances, and in how the management committee was elected and run.<br><br>Mr Lam resigned in January.<br><br>He was eventually cleared of any criminal action by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore and the Central Provident Fund Board.<br><br><strong>June 2007: St John's Home for Elderly Persons</strong><br><br>A POLICE investigation was launched after about $3.88 million was found missing from the home's bank accounts.<br><br>This amount -the home's reserves - was painstakingly built up by the home since 1959.<br><br>Also missing was the home's superintendent, Benjamin Ho, 60, who handled its finances.<br><br>He left on overseas leave on May 30 and did not return.<br><br>He, as yet, cannot be found.<br><br>It is also believed that signatures on cheques may have been forged.<br><br>A lawsuit was subsequently filed against him by the home.<br><br>This led to a High Court ruling on Aug 22 that he must return the money.<br><br>A new superintendent, Mr Goh Beng Hoe, 44, was appointed in September.</div>
