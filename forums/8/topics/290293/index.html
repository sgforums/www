            <div class='col-md body'>Home &gt; Latest News &gt; Singapore<br>Nov 7, 2007<br>Govt inquiry into Ren Ci Hospital &amp; Medicare Centre<br><br>An artist's impression of Ren Ci's new premises at Irawaddy Road. -- PHOTO: MOH<br><br>THE Ministry of Health (MOH) announced on Wednesday that it is conducting an inquiry into Ren Ci Hospital &amp; Medicare Centre under the Charities Act.<br><br>This comes after the the ministry discovered some possible irregularities in certain financial transactions involving Ren Ci and some external organisation in an earlier general review into the charity's past dealings, which disclosed gaps in its corporate governance and internal controls.<br><br>An MOH statement announcing the inquiry into Ren Ci said in July 2006, the ministry appointed Ernst &amp; Young Associates (EYA) to carry out a general review of the corporate governance on 12 larger Institutions of a Public Character (IPCs), including Ren Ci.<br><br>Completed in February 2007, the review covered areas such as corporate governance structures, internal controls, and compliance with IPC regulations.<br><br>The individual IPCs were asked to progressively put in place the recommended improvement measures. One recommendation was for Ren Ci to separate the roles of its Chairman and CEO, said MOH.<br><br>Two months ago, Mr Chua Thian Poh, Chairman and CEO of Ho Bee Group, took over the chairmanship of Ren Ci from Venerable Shi Ming Yi.<br><br>'As the general review into Ren Ci's past transactions also disclosed other gaps in corporate governance and internal controls, MOH commissioned EYA to carry out a more in-depth evaluation,' said the MOH statement.<br><br>'The follow-up reviews have since identified some possible irregularities in certain financial transactions involving Ren Ci and certain external organisations. Hence, MOH is commencing an Inquiry into Ren Ci to establish a fuller and better understanding of these irregularities.'<br><br>MOH is the administrator of the Health Sector under the Charities Act.<br><br>The inquiry, which is under the Charities Act, is expected to take about three months.<br><br>The ministry will announce the findings after the probe is completed and will take appropriate measures if there are any breaches.<br><br>In view of the ongoing inquiry, MOH said it will not renew Ren Ci's IPC status which expires on Nov 27.<br><br>Donations made by members of the public to Ren Ci after Nov 27 will not be tax-deductible.<br><br>'Pending the outcome of the Inquiry, MOH will evaluate when Ren Ci can apply to reinstate its IPC status,' said the ministry.<br><br>In the meantime, MOH will continue to subsidise Ren Ci's patient care services so that patients will continue to receive their medical treatments.<br><br>'We recognise the good work of Ren Ci's staff and we are confident that the Ren Ci Board will ensure that professional standards and services remain intact and the day-to-day operations in Ren Ci carry on undisrupted,' said the MOH statement.<br><br></div>

But then paper cannot wrap fire one leh. Sure to burn one.<br><br>Anyway who says monks can be trusted completely? No one can be trusted! Monks are human beings made of flesh and blood like you and me too. Sometimes along the way they 'zou huo ru mo' and began to deviate from the right path as the lure of the $$$ is simply to great to resist. 'Dao heng' not high enough.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">More mega charity trouble</span><br>Ren Ci under probe for possible financial irregularities, IPC status won't be renewed</strong><br>TODAYonline<br>Thursday Â• November 8, 2007<br>Lee U-Wen<br>u-wen@mediacorp.com.sg<br><br>LIKE the old National Kidney Foundation, it is well-known for its star-studded televised charity shows that rake in millions of dollars in donations.<br><br>Now, the Ren Ci Hospital and Medicare Centre Â— one of the largest local charities, whose honorary chief executive officer, the Venerable Shi Ming Yi (picture), has become a household face with his fund-raising stunts Â— is under probe by the Government for its financial management.<br><br>Its status as an Institution of Public Character (IPC) will also not be renewed when it expires on Nov 27 Â— which means public donations made after then will not be tax-deductible.<br><br>Yesterday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said it was commencing an inquiry into "some possible irregularities in certain financial transactions" involving the charity and other external organisations.<br><br>Ren Ci, whose last charity show in March raised $7.2 million, is one of 12 large IPCs under the ministry's purview. In July last year, the MOH had appointed one of the "Big 4" accounting firms, Ernst &amp; Young Associates, to conduct an eight-month corporate governance review exercise involving all 12 IPCs.<br><br>The firm had looked at each organisation's accountability and transparency of its operations, and drawn up a list of recommendations for each. In Ren Ci's case, one suggestion was to separate the roles of its chairman and chief executive officer, which were jointly held by the Venerable Shi, 45. This was in keeping with the practice that board and management remain independent of each other.<br><br>In September this year, Ren Ci duly complied and named Mr Chua Thian Poh, chairman and CEO of Ho Bee Group, as its new chairman. However, the review into the charity's past transactions also "disclosed other gaps in corporate governance and internal controls", according to the MOH in a statement.<br><br>This prompted the ministry to commission Ernst &amp; Young to carry out "a more in-depth evaluation", which turned up the possible irregularities. Hence, it is now "commencing an inquiry into Ren Ci to establish a fuller and better understanding of these irregularities", said the MOH. The ministry, the administrator of the health sector under the Charities Act, will announce its findings after the inquiry is completed in February and take action if required.<br><br>Responding, Ren Ci said it has a strong culture of corporate governance and would cooperate fully in the investigations. At the hospital's Buangkok View premises yesterday, auditors were seen carting files into the office.<br><br>Observers say that for the public to pass judgment on the charity without knowing more details would be "jumping the gun".<br><br>Associate Professor Mak Yuen Teen, director of the Corporate Governance and Financial Reporting Centre at the National University of Singapore Business School, said it is likely the investigations had uncovered "conflicts of interest", where one or more Ren Ci board members failed to disclose their roles in other organisations. "It could involve a situation where a board member has an interest in transactions and did not declare this as it could lead to them losing their position on the board," said Prof Mak.<br><br>Or, he said, it could simply be a case of ignorance on the board members' part, with no intent to deceive. "That's why it's important for board members to understand their responsibilities Â… In the eyes of the law, there is no such thing as ignorance and any breach is seen as breaking the law," he said.<br><br>Meanwhile, the loss of IPC status for Ren Ci could mean a drop in donations.<br><br>The charity's latest annual report showed that as of March 31, donations, grants, investment gains and other receipts for the last financial year totalled $30.3 million Â— up 16 per cent Â— while expenses amounted to $18.8 million, an 8 per cent rise. The ratio of its reserves to annual operating expenditure was 1.9.<br><br>Of the money raised from this year's charity show, $1.5 million has been set aside for the new Ren Ci Hospital in Irrawaddy Road, to be completed next year.<br><br>The ministry said it recognised the good work of Ren Ci's staff and would continue to subsidise its patient care services so that patients will continue to receive their medical treatments.<br><br>"We are confident that the Ren Ci board will ensure that professional standards and services remain intact and the day-to-day operations carry on undisrupted," said the statement. As of March, the charity employed 326 staff.<br><br>An MOH spokesman told Today the ministry did not expect to carry out similar enquiries on any of the other 11 IPCs.</div>

That will not be fair to the parties involved'.<br><br>His ministry said yesterday that a review of the charity had turned up 'possible irregularities in certain financial transactions' involving Ren Ci and some external parties, and that an inquiry would clarify them.<br><br>The Straits Times understands that several companies had been given loans, some amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars. But Ren Ci's books recorded loans that, in some cases, were several hundred thousand dollars more than what was reflected in the borrowers' books.<br><br>These irregularities surfaced in the wake of the ministry tightening corporate governance among the charities under its wing last year, following the NKF scandal of 2005.<br><br>In July last year, the ministry appointed accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young to carry out a general review of the operations at its 12 largest IPCs, including Ren Ci.<br><br>At the end of the review in February, Ren Ci was asked to split the role of board chairman and chief executive officer.<br><br>Both positions were then held by Venerable Ming Yi, a colourful character who has performed death-defying stunts in the charity's popular annual televised fund-raisers.<br><br>He has since become Ren Ci's honorary CEO. Mr Chua Thian Poh, chief executive of property developer Ho Bee Group, became the charity's chairman in September.<br><br>The ministry next got Ernst &amp; Young to delve deeper into Ren Ci's operations, which was when the loan discrepancies were uncovered.<br><br>Yesterday, the ministry informed the Ren Ci board that a probe under the Charities Act would be convened. This is expected to take three months, after which the findings will be disclosed and 'appropriate measures' taken.<br><br>Auditors were seen moving files into a room on the ground floor of the hospital's Buangkok premises just before 7pm yesterday.<br><br>Venerable Ming Yi was seen on the premises, but declined to take calls to his cellphone.<br><br>Mr Chua, contacted in China, where he is on a business trip, declined comment and referred The Straits Times to a statement put out by Ren Ci, which said: 'Ren Ci Hospital &amp; Medicare Centre has a culture of strong corporate governance and transparency.
