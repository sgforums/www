            <div class='col-md body'>Like that also can ah. Great discussion here. I also say my piece horÂ…<br><br>Salute to mr_sotong !  Wow! You have satisfied the 3 conditions of a perfect philanthropy ; see no beneficiary of philanthropy, see no object of philanthropy and see no act of philanthropy. Great job !<br><br>Same as dumbdumb! I also support Ren Ci and its staff. Even MOH also said they Â“recognize the good work of Ren CiÂ’s staff and they are confident that the Ren Ci Board will ensure that professional standards are services remain intact and the day-to-day operations in Ren Ci carry on undisrupted.Â”<br><br>What I can say for sir_peanuts query, Â– under the robes are the Triple Gem at work.<br><br>Dxdx Â– not pang pui lah ! Have any of you been to Ren Ci ? The greatest virtue of all compassion is to tend to the old and the sick. I think most of us do not possess such virtue; including me. We all like to enjoy ourselves. One of these days I would go and visit Ren Ci and see not with my eyes but with my heart.<br><br>GenX Â– ai ya, thatÂ’s the art of public speaking mah. DonÂ’t quite recall the course title already. Once you master this public speaking art, it actually looks as though you have memorized a perfect speech; but in actual fact, itÂ’s actually thinking on the feet. Well, heÂ’s innocent until proven guilty right; and I have this feeling, heÂ’s clean.<br><br>On the issue of salary. If I read the newspaper reporting correctly, there were only 4 years where he drew salary of $12k but also donated $6k back to Ren Ci. IÂ’m not versed in Buddhism text, but can vaguely recall that a monk cannot possess personal wealth; as this is against the Buddhist teachings. Having said that, donÂ’t forget hor, a monk also has father and mother which he has to look after their basic needs. This is the basic filial piety (Xiao Dao). How he used that $6k, I donÂ’t know. Most probably tend to the basic needs of the parents and the remainder donated to charity. DonÂ’t ask me.<br><br>Well, about monks driving car. Come on , we are in a modernize society, religious leaders need to be like you and me and talk in our lingo; and not behaving like creeps right ? WhatÂ’s wrong with driving a car? You canÂ’t expect them to walk bear footed under the hot sun from one point to another right ? Just based on my limited knowledge on cause and sustenance (Yin Yuan).<br><br>Yes, a monk he is; that is just one of the many hats he is wearing. As a designated CEO of a company, I think it is not too much to ask for a car. Respect and status should be reciprocate; especially during corporate meetings. You treat me with respect, I treat you with respect too.  Some forumers comment that he should not be driving car; should get some other staff to drive him around. But, again, if someone sees him being chauffeur around; wow, see Â– a monk also got chauffeur leh !! Mouth is yours, say whatever you like lohÂ….<br><br>On the rules of being a real monk suggested by few forumers, what my thought is we shouldnÂ’t see things superficially. Remember, itÂ’s substance over matter. We have indulged too much into the superficial matter over the real, underlying principles of being a real monk, the real follower of the Buddhist teachings. What I thought of a real monk is one who has compassion and others above self. Even fame; which is superficially bestow upon a monk; is nothing but a by-product of the fruit of labour of applying the correct principles of a true bodhisattva. HmmÂ… let me try to illustrate with one example. One sees a Â“thousand hands Guan YinÂ” statue as having mighty power to help the weak and needy. This is superficial. ItÂ’s real meaning, translating to the mundane world which we live in; is to be able to help the weak and needy using many Â“contact armsÂ” to reach out to as many available resources as possible to help the weak and needy; not for oneself. This is the spirit. For that, I kneel and bow to the true monk.<br><br>Well, donÂ’t know about you all. But, I will continue to donate to nkf and ren ci to help the sick and needy. DonÂ’t penalize them lah.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">A monk like no other</span><br>Ren Ci's honorary CEO confounds most people's views of what a Buddhist monk is like</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Sunday Times, The (Singapore)<br>News, Pg 6<br>November 11, 2007<br>Author: Wong Kim Hoh</span><br><br><img src="http://img46.imageshack.us/img46/9573/picture1zy3.png"><br><img src="http://img337.imageshack.us/img337/1061/picture3fc1.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://i12.tinypic.com/7328znq.jpg"><br><br>WHEN business consultant R.S. Ye met the Venerable Ming Yi in 2004, he was struck by the bespectacled monk's business acumen.<br><br>Mr Ye was then an executive for a publishing firm and was discussing with the Buddhist monk a proposed biography.<br><br>He recalled of the meetings: 'What struck me was how sharp and sure he was. I felt like I was talking to a CEO instead of a religious person.''<br><br>Of course, the Venerable Ming Yi is both monk and honorary chief executive officer of Ren Ci Hospital and Medicare Centre, a charity with an income of $30 million.<br><br>The centre has 120 nursing home patients and 324 chronic sick patients. The Venerable Ming Yi is also abbot of Foo Hai Ch'an Monastery in Geylang East, as well as temples in Hong Kong and Malaysia.<br><br>To Singaporeans, he is the public face of Ren Ci, famous for his daredevil stunts such as abseiling down the 45-storey Suntec Tower 2 and immersing himself in ice cold water to raise money for charity.<br><br>He is also known to have easy access to Hong Kong celebrities such as Andy Lau and Eric Tsang. The two are listed on the Ren Ci website as the charity's patrons.<br><br>Last week, Ren Ci made headlines when the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced that the charity is being probed for 'possible irregularities in certain financial transactions'.<br><br>An audit found that the charity had made interest-free loans amounting to a few million dollars to various companies since 1996. There were discrepancies between what the charity recorded it lent and what the companies involved recorded as having borrowed.<br><br>Not surprisingly, public attention has been trained on the Venerable Ming Yi who founded the hospital in 1994 when he took over the chronic sick unit in the former Woodbridge Hospital. He was then just 33 years old.<br><br>A former Raffles Institution student, the abbot stood out among Buddhist leaders then because he was articulate and bilingual.<br><br>Mr Dennis Foo, CEO of St James Power Station, who has been following the abbot's career, said: 'It's fascinating. For me, religion and business are two different things. Religion deals with the spiritual, business deals with finance and numbers. They are two totally different tangents, it's very hard to mix them.'<br><br>Ren Ci's honorary CEO, however, is used to dealing with questions from people who see him as a bag of contradictions.<br><br>At an interview in 2003, not long after his abseiling stunt on Suntec Tower 2 prompted television viewers to call in with donations of nearly $1 million, he brandished a sleek Nokia mobile phone and was more than conversant with a PC.<br><br>He said then: 'I run a hospital. I carry a handphone not because I want to look good but because I need it for communication in case there are problems and emergencies at the hospital.'<br><br>The monk, who also has a Master's in Health Care Management from the University of Wales, and a PhD in Philosophy from Mannin University in Britain, said: 'In the past, great Buddhist masters walked all the way from China to India to get the scriptures. Do you need to do that now? You don't; you fly. You may not even need to fly; you e-mail them over.'<br><br>Religion, said the abbot, has to adapt to modern life.<br><br>'Things have changed but the teachings are the same. In fact, monks are supposed to bring Buddhism to the everyday lives of people, and to help them with problems they face in the modern world,' he added.<br><br>Which is why, he said, he reads books on 'how to be a CEO, and how to run a hospital'.<br><br>Asked in another interview why he attempted fund-raising stunts such as spending nearly 23 minutes in a container with 1,000kg of ice and water, he replied: 'Sometimes dance and singing acts are not special enough.'<br><br>He is known to go to the gym regularly: he runs on the treadmill and skips.<br><br>While generous with access to reporters, he has not let on much about his family. The youngest and only son (he has three older sisters) of a bank employee and a housewife, he said he knew his calling since he was a teenager.<br><br>"In school, everyone thought I was strange because I always went to the temple, even on Saturdays and Sundays. But it was something I liked to do,' he told The Straits Times in 2001.<br><br>His parents reluctantly agreed to him becoming a monk when he was about 23.<br><br>Several people The Sunday Times approached declined to talk about him, given the probe. But those who did described him as a charismatic leader.<br><br>Financial analyst Taserine Chua, 30, was a member of the NUS Buddhist Society in 1997 when the religious leader was its spiritual adviser.<br><br>She said: 'We felt connected to him because he was young and spoke very good English. Although he was serious, he was also open to opinions and very approachable.'<br><br>Television and stage actor Adrian Pang, 41, has met the abbot during Ren Ci charity shows.<br><br>He said: 'He has this implacable demeanour when he's doing his stunts, which is amazing considering their degree of difficulty.<br><br>'Each year, he sets himself a new bar, but never in a vainglorious way. He always makes it a point to come by during rehearsals and shake our hands. He has this really calming effect. We'd just stop whingeing each time he's around.'<br><br>To those who said Buddhism and money should not mix, the abbot had this retort: 'I'm not raising money for my personal use. I am doing it for people who are suffering. I sign cheques but I don't handle accounts or cash.'<br><br>When the National Kidney Foundation scandal broke in 2005, he refuted talk that he earned more than $10,000 a month as Ren Ci's chief. He said that he was just a volunteer and his salary was paid by the monastery.<br><br>'No matter what, I'm a monk and I'm different from other people. My conscience is clear. I'm human after all. I need to eat and go overseas to spread Buddhist teachings.'<br><br>He raised eyebrows when he told Shin Min Daily News last year that he would not decline offers of first-class travel overseas from believers.<br><br>'If a believer invites you for a meal and takes you to a good restaurant, does it mean I can go only to the foodcourt because of my Ren Ci links?'<br><br>The probe into Ren Ci - expected to take three months - has led many to wonder about his fate.<br><br>But those interviewed by The Sunday Times cautioned against jumping to conclusions.<br><br>Ms Chua said: 'As organisations grow big, there are bound to be problems. It's not fair to form judgments now, and I wouldn't.'<br><br>kimhoh@sph.com.sg<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">MOH refutes remark by Ren Ci head</span></strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Sunday Times, The (Singapore)<br>News, Pg 1<br>November 11, 2007<br>Author: Salma Khalik, Health Correspondent</span><br><br>THE Ministry of Health (MOH) yesterday refuted the head of Ren Ci Hospital and Medicare Centre's remark that the ministry's probe into its affairs 'is not a big problem''.<br><br>Ren Ci's honorary chief executive officer, the Venerable Ming Yi, was quoted in the press last week as saying that he was not worried about the probe as only $200,000 to $300,000 of the multimillion-dollar charity's money was unaccounted for.<br><br>An audit had turned up discrepancies between what the charity recorded it lent and what the companies involved recorded as having borrowed. The Venerable Ming Yi had said that most of the money has been recovered.<br><br>A ministry spokesman told The Sunday Times yesterday: 'When financial irregularity in a charity is uncovered and is not properly explained by management, it is necessary to conduct a proper inquiry to get to the bottom of the matter.<br><br>'The amount of money involved and the ability to repay is not the issue here.''<br><br>Saying that it is important for charities to be transparent and to build trust with the donating public, the spokesman added: 'That some repayments have been made, after discrepancies have been identified by auditors, does not detract from the need to establish the facts surrounding the original transactions.'<br><br>The Sunday Times understands that the amount of money not accounted for adds up to a few million dollars, and not a few hundred thousand as the Venerable Ming Yi had said. Some of the loans were apparently made without approval from the board.<br><br>The Venerable Ming Yi was both board chairman and CEO till February this year, when Ren Ci was asked to split the two roles following a review by accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young ordered by MOH.<br><br>One of the companies which was given an interest-free loan of between $200,000 and $300,000 was the Mandala Buddhist Cultural Centre.<br><br>The Venerable Ming Yi and a former Ren Ci board member, Mr Wee Beng Seng, are the two registered owners of the centre. Mr Wee has said the centre is not making any profit and has not repaid the loan.<br><br>The probe into the charity, the second largest under MOH's jurisdiction after the National Kidney Foundation (NKF), was announced last Wednesday.<br><br>The charity will not have its Institution of a Public Character status renewed when it expires on Nov 27. This means that donations will not be tax-exempt.<br><br>Almost a third of the charity's $30 million income this financial year came from tax-exempt donations. The inquiry is expected to take three months.<br><br>The MOH spokesman said: 'Managing a charity, or volunteering to help out in one, is not just about doing charitable work.<br><br>'It is also about carrying out the work professionally, with good systems in place. Charities have a stewardship responsibility to the donating public.'<br><br>She said that there are many charities that are doing good work and their efforts should be recognised.<br><br>Pointing out that public confidence in charities had 'taken a beating' since the largest and best known charity, the NKF, was found to have misused public funds, the spokesman said of the probe into Ren Ci: 'We urge the public not to jump to any conclusions or be overly speculative.'<br><br>salma@sph.com.sg<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>

Remember, itÂ’s substance over matter. We have indulged too much into the superficial matter over the real, underlying principles of being a real monk, the real follower of the Buddhist teachings. What I thought of a real monk is one who has compassion and others above self. Even fame; which is superficially bestow upon a monk; is nothing but a by-product of the fruit of labour of applying the correct principles of a true bodhisattva. HmmÂ… let me try to illustrate with one example. One sees a Â“thousand hands Guan YinÂ” statue as having mighty power to help the weak and needy. This is superficial. ItÂ’s real meaning, translating to the mundane world which we live in; is to be able to help the weak and needy using many Â“contact armsÂ” to reach out to as many available resources as possible to help the weak and needy; not for oneself. This is the spirit. For that, I kneel and bow to the true monk.<br><br>Well, donÂ’t know about you all. But, I will continue to donate to nkf and ren ci to help the sick and needy. DonÂ’t penalize them lah.<br></div></blockquote>Yes, monk need to travel, but does he need a big car.  The saving from using big car, could help a few more patients isn't ?</div>

Moreover he should educate those donors that it would be a waste of donating him such a big car as a small simple one will do and he should point out that by giving him big luxurious items will inevitably invite gossips. So? Just because people donate him big things then he must take and use? That is not the way of a monk life. It's call excessive.<br><br>Someone also mention that he has parents like everybody and <strong>MUST</strong> support them even though he is a monk as filial piety is one of the buddhism way, which I agree wholeheartedly. <strong>BUT!</strong> Take note of this - <strong>IF HE HAS OTHER SIBLINGS</strong>, (which was reported that indeed he has older sisters) <strong>THAT</strong> were capable of supporting the parents in monetary wise <strong>THEN HE IS NOT OBLIGATED</strong> to contribute in terms of monies to his parents to show that he is filial. He can do it in other manner by expounding his teaching to his parents! Let me tell you by expounding the sutra to the parents is considered even more meritorious, more useful, more filial as he is helping his parents to wash away any bad karma they have accumulated so when they go to hell they don't have to suffer so much and get rebirth faster to a better life!<br><br>Now, <strong>PROVIDED HIS PARENTS WERE UNABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES IN MONETARY WISE</strong> and has no other siblings to take care of them THEN he has the duty as a <strong>SON</strong> to pay them to upkeep their living lifestyle so his parents will not suffer unnecessarily but to have a comfortable life. <strong>TAKE NOTE OF THIS! IT'S COMFORTABLE LIFE NOT LUXURIOUS</strong>!<br><br>But we all don't know how the parents live right? Since report said he didn't give much infos about his parents which I wonder why? He should be happy to tell the world that his parents has given birth to him and made him as what he is today - an honourable venerated MONK! Right? Go figure <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Anyway hor, the above doesn't just apply to him alone but to the rest of the monks in the world and also not intended to slam him with but since RenCi is under him and is under probe well, he has to be highlighted and used as a example for our debate. Whether he is innocent or not is yet to be seen. The truth shall be reveal. Let's wait for the next episode.
