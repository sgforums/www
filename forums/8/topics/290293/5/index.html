            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by LikeThatAlsoCan:</div><div class="quote_body">Like that also can ah. Great discussion here. I also say my piece horÂ…<br><br>Salute to mr_sotong !  Wow! You have satisfied the 3 conditions of a perfect philanthropy ; see no beneficiary of philanthropy, see no object of philanthropy and see no act of philanthropy. Great job !<br><br>Same as dumbdumb! I also support Ren Ci and its staff. Even MOH also said they Â“recognize the good work of Ren CiÂ’s staff and they are confident that the Ren Ci Board will ensure that professional standards are services remain intact and the day-to-day operations in Ren Ci carry on undisrupted.Â”<br><br>What I can say for sir_peanuts query, Â– under the robes are the Triple Gem at work.<br><br>Dxdx Â– not pang pui lah ! Have any of you been to Ren Ci ? The greatest virtue of all compassion is to tend to the old and the sick. I think most of us do not possess such virtue; including me. We all like to enjoy ourselves. One of these days I would go and visit Ren Ci and see not with my eyes but with my heart.<br><br>GenX Â– ai ya, thatÂ’s the art of public speaking mah. DonÂ’t quite recall the course title already. Once you master this public speaking art, it actually looks as though you have memorized a perfect speech; but in actual fact, itÂ’s actually thinking on the feet. Well, heÂ’s innocent until proven guilty right; and I have this feeling, heÂ’s clean.<br><br>On the issue of salary. If I read the newspaper reporting correctly, there were only 4 years where he drew salary of $12k but also donated $6k back to Ren Ci. IÂ’m not versed in Buddhism text, but can vaguely recall that a monk cannot possess personal wealth; as this is against the Buddhist teachings. Having said that, donÂ’t forget hor, a monk also has father and mother which he has to look after their basic needs. This is the basic filial piety (Xiao Dao). How he used that $6k, I donÂ’t know. Most probably tend to the basic needs of the parents and the remainder donated to charity. DonÂ’t ask me.<br><br>Well, about monks driving car. Come on , we are in a modernize society, religious leaders need to be like you and me and talk in our lingo; and not behaving like creeps right ? WhatÂ’s wrong with driving a car? You canÂ’t expect them to walk bear footed under the hot sun from one point to another right ? Just based on my limited knowledge on cause and sustenance (Yin Yuan).<br><br>Yes, a monk he is; that is just one of the many hats he is wearing. As a designated CEO of a company, I think it is not too much to ask for a car. Respect and status should be reciprocate; especially during corporate meetings. You treat me with respect, I treat you with respect too.  Some forumers comment that he should not be driving car; should get some other staff to drive him around. But, again, if someone sees him being chauffeur around; wow, see Â– a monk also got chauffeur leh !! Mouth is yours, say whatever you like lohÂ….<br><br>On the rules of being a real monk suggested by few forumers, what my thought is we shouldnÂ’t see things superficially. Remember, itÂ’s substance over matter. We have indulged too much into the superficial matter over the real, underlying principles of being a real monk, the real follower of the Buddhist teachings. What I thought of a real monk is one who has compassion and others above self. Even fame; which is superficially bestow upon a monk; is nothing but a by-product of the fruit of labour of applying the correct principles of a true bodhisattva. HmmÂ… let me try to illustrate with one example. One sees a Â“thousand hands Guan YinÂ” statue as having mighty power to help the weak and needy. This is superficial. ItÂ’s real meaning, translating to the mundane world which we live in; is to be able to help the weak and needy using many Â“contact armsÂ” to reach out to as many available resources as possible to help the weak and needy; not for oneself. This is the spirit. For that,<blockquote> I kneel and bow to the true monk.</blockquote>Well, donÂ’t know about you all. But, I will continue to donate to nkf and ren ci to help the sick and needy. DonÂ’t penalize them lah.<br></div></blockquote>Problem is ..... where are the 'true monks'? Don't seem to be able to find any around! Either they are extinct or a highly 'endangered specie'. For 'true nuns' ....... at least there was Mother Theresa! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> But the sad truth now is the decision to grant her sainthood rests on a bunch of hypocrites (their leader moves around in a bullet-proof car) to decide! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

Some of these loans were made, apparently, without board approval.<br><br>Also, there were discrepancies between what the charity recorded it had lent and what the companies involved recorded it had borrowed.<br><br>Under the new Code, there should be procedures to handle conflict of interest situations, for example, when a board member has vested interest in businesses the charity deals with.<br><br>One guideline is that the board member should not vote on the matter or take part in discussions regarding the business.<br><br>Also read New Code of Governance for charities and IPCs<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Home &gt; Latest News &gt; Singapore<br>Nov 26, 2007<br><strong>New Code of Governance for charities and IPCs  </strong><br>By Melissa Kok<br><br>THE Charity Council has launched a new Code of Governance for Charities and Institutions of Public Character (IPCs), to serve as an industry benchmark in governance standards.<br>The launch comes after extensive consultation with the public and charity sector, which has seen the Code tweaked since a draft version was released earlier this June.<br><br>The amendments were made based on feedback from 977 individuals from more than 700 charities and IPCs, as well as 200 written responses from individuals and organisations between June and August this year.<br><br>The Code<br>The voluntary Code will affect about 1,900 charities here, and covers nine key areas, including board governance, conflict of interest, financial management, human resource policies, and fund-raising.<br><br>One key recommendation is that a charity's board be 'wholly' independent' from its executive management.<br><br>However, recognising that some charities may find it necessary to keep paid staff on the Board, the Code will allow it as long as they comprise not more than one-third of the Board.<br><br>While the Council has recommended that board members should not be paid a salary, it said those that do must declare their exact salary and remuneration package.<br><br>To better safeguard the charities financial interest, board members holding the treasurer's post should step down from the position after serving a maximum of four consecutive years.<br><br>The Code is also 'tiered' such that IPCs and bigger charities will have more stringent guidelines, as they handle larger amounts of charitable resources for the public benefit.<br><br>Working on the principle of 'comply or explain', charities and IPCs unable to adhere to certain Code guidelines will have to explain their non-compliance.<br><br>Charities and IPCs must submit a Code evaluation checklist to the appropriate sector administrators via the Charity Portal by March 31 next year.<br><br>All IPCs are to publicly disclose their extent of compliance by March 31, 2009.<br><br>The extent of their compliance will affect their application for renewal of its IPC status.<br><br></div>

              <p><strong>CAD called in to probe Ren Ci's finances</strong></p>
              <p>THE probe into Ren Ci Hospital's finances has taken a more serious turn, with Singapore's white-collar crime busters called in to look at questionable transactions in its books.</p>
              <p>The Buddhist charity, the second largest under the purview of the Ministry of Health (MOH), was unable to explain some of its deals satisfactorily, Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan told reporters yesterday.</p>
              <p>'There may be wrongdoing, there may not be. I do not know,' he said, urging patience while the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) does its work.'It is important to let the investigators do their job. Let's not speculate or jump to conclusions because that would not be fair to Ren Ci and the individuals involved.'</p>
              <p>
              
              He hoped that the CAD would complete its probe in 'a few weeks'. Officers from the agency carted off at least 20 boxes of documents from the charity's office in Buangkok View early yesterday.</p>
              <p>Ren Ci will continue caring for its 120 nursing-home patients and 300 chronically ill individuals.</p>
              <p>The charity and its chief, Buddhist monk Venerable Shi Ming Yi, have been facing questions for the past year, since the ministry started auditing the largest charities under its charge.</p>
              <p>Last February, the monk was told he could not hold the posts of chief executive and chairman concurrently as that was contrary to good corporate governance practices.</p>
              <p>Prominent businessman Chua Thian Poh, head of property developer Ho Bee Group, took over as chairman last September. Venerable Ming Yi became the honorary chief executive.</p>
              <p>Then, last November, the Health Ministry announced an inquiry into Ren Ci's finances, citing 'possible irregularities'.</p>
              <p>It did not give details, but it appeared Ren Ci had given interest-free loans to several companies, including a few Venerable Ming Yi had a share in.</p>
              <p>There were also discrepancies between what was loaned out in Ren Ci's accounts and what was reflected in the borrowers' books.</p>
              <p>Venerable Ming Yi, who is also abbot of the Foo Hai Ch'an Monastery in Geylang East, initially brushed away news of the probe, telling reporters that the shortfall in the charity's accounts amounted to no more than $200,000 to $300,000.</p>
              <p>But a ministry spokesman responded immediately, saying the issue was not the sum involved but the original transactions themselves.</p>
              <p>With the launch of investigations, Ren Ci lost the right to grant its supporters tax-exemption for donations.</p>
              <p>It was well known for its televised annual fund-raisers that featured stunts by Venerable Ming Yi and celebrities, which raked in millions of dollars.</p>
              <p>The shows have usually been held in January, but this year's has been postponed indefinitely.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, Mr Khaw noted that the charity will still have access to Government subsidies and its own reserves to fund its work.</p>
              <p>Its accumulated reserves of $33.5 million are enough to last six years. In 2006, it received $9 million in subsidies.</p>
              <p>Contacted yesterday, the charity's chairman, Mr Chua, told The Straits Times that he planned to improve the charity's 'credibility and sustainability' by bringing in new blood, among other things.</p>
              <p>He has roped in Mr Seah Moon Ming, president of Singapore Technologies Electronics, to head the committee on corporate governance, while Mr Tan Huay Lim, a partner with audit firm KPMG, now leads its audit committee.</p>
              <p>The charity still has its supporters. Before the Chinese New Year, businessman Oei Hong Leong donated $306,000 to cover sums owed by Bodhicherie Food, a company in which Venerable Ming Yi had a stake.</p>
              <p>It ran a vegetarian restaurant, which has since closed down.</p>

              <p><br>hmm. all man are fallen creatures.. even churches do have cases where some pastor or priest embezzled money and ran off. happened twice to my knowledge.</p>
              <p>but in the end, I guess its the heart condition. if i donate, i know my money's with God, He will use it. if it gets embezzled, God will judge righteously.</p>
              <p>if i don't donate. i won't feel condemned either. so its fine with me</p>
