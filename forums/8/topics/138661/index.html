They go to meetings and forced everyone to pray and they would say gospel and all that.. They would pray at least 15 minutes especially for projects.  These women are emotional, always angry, always taking their issues out on their subordinates.  Very hard to work with and for them and anytime they not happy, they make your life very miserable and they know it and do it with pleasure.  But then the place intro a angmoh man to run the IT dept later and all these old aunties - got oursourced to IBM (some still stay because of political manipluations - ie they save own jobs). So they move from one GLC to another...  there's not many major outsourcing to IBM that happened, I guess some would know which place I'm talking about..</div>
