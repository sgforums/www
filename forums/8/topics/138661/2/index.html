            <div class='col-md body'>From my work experience, women as bosses not so good. I always believe those wanna be my boss should be at least able to do the task that I am doing and that's why you are my boss rite? NO! In my line, those female only open mouth and discuss concepts and plans and when come to developing software implementation, they know nuts!!!! When there is some bug if I am on leave, they are held ransom. They dun know how to look at source code hence dunno how to debug.<br><br>Their style of living in the company is simple. Open mouth ask the top management release money so that they can go recruit ppl under them to do the development work for them. Wah cow such style to earn rice bowl I despise. Use mouth can already. Maybe besides ordering us, she uses her mouth for other purposes say to satisfy the male top management? Hahhahahaha.....<br><br>A boss who cannot do what a subordinate is doing is nothing.  Respect is to be earned and not demanded because of your rank.</div>

They go to meetings and forced everyone to pray and they would say gospel and all that.. They would pray at least 15 minutes especially for projects.  These women are emotional, always angry, always taking their issues out on their subordinates.  Very hard to work with and for them and anytime they not happy, they make your life very miserable and they know it and do it with pleasure.  But then the place intro a angmoh man to run the IT dept later and all these old aunties - got oursourced to IBM (some still stay because of political manipluations - ie they save own jobs). So they move from one GLC to another...  there's not many major outsourcing to IBM that happened, I guess some would know which place I'm talking about.. </div></blockquote>Ahh...gotta love self-righteous bigots that stuff their religion down everyones' throats. Let me guess, the company in question practiced the bone-headed (not sure about now)  policy of denying internet access at the workplace, ironic considering what sort of business its in.</div>

I dont think 'trying too hard' is a good way of handling it at all - but bigotry still exists and is very prevalent as in obvious here. And while in an ideal world, a perfect person can handle such pressures and stresses in a perfect way - in an imperfect world, most of us crumble and struggle.<br><br>I find it rather shocking to have someone's behaviour put down to 'oh cos she's a spinster', or 'oh cos she's divorced'. OR even worse, a more spiteful "she like this NO WONDER husband don't want her, NO WONDER cannot find husband"....<br><br>it really does imply that the existence of a husband is simply the MOST important thing that impacts on a woman's life without which she is a handicapped soul. It doesn't help that often its women that I've heard uttering the barbs. It's a sad day when we chop off another woman's wings in our attempts to be self righteous and judgemental.</div>
