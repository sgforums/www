            <div class='col-md body'>Move over Embassy pub... Here comes NTUC Club.. NTUC operates as a business not union as some assumed.. NOW, we know why sheng shiong is cheaper... so let's face it.. face the TRUTH that NTUC will not be the people's etc etc as proclaimed.. we need a union to help poor people.. WHERE IS IT ??<br><br>Stop living in denial.. we need to wake up.. FAST......<br><br>Former chic Esplanade nightspot to reopen on May 1 with significant changes<br>By Kelvin Wong<br><br>EMBASSY bar and restaurant, once the jewel of the nightlife scene here, will get a new, unlikely owner: NTUC Club.<br><br>CLEARED OUT: The signature glass floors and decor of the former Embassy bar and restaurant will make way for a new Zen and modern look. NTUC Club is spending about $1.2 million to redecorate the nightspot.<br>Advertisement<br><br>And when it reopens on May 1 - Labour Day - there will be more than a few changes.<br><br>The well-heeled crowd that thronged the Esplanade nightspot to see and be seen will likely be replaced by young trendsetters.<br><br>There will be a name change, and those signature see-through glass floors will be no more.<br><br>In its place will be a 'Zen, very modern' design, said NTUC Club's deputy chief executive, Mr Lim Eng Lee, in an attempt to break from the past.<br><br>'We want a clean slate. The glass floors were very Embassy.'<br><br>Other changes can be expected from a redecoration effort that will cost about $1.2 million.<br><br>Exactly what will be done is still being decided, but NTUC Club hopes that the new nightspot will give it what it is not commonly associated with: a hip quotient.<br><br>So, while older members of the labour movement are welcome to shake their hips on the dance floor, or relax at the second-level wine and cigar bar, the target is the yuppie crowd.<br><br>Another change: no more sky-high cover charges.<br><br>While no decision has been made on the cover charge yet, Mr Lim promised the price of drinks will be 'very affordable'.<br><br>National Trades Union Congress members are likely to get free entry to the club, which will be open to the public.<br><br>NTUC Club, the entertainment arm of the labour movement, inked a 4 1/2-year deal with sub-landlord Colours F&amp;B to lease the nightspot yesterday.<br><br>It hopes that the opening of the nightspot will boost NTUC Club's image and thus attract younger members to the labour movement.<br><br>Said Mr Chng Hee Kok, NTUC Club's chief executive officer: 'Over the last few years, we've tried to reposition ourselves, as the workforce gets younger, to attract younger members.'<br><br>Recent initiatives include the $65 million makeover of the then-NTUC Pasir Ris Resort to the current Downtown East, and the opening of water theme park Wild Wild Wet in June last year.<br><br>The union, which has about 450,000 members now, signs up about 5,000 each month. About 70 per cent are aged below 30. In 2001, this group made up 30 per cent of new members.<br><br>Labour Day was chosen for the new club's opening as it is 'an important part of the labour calendar'.<br><br>The club's reopening closes a sorry chapter in the Singapore nightlife scene. Embassy opened with a bang in November 2002 amid much hype and promise.<br><br>Billed as the most chic nightspot in town, it began defaulting on its rent and utilities bills barely a month after opening.<br><br>Eventually, it amassed debts of $1.13 million and shut with a whimper in May last year.<br><br>Though it has been lying empty since then, there has been a smattering of interest in it from several nightspot operators, including Devils Bar owner Dennis Foo.<br><br>A Colours F&amp;B spokesman said a deal was eventually struck with NTUC Club as it is 'an established name and a safe tenant'.<br><br>'We are trying to put in a club that will bring in the traffic. In terms of numbers, it has all its members. Who else in Singapore can do that?'<br><br>Conceding that the night entertainment business was a 'tough' one that has crippled even big names like Centro, NTUC Club's Mr Chng said: 'Money-making is not our main criterion. We hope to break even operationally.<br><br>'Our main role is to provide a social outlet for our members and the public.'<br><br>Other nightspot operators were also not too concerned about NTUC Club weighing in on their core business.<br><br>Zouk marketing manager Tracy Phillips said: 'The current nightlife scene has a lot of clubs and pubs appealing to a wide spectrum of people.<br><br>'NTUC Club, with its base of members, can bring something different to the scene.'<br><br></div>
