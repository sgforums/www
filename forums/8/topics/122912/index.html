He spends more time taking care of his children's needs bec there's some flexibility in his work schedule.  His wife is quite a high flyes, very committed to her work. The man tried to get her to work on the marriage initially. During their separation, the man starts spending time with a girl though, apparently, nothing naughty has transpired.

Joint custody isn't very much more than sole custody. It just let both parents decide on the important events of the said child. In making the decision for that, the judge would also look into whether both parents are on reasonably ok terms to make decisions together. If they're not, it's quite unlikely that the courts would want to settle disputes of such in the future rather than just calling for a sole custody.<br><br>I repeat. And as per the concern of most court decisions. Custody of child is for the sake and welfare of the said child. Often not taking into consideration the reason for separation unless it's critical to the child's safety and welfare. And BOTH SCIENCE and HISTORY have shown that mothers are often better care-takers. I can agree with you that women these days can be different. But by statistics, there're still more cases of children suffering (severely abused or neglected forms) under the father than with mother.<br><br>I would also agree with you that father can be better care-taker than mother in some cases of custody control. But the judges often have to deal with many cases. And they are not very familar with the parents other than per what is presented. To call for a sounder decision, they often would just land custody on the mother. Even when father might be better (or more 'idea' in a way if you wanna see in certain aspects?) as a care-taker, mother would often still at least take care of her own child to a certain extent.</strong></div>

Hardly worth paying a private investigator's fee, huh, unless you don't want to wait out the separation period? And continuing to live together after knowledge of the fact means you can't even use it to petition for divorce!<br><br>The other point that I find interesting is the "living apart" bit.  If the estranged spouses are having, say, Saturday dinners together at home as a family (with kids and grandparents) and they are sleeping in the same bedroom (but without relations), is this still seen as having separate lives?<br></div>
