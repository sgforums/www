            <div class='col-md body'><strong>THE FAN</strong><br><br>Looking at my fan spinning in a blur I realised that I am going through life like one.<br><br>Looking beyond that piece of machinery that attempts to cool me down with debatable results is a view through my window from the tenth story. A view of the concrete jungle that defines Singapore.<br><br>What caught my eye though, is a figure of the human female along the street. The morning sun rendered a translucent image of her figure through her skirt that fluttered in the cool morning breeze.  Ah, she's home. My love, my life, that's her.<br><br>Nevermind that she just alighted from a Beemer that belongs to her boyfriend. Nevermind that just moments prior to me seeing her, they were in the car planning the next rendezvous. At least she has come home to me, albeit with only her body; her heart belongs elsewhere.<br><br>She avoided my eyes as she walked past me at the front door. Just as well, my tears were impossible to hide. "Good morning", she managed, as she proceeded to the bedroom to prepare to lie on the bed I had just made. Maybe she'd like some hot chocolate, I wonder silently.<br><br>I put on my shoes, took a deep breath, and went to work.<br><br>The train is a little crowded tonight, I thought to myself on the way home. No, it's not the train. It's my thoughts. It's so crowded that it's blurred. I immediately remembered my fan. Well at least there's one thing it's good for.<br><br>I opened the front door while undoing my tie. She bought this tie for me. It's my favourite tie. Why is it my favourite tie? Because she bought it for me. Ah. The door is open. Might as well go in. Maybe I'll start counting the tiles on the floor instead of thinking so much.<br><br>I have always loved listening to the piano. She has always loved playing it. For me. After counting the third tile I realised the living room was filled with her piano playing. With each melodious note my heart quivered with anticipation. Was it my imagination again?<br><br>The baby grand hadn't been touched for what seemed like years. Actually it was only yesterday. What a long day I've had.<br><br>Indeed, she was playing with all the grace and emotion that would put angels to shame. She glanced over her shoulder as I laid my briefcase on the floor below our wedding photo. I refused to look at the photo just like I would refuse a blunt, serrated knife stabbing my heart.<br><br>I took my place next to her on the piano chair. She was wearing an old, tattered oversized t-shirt of mine, and nothing else. The stretched collar managed to fall off her left shoulder and revealed her collarbone sensuously. Her hair was in a beautifully messy tied back sort of way. A thick strand of hair had come loose and covered her face in a way that accentuated her flawless facial features.<br><br>Tentatively, I tucked that strand of hair behind her ear, and she turned instinctively. I backed off, but she smiled. Her eyes met mine for the first time that week, and like a single sunflower in an open grass field I saw in them her heart. It was here. That couldn't be, it wasn't there that morning.<br><br>Her heart spoke to me through her eyes. No words, just the sweet melodies from the baby grand through her delicate fingers. It was then I realised: <span style="font-style: italic;">she still loves me</span>.<br><br>That night I turned and faced my fan again. At least it knows the purpose for its existence...<br><br></div>

My fingertips<br>are branded with his name. He reads me<br>as a blind man does, with fingers and tongue;<br>his hands delve into the deepdown places,<br>the spaces between the ribs, melting the secret<br>emptinesses with the sweet solvency of touch.<br>He finds me in the chaos of myself,<br>and draws me into being.<br>And I am learning him, learning<br>the journey of him, the journey of the<br>cobbled spine and the contours of muscle,<br>of tongue and lips and teeth, of the old scars and<br>the steel-toed heart. His warmth winds around me<br>and his voice binds me with a whispered word.<br>I trace his veins to their fire source and<br>dissolve into them, and find the shape of him<br>in the heart of the flame.<br>He is the poem i travel.<br><br>-<br><br>I am the shell by the sea, hollow, emptied, quiet,<br>burnt by the sun, lipped by gentle waves, waiting<br>for him to fill me.<br><br>I am the leaf dancing on the broad blade of wind,<br>spiralling up to graze the stars and drifting back down<br>to alight on his hair.<br><br>I am the bowl he shapes, looks in, lifts to his lips;<br>I am the clear water rippling his reflection,<br>locked in his hands.<br><br>I melt into the inky darkness of his shadow<br>and sheltering in his strength redraw the outlines<br>of a curious grace.<br><br>I am the drop of rain just learning the storm,<br>drawing the curve of a snow-petalled flower,<br>shaping a clear peace.<br><br>-<br><br>My phantom lover in the deep black jazz night,<br>his ghost hands whispering down the strings<br>of the heart and playing them with the lightest touch,<br>drugging the dreams with rich saxophone notes<br>of deep longing, binding the soul, shivering down<br>the bones and infusing them with a mute cry,<br>a sudden ache of loneliness.<br><br>-<br><br>I want you to miss me when I'm not there-<br>I want you to watch after a disappearing back and wound<br>yourself on the sharp edges of an absence-<br>I want a sudden remembrance to flood your senses, to wake a<br>terrible longing under the skin, to slice into the heart and<br>leave you crying out on this side of the night-<br>I want your arms to ache with the emptiness, your hands to clutch<br>at forlorn air, your ears to ring with silences-<br>I want you to search the night and trace in the pattern of stars a<br>foetal hope, to listen for a breath of voice in the haunting<br>wind-<br>I want to haunt you, to lurk in the unknowing mind, to scorch<br>your fingertips with a remembered warmth-<br>I want you to eat fire for me-<br>I want you to want me too.<br><br>-<br><br>Love brute and beast, rubbing against you hungrily, hesitantly,<br>lapping at the salt of you, wrencing at your mouth-sweet-<br>ness.<br>Love a savage knowing, a shock of recognition ripped from you,<br>more than feeling and deeper than consciousness, rapped<br>into the frame of bone.<br>Love a clarity of blindness, exhilarating and frightening, a mirror<br>for a flawed vessel, an act of faith, forcing you to your knees.<br>Love an invisible circle binding you, anchoring your flight,<br>building you a homecoming.<br>Love a violence to shatter your peace.<br><br>-<br><br>Will you leave me here on the other side of the glass<br>with only a snatch of voice and the faint memory<br>of a fleeting touch to keep me?<br><br>-<br><br>We are one-winged angels just learning to fly,<br>riding the piercing sweetness of hope with a pair<br>of dreamer's wings, shaped of a song tender<br>and tremulous, soaring high into the clear night<br>and waking all the stars to dance, a great golden<br>shower of exuberant exquisite joy.<br>This is our time, this diamond night, the<br>bewitching hour, this dreamtime perfumed<br>with the sandman sleep, this velvet wilderness<br>of a wonderous grace; and these our hands<br>will find each other.<br><br>Koh Tsin Yen</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Colours<br><br>Rainbows again? Jackie, would you like to draw something else other than rainbows? Like your Mummy or Daddy?<br><br>But I am drawing my Mummy and Daddy, Miss Jones. Red is for Mummy's rosy cheeks. Orange is for the juice they drink every morning. Yellow is Daddy's favourite colour. Green is Mummy's favourite colour. (You should see her dresses, they are ALL green.) Blue is our colour because we are always so happy together, just like the sky is always blue. Mummy says the two shades of purple mean love. I love my Mummy and Daddy very much so this part of the rainbow is for them.<br><br>-<br><br>"You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are grey. You never know, dear, how much I love you. Please don't take my sunshine away."<br><br>Mummy, have you ironed Daddy's yellow shirt? Yellow really looks good with the blue sky, you know. Mummy, what does it mean when the song goes "when skies are grey?" The sky always looks blue to me. Oh, like during a storm, when there is rain, lightning, thunder and everything? Are you sure? But the sky would still be blue to me because Mummy and Daddy would be there to tuck me into bed and hug me till I fall asleep.<br><br>When is Daddy coming home? He is taking us to the beach, right? His yellow shirt is waiting for him. So am I. Maybe if I think hard enough, Daddy will appear right at the door. Daddy come home, Daddy come home, Daddy come home ... the phone is ringing, lemme get it, lemme get it! Hello? Okay ... Mummy! The call is for you! Now where did I stop? Daddy come home, Daddy come home....<br><br>Mummy get ready, Daddy should be home any minute. Mummy? How come your face is so white? Your cheeks are not read anymore. Mummy, please don't make me scared. Daddy, where are you? Daddy, come back ... please!<br><br>-<br><br>One, two, three, four ... twenty-two. Twenty-two people all in black. This is the first time I have really seen a grey sky. Neither green grass nor a long, brown box with Daddy in it look good with a grey sky. It doesn't matter, Daddy. When the sky turns blue again, I will wake you up with my beariest hug and wettest kiss! Deal! I wanted to wear a purple dress today but Mummy wouldn't let me. Mummy's face is still white and guess what? Mummy does not look good in black. I have never seen Mummy crying before. I want my happy, smiling Mummy back, with her rosy cheeks and wearing her green dress.<br><br>-<br><br>Mummy, where is Daddy? I haven't seen him for a long time. I want to show him my new drawing. Yes, I know there is a place up in the sky called heaven. (It must be a real fun place if it's blue in colour). He's there? Then, why didn't he bring me along? Because it's not the right time? What does that mean? But Daddy can see me? From way up there? So if I show him my picture, he can see it! Here goes, Daddy! Wow! Did you see that? The sky turned bluer! (Sorry, no such word). He saw it! He saw it! And he likes it, I'm sure. Oh no, but I need Daddy to help me in my homework. How am I going to do it now? He can help me from there? Oh ... he can do anything in heaven. Why are you coughing so badly, Mummy? Are you okay? I'll ask Daddy to make you better. He can do ANYTHING. So you won't have to lead me across the railway track to school every morning, then you can rest at home. Daddy can do that now. Don't cough so much, Mummy.<br><br>-<br><br>Don't worry, Mummy. Daddy will get you out of the hospital soon. I'll bring you some juice so your cheeks will be rosy again. Do eat something. You haven't had anything all day. It must be real awful to have tubes sticking all over your body. Eat, or you will be skinny and you won't fit into the green dresses you love so much. Daddy, I'm sure you can hear me. Do something to help Mummy quick.<br><br>-<br><br>I gotta go to heaven myself so I can help Mummy. But I don't know how to get there. Miss Jones said you have to die or something, but what does that mean? Another kid told me that a long time ago someone just lay down on the railway track and finally got to heaven. Maybe I can do that. Oh goodee! I can hear the train coming already. Just wait a little longer, Mummy, and all three of us will be together again. Look! A rainbow!<br><br>I'll be in heaven ... real soon.<br><br>Chan Lai Gwen</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alien Stars<br><br>She sees him across the discotheque, looking at her with eyes of dark fire. She smiles at him, beckoning. He sets down his drink, walks across the dance-floor, glides across with the fluid feline grace of a young panther.<br><br>"Hello," he says coolly. A faker like the rest, she thinks. "Why are you alone?" "Why not?" she replies just as coolly. "Why should anyone be alone," he says. Makes it sound like a statement. But a statement of what?<br><br>She laughs it off. Takes a sip from her can of beer. His eyes never leave hers. She feels herself falling into those dark eyes. Drowning in the hidden fire she sees there. Haunted, she thinks. There are demons in his eyes. Yet she cannot see the same darkness reflected in herself, in the music, in the restless shadows of the flashing neon lights. She cannot see his face clearly.<br><br>"Shall we dance?" he asks, peering into her face. And by this she knows that he cannot see her clearly either. But it is just fine, she thinks. No one wants to see the truth anyway. Images and life on the surface are all that matter. Why bother with the myriad intricacies of the heart and its obscure trafficking? Why open oneself to unnecessary pain? Because, just because, her treacherous heart whispers. She quickly silences it. Love does not exist, she tells herself. And it is always easier to live without hope. Foolish dreams of what might be only raise you up to fling you back to the ground. Only darkness without. Only darkness within. And her heart cries out at her betrayal. But betrayal haunts every soul.<br><br>"Well?" He looks at her expectantly. "Alright." They move to the dance-floor together. Dancing, she watches him. Admires the ease with which he moves his body. And the neon stars of the discotheque shine in their false night.<br><br>The song changes suddenly. It is a love-song now. On no, she thinks, she hates love-songs. Maudlin meaningless lyrics set to the sound of some soft heart breaking. He holds out his arms to her and she goes into them. Both moving slowly, closely together now. His eyes never leave hers. Funny, she thinks. What colour are they? She cannot see clearly. They seem so dark, yet so...colourless. Like pools of conscious and unconscious memory. Swirling darkness. Indiscernible. Indescribable.<br><br>He leans close to her. Lips almost touching her ear. Above the noise of the people and music, she hears him say, "Who are you?" "What?" She blinks in surprise, draws away from him, he looks at her bemusedly. "I said, who are you?" "What do you mean?" she asks unsurely. "I am tired, stranger. Tired of all the poses, all the cowardly games people play. For once, I would like to be myself. So I am offering you this deal now: for one night, just for one night, we will take away the masks which conceal our souls. And at the end of it all, we will part. As strangers. But just for once, we see what we truly are within." She hears the weariness in his voice. Sees his eyes light up with an unknown passion. And she cannot help but be attracted to his wild idea. "What will happen?" she asks cautiously. "Who knows?" He smiles casually. "In any case, secrets are better off with strangers, right?" She nods in agreement. Secrets are always safe with strangers. Because they do now know you, they cannot betray you. Simple rules of the game. "Okay," she says. "Let's go someplace else." So they walk away from the music. Walk away from the neon strobe lights. Into the darkness of a night lit by alien stars and a stranger moon.<br><br>There is a park a little distance away from the discotheque. They walk there, hand-in-hand. She sits on the swing, shivering slightly in the cool night air. He stands behind her and she leans back against him. Drawing warmth from him. A gentle breeze blows upon them. High above, cold stars shine brightly.<br><br>"Look up there. In the tree." he says. She looks and sees nothing. Suddenly, a pair of liquid yellow eyes flash. She sees it. A strange-looking bird. An ugly, monstrous bird. With the most mournful ewel eyes. "It's ugly..." she starts to say. "Hush." They stare silently at the bird. It begins to sing. A haunting song of painful sadness.<br><br>He leans over and speaks low into her ear. "When I was young, my father used to tell me stories of this bird. We would sit under the tree at night and listen to it sing. For it is only at night when this bird sings. My father told me once, that this bird sings its songs for us. Because we humans have forsaken truth and chosen darkness. So the bird sings of all the wasted desires, all the abandoned hopes that arose from our choice. All of man's foolish pride and conceited loneliness. It sings to us what we could have been. What we chose to be instead. And its yellow glass-bright eyes burn to remind us the day we stopped seeing, of the night we stopped dreaming."<br><br>It cannot be so, she thinks. Such inexpressible yearning. Such hopelessness. Yet the song sounds familiar. Then she feels the cold pour into her. Within the song she hears the cry of a human child. The cry of the baby she gave away. Her baby, it cannot be. She whimpers, suddenly afraid. Nestles closer to him. Tries to hide from herself. And in its tongue, the bird continues to sing its human song.<br><br>"Are you alright?" he asks her worriedly. She is shaking so badly. He holds her in his arms. "What's the matter?" "My baby, my baby." She is lost in her thoughts. "Baby?" he asks, puzzled. "When I was seventeen, I had a baby. A dear, sweet child. But I was a child too, and they would not let me keep him. Told me that I could never be a good mother. Fool that I was, I believed them. I was afraid. So I gave my child away. I gave away my baby with my own hands." She starts crying. "I wanted to keep him. I really did. But what was I to do when no one would help me? I miss him. So many times in the night I wake up dreaming of his fragile warmth. He needed me as no one else did. And I love him, because he is mine. But he can never me mine now.<br><br>Maybe the problem is with us humans is not so much as not loving, but having so much love and no one to give it to. He was a little life who needed me. And for once, I felt my life was worth more than trash. That I actually had a purpose for living. Then I gave him away, and with it, gave away my own soul. Why? He was the core of my happiness, the one thing that saved me from what I was. From what I am now. And nothing can save me now.<br><br>So many times I stand alone in the night with my knife on my wrist. Wanting so badly for the intolerable darkness to end. So many times I stand alone in the moonlight dreaming of blood and dark salvation. Pain ends with death, does it not?" She laughs to herself. Tears in her eyes. There is bitterness in her mouth, in her heart, in her being.<br><br>He holds her close and starts to speak. "When I was young, I used to think that nothing could ever hurt me, nothing could destroy me within. That was when my father was still alive. He loved me so very much. Protected me from every pain. There was this inner core of peace within him that was untouchable. And when I was with him, it was as though that serenity had transferred into my very own being. Of course, I did not know it as such then. All I knew was that my father loved me and I was happy. We used to play along the edge of the sea, running away from the blue-white waves even as we dared them to touch us with their cool fingers. And at night, my father would hold me in his arms and rock me gently to sleep, telling me softly of stars and worlds so beautiful they were beyond comprehension. Then one day, he killed himself. My father put me to sleep then killed himself. I was nine years old them, felt so lost, so betrayed. He used to speak to me love, and life, and how it is worth more than anything in the world. Yet he took his own life. And with that one single act, destroyed all that I was. He made false what he had taught me as truth before. Everything I knew, everything I loved turned to dust. White ashes of a stolen soul.<br><br>The first few months after his death, I would wake up crying in the night, calling out his name. But only darkness heard my pain, only darkness answered my calls. Slowly, gradually, I stopped crying. Stopped waking up in the middle of the night dreaming of his warm laughter. I could feel the darkness seeping into me. But I could not stop it. I did not want to stop it. So the darkness took away my soul. Leaving the empty shell of my being with dust within. You see me here standing before you, wild child with a face of an angel, with a cavern for a soul. Just an innocent with innocence betrayed, that is all I am."<br><br>He bows his head. She turns around to face him and gently makes him look at her. Brushes his hair away from his face. Sees those dark eyes haunted by nameless ghosts. "So please, girl. Don't kill yourself. Because the life you destroy will not be your own." There is so much sadness in his voice. "So we have to live on then, if we do not die." "Why?" he asks, trembling like a little boy betrayed. So much pain in him. It hurts even her. And she has no answer. "Hush, baby," she says, gathering him into her arms. "Hush, it will be alright. We will be alright." She holds him close to her. This stranger without a name. Clumsily, tenderly tries to comfort him in her darkness. He hugs her so tightly in return. She cannot breathe. And she feels herself dying in their pain.<br><br>"Look at the stars." she says, trying to distract him. Trying to distract herself from drowning. "Stars?" he asks, eyes gleaming with the dark light of despair. "I used to love them. My father once told me that stars were loves, hopes, dreams of mankind; symbols of life and living. I actually believed him." He starts laughing desperately. "Don't, please." She tries to stop him. But he will not stop. "I grew up and realised that they were merely pieces of rock in the sky. Stars? They are false. Just like everything else. 'Find comfort in the stars, in the night,' my father told me. He was a liar. There is not comfort to be found in stars. Stupid rocks with their foolish pride. Not knowing that they are but a reflection of the true sun. And the sun burns. It burns and consumes everything in its passion. And I am burnt by this proud sun, frozen by dreamless stars. So where do I belong then? Nowhere. I am nothing but a fool, an outcast. I have no home, no truth. I belong to nothing. I am nothing." He laughs even harder. The cold truth of his words pierce her soul like a knife through a lily. Shattering what is left of her. And the lily starts to bleed. She feels a darkness descend upon her being, as she thinks of her life and all that it has been. It is true, she thinks. We are nothing. Nothing to the world or to anyone. Two outcasts in an alien world, that is all we are. And she feels the stars whisper down mockingly. And she feels the stars pour their scorn into her burning ears. You are nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing. She feels an irresistible urge to join in his mad laughter. Don't, her heart tells her softly. Walk away from this madness. She fights desperately within herself. While the stranger within her arms laughs, and finds relief at last in his despair.<br><br>"Stars? False fire. Hope? Illusion. Dreams? Imagination. That is all life is. A parody, misplaced faith." His words destroy her. She feels her heart take its final breath as all her beliefs shatter. As she feels the laughter welling up within her. Starts to join him in the madness. Starts to laugh even as she starts to cry. Two strangers laughing wildly in each other's arms. Laughing wildly as tears blind their eyes. And high above the alien stars shine, their light, cold.<br><br>Edlyn Ang</div>
