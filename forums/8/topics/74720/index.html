I'm a law-abiding person most of the time. Laws are there for a reason and they make sense most of the time. Like how banning chewing gum is to ensure public hygiene. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

U should do so because it is the right thing to do.<br><br>I've seen so many incidents whereby people have to be sent to the hospital because drivers speed and then get into accidents. I believe that if they have obeyed the road traffic rules (most normal 3-lane speed limit is 50km/h in Singapore), they will have been more able to react in time (remember the Traffic Police advertisement?)<br><br>This is for drivers but pedestrians should also refrain from jaywalking. I've also seen pedestrians WALK across busy roads forcing oncoming traffic to avoid or slow down. And it's sickening that their expression is like, "don't give a damn"...</div>

When was that? Which police centre u went to?<br><br>As for cat stuck on a tree, u should call Singapore Civil Defence Force, not the police. Police officers are never trained in climbing and do not have any equipment to help in climbing trees. As for police often saying that many of our problems are not their duty, they are right. There are many government departments handling all the different sorts of problems in Singapore. The relevant department to call if your upstairs neighbour's clothes are dripping onto yours or they are causing noise through renovation works is HDB. If someone's dog has been urinating in front of your unit, u should call Town Council. Police will only handle stray animals if they are dangerous and are likely to endanger lives; otherwise u should contact SPCA. And so on...<br><br>People keep calling police because their telephone numbers or locations are convenient, and these people do not want to be bothered looking through the phone book for the relevant department. The Singapore Police Force's duties are primarily law enforcement. It published a small handbook for residents a couple of years ago regarding which department to call if u are facing certain problems; don't know if they are still in circulation. If u drop by a police centre, can see if there are still any copies left.</div>
