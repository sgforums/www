            <div class='col-md body'>some people study study and study...but they really have no idea why they are studying...<br><br>For me, i didnt study during my primary, secondary, or JC days...i am just a lucky SOB that manage to scrap through all the time..It's only when i failed by pilot course in NS when i really 'woke' up..<br><br>It's amazing what the impact is like when a man loses his ambition, his driving force. Trust me, its way more painful than losing a gf of 5 years.<br><br>During my first sem in NTU, i told myself i wanted to be a mugger. Mug and mug, and try to beat the foreign contingent..Sure i did fine in the exams, but I realise its the wrong way to study. I don't want my future employer to laugh behind my back saying that I am just good at memorising, and when it comes to practical applications, NTU grads are just a bunch of crap..<br><br>That thought forced me to changed my way of studying. Of course, memorising is still part and parcel of education, but if you realli try to understand the concept, it tends to stick in your head longer too!  Also, if your fundamental concepts is solid, no matter how your teachers twist and turn the questions, you'll still be able to solve.<br><br>I also realise you have to accept reality. They are so many smart people in school, no matter how hard you study, its still practically impossible to beat them. Its like...you gota read the notes 3 times to fully understand whats going on, but there will be some that just need to read it once to get the gist of whats going on.<br><br>My point is, set yourself an attainable target. If you think you can score a B, than aim to score A. Aim for the sky, you'll drop on the tree. Aim for the tree, you'll end up on the ground.<br><br>I am a firm believer in this principle. Its not necessary to compare with others. There will always be people better and worse than you. Its more worthwhile trying to prove your own potential to yourself. Even if you don't suceed, you cannot lose heart, cause its already your best effort. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
