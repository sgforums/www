            <div class='col-md body'>Recently the father of physics made a visit to earth to watch a movie. He watched a few Tamil movies and had his head spinning. He was convinced that all his logics and laws in physics were just a huge pile of junk and apologised for everything he had done. In the movie of Vijayakanth, Newton was confused to such an extent that he went paranoid. Here are a few scenes:<br><br>1) Vijayakanth has a Brain Tumor which, according to the doctors can't be cured and his death is imminent. In one of the fights, our great Vijayakanth is shot in the head. To everybody's surprise, the bullet passes through his ears taking away the tumor along with it and he is cured. Long Live Vijayakanth.<br><br>2) In one of the movies, Vijayakanth is confronted with 3 gangsters.<br>Vijayakanth has a gun but unfortunately only one bullet. Guess, what he does....... He holds a knife in his hand and throws at the middle gangster.. &amp; shoots the bullet towards the knife. The knife cuts the bullet into 2 pieces and kills both the gangsters on each side of the middle gangster &amp; the knife kill the middle one ....<br><br>3) Vijayakanth is chased by a gangster. Vijayakanth has a revolver but he got no bullets in it. Guess, what he does. Nah not even in your remotest imaginations. He waits for the gangster to shoot. As soon as the gangster shoots, Vijayakanth opens the bullet compartment of his revolver and catches the bullet. Then, he closes the bullet compartment and fires his gun. Bang... And the gangster dies....<br><br>This was too much for our Newton to take and he was completely shaken and he decided to go back. But he happened to see a movie for one last time and thought that atleast one movie will follow his theory of physics. The whole movies goes fine and newton is happy that all in the world hasn't changed. Oops not so fast. The climax finally arrives.<br><br>Vijayakanth gets to know that the villian is on the the other<br>side of a very high wall. So high that Vijayakanth can't jump<br>even if he tries like one of those superman techniques that<br>our heroes normally use. Vijayakanth has to desperately<br>kill the villian because it's the climax.<br><br>Newton is smiling since it is virtually impossible. But then,<br>Vijayakanth suddenly pulls two guns out from his pocket (probably a backup). He throws one in the air and when the gun has reached the height of the wall,he shoots at the trigger of the first gun in air, with his second gun. Now the first gun fires off and the villian dies again.<br><br>That was the last straw for Newton...<br><br></div>
