            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, found this in my e-mail and decided to chunk it here...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>&gt;Keeping a Relationship<br>&gt;<br>&gt;It's best to wait for the one you want than settle for the one available.<br>&gt;Best to wait for the one you love than one who's around.<br>&gt;Best to wait for the right one because life's too short to be wasted on just<br>&gt;<br>&gt;someone.<br>&gt;An African proverb states, "Before you get married, keep both eyes open, and<br>&gt;<br>&gt;after you marry, close one eye." Before you get involved and make a<br>&gt;commitment to someone, don't let lust, desperation, immaturity,<br>&gt;ignorance, pressure from others or a low self-esteem make you blind to<br>&gt;warning signs.<br>&gt;Keep your eyes open, and don't fool yourself that you can change someone or<br>&gt;that what you see as faults aren't really that important. Once you decide to<br>&gt;<br>&gt;commit to someone, over time, their flaws, vulnerabilities, pet peeves, and<br>&gt;differences will become more obvious. If you love your mate and want the<br>&gt;relationship to grow and evolve, you've got to learn how to close one eye<br>&gt;and not let every little thing bother you.<br>&gt;You and your mate have many different expectations, emotional needs, values,<br>&gt;<br>&gt;dreams, weaknesses, and strengths. You are two unique individual children of<br>&gt;<br>&gt;God who have decided to share a life together. Neither one of you are<br>&gt;perfect, but are you perfect for each other? Do you bring out the best in<br>&gt;each other?<br>&gt;Do you compliment and compromise with each other, or do you compete,<br>&gt;compare and control?<br>&gt;What do you bring to the relationship? Do you bring past relationships,<br>&gt;past hurt, past mistrust, past pain? You can't take someone to the altar to<br>&gt;alter them. You can't make someone love you or make someone stay. If you<br>&gt;develop self-esteem, spiritual discernment, and "a life" you won't find<br>&gt;yourself making someone else responsible for your happiness or responsible<br>&gt;for your pain.<br>&gt;Manipulation, control, jealousy, neediness, and selfishness are not the<br>&gt;ingredients of a thriving, healthy, loving and lasting relationship.<br>&gt;Seeking status, sex, and security are the wrong reasons to be in a<br>&gt;relationship.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;What keeps a relationship strong?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;*communication<br>&gt;*intimacy<br>&gt;*a sense of humor<br>&gt;*sharing household tasks<br>&gt;*some getaway time without business or children<br>&gt;*daily exchanges (a meal, shared activity, a hug, a call, a touch, a<br>&gt;note)<br>&gt;*sharing common goals and interests<br>&gt;*giving each other space to grow without feeling insecure<br>&gt;*giving each other a sense of belonging and assurances of commitment<br>&gt;<br>&gt;If these qualities are missing, the relationship will erode as<br>&gt;resentment, withdrawal, abuse, neglect, dishonesty and pain replace the<br>&gt;passion.<br>&gt;"AS LONG AS WE HAVE MEMORIES, YESTERDAY REMAINS. AS LONG AS WE HAVE HOPE,<br>&gt;TOMORROW AWAITS. AS LONG AS WE HAVE FRIENDSHIP, TODAY IS BEAUTIFUL."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Love is when you take away the feeling, the passion, and the romance in a<br>&gt;relationship and find out that you still care for that person.<br>&gt;</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>a friend of mine send mi this...bout guys.....veri usefull n true n intersting.....<br><br>1. Guys don't actually go after good-looking girls. They prefer neat<br>and presentable girls.<br><br>2. Guys hate flirts.<br><br>3. A guy can like you for a minute, and then forget you afterwards.<br><br>4. When a guy says he doesn't understand you, it simply means you're<br>not thinking the way he is.<br><br>5. "Are you doing something?" or "Have you eaten already?" are the<br>first usual questions a guy asks on the phone just<br>to get out from stammering.<br><br>6. Guys may be flirting around all day but before they go to sleep,<br>they always think about the girl they truly care about.<br><br>7. When a guy really likes you, he'll disregard all your bad<br>characteristics.<br><br>8. Guys go crazy over a girl's smile.<br><br>9. Guys will do anything just to get the girl's attention.<br><br>10. Guys hate it when you talk about your ex-boyfriend.<br><br>11. When guys want to meet your parents. Let them.<br><br>12. Guys want to tell you many things but they can't. And they sure<br>have one habit to gain courage and spirit to tell you many things and it<br>is drinking!<br><br>13. Guys cry!!!<br><br>14. Don't provoke the guy to heat up. Believe me. He will.<br><br>15. Guys can never dream and hope too much.<br><br>16. Guys usually try hard to get the girl who has dumped them, and this<br>makes it harder for them to accept their defeat.<br><br>17. When you touch a guy's heart, there's no turning back.<br><br>18. Giving a guy a hanging message like "You know what?!..uh...never<br>mind!" would make him jump to a conclusion that is far from what you are<br>thinking.<br><br>19. Guys go crazy when girls touch their hands.<br><br>20. Guys are good flatterers when courting but they usually stammer<br>when they talk to a girl they really like.<br><br>21. When a guy makes a prolonged "umm" or makes any excuses when you're<br>asking him to do you a favor, he's actually saying that he doesn't like<br>you and he can't lay down the card for you.<br><br>22. When a girl says "no", a guy hears it as "try again tomorrow."<br><br>23. You have to tell a guy what you really want before he gets the<br>message clearly.<br><br>24. Guys hate gays!<br><br>25. Guys love their moms.<br><br>26. A guy would sacrifice his money for lunch just to get you a couple<br>of roses.<br><br>27. A guy often thinks about the girl who likes him. But this doesn't<br>mean that the guy likes her.<br><br>28. You can never understand him unless you listen to him.<br><br>29. If a guy tells you he loves you once in a lifetime. He does.<br><br>30. Beware. Guys can make gossips scatter through half of the face of<br>the earth faster than girls can.<br><br>31. Like Eve, girls are guys' weaknesses.<br><br>32. Guys are very open about themselves.<br><br>33. It's good to test a guy first before you believe him. But don't let<br>him wait that long.<br><br>34. No guy is bad when he is courting<br><br>35. Guys hate it when their clothes get dirty. Even a small dot.<br><br>36. Guys really admire girls that they like even if they're not that<br>much pretty.<br><br>37. Your best friend, whom your boyfriend seeks help from about his<br>problems with you may end up being admired by your boyfriend.<br><br>38. If a guy tells you about his problems, he just needs someone to<br>listen to him. You don't need to give advice.<br><br>39. A usual act that proves that the guy likes you is when he teases<br>you.<br><br>40. A guy finds ways to keep you off from linking with someone else.<br><br>41. Guys love girls with brains more than girls in miniskirts.<br><br>42. Guys try to find the stuffed toy a girl wants but would unluckily<br>get the wrong one.<br><br>43. Guys virtually brag about anything.<br><br>44. Guys cannot keep secrets that girls tell them.<br><br>45. Guys think too much.<br><br>46. Guys' fantasies are unlimited.<br><br>47. Girls' height doesn't really matter to a guy but her weight does!<br><br>48. Guys tend to get serious with their relationship and become too<br>possessive. So watch out girls!!!<br><br>49. When a girl makes the boy suffer during courtship, it would be hard<br>for him to let go of that girl.<br><br>50. It's not easy for a guy to let go of his girlfriend after they<br>broke up especially when they've been together for 3 years or more.<br><br>51. You have to tell a guy what you really want before getting involved<br>with that guy.<br><br>52. A guy has to experience rejection, because if he's<br>too-good-never-been-busted, never been in love and hurt, he won't be matured and grow<br>up.<br><br>53. When an unlikable circumstance comes, guys blame themselves a lot<br>more than girls do. They could even hurt themselves physically.<br><br>54. Guys have strong passion to change but have weak will power.<br><br>55. Guys are tigers in their peer groups but become tamed pussycats<br>with their girlfriends.<br><br>56. When a guy pretends to be calm, check if he's sweating. You'll<br>probably see that he is nervous.<br><br>57. When a guy says he is going crazy about the girl. He really is.<br><br>58. When a guy asks you to leave him alone, he's just actually saying,<br>"Please come and listen to me"<br><br>59. Guys don't really have final decisions.<br><br>60. When a guy loves you, bring out the best in him.<br><br>61. If a guy starts to talk seriously, listen to him.<br><br>62. If a guy has been kept shut or silent, say something.<br><br>63. Guys believe that there's no such thing as love at first sight, but<br>court the girls anyway and then realize at the end that he is wrong.<br><br>64. Guys like femininity not feebleness.<br><br>65. Guys don't like girls who punch harder than they do.<br><br>66. A guy may instantly know if the girl likes him but can never be<br>sure unless the girl tells him.<br><br>67. A guy would waste his time over video games and basketball, the way<br>a girl would do over her romance novels and make-ups.<br><br>68. Guys love girls who can cook or bake.<br><br>69. Guys like girls who are like their moms. No kidding!<br><br>70. A guy has more problems than you can see with your naked eyes.<br><br>71. A guy's friend knows everything about him. Use this to your<br>advantage.<br><br>72. Don't be a snob. Guys may easily give up on the first sign of<br>rejection.<br><br>73. Don't be biased. Try loving a guy without prejudice and you'll be<br>surprised.<br><br>74. Girls who bathe in their eau de perfumes do more repelling than<br>attracting guys.<br><br>75. Guys are more talkative than girls are especially when the topic is<br>about girls.<br><br>76. Guys don't comprehend the statement "Get lost" too well.<br><br>77. Guys really think that girls are strange and have unpredictable<br>decisions but still love them more.<br><br>78. When a guy gives a crooked or pretentious grin at your jokes, he<br>finds them offending and he just tried to be polite.<br><br>79. Guys don't care about how shiny their shoes are unlike girls.<br><br>80. Guys tend to generalize about girls but once they get to know them,<br>they'll realize they're wrong.<br><br>81. Any guy can handle his problems all by his own. He's just too<br>stubborn to deal with it.<br><br>82. Guys find it so objectionable when a girl swears.<br><br>83. Guys' weakest point is at the knee.<br><br>84. When a problem arises, a guy usually keeps himself cool but is<br>already thinking of a way out.<br><br>85. When a guy is conscious of his looks, it shows he is not good at<br>fixing things.<br><br>86. When a guy looks at you, either he's amazed of you or he's<br>criticizing you.<br><br>87. When you catch him cheating on you and he asks for a second chance,<br>give it to him. But when you catch him again and he asks for another<br>chance, ignore him.<br><br>88. If a guy lets you go, he really loves you.<br><br>89. If you have a boyfriend, and your boy best friend always glances at<br>you and it obviously shows that he is jealous whenever you're with your<br>boyfriend, all I can say is your boy best friend loves you more than<br>your boyfriend does.<br><br>90. Guys learn from experience not from the romance books that girls<br>read and take as their basis of experience.<br><br>91. You can tell if a guy is really hurt or in pain when he cries in<br>front of you!<br><br>92. If a guy suddenly asks you for a date, ask him first why.<br><br>93. When a guy says he can't sleep if he doesn't hear your voice even<br>just for one night, hang up. He also tells that to another girl. He only<br>flatters you and sometimes makes fun of you.<br><br>94. You can truly say that a guy has good intentions if you see him<br>praying sometimes.<br><br>95. Guys seek for advice not from a guy but from a girl.<br><br>96. Girls are allowed to touch boys' things. Not their hair!<br><br>97. If a guy says you're beautiful, that guy likes you.<br><br>98. Guys hate girls who overreact.<br><br>99. Guys love you more than you love them if they are serious in your<br>relationships<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Once read a book with a saying that goes something like this... To love someone is to love him for who he is in the past, present and future. However, to be in love with someone means you love the person for who he is right now. The thought of perfecting that someone with your ideals is associated with in love with someone.<br><br>Personally, I agree with the above saying. How many of us can actually love someone without strings attached or promise to continue to love that someone if he/she becomes a totally changed person one day? I guess that's why people always say true love is hard to come by and never runs smooth.<br><br>Love should not involve feelings alone but love requires actions too. However, it seems, more often than not, that couples broke off because feelings between the two parties died off. (A bit sad) To love someone unconditionally requires courage, patience and perseverence  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  Hope we can all find ours soon  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

To love someone is to love him for who he is in the past, present and future. However, to be in love with someone means you love the person for who he is right now. The thought of perfecting that someone with your ideals is associated with in love with someone.<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">hmmm....."To love someone is to love him for who he is in the past, present and future"...seems like my love quote?!?! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>No doubt, we all have this idealism within us to attain perfection in the one we love.....to give it a second thought.....is it rite? do u love me for who i am...OR....love the one u've created in me? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </span><br><br>Personally, I agree with the above saying. How many of us can actually love someone without strings attached or promise to continue to love that someone if he/she becomes a totally changed person one day? I guess that's why people always say true love is hard to come by and never runs smooth.<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">It's hard, i agree. However, if u will love a person for who he is in the past, present or future.....changes in him will be the developments, growth or maturity evident in bringing him to his future. </span>[<span style="color: red;">i]<span class="large">To love someone....walk his past.....accompany his present....visualize his future......finally, accomplish together. </span>[/i]</span><br><br>Love should not involve feelings alone but love requires actions too. However, it seems, more often than not, that couples broke off because feelings between the two parties died off.
