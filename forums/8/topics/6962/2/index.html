            <div class='col-md body'>well, i been thru NS with my relationship intact and i feel that for couples to work out this period of time, communication and effort is needed.<br>I do know that during these darkess days of NS, having a girlfriends makes all the difference. I can only imagine too well booking out on a weekend and going back alone, to ur darkened room at home, sleeping the night away till next hour to book in.<br>"Cheong"??? How much can u cheong, every weekend meh??? Unless u super on, if not,having ur loved ones besides u is better than out drinking and partying.<br>Sometimes, girls need to understand that guys became so "on" for partying with army friends could be due to the socializing factor. I used to have a bunk mate who will shun such things, having outings with us platoon mates. Needless to say, he wasn't very popular and tends to be viewed with suspicion. Boliao i got to admit, but that's army life, can't afford to be too outlandish, unless u officer lah.<br>Well, basically, divide ur time as fairly as possible. Trust ur girlfriend and most impt. of all, don't bored her with army tales and sorrow...she got her own problems and there;s nothing worse than telling her ur boring and boliao stuff!!<br>And yeah, effort. I know, it's so easy to sleep ur Sat and Sun away...do muster that last ounce of energy and try going her with her lah. At most u sleep in the show lor, spending $8 a week for sleep and bonding with ur girl is worth it mah. hahaha, u guys go think about it lah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok,all! Let me put this topic into another perspective. I was told that army guys cannot be trusted cos most of them fool around even though they are attached (girlfriend/married).  This can be confirm by those party goes,esp girls who have encounter it before! Any comment??<br><br>This in turns let people believes that all these soldiers are on the same shelves and cannot be trusted or at least not 100%. How true is this??<br><br>[This message has been edited by newwe (edited 18 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi newwe.. i guess wat u've heard might be true, coz that's wat happened to my fren... she suddenly called me one day crying saying that she's feeling very vexed..<br><br>she just broke up wif her ex not too long b4 he was enlisted... although she did hated him for dumping her at first, that hatred didn't last coz she really did love him very much, and they were very intimate (get what i mean?)... so even after they broke up, they tried to remain plainly as frenz.. however, they eventually ended up having sex again, and quite frequently... she was thinking if they made love long enuff, he'll take her back eventually...<br><br>however, things did not happen the way she wanted... the guy found a new gf... at first she was kept in the dark, she didn't realise that he was attached... finally one day, she saw a neoprint of them together... when she asked him, he told her that he was already attached for abt 1-2 mths, and he nvr told her, and still had sex wif my fren... even till now, he still calls her up and asking her for sex during the wkends when he's out of camp...<br><br>my fren's not that strong and smart enuff to reject that guy totally... and she doesn't know wat to do right now... and the bastard is also having sex wif his gf!!!<br><br>and now all i can tell her is to reject his calls... wat is the world coming to??? are those guys bastards or bastards??<br><br>------------------<br>if love was a choice, who would ever choose such<br>exquisite pain?<br><br>----Anna and the King----</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now fellows, from all the replies I've seen, it seems like a few r making some sort of sweeping comments: It's the guys fault..it's the ger's fault..... Hey, let's not let a few bad eggs from both sides spoil the basket!<br><br>I've been thru NS.... n luckily, my gf stood by me all the time. Like mention by someone above, COMMUNICATION is the most IMPORTANT! You must let u'r counterpart knows how you feel n think. Imagine, the guy being thrown into a regimental kind of life, no freedom, kanna "tekan". Now, how abt the ger? Enter into the Uni n into a new phase of her life.<br>With both sides experiencing a major change in their lifes, how do u expect u'r bf or gf to understand u if u don't tell them what u're going thru!<br><br>I've camp mates being dumped by their gfs after they've entered the Uni. I've also seen guys dumping their gfs after mixing with the wrong company. When I was an instructor in NS, one of my trainee broke off with his gf n things got so bad that he threatened to jump off the building.  I remembered spending almost 3 hrs with other instructors trying to convince him that there's a way out b4 he came down. Of course we covered up for him, since he's already going thru' such a tough time. Wouldn't want him to go to DB becos of that. The trainee blamed  his gf for not being understanding n his gf was not happy becos he was not spending enough time with her. But the root of their problem was that they did not tell each other how they really felt.<br><br>Now, let's look at it this way, such things happen all the time be it during NS or not. Somehow, people tend to make a big deal out of it when it happens during NS but wouldn't even blink an eye if it's the other way round......<br><br>Agree?<br><br>[This message has been edited by ltain (edited 18 April 2000).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by ltain (edited 18 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wonder if this is normal, but I dun have the urge at all to find a gf while in the army. Think it's becoz it's so stress in the army, I dun want to stress myself even further with a gf. Then with my puny little allowance, can barely support myself how else to support a girl? Also there is no guarantee when I can book out, and I dun want to disappoint her if I can't get out.<br><br>Once out of army, I can't help myself but been a hunter all the time..  :p</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I disagree with the above stereotyped thought. I lost my relationship during NS, not becos I was unfaithful, nor was I too close to my bunkmates. I had too much work to do, and cellular phones were luxury items during my time. I hardly booked out and by the time I was back in camp, it was already after 12am most of the time. I tried to call her hostel, but most of the time she wasn't around, or someone is using the phone. I tried to contact her during weekends, but to no avail. Finally, she initiated the break-up, saying that I wasn't as busy as I was believed to be, all thanks to someone who did not know the situation and spread rumours about me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>What to do?? No trust, might as well break up. So I believe such matters take 2 hands to clap.</div>
