            <div class='col-md body'>From my experience when I was an army guy, I tell you honestly that we are all desperate for a g/f because after a hard days work, we want to find someone (female) to talk to, as well as show to the others that we have someone to call!<br><br>Also if quarrel, can tell bunk mates and all will comfort you and talk cork sing song to you. Got all the attention. Good excuse to smoke btw.<br><br>Saturdays' night alright for fighting..and scoring.<br><br>Then there is the dinner and dance that we need a parther..cannot possibly bring sister or cousin right? Wait kena find out malu man..whole camp will know ah! So must find prferbably chiobu. But not chio nevermind..as long as figure good. Like that than got face mah.<br><br>But this does not apply to only guys in green but also blue and white. There are always scums around not in uniform who also do the same.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>forex:  yes, i thought so, too.  but he seemed to be more interested in eating out with his friends at changi village or pasir ris rather than spending time with me.  sometimes he disappeared for two weeks (or perhaps he's not supposed to tell others that he's going for training for two weeks???) and he missed the V day, my b day, and his b day.  For a regular with a handphone, not calling on three occassions is just too much right?  Finally, he disappeared,  didn't return my call for days, and finally I was too sick of calling him again.  So, the end.  Not that I'm saying all army guys are like this, but if you think that you'll get it easy because they're so in desperate need of female companion <strong>there's no way they're gonna leave you</strong>, you better think again.<br><br>------------------<br>The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are<br>always so certain of themselves, and wiser people so full of doubts.<br>--Bertrand  Russell<br><br>[This message has been edited by MayaJade (edited 15 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey.......what about regulars? We wear green too.....you mean to say we can never be trusted??<br><br>I used to think that girls in the U cannot be trusted, cause all my friends in the army kana jilted by their GFs after the girls found some more mature guy who can always be around for them. I always thought the girls were bitches. However, after I came to the U, I realised that it was very hard on the girl too. The guys have a hard week, and expect the girl to understand during the weekend. The girls wait for the whole week to see the BF, only to find that he is very tired or has to spend time at home with his family. I guess it is not the fault of either, just that their lives have taken a very large turn from each other, and it is not easy for them to stay together.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hei Turtle : *claps* for you.<br><br>I agree with what you have said.<br><br>Many girls have bad experience with army guys and they start to brand them. That's why i post this question to see the views.I mean, not all are playful or busy or stress....it's all depend on which unit you are in.<br><br>For example, i am in a combat unit...damn busy all year round cos we got only 2 years to get our people to learn what they are suppose to know and my unit bao kar liao one.  every time go field 3 to 4 days, come back to camp one day then go out 3 to 4 days type...where got time??? Then most of our girlfriends start to get suspicious and creat lots of problems for those oredi so busy and stress out guys. Worst of all, they say we cannot be trusted but let me ask....do every girl knows what we are doing??? Do they know what's the diff between those combat unit and service unit or schools??? the amount of work are different.<br><br>just want to say, please find out more before you start to get suspicious of your boys! Many of my men are trying very hard to maintain their relationship and turn out that their girls don't trust them.  I have met people who have AWOL cos their girl wanna leave them.<br><br>So, girls, be fair to us too!<br><br>[This message has been edited by newwe (edited 15 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>basically it boils down to how committed you are to the relationship lor...<br><br>a relationship that is built when the guy is in NS cannot be all that strong bcos there is simply not enough nurturing time for the relationship to really grow.<br><br>but relationships that are built before NS is another thing. they should be able to stnad the test of time if it is really strong. NS is merely a test of the relationship. if there were problems before the relationship that were not addressed, they will be magnified during this stressful period. but if not, then the relationship should carry on strong.<br><br>just my 2 cents...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Never had a bf in army before, but do let me write down my 2 stirlings worth.<br>Guys in the army are unexceptionally stressed up and soemtimes they might be feel that their gf won't not understand the kind of 'suffering' they had in the serving their 'jailterm'...Imagine, when they see their gf...they will complain all the things they were coerced to do...got 'framed' by their inmates and have to do the same punishment cos they believed the masketeers kinda slogan.."ALL FOR ONE AND ONE FOR ALL!"...They know their gf will find them repeating the same thing everytime...just like when gals wants to go to shopping..most guys will roll their eyes and goes tagging along...but along the way trying to find their "bf seat" when their gals rushed for their fitting rooms...it is the same logic..so sometimes gals rather goes shopping with a group of gals..rather than their own bfs...<br><br>The guys in NS feels that they can share and feel for their bunkmates or inmates...and thru time they might realise that a gf is not a part of their lives anymore cos they can't relate to each other...and each time I used to go out with my ex-bf..his frens will tell him all this incidents inside the camps...and as though they are still inside(But it is already supposed to be a weekend)...They will share their army jokes and also the 'glorious deeds' they have done..(cos my bf is not Singaporean so he dunno what is happening inside the 'jail')There are good times and bad times shared in the army...and I can see them growing to learn how to be a man..(but some of them still lives in the turtle shell even though they are supposed to be trained as commandoes)...<br><br>And yes, I have seen gals leaving for better guys after they go to the universities dumping their NS bfs...cos they might feel a change of environment has also changed their hearts as well..but after NS the guys are still young and fit...and a great career to go...what is a woman anyway if she dun loves u...and goes for another guy?<br><br>And last but not the least, now all guys are duplicate of another..so it depends who you meet....<br><br>------------------<br>We have no right to ask when sorrow comes, "Why did this happen to me?" unless we ask the same question for every moment of happiness that comes our way.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 15 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just me and my views...<br><br>Guys in green cannot be trusted? For some cases, yes. I have heard of some cases whereby it says, "If your relationship can last thru Ns, it mainly means that you can go thru the marriage state as well."<br>Really?<br>I have guys telling me that their gf stick to them for the 2 whole years. And after Ns, the guys broke off with the gals.<br>Reason: They are too stressed. Gf is one of those things who can help them to relief stress at times.<br><br>During weekends, they can tell us that they were very tired and need to sleep. In the end? Just one phone call from their frens, and they are out there enjoying themselves.<br><br>Sometimes, i felt that there are too many external factors tat psychologically influence a gal's thinking.<br>Gals are scared too. Scared that we will be wasting our 2 yrs waiting...and after tat, get dumped. So, too much of this scare thinking turned them into suspecting their bf first instead. So, when they said tat they will not be free to meet you during the weekends, u will start to sense tat something is wrong, although in ur heart, u know that they are just going to meet their<br>frens.<br><br>Guys always said tat we gals are not understanding enough. They only think, Oh, my gf is out there, working or studying...so, they might just meet a better guy out there....etc..etc...and always feel tat we are enjoying ourselves. So, whenever we complain abt how sian our study or work is, they will surely say "Wah lau, you working/studying where got as stress as me? I am in NS now leh, everyday chiong here chiong there, very siong leh".<br><br>That's it. Guys win.<br>Wait till u guys get out to the working world. We gals also look forward to weekends. Whenever, we go out and enjoy after work, guys will start complaining again. But, does they know tat going out is the only way for us to relief stress also, becoz u guys are not there for us? And that doesn't means tat we are really enjoying. Wat we prefer most will be leaning on you, telling you how stress we are....and if u guys do the same thing, i'm sure tat most of us will not mind too.<br><br>To say, guys need to understand gals also.<br>Both need to understand each other, trust each other...in order to make it work.<br>Not say guys in green cannot be trusted, just that sometimes, there are just too many misunderstandings out there.....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That is quite unfair to say such things,having gone thru BMT and working,i know that whether you are working outside or serving BMT,there will still be stress from your superiors etc etc.Both parties face stress although i know in BMT or in NS,the thought of cannot go home except weekends can be quite demoralising lah,but can you put yourself in your gf's shoes that she can't see you the whole week at all except during weekends???It just need some understanding and consideration from both parties to make it through,i do heard some couples manage to survive NS  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">))</div>
