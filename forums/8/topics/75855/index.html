            <div class='col-md body'>1. Dress for your culture<br><br>I used to pride myself on buying inexpensive suits and other clothing. Over the years, I've learned this is wrong.<br><br>I now buy very high-quality shoes and they seem to last forever, whereas the cheapos used to wear out quickly and always looked as cheap as the price I'd paid for them.<br><br>2. Let your guard down, but only on purpose<br><br>Offer a calculated nugget of information, or a provocative opinion, to see what the reaction will be.<br><br>If you say something seemingly off the cuff, you may get a revealing response.<br><br>3. Be your own financial adviser<br><br>Many people go out and hire financial advisers, but I have also seen a lot those advisers destroy people. Rely on your own judgment based on what you read in reliable publications like The Wall Street Journal.<br><br>4. Sometimes, you still have to screw them<br><br>If someone screws you, screw them back. When somebody hurts you, go after them as viciously and as violently as you can. Like it says in the Bible, an eye for an eye.<br><br>5. The art of the hair<br><br>I'm often criticised for the way I comb my hair.<br><br>The New York Times called it 'an elaborate structure best left to an architecture critic'. I think it looks good.<br><br>6. Avoid the handshake whenever possible<br><br>It is a terrible practice. It's a medical fact that this is how germs are spread. I wish we could follow the Japanese custom of bowing instead.<br><br>7. Go with your gut<br><br>Being an entrepreneur is not a group effort. You have to trust yourself. You may have superb academic credentials, but without instinct, you'll have a hard time getting to, and staying at, the top.<br><br>8. Be optimistic, but always be prepared for the worst<br><br>Learning to expect problems saved me from a lot of wasted energy. Ups and downs are inevitable, so simply try to be prepared for them.<br><br>9. Pay attention to the details<br><br>If you don't know every aspect of what you're doing, you're setting yourself up for some unwelcome surprises.<br><br>10. Get a prenuptial agreement<br><br>If I hadn't signed a prenup, I would be writing this book from the perspective of somebody who lost big. We needed a bus to get Ivana's lawyers to court. It was a disaster, but I had a solid prenup, and it held up. (Ivana Trump was awarded US$20 million of Mr Trumps billion-dollar fortune).<br><br></div>
