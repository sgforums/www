            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by DailyFreeGames.com:</div><div class="quote_body">Reminds me when you talk about the young boys... I probably fit into those categories. I'm so crazy about older ladies, not that I needed someone to take care of me, in fact I took care of most of my gf and they are usually a few years older than me... Just to share, I really don't know why I am not interested in young girls, probably DNA? The ironic thing is that I look young for my age and hence I tend to attract the younger ladies. People look at my gf and they usually ask, your sister ah and I was like, noooooo! The thing I like about older ladies is that they are more emotionally stable and when it comes to love, they are really nice and tender, and they makes for good conversation. To me, they are the perfect lady to marry. But don't give up on the younger guys, they may be the perfect guy whom you're looking for. Start from coffee, and friendships, you don't have to start a r/s immediately, things can move slowly and then when you're sure he's the perfect catch, grab it, fight for it.</div></blockquote>That is so not true, most woman above the age of 35 who are not married are psychological unbalanced. They are insecure and more demanding than those PYT because they know that their bio clock is working against them. When they find a man, they so really wanna tie him down, so much that they ruin the whole thing.<br><br>Dun believe me? Try to rattle the boat alittle next time and see how they jump.</div>

I've been a serial dater of late but I think I've gone far enough with the rebounding, bounced back really happy and now I'm wanting to be in a meaningful relationship that would lead to a serious relationship. Uh huh, yes I'm looking. (Shocking isn't it?) Just a great girl, looking for a great guy to be in a great relationship. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I'm 39, 5'2", rather fit (I love my gym!), with a sharp mind (dull on occasions like after a heavy meal) very attractive (so I've been told alot, various adjectives were used: beautiful, very pretty, Cuuuuute! etc, etc.) Been mistaken often to be in early to mid 20s, sometimes teens? I've been hit on by a 15 year old in a lan gaming place and my teenage cousins thought I still looked like a kid in my 30s <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> I wouldn't call myself a sex bomb but I do turn heads very often. I'm rather artistically and musically inclined, so alot of that gets expressed at work and play. I love dancing and the outdoors <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> So what I'm looking for in a man: someone who can get past 10 minutes of conversation with me, is kind, a gentleman, has a great smile and turns me on (hey, women need sexual attraction, too!). I'd like him to be at something like 6' to 6'3" tall and very fit. A good physique is a major turn on for me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> and maybe, just maybe....that Nicolas Cage type of bad boy look? (but that's really optional) Someone easy-going, fun-loving, who isn't uptight about lots of things, comfortable in his own skin and a good sport. With a broad spectrum of interests and has a mind with some breadth and depth. Reliable (will do exactly what he says he will do) and financially stable. Non-smoking, preferably. Clean and neat. Please send me pics if you do respond.</div></blockquote>That is the problem with the society nowadays, its all about " WHAT I WANT "<br>i want someone  this , someone that.......maybe nicolas cage , kaneshiro, tom cruise...blah blah blah.<br><br>I think hollywood has destroyed the convenant of the institution of marriage.<br><br>In the olden days, u just get married to whoever has been chosen for you and u stick through it! Raise 7 kids and just be happy.<br><br>No dun get me wrong , i m not advocating arranged marriages, it just struck me that marriages in the olden days last no matter the circumstances.<br><br>I think people looking for life partners should focus on what he or she could contribute to building a family than what they want or expect from their partners.<br><br>This brings me to a conversation with a wife  of my friend. SHe stated she wants her hubby to be financially stable, Cares about her, gentle, wan 5 Cs....blah blah blah...<br><br>I told her in return, " You cant cook, dun do housework, dun like kids. So what does a guy get in marrying you"<br><br>She can reply , " Me  Lor "  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div>

Prized collection?<br><br>- cos most single females are more attractive than their younger peers &gt;&gt;&gt; Good for you....even if you are a homemaker, you should be attractive to your husband and people around you.<br><br>- cos most single females carry themselves well and have passion for dancing &gt;&gt;&gt; definitely not a problem with homemakers. My wife has her own passions and I respect that. Just be mutually understanding and balance commitments with passion.<br><br>- cos most single females don't drink &gt;&gt;&gt; my wife and many homemakers drink so it's personal perference.<br><br>- cos most single females hate being hit on in clubs &gt;&gt;&gt; personal preference but I trust my wife enough that if she's hit on, she has the decency to deal with it appropriately.<br><br>- cos most single females are attracted to ang moh &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some ang moh are also traditional so just have to open your eyes and select wisely.<br><br>- cos most single females are not into ONS &gt;&gt;&gt; most homemakers are not too, I hope. But I heard some couples' sex life has the frequency of ONS....wonder it's good or bad! ; )<br><br>- cos most single females hope to make everything worthwhile and meaningful &gt;&gt;&gt;  I believe everyone wishes to do that.<br><br>Frankly, it doesn't matter what you choose...it's how you make it out to be. E.g. a single female can help build schools in third world countries, or be successful, be filial, be a homemaker, anything....<br><br>Just be responsible...</div>

(not that I have anything against Lesbianism but somehow the thought of it does send chills down my spine)! So I thought to myself 'that's it, i'm gonna have to do something about this instead of waiting around.' Which brings me here. What puzzles me is this: younger men seem more attracted to me and I mean really young and i'm in my late thirties!( Nope, can't see myself robbing the cradle. No.) Although many of my friends and their friends have said that I put lots of younger women to shame. Let's just say I carry myself well. My passion: dancing....something about music that moves me, the right kind of music of course. So love the dance floor, don't drink and hate being hit on at clubs especially so by drunks and younger men. No offence to you young guys but i'm definitely not into teaching you a thing or two. Somehow of late I find myself attracted to caucasian men. Again no offence to the local young men. Not into ONS. In fact, I'm keen on moving into the next phase in life that makes everything I do here in this life worthwhile and meaningful. Well if you get my drift and feel the same way, let's start talking....
