(not that I have anything against Lesbianism but somehow the thought of it does send chills down my spine)! So I thought to myself 'that's it, i'm gonna have to do something about this instead of waiting around.' Which brings me here. What puzzles me is this: younger men seem more attracted to me and I mean really young and i'm in my late thirties!( Nope, can't see myself robbing the cradle. No.) Although many of my friends and their friends have said that I put lots of younger women to shame. Let's just say I carry myself well. My passion: dancing....something about music that moves me, the right kind of music of course. So love the dance floor, don't drink and hate being hit on at clubs especially so by drunks and younger men. No offence to you young guys but i'm definitely not into teaching you a thing or two. Somehow of late I find myself attracted to caucasian men. Again no offence to the local young men. Not into ONS. In fact, I'm keen on moving into the next phase in life that makes everything I do here in this life worthwhile and meaningful. Well if you get my drift and feel the same way, let's start talking.... Rgds, N</div></blockquote>Reminds me when you talk about the young boys... I probably fit into those categories. I'm so crazy about older ladies, not that I needed someone to take care of me, in fact I took care of most of my gf and they are usually a few years older than me... Just to share, I really don't know why I am not interested in young girls, probably DNA? The ironic thing is that I look young for my age and hence I tend to attract the younger ladies. People look at my gf and they usually ask, your sister ah and I was like, noooooo! The thing I like about older ladies is that they are more emotionally stable and when it comes to love, they are really nice and tender, and they makes for good conversation. To me, they are the perfect lady to marry. But don't give up on the younger guys, they may be the perfect guy whom you're looking for. Start from coffee, and friendships, you don't have to start a r/s immediately, things can move slowly and then when you're sure he's the perfect catch, grab it, fight for it.</div>

(not that I have anything against Lesbianism but somehow the thought of it does send chills down my spine)! So I thought to myself 'that's it, i'm gonna have to do something about this instead of waiting around.' Which brings me here. What puzzles me is this: younger men seem more attracted to me and I mean really young and i'm in my late thirties!( Nope, can't see myself robbing the cradle. No.) Although many of my friends and their friends have said that I put lots of younger women to shame. Let's just say I carry myself well. My passion: dancing....something about music that moves me, the right kind of music of course. So love the dance floor, don't drink and hate being hit on at clubs especially so by drunks and younger men. No offence to you young guys but i'm definitely not into teaching you a thing or two. Somehow of late I find myself attracted to caucasian men. Again no offence to the local young men. Not into ONS. In fact, I'm keen on moving into the next phase in life that makes everything I do here in this life worthwhile and meaningful. Well if you get my drift and feel the same way, let's start talking....
