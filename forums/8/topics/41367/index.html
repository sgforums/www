            <div class='col-md body'>One day while walking down the street a highly successful Human Resources<br>Manager was tragically hit by a bus and died. Her soularrived up in Heaven<br>where she was met at the Pearly Gates by St. Peter himself.<br><br>"Welcome," said St. Peter. "Before you get settled in, though, it<br>seems wehave a problem. You see, strangely enough, we've never<br>once had a Human Resources Manager make it this far, and we're not<br>really sure what to do with you."<br><br>"No worries, just let me in," said the woman.<br><br>"Well, I'd like to, but I have higher orders. What we're going to do<br>is let you have a day in Hell and a day in Heaven and then you can<br>choose whichever one you want to spend an eternity in."<br><br>"Actually,I think I've made up my mind, I prefer to stay in Heaven",<br>said the woman.<br><br>"Sorry, we have rules..."<br><br>And with that St. Peter put the executive in a lift and it went<br>down-down-<br>down to Hell.<br><br>The doors opened and she found herself stepping out onto the putting<br>Green of a beautiful golf course.<br><br>In the distance was a  country club and in front of her were all her<br>fellow executive friends that she had worked with, and they were well<br>dressed in evening gowns and cheering for her.<br><br>They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks and they talked about old<br>times. They played an excellent round of golf and at night went to the<br>country club where she enjoyed a superb steak and lobster dinner.<br><br>She met the Devil who was actually a really nice guy (kinda cute)and<br>she had a great time telling jokes and dancing.<br><br>She was having such a good time that before she knew it, it was time<br>to leave. Everybody shook her hand and waved good-bye as she got on the<br>lift.<br><br>The lift went up-up-up and opened back up at the Pearly Gates and found<br>St. Peter waiting for her. "Now it's time to spend a day in heaven," he said.<br><br>So she spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds and playing the<br>harp and singing. She had a great time and before she knew it her 24<br>hours were up and St. Peter came and got her.<br><br>"So, you've spent a day in Hell and you've spent a day in Heaven. Now you<br>must choose your eternity". The woman paused for a second and then replied,<br>"Well, I never thought I would say this. I mean, Heaven has been<br>really great, but I had a better time in Hell."<br><br>So St. Peter escorted her to the lift and again she went down-down-down<br>back to Hell.<br><br>When the doors of the lift opened she found herself standing in a desolate<br>wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw that her friends were dressed<br>in rags and picking up garbage and putting it in sacks.<br><br>The Devil came up to her and put his arm around her.<br><br>"I don't understand," stammered the woman, "yesterday I was here and<br>was a golf course and a country club and we ate lobster and we danced<br>and had a great time. Now all there is a wasteland and all my friends<br>look miserable."<br><br>The Devil looked at her and smiled. "Yesterday we were recruiting<br>you, today you're staff..."<br><br>The moral of this story; Never believe what you see in<br>the company or what they promised you.<br><br>It turns out to be S**T always. Have a fun day ahead.<br><br></div>
