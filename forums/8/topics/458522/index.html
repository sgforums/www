              A CCTV was installed in the lift of my HDB flat recently. I am happy because it give me a sense of security.
              
              But does it give me a false sense of security? Will professional criminals be deterred from committing criminal offences such as house breaking; loan shark harassment; lift robbery etc?
              
              CCTV is used to record occurrences happened at places such as shopping centres; entrances and exits of MRT stations etc. Shop operators also installed CCTV in their premises. Their objective is to monitor the staff activities within the shop premises.
              
              CCTVs are also used by EMAS to monitor the traffic condition along the Expressways.
              The staff on duty will update and alert road users on the current road situation timely without fail.
              
              Does CCTV give you a false sense of security?

              "Massive investment in CCTV cameras to prevent crime in the UK has failed to have a significant impact, despite billions of pounds spent on the new technology, a senior police officer piloting a new database has warned. Only 3% of street robberies in London were solved using CCTV images, despite the fact that Britain has more security cameras than any other country in Europe."
              
              Is this finding relevant to Singapore?

            <div class='col-md body'>The appearance of surveillance cameras in public areas in the UK (streets, parks, car parks, shopping malls etc) is obvious to everyone using these kinds of spaces. They are used to watch peopleâ€™s activities and behaviour and, if necessary react towards crime or anti-social behaviour. The UK is by far the most advanced country in Europe in regards to public surveillance research and installation. In the last decade the coverage has grown dramatically. In 1990 there were three town centre schemes with approximately 100 cameras and in 2002 there were approximately 500 schemes with around 40,000 cameras. The impression can be made that it is used as a general tool to prevent crime and promote a safer and cleaner community. But is it as effective as it promises to be and to what extent does it effect peopleâ€™s perception and activity in neighbourhoods and cities? To what extent does CCTV influences the urban designer work? What needs to be considered when implementing CCTV in existing and new developments? This paper will help to understand the complexity of this question and issues related with its context. One approach to the topic lays in the question: Why do people feel scared and insecure in public areas? The â€˜fear of crimeâ€™ has become an important issue to consider within urban design and town planning. Being afraid of being a victim of crime can be positive if it leads to increased crime prevention, but it can also affect people's quality of life in a negative way. This fear gets projected on the appearance of places and their users which lead towards banning beggars and on-street traders. In the argument about public surveillance, it is often mentioned that constant camera monitoring is reducing this â€˜fear of crimeâ€™.</div>
