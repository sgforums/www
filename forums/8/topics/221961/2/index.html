When you try to make it big by short cuts (TS pointed out that he and his friends combined barely have enough to buy 1 lot); 9999999.999999999 times you will not make it.<br><br>There are consequences if you do not make it by short cut methods (like borrowing money to fund it) and like you say, end up bankrupt.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I once told my gf that everybody, whether rich or poor, should invest. Even if you had no money, your should force yourself to save a bit to invest a little. This is a thought which i came up with after knowing what investment is all about. And my gf came across this thought again in a book that she read on investment.<br><br>It is not wrong if you don't want to take risk. But I would advise you to find out about investment. Know more about the various vehicles of investment. Anyway, i wouldn't advise you to follow your friends' method of investing. Understand investment before you come out with a method that suits you best.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>not wrong to take risk . if u think ur happy with ur income ,enuff to feed urself and ur family in time to come ,long working longs hours and u like what ur doing u can stay with the cubicle for rest of ur life.<br>your friend condemn u being lack of ambition<br>you condemn ur friend being too unrealistic.<br><br>Most important thing is that only risk taker like them might have a way more better income in time to come or if thier investment fails , its just like plunging into the water. But of cos before taking risk of cos must do some financial planning and understand the market before doing any form of biz or investment.</div>

Everyone live their lives differently. Its just like we do not shit at the same time everyday. I might poo in the morning, you in the evening.<br><br>Anything may happen even if you live the life you prefer. Eg. You might get fired one day and cant find a job for 6 months etc, things like that while your friends made their investment and made millions. Then months into it, you get hooked up into a high paying job then your friends start to get burnt.... get the drift?<br><br>However, in investments, one thing is for sure.<br><br>Please.

Even those investment insurance plans are some sort of a masked mutual fund. The Singapore govt take our tax money and put into mutual funds also (an average of 9% yield).<br><br>A good investment strategy will insure good retirement. Definitely way better than putting all the money in a savings account. Single stocks are a bit too risky for me though.</div>
