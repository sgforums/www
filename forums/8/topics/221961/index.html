            <div class='col-md body'>U r only being prudent by planting your feet firmly on the ground.

So, congratulations on being level-headed!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, if u look from another pt of view, ppl who aim low are less hardworking and have little improvement in their life. If at this stage, you refuse to aim high n settle for a so-so lifestyle. When the times come that your lifestyle becomes a burden for you, there will be little chance for you to make a comeback.</div>
