            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I am perplexed by the sheer number of Eco posers in my office. FYI, I work in a Market Research MNC agency as a Quantitative analyst. A great deal of my job involves data analysis, cross referring hordes of data, checking data integrity and all. As such, I would always prefer to print out my data in paper so that I can better analyze the data and spot mistakes. However, I am always being scolded if not told off by my seniors or some dumb secretaries for printing the data out on paper. Common, how I want to print and use the office printer paper is my own prerogative. After all, itÂ’s my work anyway. Besides, I would recycle the paper by printing on the other side some time later.<br><br>I believe an Eco fighter is one who exercises Logic and Good common sense in executing his/her work to deliver efficiency and be green at the same time. An eco-poser on the other hand, is an attention grabber who prefers to abandon good business logic and efficiency in a bid to display how good an eco-activist they are, and in the end deliver more damage to the environment.<br><br>Another example would be the deliberate switching off of this huge mega server computer where analyst withdraws and extracts data from the system. Some Eco-posers chicks will at the end of the day, stupidly switch off the computer. Common, dumb woman, to reboot and restart the computer takes 30minutes!!!! Simply put, these eco posers are not exercising logic because the amount of electricity needed to reboot the system would consume at least 5 times the electricity consumption if the computer were to be simply in sleep/standby mode overnight. This is also precisely why Changi Airport turns on the air conditioning 24/7 because it will consume a lot more electricity if the conditioning system were to be turned on and off.<br><br>Another incident would be about the claiming of Cab fees. My company policy allows employees to claim for cab fee after 9pm. For goodness sake, most public transport services are still operational during 9pm. It is illogical to grant cab fee claims so early in the night. In doing so, it simply encourages employees to take cab at will (producing more pollution) and be lazy bums who will not use the public transport even when it is still not so late in the night.<br><br>A more illogical time to accept cab fee claims would be after 11pm. However, I am surprised that these eco posers remain quiet in voicing out their opposition to this 9pm rule. Why the silence? Because Eco-posers are folks who do green stuff for show, but when a certain green measure takes on a severe toil in inconveniencing them, they will be as mute and meek as a sheep. You will be surprised that these green posers go way up the hierarchy to director levels.<br><br>I urge all of you office folks out there, to stand up against Eco-posers. And if your office has established a green team (or something similar), please make sure there are no eco posers in it.<br></div>

There is no difference in using recycled or normal paper if the company if truly green.<br><br>If normal paper is used, but there is a conscious recycling culture/habit in the company, where the papers are reused and sent for recycling, then there is no point in paying to use recycling paper. In fact, using recycling paper would create a greater evil, since employees are more likely to waste the paper now because they believed it is already recycled once. Therefore it weighs less on their conscience.<br><br>An eco-poser case would occur, if the company passes down the extra costs of $2 to the employees when there is already a strong conscious recycling culture/habit in the company.<br></div>

Somehow this is a damned and condemed world. But i guess, we need to keep the awareness afloat. Currently, it seems trendy to be green, so there is a need to be cautious that we do not breed and encourage Eco-posers. An eco-poser in the office is a huge distress to the workers.<br><br>I mean if these eco posers really want to "wayang" all the way, then they should also protest against the incumbent burning of incense paper during the traditional lunar Ghost festivals. I do not see these eco-posers making a fuss about it.<br><br></div>

Recall, that i think a few months back, this famous british Designer launched a green trendy shOpping bag, which was quickly snapped up by celebrtities in HOllywood and all. When the launch arrived in HK and China, there was a huge scuffle where people queued overnight for the launch. Riots and fightings broke out when the shop opened doors. The launch of the designer shopping bag was meant to save environment, but it created more damage to the environment because of the number of the amount of gas and electicity wasted from the deployment of extra security personel, police, paramedics etc. to contain and pacify the riots.<br><br>Were these people seriously concerned about using a shopping bag? if so, they could do so and buy a cheap cloth bag. Why is there a need to clamour for a designer Shopping bag? Hypocrites indeed.</div>

They really do not 'do' anything to help our earth, they just purchase over priced stuff from companies that try to help. So they wear the hemp and eat the organic, but do they actually take time out of there cell phone lives to give a helping hand?
