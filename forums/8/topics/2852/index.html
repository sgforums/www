            <div class='col-md body'>Whew! I got my millenium Hello Kitty alredi! I'm thinking of getting the Chinese and Japanese ones too. But I simply refuse to be fleeced by black marketeers for them. I'll rather go without. They're not worth the trouble.<br><br>Anyway, my bf's 'radar' is up. He actually asked me when the next Hello Kitty will be out. I don't want them (the Malay ones) but it really warmed my heart to know he remembered. I hope he listens to me and not throw away $$$ for them. If he does, I'll get pissed off becos I told him not to. I dun want them THAT badly, and I absolutely hate the thought of supporting blood-suckers who will take the next opportunity to suck me dry.</div>
