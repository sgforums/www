              <p>Think about it, why the world is changing? Who are the ones encouraging women to work? Who caused the change? Women.</p>
              <p>It's not about the issue who earns more, who earns less. It regards to who's responsibility is that.</p>
              <p>Back in stone age, men are out to hunt for food. Women stayed in caves to take care of the young ones. Research has shown that men has thicker skin than women. Nobody can deny that. I don't see any women go out to hunt for food. That's not their instinct.</p>
              <p>Simply, women don't want to stay at homes to be homemaker, because they can't cook, do laundry, and many more. Thus, maids come into picture. Do you see any male maids around? No. If yes, I am worried.</p>
              <p>First, if women want to work, they have to make sure that the house is being well taken care of by HER, not by other people. If she can't take care of her house well enough, drop the idea of going out to work. However, if women want to work, no problem with that. Men are much more happier that there is an extra income. However, the key issue is whether women can ENSURE everything is alright at home?</p>
              <p>Men don't do nothing at home, they do contribute to the family with household chores. You got to choose the right men.Â </p>
              <p>Men's role in the family: Bring $ back home(primarily), take care of the house(secondary)</p>
              <p>Women's role in the family: Take care of the house(primarily), bring $ back home(secondary)</p>
              <p>Anyway, your ancestors as a female role in the family have been doing it for centuries. Why CAN'T you? You cannot take up such challenges as a 21st century women or women in this era getting weaker? Perhaps both.</p>
              <p>It's alright to engage maids at home, your children will start to treat the maids as their mums. Take care of them, feed them, bathe them and even coach them with their homeworks. What about women's position at home? You are nothing but a child bearer.</p>

                                      going out to work. However, if women want to work, no problem with
                                      that. Men are much more happier that there is an extra income.
                                      However, the key issue is whether women can ENSURE everything is

              <p>Given that some responsiblities can be shared, but there must also be clear separation of responsibilities, when it involves the welfare of the children at large. Because this often leads to conflicting roles and decisions as both have very strong personalities.</p>
              <p>Double standards, double management. Hard to work out.</p>
              <p>The only "work" I will accept for the housewife, is perhaps a non-stress job like I dont know, something she dont have to be there and it still can operate. Or manage, e.g Holding Companies sort of work, cause she can manage the assets and future funds.</p>

              <p><span>Yes. You maybe right. It is the society gives you the opportunity. If not, where during you think your words stand?</span></p>
              <p><span>Â The world is being created this way, so respect the truth of nature. You can't deny that.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I don't have the patience to quote and unquote you so just make do with my reply in blue.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yes society gives me the opportunity but it's made up of both men &amp; women</span></p>
              <p><span>Â If the men don't do that, do you think you all women will be satisfied? That's one of the way to keep your women's mouth shut. Why is there not enough in the workforce? Women don't give birth to enough childen. Why? being selfish, want to work for themselves, have their own pocket $. Simple as that. Single income can work. It depends on how much the women spend on their "maintenance" fee.</span></p>
              <p><span>Responsibility change with time and need not be a gender defined role.</span></p>
              <p><span><span style="color: #0000ff;">Really? Just the women being selfish? Wow, so typical to just blame it all on the women. I don't think I need to pull in the reasons why women were pulled into the workforce and there are more to the falling birth rates than womenÂ wanting to spend money but I don't want to waste my time on you.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yes responsibilities change with time and apparently, you are stuck in time</span>Â </span></p>
              <p><span>Â I am glad that you can cook and do housework. What's the quality? Is good enough? Ask your husband, he prefers his mother's food or yours? I am not trying to demoralise you. I would like to take this opportunity to encourage you to carry on and do a better job. You may be right, I don't see them in Singapore. It's not acceptable in an Asian country. Are you being Westernised?</span></p>
              <p><span><span style="color: #0000ff;">My husband prefers my food. That one I am 100% sure and I have had many compliments that I am a good cook. I am westernized. I'm not being westernized. I was brought up that women are in no way inferior to men. My parents treated both me and my brother equally.</span> </span></p>
              <p><span>Bear in mind, life's never fair. Don't try to strike a balance. It will never be equal.Â Definitely, it's both responsibility. However, women need to take up more. I have no offence on that. That's on how I personally feel. If one day, a men can do everything like household chores(with or without maid)Â andÂ bringing back $. what do women do?</span></p>
              <p><span><span style="color: #0000ff;">Well, women are already bringing back the money and also helping out with the household chores is what they are already doing now. It's like if we don't do the household chores and work and take up the greater part of responsibilities we are worthless from your pt of view.</span></span></p>
              <p>What I am trying to bring across is that has women done enough for their men? Women who need to find husbands who can do household chores, because women themselves can't do. They need MANPOWER. Fortunately, this does not apply to you, but applies to alot of SG women. Cheers for you.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Good grief so now it's what women have done enough for their men? I can go into a thousand things on what men have done for their women?? But that is pointless. Seriously if you want old-fashioned, and ancient roles, please put on your loin cloth and go back out there to hunt. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I can only say I'm glad that my husband does not think like you and encourages me to stay out in the work-force and helps out around the house.</span></p>
