              <p>All I can say is that the system is never perfect, no one system is perfect in catering to all students. The singapore education system only caters to those who are <strong>all-rounders</strong>. All-rounders are good employees dont you agree fellow employers? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"> Make us study science, maths, arts, history, literature, geo..etc. One cannot choose to specialise early and if you dont score well in other subjects, your average grades goes down even if you do well in your favourite subjects.</p>
              <p>Teachers (you have a moral obligation) and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">especially</span> parents (i feel that most dont know how to teach their kids and leave it to the education system) have the responsibility to identify or nurture the special interest of the child. Be it an engineer, scientist, business owner, investor, artist, sports star or whatever. If you find that the child is special in certain area, take them out of the crowd and groom them, which could give them a very good head start. Dont waste time with the system of all-rounders.</p>

              <p>For all-rounders to do well in all the subjects, they must cultivate or make themselves like the subject. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">So, at the end of the day they dont know what they really like anymore.</span>  It took me a long time to get out of this dilemma. Spoilt for choices, but duno what you like. Anyone experienced this before? Its like you are wasting a lot of time running in circles.

              <p><br>express students retain at sec 3 yes i have seen but reason for retaining was that they were absolutely lazy. they copied homework skip extra lessons more interested in eca represent sch team etc not become they were not capable of delivering the results. they paid a price for their laziness and not getting their priorities right. but in the o levels they were like scoring 12pts and going to jc or poly.</p>

              <p>The statements you made are just generalisations and reflect of that rat race lifestyle in Singapore. Ditch the weaker ones while you forge ahead. There are teachers who exhibit this mentality that all normal students are lazy . Unfortunately those same type of two faced teachers I had, are very nice to me now because they know that I am doing wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy well beyond their expectations. I had a principal who wished that we all <strong>DON'T DO WELL</strong> in our O levels .....slip of the tongue LOL .</p>
              <p>I got issues with people portraying your view which is either too naive or too arrogant for its own good. I do agree that indulging in self pity doesn't help but for goodness sakes , we are talking about<strong> children and teenagers</strong> .  They are at stage where patience, encouragement and gentle guidance will help alot. Demoralising them achieve nothing.</p>
              <p>We are not talking about adults who should know any better and should bear responsibility for their actions.</p>

                                      because they are unable to perform. this is because they are given

              <p>I wasted one freaking year because my mandarin is sh*t . All other 8 subjects - good scores. 75% was the average score to enter express and I got blocked because of one subject even though I had the necessary 75%. The teachers - some are very good but most were sh*t.</p>
              <p>The crap ones let us know what they think of us ....one called us stupid . Why? because she forgot to tell us to bring color pencils and we told her that she didn't tell us to do so. For that reason, it was our fault not hers.</p>
              <p>We had a good science teacher who knew the system and made us do 10 year O level series since we were secondary 3. She set a test paper which is used for express by mistake. To her surprise ,my class scored better than her express class. We learnt how to cheat the system and that help alot of us over the hill. The history teacher taught us how to spot the questions via 10 years series.</p>
              <p>More than half of my old classmates in normal academic stream have degrees by 25 years old , 5 of us have a master degree, and I am the first to do my PhD.</p>

              <p>i think overall, streaming is indeed beneficial to those weaker students out there. there is also ample opportunities available for the hardworking to upgrade to express, if they make the cut.</p>
              <p>however, i disapprove of moe watering down on the quality of NA education.</p>
              <p>NT is another matter, since they are taught with a different focus.</p>
              <p>NA and express are suppose to be the same in terms of quality, with the only difference being the duration of study. however, as we can see, it is not the case. do you see alot of NA students being allowed to take up pure science? no. it is already sort of condemning their chances of getting into uni, as it is making it hard for them to enter jc, the easier route to uni.</p>
              <p>yes, they do have a chance to enter poly, and from there, to uni. but looking at figures, only 40% of NA students make it to poly, and only a further 40% of poly students make it to uni. so if u go calculate, NA students have only a 16% chance of entering uni, and that's assuming that they can catch up with the rest, and at the same time be the top outstanding 40% of their cohort.</p>
              <p>another factor is the society's current over reliance on grades. as everyone knows, grades are not everything. there can be people with good grades but their attitude sucks.</p>
              <p>even those employers who are not highly educated, look down on NA applicants. isn't that absurd?</p>

              <p>Technically, NA students has about 20-40% chance of going poly if they are weak.Coping and stronger students probly have 60%.</p>
              <p><br>Anyway, for NA Sec 1, stronger students can be upgraded to express sec 2 if they study hard..that explain the lower percentage chance in upper sec</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But actually, ur still right about ITE.. there's no point in thinking that the extra year in sec 5 will "help" you..because the system is somehow meant for ITE - the syllabus is such that there's much more in sec 5 and so weak students will confirm cannot cope if they cant cope with sec 4 syllabus.</p>

              <p>Yea, I must admit, but who to blame? I'd probably blame on Singapore Government, coming out with craps stream, if I'm not wrong, w.e.f this year, those primary school stream have already been axed away.</p>
              <p>Why do I blame it on government? Basicially, what we are doing now is pretty high pace compared to other countries I've visit under school student council. If you are M.I.A one day, you are good as gone.</p>
              <p>Then what? We got streaming in Primary school, getting your ass into EM3 (in the past, and I was from EM2) can use to be very disgraceful to your parents and probably neighbour will look down on you. P4 streaming exam to me consider first huge pressure by parents and to myself.</p>
              <p>Not forgetting two years later, PSLE (Primary School Leaving Examination), again we kid get pressure again. Because is like a life of death game to us, choosing of streams lies in your hand or you can choose to retain again. Again pressure everywhere.</p>
              <p>Then gotten result, wah sway! Kena posted Normal Technical stream! Die! Parents treat you for a round of canning. You cry, your parents feel hopeless about you, your neighbour gossip about you and look down on you. This is clear that you will go into ITE after N-level.</p>
              <p>Man, this is not all, N-level Examniation. No matter how good you are (I was the top 10 in class last year), you still end up in ITE, unless your parents don't feel hopeless, you can jolly well forget about getting into private institution. But I'm not sure what PI can do to you.</p>
              <p>Isn't this sucks to be a NT student? You are already been condemmed by your surrounding neigbour, disgrace your parents, and yet I don't really see the government care about NT students. Resulting ending up in ITE, we have to start all over again from there and work farking hard. We are already been condemmed in the past, and yet the future society perhaps maybe gonna condem us too.</p>
              <p>Perhaps what you said is true, NT students should go and die, because from what I see, government just throw us there and leave us to die, slowly and tourting. Unless we found a way to stand up again.</p>

              <p>I wasted one freaking year because my mandarin is sh*t . All
              other 8 subjects - good scores. 75% was the average score to enter
              express and I got blocked because of one subject even though I had
              the necessary 75%. The teachers - some are very good but most were
              sh*t.</p>
              <p>The crap ones let us know what they think of us ....one called
              us stupid . Why? because she forgot to tell us to bring color
              pencils and we told her that she didn't tell us to do so. For that
              reason, it was our fault not hers.</p>
              <p>We had a good science teacher who knew the system and made us do
              10 year O level series since we were secondary 3. She set a test
              paper which is used for express by mistake. To her surprise ,my
              class scored better than her express class. We learnt how to cheat
              the system and that help alot of us over the hill. The history
              teacher taught us how to spot the questions via 10 years
              series.</p>
              <p>More than half of my old classmates in normal academic stream
              have degrees by 25 years old , 5 of us have a master degree, and I

              <p>I hv a fren who went from NT to ITE to Poly and finally in the
              same graduating batch as me in NUS. And.... he has much higher
              networth than me (near $100k)</p>

              <p>You don't get the same treatment as other people.</p>
              <p>Is like you are on the first class ticket on the airplanes, everyone get their good, excellent service, but when you call for a steward, they all heck care you.</p>
              <p>Is like we are there, but we are being treated we are not there. So what's the difference of being NT and dead? I don't see the difference.</p>
              <p>Of course we can go to Poly and then work our way to NUS. But don't forgot, government take up two years of our life when we reach level 18 (18 years old). To us, I've rather calculate, a student from Nitec who finish everything, including poly, NS, university, will take up rougly 9 to 10 years depending on what course you take in university. How do I get the answer? Simple.</p>
              <p>Nitec - 2 years.<br>NS - 2 years.<br>Poly - 3 years. We have to restart all over again. <em>Note!</em> : -1 year for Higher Nitec Student<br>University - 2 - 3 years. Depending on what course you take. I'm not sure how long are the courses. So I take 2 to 3 years as an example.</p>
              <p>Now go get a calculator and calculate. You will see how many years we wasted, but is worth it lah. And there's alot of short cuts such as going into PI (private institute), cutting down the time and the years. Is just whether your parents or you wanna spend that huge amount of school fees into PI.</p>

              <p>Its just that its very difficult from the start once you have been posted to NT stream.Not even a chance to do O lvl which NA has.Confirm ITE means having a school filled with potential gangsters and classes may not be as peaceful when sometime lecturers cannot even be bothered(gt one thread either here or in HWZ where a lecturer mocked the ITE students for not studying,playing games in school etc)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But i do admit sometime express class does not as good as the Normal stream..heck,my class was super lazy that sometime the best NA class surpassed us in certain case<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>And sorry about my bad joke just now..<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="icon_neutral.gif"></p>
