              <p><br>Sorry to damp your enthusiaism. I heard a life science grad probably when you graduate, you end up washing test tubes in the biopolis. And if you did decide to pursue this field, well you mz be prepared to pursue it all the way up to PHD levels. Because in the life science field, a mere bachelor degree will not do you good if you wanna stay in life-science field.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Common, when did you last see a BAchelor-degree-owned academic publishing a medical/bio science paper in conferences?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Think very very carefully. And yeah this line, hmm pittance starting pay, work in lab all day long, may develope allergy to the alcohol used in the sterilizing environment and yeah little or no career advancement because probably after you grad, you may be just working as a research assistant to some PRC or Indian born PHD in NUS or NTU.</p>

              <p>yeah, if you wish to stay in the Biological industry, or any serious scientific industry, nobody would higher a bachelor degree holder for research. PhD is not compulsory tho, but to get opportunities, you need at least a masters.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But the tradeoff is worth it in the long run. There are few graduate students around and even fewer postdocs, so the more you study and the more experience you accumulate, the more valuable and highly paid you are. A physicist (my major) in the semi conductor industry would earn 3k+ starting pay with masters, and up to 5k+ as a PhD.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But there are a lot of private sector jobs that are not researched based and only require any general degree. These, a bachelor degree will do, though the optimum is a masters. So don't worry about jobs.</p>

              <p><br>no there arent that many test-tubes to wash as one person can wash many many test tubes. So even getting a job to wash test-tubes can be hard.</p>
              <p>But to reply to TS, i think you should look at criterias to getting into the course. Take for eg. NUS chemical engineering admission criteria was previously A, A, A while NTU chemical engineering admit students with B B B for A levels. However, because of the admission difference, it is also theoretically easier to get a first class honours in NTU than in NUS engineering.</p>
              <p>But since both unis are equally recognised in singapore and probably rest of the world, it might be a bargain to go into NTU instead.</p>

              <p>Lol weewee, that's an interesting comparison, but don't forget that getting first class honours also depends on projects and not soley on examinations, which basically means having to work with your peers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Theoretically" an AAA student from NUS is more likely to perform better than a BBB student in NTU, hence project mates in NUS will theoretically be more capable. This may help you to score well in projects, provided you keep up with them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then again, theory is bullshit in the real world (NS taught me that =.=). It still takes alot of hard work and adaptation to earn a first class honours IMO.</p>

              <p>Bio science can be useful in major pharma companies , cosmetics , surgical and other med/bio specialized field.</p>
              <p>Think global.</p>
              <p>You may start low, but like any job, it's what you can do that decides how high you can fly.</p>
              <p>If you are really interested in bio science, go for it.</p>
              <p>Scope out the difference in the course outline. Decide what you
                                      want to study.</p>

Without a postgrad degree, you are only able to run expt and stuff for your chief investigator/scientist(not exactly washing test tube though).However since singapore does invest rather heavily in this sector, I guess you could probably find some job doing some futile research here. Anyway at least honours degree required here i think. I only had a basic degree and the staff look me no up.</p></div>

              <p>I find your comments about job prospect in biological (life) sciences very positive.  I believe there are jobs available besides just doing pure research alone. From your knowledge, think you can share on specific types of jobs that can be found in pharma companies , cosmetics , surgical and other med/bio specialized field?  And how well they are paid?</p>

              <p>hi i got accepted into ntu's biological sciences.</p>
              <p>it think its abit too much that those new graduates can only get to wash test-tubes. in fact, its really out of the question. haven't you guys heard of lab assistants just like those in your sec sch/jc? <br>although i must agree, one must study masters or even phd to do well in this sector but im still optimistic. of course, there are alwyas cases where you can venture out of your own field into others (biz?) my parents and bro have been working  for a v long time alr and ithey tell me that many pple dont do what they actually studied.  so i think having a degree (which is at least recognized and of some standard) is good enough</p>
              <p>my bro studied computer engineering in us but he's an auditor in the top 4 accounting and audit firms now. just to encourage those and i hope this helps.</p>

              <p><br>no such thing. Grass is always greener on the other side. Now there's oil crisis, rice crisis, leading to bank collapse and many other things. Lots of companies are retrenching and thinking twice about hiring more pple. Stock market is bad. Now is the worse time in a decade to be looking for a decent job lor.</p>
