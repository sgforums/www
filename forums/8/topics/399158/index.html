              <p>manic depression. I am a bit like that also.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana, Helvetica; line-height: normal; font-size: small; color: #222222;"><strong>Manic depressive - What does it mean?</strong><br>Manic depressive refers to mood swings from overly “high” (manic) to overly “low” (depressed). Another name for manic-depressive illness is bipolar disorder. This refers to a person’s mood alternating between “poles” of mania (highs) and depression (lows). Bipolar disorder is a brain disorder that causes unusual changes in the person’s mood, energy, and ability to function. <br><br>Manic-depressive illness or bipolar disorder affects both men and women. Although it can start at any age, it usually begins in late adolescence. Bipolar disorder is found among people of all ages, races, ethnic groups, and social classes. It appears to have a genetic link and tends to run in families. Unfortunately, in addition to affecting the sufferer’s life, this disease also has the potential to devastate the lives of the caregivers and those in the immediate family circle.</span></p>

              <p>Well i am also like that. But i guess there is a limit. Repeating the same thing 3000 times is tiring. If your BF is doing that to another girl, i suggest go with him also. Couples must have a basic level of trust.</p>
