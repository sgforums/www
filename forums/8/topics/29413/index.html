            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;">3 years ago, it was my final year in my secondary school. During the last few months in school, I have the chance to meet a girl, then in Secondary 2. When I first seeing her at the assembly area, I started wanting to be her friend. However, some of my classmates dislikes her because she was a prefect, and so I did not have the chance to approach her.<br><br>Every night, I will be thinking of her. I don't know why is that so. Maybe is the feeling. I went online to the school's chatroom to look for her but she was not there. Asking her friends about her, most of them don't know.<br><br>After my final year, I have even lesser and lesser time to see her. Have to say, only 1 year at most 2-3 times, which include going back to school for teacher's day and chinese new year celebration.<br><br>Once, I went to school to look for her. I want to make friend with her. However, when she came out of her school, there was too many people. I do not have any chance to approach her. Therefore, what was in my mind was: Follow her to her place, at the void deck, walk up to her and ask her to friend.<br><br>However, upon reaching the place, I lost touch with her. Then I went home and went to irc. Surprisingly, I saw her there and she admitted that she is the girl. I told her that I wanted to be her friend and to be very honest with her, I told her I followed her home. Actually, I should not tell her. She was angry with me and I knew I was in the wrong.<br><br>How, I deciding whether I should stop this 3 years torture or not. Even if she really agree to be a normal friend with me, will we have any chance to go for a meal, show, etc? Will she? Will I get to see her often even? Worse still, I will be enlisted for NS very soon, prehaps mid of next year.<br><br>Should I rather go for my few best male friends instead, who are all without girlfriends?<br><br>I have been thinking of her these few days and it is making me sick.<br><br>I really hope that any of you can suggest to me. I am very frustrated already and I hope no stupid comments. Hoping all of you can understand my situation and need some good and usable advise. Any of you with such problem can also comment and share your view.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>maybe u just have to take it step by step....<br>perhaps you are scaring the girl by following her home and asking for her photos.. just take it easy.. i suggest u let her 'rest' for a while.. dun look for her for a period of time.. if u want can call her and see how she react to it.. if she is hostile then call some other time.. seriously, i think i understand how she feels coz i also gana this kind of case before.. so i think the best way is to leave her alone so that she not so 'fan gan' anymore then you go befriends with her..</div>
