Maybe your cousin didn't put in enough effort for wat is necessary to get the 2 bonus points? Or maybe it's just that Scouts don't have much events to participate in.<br><br>I was in NPCC, and to say the truth, getting 2 bonus points was a piece of cake. With each promotion of rank, we gain CCA points, and during NPCC Day Parade, SYF or National Day Parade, we can gain points if we participate as well. HahaZ~<br><br>And the thing about gals joining choir and stuff... Maybe they juz like to sing. After all, if a person knows that her singing is horrible but she hates sweating, she wouldn't join choir just to avoid the sun, would she? Lol.. But i do agree that there are many ppleZ who join CCAs purely for the sake of the CCA points. But those ppleZ, because they cannot bring themselves to attend that particular CCA, ends up switching CCAs or worse still, having no CCA at all, and since CCA points automatically "disappears" once a person leaves the CCA., there's not much point in it, is there?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Okie...how many of the people who participate in sgforums is known by Mr Tharman? I think he should mentioned some or a few Singapore students instead of using Singapore students.<br><br>Well, there are a lot of Singapore people who are born with an opportunitist spirit. Young students are probably more ambitious as last time when policemen wear shorts. Simply because they know more things about life without having to learn them through the hard way. One concrete proof of this is that our people are far more worldwide recognised in this world right now than 30 to 40 years ago. RIght now you go overseas and some ang mohs ask you where you are from...ang mohs always think we are from China. So when you tell them you are from Singapore...they go "ohh...ahh....yeahh....". I think 30 to 40 years ago, if you tell them you are from Singapore...they probably ask "Where is it?...what pore?" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyway, it sounds more like a personal complain from our Acting Education Minister...nothing more than that. I feel that as an Acting Education Minister, he should come out with more motivated words to encourage the Singapore students to be adventurous, always hungry, willing to take on difficulty and turn it into advantage and etc. Personally, I enjoy a speech from our PM Goh anytime because he is more articulate in his speech and his solutions are usually refreshing to me.<br><br>I hope Mr Tharman can put more effort in his speech and resolutions and start behaving like a real Education Minister instead of an Acting Education Minister.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
