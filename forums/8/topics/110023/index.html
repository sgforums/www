            <div class='col-md body'>bedok jetty fished out already. If you wanna catch taman then dats fine..still quite fun. Go just after a heavy rain sure can catch a lot.<br><br>Best place for crabs using cast net is sembawang but the mud crabs are getting smaller and smaller also going to be fished out soon. Somemore water there got oil slick not very healthy to eat the crabs.<br><br>Before jurong island was "sealed" I used to go quite frequent, there also have big monsters and ever heard stories of 50 pound shimano handline burst. But normally just rock dwellers like snapper.<br><br>So far if I wanna go fishing labardor or tanjung berlayer is still the best for me. I remember 1 pitch black night after a heavy rain 3 of us only left in the whole park we caught over 40 gar fish that was the best ever. There are still quite a lot of good fish there at certain spots but won't say where and what type as I dun wan people to know otherwise kanna fished out by kiasu and kiasi people.<br><br>There are also other spots, with public transport like west coast(follow the canal) and behind the old seagate senoko(rumoured to be kim bak lor there)<br><br>jurong area some abandoned factories by the sea also can try.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1) long time never fish already... last time used to fish around Kallang river(opposite of national stadium, near police coast guard), there got kim bak lor, jio ming and catfish. Dunno now that area still can fish or not. (used live prawns/fishes cos water quite calm)<br><br>2) Another favourite spot is Changi beach at night, beside the jetty with hovercraft(left side of the jetty). There got many sting ray, grouper and catfish. (caught red garoupa too). (used live prawns/worms)<br><br>3) Lor Halus also not bad..many angler's fav spot.<br><br>4) Tanah merah ferry terminal there.. at big big canal or around there.<br><br>5) Lastly, bedok jetty. But i myself never kenna big fish before. If you just wanna have fun and hook some fish, can try the smallest hook with those dunno what worms(pple always sell them in sawdust) as bait. I remember once.. a prompfret(if i never see wrongly) got away while im reeling back. Hooked many other types of small fishes(slightly bigger than hand size) too. (live prawns/fishes/worms)<br><br></div>
