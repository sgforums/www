If NS is compulsory for females, what should govt do to girls who are and will be pregnant, or have already had children?<br><br>2. If those females mentioned above are exempted/excused from NS, wouldn't that create an increased situation where girls get pregnant just to "skip" NS. Sometimes loving parents will be willing to support an early marriage just so that their daughters do not go thru NS.<br><br>These are 2 already very controversial issues which makes females NS a very hard thing to decide on.

(2 is actually not sufficient)<br><br>A mom had to undergo at least 18 months of suffering for those 2 babies Singapore needs. That's equivalent to 1 1/2 years of NS.

Women can only be attached to support and office work.<br><br>Women who are pregnant would be having a long leave and if both parents are tied down to NS and in-laws are working.. SAF may need to create more unnecessary childcare centres... (WAHAHAHAHAHAHA BUILD Childcare centre in SAF bases? kena bomb whole family kong ka kiao)<br><br>There will also be a need to provide unnecessary equipment, stores, e.g. clothings, shoes, to fit a woman's natural petite size and bodyshape.<br><br>Having women is a distraction to men who're being forced to stay in-camps and may lead to abuses, ill-treatment and possible complications.<br><br>Thereafter, unnecessary buildings will be needed to cater to the needs of these women due to the big influx. and Singapore being limited in land area.. would be having problem housing them....<br><br>*yawns*<br><br>i don't think i want to elaborate more on this issue. It's ridiculous inconvenient to have women in camps.</div></blockquote></div>

The General's Daughter was one of them.  She was known to do well in her studies and training... an 'A' student.<br>One night, at the exercise, the General's Daughter was humtum, tied up and gang raped by a group of her fellow school mates.  She got pregnant after that and had an abortion.  She was told by her father the General to keep quiet, due to some political reasons.<br><br>I was told that this movie was based on a true story.  Dunno true or not.</div></blockquote>To get some facts straight, first the show <span style="color: red;">did not </span>feature harrison ford. It starred john travolta and madeline stowe (no she was not the gen's daughter either)<br><br>Secondly, the story was based on a true story. The investigators later convicted all the perps involved in the gang rape of the female officer. Coincidently, the incident took place during a brigade-size military night exercise.<br><br>Thirdly, the general was planning to run for congress. That prompted him to keep things quiet.<br><br>And for ppl reading this, this took place in the US army, in USA where they branish sniper rifles and go on a multi-state shoot-spree, the land of opportunity where insane goofballs train bull mastiffs how to murder innocent neighbours.<br><br>Highly unlikely such extreme things will happen in our fine nation. At most there will be the occasional MCPs and minor harrassment incidents.....<br><br>damn those are tough to wipe out too...</div>
