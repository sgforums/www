All the damn adverts here are narrated by people with a northern accent. Its a very irritating accent, sounds like they're tryin to gargle with a mouthful of mud. But why are all the narrators people with northern accents? Apparently 10 years ago a survey was done to see which accent is sexiest. Scottish was sexiest, northern accents 2nd.

Lets leave it out for the moment and concentrate on the issue.<br><br>Germans didnt learn english as a 1st language. Italians didn't learn english as a 1st language. French sure as hell didn't learn english as a 1st language. But we're not china. we're singapore. We DID learn english as a 1st language. That was a lousy comparism there. As for texans, if u're talking about the rednecks who don't have much education, then yea they do. So in the end, u're telling me, the only valid excuse for singaporeans not to speak good english is a low educational standard then. Soooo then, who wants to show that they are uneducated?

If one doesn't like things in the country, one always has the right to speak up and fight for changes. Join PAP and work your way up? My dear, you make us sound like a communist country. Perhaps we are? Join the "party" before we can make any changes? Then again, that is doomed to failure. If you don't stay in line in the party, how are u going to move high enough to change anything? If u do stay in line, it won't be long before u're corrupted as well.

However, its not the same for others. People use too much singlish online and even when abroad. And that is why a backlash against singlish has arisen. Its only natural. Bashing the threadstarter won't do singlish itself any good. See? It's simpler.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Singlish or English?</strong></span><br><br>In my own opinion, what matters most is our ability to code-switch. For all of you out there who don't know what is 'code-switching',<br><br>Code-switching is a term in linguistics referring to alternation between two or more languages, dialects, or language registers in the course of discourse between people who have more than one language in common. Sometimes the switch lasts only for a few sentences, or even for a single phrase.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">-- wikipedia.com</span><br><br>To me, speaking Singlish is just code-switching. Throw in some malay, chinese, hokkien or even some alien language and viola!<br><br>By speaking Singlish, it doesn't mean that we are not proficient in English. The most important thing is to know when to code-switch, and when to not. If we are speaking to our own group of friend, i don't see why we can't throw in a few 'lor's or 'la's in our conversation. If our intended meaning is not distorted by our frequent lors and las, i think it is perfectly okay to speak in Singlish.<br><br>Just do not make a fool out of yourself by speaking in such proficient Singlish such that other people, such as foreigners, do not even understand what we are trying to say.  I believe this is what the Speak Good English Movement is all about. To speak good English is not about using bombastic vocabulary, but simply being grammatically correct and not using our Singapore speak that often.</div>
