This is due to the fact that both these products sucks out impurities deep and the appearances of pimples attest to the fact that the impurities are surfacing to be purged as pimples.

I think my distributor is selling more and more ex. Anyone can recommend another distributor for me?<br><br>I would recommend Prescriptive anti-blemish lotion as it is the most effective of all the other brands I have tried. Especially for those pimples that contain pus in them...they are the most "poisonous" of the whole lot of pimples, and they take the longest to heal. This lotion that I tried will stop the itching and prevent bacteria from spreading on the face. So try it. The down side is that, it is also expensive...<br></div>

Go check out all the top range products, even at retail price, it is very competitive.<br><br>Suggest you join as member, so u can get at wholesale price.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> DuH<br><br>------------------<br>yeah yeah yeah, boogie woogie spit it out at <a href="http://www.my77thstreet.com" rel="nofollow">www.my77thstreet.com</a></div>
