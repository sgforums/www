            <div class='col-md body'>ya the main problem is highlighted by heng.. in one earth day ISS sun rise and set 16 times.. also they can't prepare food regularly cause the food is packed specially.. dehydrated etc.. they need machines in space to rehydrate the food etc.. and lets not forget food flies away, water droplets are balls floating around.. etc..<br><br>also they have to exercise frequently or else muscles will have problem and cant even stand up when back on earth.. then if space shuttles and russian spacecraft grounded etc. have to ration even more.. even oxygen itself is a commodity.. haiz.. gd luck to them</div>
