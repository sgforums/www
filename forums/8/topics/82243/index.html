I think you must see what you enjoy since if you enjoy it can study easily. Some people in my class breeze through Jap 1 like nothing like that...haha I struggle but still struggle happily. French my friends a lot take...popular especially among the girls  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  But that's according to my school...I'm not IT. I'm the people invading your territory always haha School of Design. Hardly anyone took Marketing I noe...only a couple. But I hear it's pretty useful. More useful than the languages if you don't intend to work in France or Japan.</div>

I had also study Jap for 1 sem then after that i just forgot most of it as I do not continue on my own.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
