            <div class='col-md body'>This is my first posting in this forum though i have been reading the other posts often.just wanna know how many ppl had this kinda feeling....<br><br>Have any of you wished you had made that first move to approach that girl and then hesitated for god knows what reason ?<br><br>I just had to get this damm feeling of my chest...<br><br>During my jc days, i met this girl who later then became my classmate.. from the moment i saw her i was like gosh that sure is one nice girl.. and i was rite. She has a heart of gold, considerate, demure and humourous..<br>basically she was my dream girl...<br><br>I dunno why i never did muster the courage to ask her out.  Maybe i feared rejection and god knows what..<br><br>Then one fine day.. a few years later..<br>i called her and we had a nice chat. Then she dropped the question if i liked her.<br>I was stunned for a while.. but still did let her know how i felt for her..<br><br>Sometimes i just wished i had asked her out and things would have picked up from there... but nooo... i had to sit in the corner ... apparently our feelings for each other were mutual..and she was waiting for me.<br><br>Now she is already attached and i am still single... sometimes it pains me to see her.. cos i knew we could be together..<br><br>I just came back from her birthday celebration and when i saw her with her bf, it was so damm miserable for me... but still it was her day and i should in no way spoil it.<br><br>Sometimes i wish i had taken the initiative to ask her out.. then things might have been different..<br><br>If only.............................  : (<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i feel for you DD, i really do...<br>but at least you know that the feeling is reciprocal, even if it was a while ago, cuz no matter what, whenever she thinks of you, she will remember you for all those qualities that made her like you initially, and i don't think that feeling will ever disappear.  and it's not utterly hopeless, seriously.  sometimes, all we could do is just be positive and be the eternal optimist.<br>somehow, you have to believe that hopefully she will make the right decision...but take heart, at least you know for a fact that she likes you...<br>and if things don't go quite your way, then i suppose that's life...<br>all the best for you buddy...i wish you all the luck in the world...<br><br>cheers!<br><br>------------------<br>Underneath the Southern Cross I stand...</div>
