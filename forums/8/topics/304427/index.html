I was speeding down the as I was late  ..  this stupid girl was crossing the road yakking on the phone and did not see me coming.  She was walking with a small crowd.  The rest stopped at the middle of the road as it is a two way traffic, she didn't stop.  I had to brake so hard, the screeching sound was damn bloody loud and my tyres actually had smoke coming out of it.  I managed to stop in time ...

This is my take ... life is more important than anything else.  But if one do not take care of his/her life, how much can we do.  I may slow down and suddenly she jump out ... still will accident, as much as I am right, I will not feel good too ..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br></div>

I was speeding down the as I was late  ..  this stupid girl was crossing the road yakking on the phone and did not see me coming.  She was walking with a small crowd.  The rest stopped at the middle of the road as it is a two way traffic, she didn't stop.  I had to brake so hard, the screeching sound was damn bloody loud and my tyres actually had smoke coming out of it.  I managed to stop in time ...  I hate to think what would happen if I didn't... ..</div></blockquote>if you didnt, that means less one stupid ppl in  this world hehe<br></div>
