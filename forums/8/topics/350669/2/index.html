              <p>by photographers i meant those that are using DSLR camera to shoot for street photography. it's not that we(photographers) want to invade your privacy it is just that when we see something that inspires us, our automatic move is too capture the moment before it is too late! but if we ask for permision to shoot the picture of someone in the street, the feeling of the picture is lost already. i hope you guys and ladies could be more friendly and open towards street photography :] cheers everybody!</p>

              <p>I like to take photographs of the public; like a bunch of people crossing at a traffic junction, you can capture so many natural expressions. But I have never intentionally focused on one particular person before, not in public anyway.</p>
              <p>But if i were to do so, I would take the shot before they are even aware of it, so that their character/emotion can be preserved, THEN i would ask for permission. But that depends, if it's just random pictures (not intended for any display) and if people are just passing by, i may not catch up to them to ask permission.</p>
              <p>But I do not think it warrants permission unless you are selling the shots. But then again it depends what sort of pictures. If it were for a screening/gallery, ofcourse you ask for permission and their names to sign off on it, because that's the right thing to do. But one should never openly take pictures of people, because it can be so awkward.</p>

              <p>On the street, the photographer can say he is taking the lamp-post or dustbin, and you happen to be there. Don't like, don't come out.</p>

              I would use my palm to cover my eyes to spoil his shot.
              
              Happened to me a few times like on the bus;
              
              1) people pretending to take pics of themselves while sitting infront of me, but the hp camera lens is pointing @ me
              
              2) girl holding her hp camera lens in such a way that the len is pointing @ me
              
              I know de and I always use my palm to cover my eyes. Not to look awkward but to let people know that I know they're taking pics of me!

              <p>i won't even dare to approach the guy in the first place, what if he try to do something funny? moreover, he may just be using it as a tactic to talk to gals, and I definitely won't be giving him the satisfaction of talking to me</p>
              <p>when i was sec 4 i met this guy at bishan taking my pic, i confronted him and then he tried chatting me up, telling me he'll only delete if i go out with him for lunch. my 6th sense tell me this guy was not right and i quickly walked away, and he followed me and i was very scared cos I was alone. I told him i'll scream and call police if he stilll follow me, luckily he stopped after that, and I practically ran home</p>
              <p>to gals: if you are alone never confront the person, stay safe and walk away</p>

              <p>I once took a photo of a trishaw uncle with permission. He gladly let me take his photos and even strike me a pose by putting his legs on the bicycle handle and relax.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I then drew the picture of him together with backgrounds of old torn buildings for my project.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for me, I'm more open to public for taking my photos. As long as its not offensive. Eg.. took photos of my forgotten-to-zipped pants. Opps.... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/embarrassed.png" alt="embarrassed.png"></p>

              <p>hey guys and ladies</p>
              <p>if you people were walking or hanging out at town or street area, and you saw a photographer trying to take a picture of you. do you find this offensive? would you give him a pissed off look or shun him or just act like normal so as too not destroy his shot?</p>
