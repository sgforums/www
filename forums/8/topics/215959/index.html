            <div class='col-md body'>I have very big clique problems. I have this clique of about 6. But everytime when our clique have problems, we'll solve among ourselves as soon as possible. That only involves in girls i know. Boys doesn't have this kinda things yeah. I have this friend in my clique that always like teasing people, calling people names but everyone won't call her names. I also don't know why. Today, cause she had a bad hair day, i said that her hair so ugly. Didn't really mean it on purpose, it just came out of my mouth all of a sudden. She ran to the toilet and cried. Cried until school was over. I didn't understand her, people said that her hair was ugly and she cried? Didn't really make any sense please. Somemore she also always tease me with my hair too. I never say anything and let her be. I just ignore her. My whole clique seemed to be on her side too. So i went with another clique, and they were really nice to me.  They told me what to do. They ask me not to apologize to her as she is not a good friend. I don't know about it. I didn't wanted to have friends i don't talk to. I messaged her and said sorry. She didn't reply. Should i call her or something or apologize to her personally? I'm really stuck ):</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ivenely:</div><div class="quote_body">I have very big clique problems. I have this clique of about 6. But everytime when our clique have problems, we'll solve among ourselves as soon as possible. That only involves in girls i know. Boys doesn't have this kinda things yeah. I have this friend in my clique that always like teasing people, calling people names but everyone won't call her names. I also don't know why. Today, cause she had a bad hair day, i said that her hair so ugly. Didn't really mean it on purpose, it just came out of my mouth all of a sudden. She ran to the toilet and cried. Cried until school was over. I didn't understand her, people said that her hair was ugly and she cried? Didn't really make any sense please. Somemore she also always tease me with my hair too. I never say anything and let her be. I just ignore her. My whole clique seemed to be on her side too. So i went with another clique, and they were really nice to me.  They told me what to do. They ask me not to apologize to her as she is not a good friend. I don't know about it. I didn't wanted to have friends i don't talk to. I messaged her and said sorry. She didn't reply. Should i call her or something or apologize to her personally? I'm really stuck ):</div></blockquote><span style="color: blue;"><br>It's quite a common scenario in teenage cliques.. sounds like ur friend there is still at a growing stage, insecure about her own personal image and dealing with alot of changes in hormones.. it's a confusing time of her life.  That's why she teases the rest of u to make herself look better (weapon of mass distraction).. and since nobody actually dared to tell her off till you came along, she thinks her behaviour is acceptable (or even encouraged).<br><br>2 things - you can either walk away, or apologize to her.  Try talking to her one more time, after things have cooled off a bit.. listen to what she has to say.  Whether u extend ur friendship to her again will be entirely up to you..<br><br>Personally I'd go for the whole apology thing to cover my own back (You do not want to be the star of "House of Flying Daggers", trust me)!  .. but remember to state why you are surprised she would mind since she does it every day to others... at least this way, no one will be able to fault you!   You might even earn yourself some unexpected admirers at school..<br><br>Keep things simple and soon you'll be an expert in handling these situations <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>haha apologise? i wouldn't even think of apologising to people like her.<br>i have people like that in my work place, i used to put up with the verbal abuse but it gets to a point when its unbearable .  these people like to make themselves happy by putting others down, with friends like these who needs enemies. right now my days are more peaceful since my colleagues know that i would give the same treatment back , sad to say some tension comes with it since i'm no longer as "easy going " in their eyes but you have to stand up for your rights or get trample over</div>
