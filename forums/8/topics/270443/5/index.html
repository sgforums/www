It's true and it just happened to my friends.<br><br>Just now I saw a group of people crowding around under a unit in my block. The unit was on the second storey. Curious, I walked over and asked them what had happened. One of them, a receptionist told me they are checking if there is anyone in the room. Apparently, someone complained of receiving anonymous phone calls.<br><br>The room, just for you info, is locked on the outside. The accumulated bills and the padlocked doors are pretty much proof that the owner is not in as he is now in another province. The bills are always paid on time through bank transfer.<br><br>Ok, so now we know that no one is in the room, it is padlocked and the owner is not in the unit for at least 2 months plus.<br><br>But weird things start happening recently...<br><br>Many people received funny calls, normally with static and no answer. These calls go from room to room and normally several times a day. The management office on the ground floor alone received it several times... and normally it is the same, just static.<br><br>So the office called to check with the owner and the owner confirmed that there should be no one inside. No one at all and that he has locked the door with padlock too.<br><br>So out of curiousity, last night someone called the room. Some one answered... "Sawatdee Ka". Shocked, the caller hung up and was covered in goosebumps. They tried calling again but no answer... determined, they went up to check but the door was locked... from the outside.<br><br>Someone must be inside... but who? Today they climbed up through the balcony to take a look but no one was inside...<br><br>The calls as shown on the computer was traced to that room. The calls made was not only to one room but several different room.<br><br>Who could be making those calls?<br><br></div></blockquote>Hey share the location and address leixz!</div>
