It's true and it just happened to my friends.<br><br>Just now I saw a group of people crowding around under a unit in my block. The unit was on the second storey. Curious, I walked over and asked them what had happened. One of them, a receptionist told me they are checking if there is anyone in the room. Apparently, someone complained of receiving anonymous phone calls.<br><br>The room, just for you info, is locked on the outside. The accumulated bills and the padlocked doors are pretty much proof that the owner is not in as he is now in another province. The bills are always paid on time through bank transfer.<br><br>Ok, so now we know that no one is in the room, it is padlocked and the owner is not in the unit for at least 2 months plus.<br><br>But weird things start happening recently...<br><br>Many people received funny calls, normally with static and no answer. These calls go from room to room and normally several times a day. The management office on the ground floor alone received it several times... and normally it is the same, just static.<br><br>So the office called to check with the owner and the owner confirmed that there should be no one inside. No one at all and that he has locked the door with padlock too.<br><br>So out of curiousity, last night someone called the room. Some one answered... "Sawatdee Ka". Shocked, the caller hung up and was covered in goosebumps. They tried calling again but no answer... determined, they went up to check but the door was locked... from the outside.<br><br>Someone must be inside... but who? Today they climbed up through the balcony to take a look but no one was inside...<br><br>The calls as shown on the computer was traced to that room. The calls made was not only to one room but several different room.<br><br>Who could be making those calls?<br><br>Hey, anyone know what happened to this story?<br>Me very kay-poh and want to know ler?<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys, sorry for the absence.<br><br>Regarding the lock, it's normal for residents in apartments in Bangkok to padlock their doors when they are away as ex-residents may have duplicated the key to the place, hence the need to padlock when they are not in the unit.<br><br>Anyway back to the updates. I happened to be around as I asked the guys there to call me once the owner is back, haha typical KPO.<br><br>*****************<br><br>The owner returned two nights ago, and along with her she had her friend to accompany her. Upon seeing the security guard, she asked if the calls had ceased but the security guard replied that the calls persisted. Hearing this, she requested that the security guard accompany them back to their unit.<br><br>Her face appeared rather calm throughout but I could sense she was uneasy about the whole incident. After she gathered her things, the three of them proceeded to the unit.<br><br>(At this point we were not with them at the unit, so the rest of us just waited downstairs.)<br><br>Once the security guard returned, he mentioned that there was nothing suspicious in the room. Along with the stale air in the room, there was no evidences pointing towards any form of occupancy at all. However he remarked that he had goosebumps upon stepping into the room.<br><br>He had also tested the phone several times while in the room, making calls to the ground floor security post and there was nothing wrong with the phone. On our receiving end, those who had received the calls before commented that it was nothing like the previous calls which had only the sound of static.<br><br>The owner had also requested to have the phone changed and her request was promptly acceeded to.<br><br>The phone looks slightly older than the one in my unit. It was yellowish and the numbers faded, but apart from that, it looks to be just another phone. Soon we put the phone to several experiments. The first test was to determine whether the phone was faulty. We did several calls with the phone and the calls were reportedly fine.<br><br>After the tests, some questions still remains.<br><br>1. How was the phone able to make calls to different units on it's own? If the redial button was faulty, it should only have been to the same unit, but different units on different floors? Unlikely.<br><br>2. Why was the static sound heard when the tests we did revealed normal comms. And who was the lady on the end of the line?<br><br>3. Why did the calls only start 2 weeks ago when the owner was well away for 2 months? Should the fault lies with the phone, it should have started much earlier. Why did the calls ceased when the owner was around? (no calls for the past 24 hours)<br><br>I've been observing the unit today at intervals, all the lights were switched on approx 5pm including the balcony lights. Apparently the owner is still feeling the chills. I'd also noticed some offerings at the ground floor just below the unit. It consisted of some incense and 3 cups of red fanta. If the owner was keeping ''something or someone'', she shouldn't be so frightened by the whole incident.<br><br>Apparently this was not the first incident with this apartment, as I've also had a slight brush with the supernatural, or what appears to be an encounter. I've also heard other stories. Maybe it's just our wild imaginations, but I've learnt never to dismiss the existence of things or beings beyond the realms of science.<br><br>I will post any updates as and when there is one.</div>
