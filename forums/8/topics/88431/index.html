You just have to step out there to explore it yourself, soon you will find there is a lot of guys out there who is more suitable for you and don't mind your past.<br><br>Your fear is keeping you from making that step. Ask yourself what is there to fear when you already does not fear dead as you even think of commit suicide. The outside world cannot be that more frightening.<br><br>Your boyfriend is a pro, who can read your mind very well, he knows how to do little things that tied your heart down. But for someone who go to a prostitue and phone you to listen is a nutcase who will never be able to give you happyness. Whatever promise he give is nothing, marrying him is even a bigger mistake. Take the courage and leave him !<br></div>
