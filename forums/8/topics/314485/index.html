              <p>Some <em>really</em> like it hot.</p>
              <p>In the sordid tradition of peddling raunchy video footage of celebrities <em>a la</em> <a href="http://www.nypost.com/news/p/hilton_paris/hilton_paris.htm">Paris Hilton</a>, a long-buried sex movie of Marilyn Monroe recently hit the market, a top collector told The Post.</p>
              <p>An illicit copy of the steamy, still-FBI-classified reel - 15
              minutes of 16mm film footage in which the original blond bombshell
              performs oral sex on an unidentified man - was just sold to a New York
              businessman for $1.5 million, said Keya Morgan, the well-known
              memorabilia collector who discovered the film and brokered its
              purchase.</p>
              <p>The footage appears to have been shot in the 1950s. When it came to
              light in the mid-'60s, then-FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover had his agents
              spend two weeks futilely trying to prove that Monroe's sex partner was
              either John F. Kennedy or Robert F. Kennedy, according to declassified
              agency documents and interviews, Morgan said.</p>
              <p>The silent black-and-white flick shows Monroe on her knees in front of a man whose face is just out of the shot.</p>
              <p>He never moves into the shot, indicating that he knew the camera
              was there, but Monroe never looks at the lens, said Morgan, who saw the
              footage.</p>
              <p>Morgan said he discovered the film while doing research for a
              documentary on Monroe, after talking with a former FBI agent who told
              him about a confidential informant who tipped G-men to the existence of
              the film in the mid-'60s.</p>
              <p>The feds eventually confiscated the original footage - but not
              before the informant made a copy of it, which is what was just sold by
              his son, Morgan said.</p>
              <p>There are heavily redacted, declassified FBI documents talking about a "French-type" film.</p>
              <p>They state the informant "exhibited [to agents] a motion picture
              which depicted deceased actress Marilyn Monroe committing a perverted
              act upon a unknown male," Morgan said.</p>
              <p>The informant was with at least one mobster at the time, the documents state.</p>
              <p>According to the documents, "Former baseball star Joseph DiMaggio
              in the past had offered [the informant] $25,000 for this film, it being
              the only one in existence, but he refused the offer.</p>
              <p>"Source advised that [redacted name of the mole] informed them that
              he had obtained this film prior to the time Marilyn Monroe had achieved
              stardom."</p>
              <p>Morgan said he got the deceased informant's name from the former
              FBI agent who tipped him off to the flick - and was floored after he
              found the mole's son in Washington, DC, and the man retrieved a film
              canister from a safe-deposit box and spooled it up.</p>
              <p>"You see instantly that it's Marilyn Monroe - she has the famous mole," Morgan said.</p>
              <p>"She's smiling, she's very charming, she's very radiant, but she's
              known for being radiant," he said. "She moves away, and then it [the
              footage] stops."</p>
              <p>Last month, he brokered its sale, leading the informant's son to a
              wealthy New York businessman who wants to keep this unseemly part of
              Monroe's past buried.</p>
              <p>"He said he's just going to lock it up," Morgan said.</p>
              <p>"He said, 'I'm not going to make a <a href="http://www.nypost.com/news/p/hilton_paris/hilton_paris.htm">Paris Hilton</a> out of her. I'm not going to sell it, out of respect.' "</p>
