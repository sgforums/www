            <div class='col-md body'>Another 1 just died, probably this early morning. What a way to start a new day. The 1 that died was the one which was always on its back swimming. I noticed last night that it wasn't too sensitive to touch. Normally,when I touch the tail fin slightly, it would quickly swim right to the bottom and away. Last night, when I touched it again, it didn't move. Only when I touched the body twice, then it moved and swam away.<br>Also,I noticed the breathing was slightly slower even though the strength of each breath was the same.<br><br>On the other hand, the 4 fishes left in the tank was swimming rather actively. But the water has become very dirty with some of the food that sunk to the bottom and also some of the fish waste materials.<br><br>God bless.</div>
