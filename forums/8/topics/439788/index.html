              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I have been given this advice by two person already...</p>
              <p>Now is a sellers market in terms of property and hence it is unwise to sell and then buy a property...</p>
              <p>Why don't I just sell of my HDB flat as it will command a higher price now and stay in a rented apartment until the time when the bubble burst and then buy a property again.</p>
              <p>In the meantime I am looking at $100K to invest in a business of my choice. Of course I have put aside 2 years worth of rental from the income I gained from selling my HDB flat...</p>
              <p>Is this a sound advice...</p>
              <p>Thank you for reading and giving this message your attention...</p>

              <p>That's the basic idea but actually I want to free up some cash, around $100K to start a business in the construction industry...</p>
              <p>I figure that the price of the HDB flat is currently quite high but it's also true that even when the bubble burst eventually,  our currency may have depreciated and hence the price of property may seem to be high due to it even after that time comes. <br><br>But this is the opportune time to release some cash to set up my business without having to take credit from the bank.</p>

              <p>But the price of a smaller unit is unrealistically high... a 3 room flat can fetch as high as $300K.... if I do get a cheaper one, it will almost always comes with a baggage e.g. a target for loanshark (my front door will their arty-farty canvas) or some other undesireable condition...</p>

              <p>I see the current property market as a sellers market rather than a buyer's market which I think will likely be for a couple of years down the road, with the onset of building more houses in the next 2 years the trend will likely reversed... that's why I'd rather go for the rental market than buying a property now...</p>

              <p>You must look at demand vs supply. I really doubt there would appear to be any bubble to be burst in the spore property market. Just look at New York, espcially in Manhattan, even with the subprime crisis, apartment and townhouse lots still worth USD3million and above. In island like Spore, overpopulation and housing problem, I can bet you, the price is going to stay sky high.</p>
              <p>Stick to yer property, don't sell, you may regret.</p>
              <p>However, if you feel you need the 100k desperately by selling it - instead of renting a room, why don't you go to Johor and stay there?</p>

              Risky... trading off something u can fall back on anytime.Seems like too a high risk and relying alot on market speculation. While it is not wrong to believe in what u are thinking of embarking to do, like all gains, lack or risks results in risking nothing and eventually having nothing at all.
              
              How about renting HDB out and secure loans for your investment ? 
              
              Any market, property pros here care to share insights ?

              overpriced ...</p>
              <p>I see the current property market as a sellers market rather
              than a buyer's market which I think will likely be for a couple of
              years down the road, with the onset of building more houses in the
              next 2 years the trend will likely reversed... that's why I'd
              rather go for the rental market than buying a property now...</p>
              <p>This is where this discussion will benefit everyone tuning
              in..</p>

              <p>Risky… trading off something u can fall back on anytime.Seems

              <p>How about renting <span>HDB</span> out and secure loans

              <p>Yes, I like the idea of renting my flat away... stay in Johor and use the difference in rental to pay off the loan I secure to set the business...</p>
              <p>Really slick... </p>

              <p>Its a bad idea as long as it involves renting a property on a long term basis.</p>
              <p>Yes, you can cash out the profits from the sale. But how much cash can you get? after you cleared your bank loan, and return back the portion you used from CPF?</p>
              <p>And how long do you plan to rent? are you going to rent only a room, or renting the whole apartment? nowadays, a room cost around $700-800/month, close to what you are paying monthly <strong>to own </strong>your hdb flat.</p>
              <p>At this rental rate, it would bleed you dry of whatever profits you get from the sale of  your flat.</p>
              <p>If you really want to cash out, it is better that you downgrade immediately. 4 room to 3 room, so that at least you won't waste money on rentals.</p>

              If anyone can predict the market, they are already a billionaire. Are your friends giving you those advice, already a billionaire themselves? If not, are you sure you want to gamble based on friend's advice? Because at the end of the day, cannot blame anyone, must take all the responsibility on yourself if anything goes wrong.
              
              As with all gamble, the most important thing to ask yourself is, if it's lost, are you able to absorb the loss and proceed with your life?

              <p>I have been given this advice by two person already...</p>
              <p>Now is a sellers market in terms of property and hence it is unwise to sell and then buy a property...</p>
              <p>Why don't I just sell of my HDB flat as it will command a higher price now and stay in a rented apartment until the time when the bubble burst and then buy a property again.</p>
              <p>In the meantime I am looking at $100K to invest in a business of my choice. Of course I have put aside 2 years worth of rental from the income I gained from selling my HDB flat...</p>
