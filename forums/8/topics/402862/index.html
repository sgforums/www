              <p>looks like cck is really affected by christianity.</p>
              <p>in this scenario, it has totally got nothing to do with the religion, it's the problem at a individual level. A can proclaim that he is a righteous christian. But that doesn't mean that he "snatching someone's gf" mean that all christians will do the same thing. What if a buddhist snatch a christian's bf? will u be disgusted with the buddhist? if this carries on, u will definitely hate the whole world.</p>
              <p>i bet A is of the same race as u, why not you say that your race sucks?</p>
              <p>if A is of another race, i bet u will detest that race too.</p>
              <p>I got a friend who's gf ran away with a guy who is a hindu, does that make all hindus the same as what you think of christians?</p>
              <p>On the other hand, you don't know what is going on between B and C that makes B want to leave C for A. If the love between B and C is strong, do you think A will still stand a chance?</p>
              <p>cck, i think you should look things from a mature point of view and not jump into conclusions, insulting the religions/ race is not gonna make our society a better place.</p>

              <p>leekeith , wake up and smell the coffee</p>
              <p>what is the thing that i detest?</p>
              <p>is it the religion or something within that religion?</p>
              <p>Think leekeith , think very hard because you have completely missed my line of argument.</p>
              <p>The thing i am disgusted about is the hypocripsy that is showed by A.</p>
              <p>christians are the ones who preached the most when compared to other religion but they do not walk the talk.</p>
              <p>if you are gonna preach about righteousness, i expect you to behave likewise.</p>
              <p>if you talk the talk and dun walk the talk, that cut no ice with me, i assured you.</p>
              <p>Taking advantage of a situation and profit from the loss of a fellow christian is not the way how a christian should behave. it is shameful.</p>

              <p>If C can do the above, then C would've became a better person and his next girlfriend D, would be alot more blessed to be in a relationship with C, as compared to A and B.</p>
              <p>Let GOD deal with such situations, but also let C know that there is no such thing as "robbing/stealing" of girlfriends. Because .....</p>
              <p>YOU CANNOT ROB/STEAL THE UNWILLING!</p>
              <p>Ask C to forgive and bless A and B, andÂ rest all his frustrations upon GOD and remain faithful to GOD, for GOD is an awesome GOD who will definitely bless C with a better girlfriend than B.</p>

              You're really deluded if you think that religious beliefs will overcome sexual temptation, especially since the poor guy is at NS, leaving all the time in the world for his (ex) gf to be with that guy.
              
              When he was alone with her and was able to catch a glimpse of her black panties, the last thing he would do is open the bible, flip to John 3:16 and start reading.

              DEAR CCK
                       its all start some one out the happen to be and chirstian and rob his gf well let it be who ever it is but the real issue is not race or religion first we behave as human and be fair to all when such issue out there is very common what is more important is trust and understanding in a relationship i wonder if this party concern rob his friend gf when she is 50 years old, do you still complain about religion. i see this and out dated issue which is backdated since man was born just be normal and have faith in you
              
              god bless you all
