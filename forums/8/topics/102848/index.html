Haymarket is not as great as QV market here but it is adequate<br><br>Never use a chinese owned tour company at haymarket- the last time we did - the driver insisted on a 5 dollar tip despite bad service , we refused and he refused  to drive back.<br><br>Emergency departments - if you are sick , go see a doctor asap. If on weekend good luck waiting in the ED of Sydney....the wait can take up to 6-8 hrs. If you have a gunshot wound - at least 4 hrs ( I heard this from my sydney priest - he was shot but waited in ED for 4 hrs because as they assumed that he wasn't in pain).  If you want to get seen faster - do what the ladies do - scream shout cry in pretend agony ( if u have no pain)<br><br>Roads - yes the roads to kensington/coogi beach/marouba have lovely views......and traffic jams<br><br>Newtown - worth having a look at ....they have discount clothing sometimes. And lotsa eating places - thai /japanese etc.<br>Glebe too - I used to go to the bade mansion cafe - lovely vegan food.<br><br>Always be kind to beggars and the homeless - u never know when they will help you. I used to buy food for the homeless local beggar ...and one day I was nearly mugged by a bunch of teenagers - he came up with his usual smell and smile at them - they ran.<br><br>When you see a bunch of fellas walking towards you  at night- quickly go to a crowded place/flag a taxi<br><br>At night - never go out once the sun set<br><br>There u go - tips to sydney<br><br></div>

I'm working in Ultimo/Broadway area.  I guess it's easier to make friends when one's a student.

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm living in Sydney, and going to uni here. Well technically I'm not Singporean cos I'm an Australian citizen, but I lived in S'pore for 10 years and completed high school there. Plus, I'm half Singaporean by race.<br><br>Public transport here is a  nightmare, especially on weekends.<br><br>For the best Chinese food in Sydney - take the train to Ashfield or perhaps a bus that goes along Parramatta Rd. Ashfield is known as 'Little Shanghai' to the locals, great Shanghainese food.<br><br>Sydney has fantastic Vietnamese Beef Noodles, known as Pho. Try Pho Pasteur along George Sreet in the city.<br><br>Do NOT ever EVER try 'Malaysian' or 'Singporean' food in the city. It's is never the same as back home, and full expensive too. Yup, the best eating places are at Newtown (great Thai restaurants) and Glebe.<br><br>And it's not true that you can't go out after sunset. If you do, just keep your wits about you and if possible, always walk with another person. People here get mugged often, YES a lot of times by teenagers!<br><br>FYMK: Exactly how do you get to the Temasek Restaurant?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And i forgot, here's a tip to make friends:<br><br>TALK TO PEOPLE!!!<br><br>Australians aren't AT ALL like Singaporeans, they can just walk up to anyone and start a conversation. Talk to shopkeepers, the person sitting next to you on the train, anyone!! Trust me, they will not look at you like you're crazy, unlike Singaporeans.</div>
