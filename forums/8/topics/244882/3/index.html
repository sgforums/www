It was 9.45 pm, npp closes at 10pm (apparently). The 2 duty policemen (they looked young enough to be NSF) were already locking up the station and told us to go Clementi police HQ to make the report. My ex asked how long will it take to fill up a simple report since she had to leave the country the next day. They told her that the station is already locked (it was already locked at 9.45 pm) and they can't open the door again.<br><br>Talk about to serve and protect.<br><br>2nd encounter:<br>My friend got into an accident, 2 cars (including his car which I was a passenger in) collided. The other driver got abusive and violent. I called the police. 1 squad car turned up, asked for all our NRICs, then told us the procedure for a car accident then left. They left despite my pleas to stay and that the other driver was abusive. Upon leaving, the other driver once again started abusing us and turned violent. I called the police again and the same squad car came back. By then the other driver left to avoid the police. The police once again asked for my NRIC and said there is nothing he can do.<br><br>Why he kept asking for my NRIC (twice) instead of resolving the issue at hand? I cannot imagine.<br><br>3rd encounter:<br>My sister got robbed by a snatch thief. She fought back and got her handbag back, but in the process, she got dragged on the road and got hurt quite badly. When she went to report to the police at the station, she was told the only thing they can do is to take her statement, no investigation will be carried out since they cannot trace the robber.<br><br>Obviously this is not what a citizen wants to hear. How can you say there is nothing you can do about a robber?<br><br>4th encounter:<br>My mother had her pocket picked and lost a lot of money in foreign currency (she changed money to go overseas). She reported to the police and the police said they cannot do any investigation unless she personally asked the shopping centre to release the security videos. Apparently, they said they had no power to acquire the security videos from the shopping centre where the pickpocket occurred.<br><br>So, this is the reason why singaporeans sleep well at night?</div></blockquote>agreed. tt day my neighbouring void deck got pple illegal gambling. my friend call e police. n we waited hoping the police will come asap. sadly after 30min. those pple were still gambling happily.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, i would like to say that there is decent policemen and some not too decent policemen, to put it bluntly, some fuck heads.<br><br>This matter happened few years back.It was about 3-4am in the morning and i was walking home with 2 other friends after having supper. A taxi stopped by the road and a couple walked out. The male looked at me and i looked back, unwilling to take my eyes off him as i thought he would be a friend i couldn't recognise.As i looked on, i walked on.And he walked towards me.<br><br>The FIRST thing he said was "you walk very guai lan hor kua kua kua", followed by "IC gia chut lai" and flashed his warrant. We were shocked, gave him our IC with proper respect. What did he do? Act like a typical 14-year-old gangster and blabber in hokkien. Utterly disgusting.<br><br>He then brought us to the void deck and gave us a whole pile of his "life story" and so called "counselling" which was pure BULL. One of the sentences he said was "i wanted to enjoy this day with my girlfriend, but now i have to deal with this", the fuck cares? If he had really wanted to enjoy the day, why bother with us and furthermore carry that disgusting attitude. Stopping us because he FELT that i was walking arrogantly and staring at him? Isn't that our local gangsters? Trust me when i say many gangsters behave BETTER than him. Many gangsters think RIGHTLY, or at least the ones that i know. "To serve and protect" they claim. That policeman grabbed me by the neck and pulled me to a corner. WHY? OHHHH its because i walk arrogantly and stared at him.<br><br>HILARIOUS.<br><br>"To serve and protect" they claim.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How come all the situation listed here i never seen before.<br>However i did went to the nearby NPP to report lost on11B ,the station stated the opening timing to be xxxx (i forgotten) ,but it not open, i call the number of the post listed near the wall and the police officer answer and straight away open the police post,but he seen to be polite and just give me an excuse that he is patrolling outside.<br>But then again he is just an <strong>NSF</strong> lah i mean we<strong> NSFS(whether police army navy scdf air force ,ETC)</strong> are all just nsfs,we are all being forced to serve leh,with the lowly allowances so i think we should really not expected much from an NSF loh.Even though i think his excuse is quite lame,but come on ,why waste your time complaining and you gain nothing out of it?<br>As for TS incident,i think from the way you describe the situation,it really sounds stupid,i mean why he will get his police warrant to show it to your sis and ask for address?All because u look at his dog?It sounds really illogical at all, and since he is with his dog,is he on duty with uniform or he just walking around off duty,i have many friends in my Uni who serve as NS police before and from what they told me,they usually keep low profile,best is nothing happened and hope that the day of their ord came faster,they don't like to find trouble at all,it stupid and waste of their time leh.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First thing first... police warrant, not warrant cards, can only be issued by an ASP or above (if not, the magistrate). It Is extremely unlikely an NS officer to obtain the rank of an ASP and have the power to write a warrant. The ASP also have to write a report justfying why he write the warrant. If he uses the warrant card, it must have a legitimate purpose. That NS person probably is in deep trouble if what you stated is true. About the dog, you cannot prove he steals it. If he just found the dog, then he had committed no offence.<br><br><blockquote>My ex had her passport stolen and we went to make a police report. It was 9.45 pm, npp closes at 10pm (apparently). The 2 duty policemen (they looked young enough to be NSF) were already locking up the station and told us to go Clementi police HQ to make the report. My ex asked how long will it take to fill up a simple report since she had to leave the country the next day. They told her that the station is already locked (it was already locked at 9.45 pm) and they can't open the door again. </blockquote>This may be viewed as a case of laziness but however your ex should really go to another station to make the report. If a normal shop had already closed and locked the door, do you force it to open up and let you do shopping ? Are police really public servants and you can even afford not to be even considerate to them ?<br><br><blockquote>My friend got into an accident, 2 cars (including his car which I was a passenger in) collided. The other driver got abusive and violent. I called the police. 1 squad car turned up, asked for all our NRICs, then told us the procedure for a car accident then left. They left despite my pleas to stay and that the other driver was abusive. Upon leaving, the other driver once again started abusing us and turned violent. I called the police again and the same squad car came back. By then the other driver left to avoid the police. The police once again asked for my NRIC and said there is nothing he can do. </blockquote>The police have to attend to other duties. When they arrive, they can only advise, and the other party probably tame down when the police arrive. No offence has been committed in his view. The policemen have to attend other duties and cannot just stand there and look at you while crimes are being committed at other place. If the situation is under control, it is right that they resume patrol and help out other citizens. The whole world does not revolve around you only.<br><br>The law stated tat being verbally abusive and appear violent is a civil suit. You can ask for a lawyer to fight your case if you demand justice. The police really have no power to do anything unless you want to file a civil suit and they committed the offence in the police view.<br><br><blockquote>My sister got robbed by a snatch thief. She fought back and got her handbag back, but in the process, she got dragged on the road and got hurt quite badly. When she went to report to the police at the station, she was told the only thing they can do is to take her statement, no investigation will be carried out since they cannot trace the robber. </blockquote>If the snatch thief is reported very fast, a message will be broadcast to all the police to look out for the suspect. Otherwise the only sensible thing left to do is to report to the higher authority and they allocate resources for a special operation to lure the snatch thief.<br><br>Other than tat, there is really little tat the police can do. However you can make suggestions on how the investigation should be carried out. I think this is a practical problem. You throw this situation to the police in other part of the world, they can only do so much as well. I find it is hard to believe tat the police answer so undiplomatic though... are you sure these are the exact words they answer ?<br><br><blockquote>My mother had her pocket picked and lost a lot of money in foreign currency (she changed money to go overseas). She reported to the police and the police said they cannot do any investigation unless she personally asked the shopping centre to release the security videos. Apparently, they said they had no power to acquire the security videos from the shopping centre where the pickpocket occurred</blockquote>First, are you sure the money is pickpocketed away and not misplaced ? Does she have a reason to believe it was pickpocketed ? Does she know the rough location where she lost the money ? If your mum do, than the policeman should have the power to view through the security tapes to investigate the case. Otherwise, for a case of misplaced the police cannot afford to waste the manpower to pour through all the security tapes.<br><br><blockquote>agreed. tt day my neighbouring void deck got pple illegal gambling. my friend call e police. n we waited hoping the police will come asap. sadly after 30min. those pple were still gambling happily</blockquote>What happened after 30 minutes ? I think one must realise even if they are gambling, this is not an urgent case and the policemen have to take time to travel from point A to B... And how do you know it is gambling and not playing cards ? They are different. There is a reason why poker card is not banned in singapore.<br><br><blockquote>First of all, i would like to say that there is decent policemen and some not too decent policemen, to put it bluntly, some *^%^ heads.<br><br>...<br></blockquote>If what you say it true and no details hidden, take note of the warrant card and lodge a complaint.<br><br><blockquote>However i did went to the nearby NPP to report lost on11B ,the station stated the opening timing to be xxxx (i forgotten) ,but it not open, i call the number of the post listed near the wall and the police officer answer and straight away open the police post,but he seen to be polite and just give me an excuse that he is patrolling outside. </blockquote>They are now a one man team. If he go to sh!t and there is nobody else, he have to lock the door too. Sad but true.<br><br>Anyway if the comments I made r wrong, please treat is as another stupid forumers lamenting and not a police public statement.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> And I am not from the police now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Utterly disgusting.<br><br>He then brought us to the void deck and gave us a whole pile of his "life story" and so called "counselling" which was pure BULL. One of the sentences he said was "i wanted to enjoy this day with my girlfriend, but now i have to deal with this", the fuck cares? If he had really wanted to enjoy the day, why bother with us and furthermore carry that disgusting attitude. Stopping us because he FELT that i was walking arrogantly and staring at him? Isn't that our local gangsters? Trust me when i say many gangsters behave BETTER than him. Many gangsters think RIGHTLY, or at least the ones that i know. "To serve and protect" they claim. That policeman grabbed me by the neck and pulled me to a corner. WHY? OHHHH its because i walk arrogantly and stared at him.<br><br>HILARIOUS.<br><br>"To serve and protect" they claim.</div></blockquote>you should have reported him. it mght be a tad troublesome for you, but nobody should go through something like that. it's a pretty serious thing, what he did.</div>
