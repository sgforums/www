Guess what, the sargent threaten to arrest me if I don't " keep my peace "... </strong></blockquote>if it was a neighbourhood police post (npp), it is manned by a single person. you call that post, he has to call the div hq to despatch resource. the resource can come from anywhere: he could be on patrol nearby or at the extreme end of his npc's boundaries, or he could be from another location after resuming from another case. a lot of factors come into play when we talk about response time. sometimes we respond quickly, sometimes not so. and yes, not keeping the peace will result in an arrest being affected. you can air your grievances, but do mindful of the way you express it. however, having said that, it is a rather subjective issue, which is besides the point that you have brought up.<br><br><blockquote><strong>When I lived in Whampoa and saw a gang fight and called the police.

The thing is my experience with the police is nothing but "good".  Not that I am anti police but I have yet to meet one that can talk sense or done something that make me feel proud of our police force.  Two months ago, my mum had a fall, I was like be questioned by three different police officers to make sure that my mum is not being abuse. ( she happens to hit her eye when she fell and it does look like being punched in the eye).  I understand there is a need to sieve out elderly abuse but to spend so much time and effort ?  I think the police should have better thing to do right ?  Anyway, I respect you and your believe.  I sincerely hope that I can witness one good cop one day ..  Cheero ....</div></blockquote>your mum ( i assume that she is an elderly person)  had a fall. the purpose is asking what happened is not just to ensure that elderly abuse took place. another purpose is to find out what had transpired, the injuries she suffered (if any; head injuries are of utmost importance) etc.<br><br>Why the trouble, you ask? Well, for one, it has to be ensured that no foul play is involved. I understand that you might be apalled at the suggestion that you would hurt your own mother, and rightly so. But do understand that these are some questions that need to be asked. You would be surprised too, to know that sometimes, people do hurt their elderly parents for their own selfish reasons.<br><br>Anyway, You might wonder why should such questions be asked. Well, it is because for elderly, sometimes they fall, suffer injuries, get admitted into hospital, and eventually pass away. It's a common circumstance for them to leave us; quite a number leave this world that way. Asking them (as well as their kin) what had happened is just to find out what had happened lah. if head injuries were sustained, usually a statement will be recorded. usually the fall is an accident anyway, so the statement will be used to make it official lah. as evidence that no foul play was involved.<br><br>I wouldn't say that the Police have better things to do lah. But rather, we have quite a number of things to do. I hope my explanation has helped clarify the matters you brought up.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
