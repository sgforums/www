Including you ? If you think bashing non-Mindef NSmen would make you the alpha-male then you're no different from your dumbass friend.<br><br>Well, the NSPO TS mentioned is clearly retarded. What would showing a warrant card be of any use in that situation ? Neither does asking for the complainant's address help.<br><br>Any experienced/sane PO, be it regular or NS, will resolve the situation without resorting to such lowly(and ineffective) tricks to intimidate the general public.<br><br>I believe the NSPO in question could be new and did not know how to handle the situation at that time.<br><br>Last but not least, i'm an NSPO and i'm proud of it.

Where you heard that from? Btw, I am from the army, a combat engineer to be exact. Some people served their NS BMT in the civil defence and police without even stepping into a military camp. It's just the luck of the draw although a lot of Malays are posted to the Civil Defence. There are some others who are posted there after BMT, but not necessarily because they "cannot make it".<br><br>When I took a platoon of men during their mono-intake, I kept those whom I feel is good, and posted the rest to units that need men. The better of the cast-offs were sent to our sister unit, 35 SCE, while the rest were sent to become drivers and signallers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ignatiaus:</div><div class="quote_body">Well tell me ...</div></blockquote>1st encounter:<br>My ex had her passport stolen and we went to make a police report. It was 9.45 pm, npp closes at 10pm (apparently). The 2 duty policemen (they looked young enough to be NSF) were already locking up the station and told us to go Clementi police HQ to make the report. My ex asked how long will it take to fill up a simple report since she had to leave the country the next day. They told her that the station is already locked (it was already locked at 9.45 pm) and they can't open the door again.<br><br>Talk about to serve and protect.<br><br>2nd encounter:<br>My friend got into an accident, 2 cars (including his car which I was a passenger in) collided. The other driver got abusive and violent. I called the police. 1 squad car turned up, asked for all our NRICs, then told us the procedure for a car accident then left. They left despite my pleas to stay and that the other driver was abusive. Upon leaving, the other driver once again started abusing us and turned violent. I called the police again and the same squad car came back. By then the other driver left to avoid the police. The police once again asked for my NRIC and said there is nothing he can do.<br><br>Why he kept asking for my NRIC (twice) instead of resolving the issue at hand? I cannot imagine.<br><br>3rd encounter:<br>My sister got robbed by a snatch thief. She fought back and got her handbag back, but in the process, she got dragged on the road and got hurt quite badly. When she went to report to the police at the station, she was told the only thing they can do is to take her statement, no investigation will be carried out since they cannot trace the robber.<br><br>Obviously this is not what a citizen wants to hear. How can you say there is nothing you can do about a robber?<br><br>4th encounter:<br>My mother had her pocket picked and lost a lot of money in foreign currency (she changed money to go overseas). She reported to the police and the police said they cannot do any investigation unless she personally asked the shopping centre to release the security videos. Apparently, they said they had no power to acquire the security videos from the shopping centre where the pickpocket occurred.<br><br>So, this is the reason why singaporeans sleep well at night?</div>
