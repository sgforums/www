Well, for one, it has to be ensured that no foul play is involved. I understand that you might be apalled at the suggestion that you would hurt your own mother, and rightly so. But do understand that these are some questions that need to be asked. You would be surprised too, to know that sometimes, people do hurt their elderly parents for their own selfish reasons.<br><br>Anyway, You might wonder why should such questions be asked. Well, it is because for elderly, sometimes they fall, suffer injuries, get admitted into hospital, and eventually pass away. It's a common circumstance for them to leave us; quite a number leave this world that way. Asking them (as well as their kin) what had happened is just to find out what had happened lah. if head injuries were sustained, usually a statement will be recorded. usually the fall is an accident anyway, so the statement will be used to make it official lah. as evidence that no foul play was involved.<br><br>I wouldn't say that the Police have better things to do lah. But rather, we have quite a number of things to do. I hope my explanation has helped clarify the matters you brought up.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote>Thanks for your effort in explaining.  I understand the police got a job to do.  In fact when I first heard that the police was checking and asking for me, I volunteer myself to the police post for recording of statement...  but then another two came to me ?  They also spoke to my sister, wife and personally talk to my mum.  I still do not think so many time and effort should be spent in this investigation unless foul play is suspected.  I am glad that the police have this routine as it means that other cannot bully their elder but to this extend is abit too much.  As compare to my earlier  incidents, the police is like, bo chap at all..  you know what I mean ...<br><br>I got another incident where there is this civi driver in a police car.  I was behind it.  He suddenly stop in the middle of the road when there was no other vehicle at all.  I had to brake hard unless my son fell and sustain a cut.  I overtook the car and saw the driver face being very red ( evident of drinking).  Next to him was a girl with heavy makeup.  I tried to stop him and he refused.  After several attempts, I gave up.  I called 999.  That time was about 11 pm in the night.  I complained and mentioned too that I am concern as, if the driver is indeed drunk, accident may happen.<br><br>The detective called me in that night at 3 am to ask question like,  are you sure he was drinking and which way did he go...

It is highly likely that the Investigator wasn't around when the info was forwarded, which was why he had to call you in the dead of the night to find out again what happened, in detail.<br><br>It's a pity you didn't remember his name. try to get his name, report reference number and contact details the next time smth like this happens, so you can be updated on any developments in the case.<br><br><blockquote> <strong> No offence la.. these are past incident and I don't really harbour ill feeling.

It's better than just mindless flaming, don't you think?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>And true, negative feedback is good because it helps highlight certain flaws which might arise when coppers deal with people. I'll hold my hands up and admit, some aren't terribly good at dealing with people; I've seen a few. But to be honest, even coppers aren't exempted from having flaws right?

So my bro went up and have a closer look, but the guy was like so nervous and asked her gf to go up his hse to get his "police warrants". Awhile, his friend came down with his gf, that guy shown the "police warrants" to my sis in law ask her where she stay, my sis in law insists she is not going to say, that guy then give her warnings around 3 times to ask her her adddress.<br><br>**** ok the top one I do not wanna tell grandma story ****<br><br>in the end, they end up in police station ... after everything .. then we realise the so call policeman is only a NS police ... faint ....<br>so my bro lodge a complaints and when he finished the complaint, the police in the station said the HQ (dun know which head) is coming down so got to stay there ... but i was too tired to kpo ... haha ...<br><br>may I know wat will happen to that NS police ?

For all we know the TS's bro could be the one that was aggressive. He could have been insisting that the dog was his. Just imagine you minding your own business walking down a street with ur dog then out of the blue a stranger comes out and accused you of stealing his dog 2 years ago when the dog is actually urs... would you not argue back with him?<br><br>This whole thing sounds a bit fishy to me. It could also be the guy walking his dog felt threatened by her bro's attitude. And dont think just because this guy is a NS police you can bully him.

If that was really the case than i dont think all these problem would have come up.<br><br>As for the NS policeman, you may be disappointed to know that Sg police dont usually punish their own unless there are very damning evidents which in this case there isn't only your words against his, their words against yours won't be good enough. But ur bro may have a record with the police after this case even tho how light it may be, they could keep records like he would make claims of police abuse of power quite easily and if future his words against any other gov servant won't have much credibility anymore.</div>

However, having said that, investigation is a rather tedious process. It will always take time. Not many investigations get solved very quickly, let alone a complicated case like one involving cheating.<br><br>One thing that you, as the victim, can do would be to contact the investigator to find out any developments in the case, or if you have any further information, because this will greatly facilitate the rate of the investigtion.<br><br>I must apologize to you, because although I am in the force, neither CCS nor CAD is my department of specialization.

You see, the thief do not have the owner right ( he stole from you ),  so when he sold it, he sold it without the right..  This right is still with you, you are the owner ...  so technically you can get it back ...  I am not a lawyer so I can't tell you how you can take it back except that you may need a lawyer ...  anyway two years ago, the shop would had sold to someone else ...  may not be easy to take back the same set..  At least you see justice done ...</div>

For all we know the TS's bro could be the one that was aggressive. He could have been insisting that the dog was his. Just imagine you minding your own business walking down a street with ur dog then out of the blue a stranger comes out and accused you of stealing his dog 2 years ago when the dog is actually urs... would you not argue back with him?<br></strong><br><br>My bro was not aggressive, how can he be aggressive when he is with his wife + 2 kidz (less than 2 yrs old)<br><br><strong><br>This whole thing sounds a bit fishy to me. It could also be the guy walking his dog felt threatened by her bro's attitude. And dont think just because this guy is a NS police you can bully him. Cos as long as he carrys the"police warrant card", he is more than able the request to see tho not withhold ur IC, moreover he seemed to have followed the proper procedure by giving her warnings 3 times.<br></strong><br><br>so sorry to say, what's there to be fishy? he is not walking his dog, but the dog is in his arm. and in the first place, you mean NS police man will have "NS police" written on his forehead? And to what i know, even a off duty policeman cannot request for IC. (please any policeman correct me for this)<br><br><strong><br>I believed they end up in the police station was apparently not the TS's bro idea but rather the 2 NS policemen's decision. I am assuming that both were NS policemen cos TS mentioned "asked her gf to go up his hse to get his "police warrants". Awhile, his friend came down with his gf, that guy shown the "police warrants".<br></strong><br><br>You are wrong again this time, the NS policeman did not even mention to go police station, is my bro who want him to go with him. And when my bro is heading to the station, he is still reluctant to follow.<br>PS: I did not mention 2 NS policemen. if you cannot read the thread properly then I rather you read it again before replying.<br><br><strong><br>The police are not so dumb just to take the TS's bro's word for it, They will also listen to the guy with the dog and his gf as well. And dont for a minute think many would seriously belief the TS's when she says..."actually my bro just wanna confirm the dog is in good hand lor " Yea right! If that was really the case than i dont think all these problem would have come up.<br></strong><br><br>Yes indeed you are right, policemen will not ONLY take my bro's word. They did interview for both party sepeartely. Ya if that guy would allow the dog to be seen by my bro (or even more courteous) then ya .. all these problem would not have come (I agree) but sad to said ..<br>PS: NS police took out warrant give warning correct procedure ... OMG<br><br><strong><br>As for the NS policeman, you may be disappointed to know that Sg police dont usually punish their own unless there are very damning evidents which in this case there isn't only your words against his, their words against yours won't be good enough. But ur bro may have a record with the police after this case even tho how light it may be, they could keep records like he would make claims of police abuse of power quite easily and if future his words against any other gov servant won't have much credibility anymore. </strong><br><br>Don't worry for this, the 2 big shot from the HQ has already given my bro words that they will keep him update. what record will my bro have? you mean complains record? ooooo i see ....<br><br>BTW, you know the power of civilian's mouth (complains) + the power of MP ?<br><br>[/b]</blockquote><strong>My bro was not aggressive, how can he be aggressive when he is with his wife + 2 kidz (less than 2 yrs old)</strong><br><br>Dont for a minute think just be'cos he was with his wife + 2 kidz he cant behave in an aggressive manner. We all know very well that in such a situation, where argument gets overheated anything is possible even if his grandfather was standing around there.<br><br><strong>so sorry to say, what's there to be fishy? he is not walking his dog, but the dog is in his arm. and in the first place, you mean NS police man will have "NS police" written on his forehead? And to what i know, even a off duty policeman cannot request for IC. (please any policeman correct me for this)</strong><br><br>Well, fishy be'cos it was ur bro that approach him and not the other way around. Moreover, ur dog was lost 2 yrs ago already. So what if his dog was in his arms? He was also with his gf and they could be just walking his dog. Like i've said, the guy was minding your own business walking down a street with his dog, it was ur bro that went up to him, what was exchanged during this time i think its always hard to take the word of someone (In this case you) who has a vested interest in it. It is not always ideal for any policeman to flash his "warrant card" unnecessarily, the guy mentioned didn't even carried his warrant card for that matter, he could have decided to used it as a last resort in trying to cool down ur bro.<br><br><strong>You are wrong again this time, the NS policeman did not even mention to go police station, is my bro who want him to go with him. And when my bro is heading to the station, he is still reluctant to follow.<br>PS: I did not mention 2 NS policemen. if you cannot read the thread properly then I rather you read it again before replying.</strong><br><br>So you see, it was ur bro that was creating the trouble... Anyway, put ur words properly if you dont want others to miss read it. Ur sentence like:<br><br>So my bro went up and have a closer look, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the guy was like so nervous and asked her gf </span> (Shouldnt it be his?) to go up his hse to get his "police warrants". <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Awhile, his friend came down with his gf, that guy shown the "police warrants"</span> (His friend that guy shown his police warrant or warrants?) to my sis in law ask her where she stay, my sis in law insists she is not going to say, that guy then give her warnings around 3 times to ask her her adddress.<br><br>When he gave her warnings 3 times and she refuse to co-operate, he has a right to request that they go to a police station. Seems like the guy didnt do anything wrong. He product his warrant card followed by asking where she stay. If you all didnt do anything wrong then why would you be afraid to tell a police, NS police whatever still a police where you stay? Was ur bro behaving aggressively in the first place that you forgot to mention?<br><br><strong>Yes indeed you are right, policemen will not ONLY take my bro's word. They did interview for both party sepeartely. Ya if that guy would allow the dog to be seen by my bro (or even more courteous) then ya .. all these problem would not have come (I agree) but sad to said ..<br>PS: NS police took out warrant give warning correct procedure</strong><br><br>You have to ask yourself again if ur bro had displayed that manner himself, would a dog owner be unpleasant towards him? Cos i've come across many dog &amp; cat owners who are more than happy to share a word or two with regards to their pets. Just by ur repeated used that the guy "NS police took out warrant give warning correct procedure" Yes, I can only say if he feels that it is getting out of hand he has a right to do that to try to cool things down. And if he was the type that would flash his card in any small incident, he would be carrying that card of his 24/7 and not leave it at home.<br><br><strong>Don't worry for this, the 2 big shot from the HQ has already given my bro words that they will keep him update. what record will my bro have? you mean complains record? ooooo i see ....<br><br>BTW, you know the power of civilian's mouth (complains) + the power of MP ?</strong><br><br>Yea i know, that is their normal response to almost every dick, tom or harry's complain or report that they received, nothing unusual, very business like but the next time ur bro gets a traffic summon or dont pay his Tv licence on time... hehehe...<br><br>This whole thing is quite illogical, you seriously expect us here to belief that ur bro was courteous and "actually my bro just wanna confirm the dog is in good hand lor " would create so much fuss?<br><br>Even i dont buy it, do you think the police will when they have both sides statements rather than just from one side like we have over here?</div>
