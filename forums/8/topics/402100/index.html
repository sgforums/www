              <p>why is there even a fault with anybody? the angmoh in Canada never cpcb about the cantonese, why should anybody complain about the mandarin spoken? there are also many taiwanese there, much earlier, way before 1997, and they spoken mandarin. if you go to surrey, the singh are speaking their dialect as well as indian english. go to co quitlam, you find the singlish speaking people. actually the cantonese speaking people are moving to richmond already.</p>
              <p>mandarin is a new phenomenon? dialects are around longer? learn chinese culture!</p>
              <p>the difference between mandarin and dialects is that mandarin is spoken by all chinese, and dialects by the locals in provinces. HK people thought they didn't have to speak mandarin because they were under the rule of the british colonial master. Now in canada, also used to be under the queen, things are already different. been to HK lately? never hear the people there speak mandarin with cantonese accent?</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Chinese less happy about life in Canada than S. Asians:  poll</strong></span><br> <br> “Immigrants come to Canada seeking a better life for their family and
              children. Though quality of life (i.e., air, environment) is perceived
              to be better in Canada compared to their home country, there is still
              disappointment with job opportunities. Recent immigrants to Canada are
              well-educated with professional degrees, and have extensive skills and
              work experience. More companies need to create or participate in
              programs to hire these new Canadians who are able to make an immediate
              contribution to the Canadian economy. They are our solution to Canada’s
              rapidly aging workforce, which we risk losing to reverse immigration
              back to their home countries,” says Jill Hong, Vice-President at Ipsos
              Reid in Toronto.<br> <br> These views are similar across various demographic subgroups: gender,
              household income, and province (British Columbia vs. Ontario). However,
              a few differences between population subgroups exist. In particular,
              South Asians are more likely than Chinese to view aspects of life in
              Canada positively compared to their home country:<br> <br> * South Asians are more likely than Chinese to feel overall
              quality of life is much better in Canada than their home country (62%
              vs. 37%);<br> <br> * South Asians are more likely than Chinese to view their social
              life as better in Canada than their home country (48% vs. 21%); and,<br> <br> * South Asians are more likely than Chinese to consider job
              opportunities to be better in Canada than in their home country (71%
              vs. 27%).<br> <br> South Asians include people from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka.<br> <br> These are the findings of an Ipsos Reid study fielded from November 24 to December 1, 2008 and from March 11 to March 31, 2009.</p>

              <p>It's quite obvious why  PRCs impose  Mandarin on Singaporeans. In general, Singapore and singaporeans portray the country, culture and people as being chinese oriented:   </p>
              <p>(1) Singapore promotes chinese language and culture. (Interestingly, the language and culture of other ethnicities are not promoted as intensely as that of Chinese) </p>
              <p>(2) Pro-chinese singaporeans think they are pure chinese even possibly to the extend of being more chinese than PRCs themselves.</p>
              <p>In general, the country portrays itself as that of a chinese satellite. With the repressed  distinction that Singapore is not a chinese state, It's not surprising therefore that PRCs would impose their language and culture on Singaporeans. We reap what we sow.</p>
