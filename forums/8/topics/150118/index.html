Those who are not covered under the Employment Act, there is an employment contract, we call it "Letter of Appointment" or "Contract of Service". The terms and conditions of employment will be spelled out in the contract or appointment letter. Therefore, if the terms of contract are unacceptable to you, you are not obligated to sign the appointment letter or contract of service. When signed, it's legal binding.<br><br>The definition of workman is as follows:<br><br>"workman" meansÂ—<br><br>(a) any person, skilled or unskilled, who has entered into a contract of service with an employer in pursuance of which he is engaged in manual labour, including any artisan or apprentice, but excluding any seaman or domestic worker;<br><br>(b) any person, other than clerical staff, employed in the operation or maintenance of mechanically propelled vehicles used for the transport of passengers for hire or for commercial purposes;<br><br>(c) any person employed partly for manual labour and partly for the purpose of supervising in person any workman in and throughout the performance of his work:<br><br>Provided that when any person is employed by any one employer partly as a workman and partly in some other capacity or capacities, that person shall be deemed to be a workman unless it can be established that the time during which that workman has been required to work as a workman in any one salary period as defined in Part III has on no occasion amounted to or exceeded one-half of the total time during which that person has been required to work in such salary period;<br><br>(d) any person specified in the First Schedule;<br><br>(e) any person whom the Minister may, by notification in the Gazette , declare to be a workman for the purposes of this Act;<br><br>FIRST SCHEDULE<br>WORKMEN<br><br>(1)Bus conductor.<br><br>(2)Lorry attendant.<br><br>(3)Bus, lorry and van drivers.<br><br>(4)Bus inspector.<br><br>(5)Goldsmith and silversmith employed in the premises of the employer.<br><br>(6)Tailor and dressmaker employed in the premises of the employer.<br><br>(7)Harbour-craft crew.<br><br>(<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">All workmen employed on piece rates in the premises of the employer.<br><br>The purpose of the Employment Act is to protect the lower rung employees.

That's right.<br><br>Contratory to that, you might want to know why.<br>Of course, by writing a full employment law is always easier than to stipulate each particular clause. The sole purpose of this law in my humble opinion is to lure investors into Singapore at the expense of fairness for employee falling in the four categories. But thankfully, employees in these 4 categories are either professionals, people with wide experience or are holding unfixed job timing so I guess the effect is not that great.<br><br>Well, look at it this way, by luring investors to invest or to set up company here prove to be more beneficial in the long run for the people in term of creation of jobs. Beside, what is the percentage of employee in the 4 categories wrongly fired. I bet it's slim.<br><br>Fairness is very <strong>SUBJECTIVE</strong> indeed. But if this law can benefits a wider majority, its a good law.<br>Just my 2 cents.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
