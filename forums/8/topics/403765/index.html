              <p>hi. i;m wearing this type of lens.</p>
              <p>it's called the OK lens. So long as your degree is less than 500, u should be able to wear it. It's a hard lens and have to be put on every night before u sleep. The next day, u'll get perfect vision but it'll usually last for a day or two. I made mine at city optics at amk.. the optician's name is called james, he's good at this. but i believe it's quite common for ppl to wear this nowadays.. oh as for the price. $800 i think. definitely more exp than specs. and need damn alot of maintanence.</p>

              <p>it's called the OK lens. So long as your degree is less than
              500, u should be able to wear it. It's a hard lens and have to be
              put on every night before u sleep. The next day, u'll get perfect
              vision but it'll usually last for a day or two. I made mine at city
              optics at amk.. the optician's name is called james, he's good at
              this. but i believe it's quite common for ppl to wear this
              nowadays.. oh as for the price. $800 i think. definitely more exp
              than specs. and need damn alot of maintanence.</p>

              <p>personally i think one would rather wear the usual lens lor.. </p>
              <p>sure, you dun get to wear the next day if u were to wear it overnight to get the so called 'perfect vision' the next day but then it's temporary leh.. last 1-2 days nia like whats being commented above. </p>
              <p>but then u have to make the effort to wear it in the night and sleep with it....</p>
              <p>time spent = to wearin the usual lens the next day right. </p>
              <p>my personal opinion. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
