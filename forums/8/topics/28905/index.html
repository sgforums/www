            <div class='col-md body'>BY 9 TONIGHT, marathon soap opera A Kindred Spirit would have been running on Channel U for 566 hours. That is 10 hours shy of 24 days. And its days are numbered.<br><br>GREAT REALITY TV: The long-running series hooked viewers here with its compelling portrayal of family life, along with humourous antics and dialogue.<br>The popular prime-time Hongkong family drama, which began airing on the Mandarin SPH MediaWorks channel on July 4 last year, will finish its run by the middle of next month.<br><br>Drawing consistent double-digit viewership ratings, sometimes as high as 17 per cent, it is without doubt Channel U's top programme.<br><br>Mr Chang Long Jong, chief executive officer of rival MediaCorp Studios, describes it as Channel U's lifeline.<br><br>But he also wonders if running it day in and day out on prime-time might hamper Channel U's move to forge a young and vibrant identity, as some viewers might see it as a one-programme channel.<br><br>MediaWorks chief operating officer Man Shu Sum is not worried about this.<br><br>'It's like Manchester United. People associate it readily with David Beckham. But without the team effort of other players and a good manager, how can it become the world's top football club?' he reasons.<br><br>Set in pre-handover Hongkong, A Kindred Spirit centres on the so-called Char Siew family - named after its business of selling barbecued pork - and the relationships among its members, in-laws, relatives and friends.<br><br>Played by veterans Kwan Hoi San and Lai Shuen, the patriarch and matriarch of the clan have two daughters - down-to-earth Ren Shan (Louise Lee), who is married to Char Siew Bing (Lau Dan), and the widowed and greedy Ren Hao (Nancy Sit).<br><br>Supporting them in this Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) production is a circus of at least 15 others. They include May Kwong, Wallis Phang, Mary Kwok, Kennix Kwok, Marco Lo, Cally Kwong and Lui Fong.<br><br>At 1,128 episodes of 30 minutes each, A Kindred Spirit, or Zhen Qing in Mandarin, holds the record as Hongkong's longest serial.<br><br>It aired there from May 1995 to November 1999, with production stopping about two months before the end of its 4 1/2-year run.<br><br>It was so successful, a stage musical starring most of the original cast was made.<br><br>The series has also aired in Taiwan, Japan, Vietnam, Malaysia and Australia.<br><br>Though first shown here in Cantonese on TVBJ (cable channel 4<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> in November 1997, it did not catch on with Singaporeans until the dubbed-into-Mandarin version was broadcast on free-to-air Channel U.<br><br>The channel has cut and spliced two episodes, sometimes more, into hour-long packages. On Monday nights, viewers get two hours worth of the soap opera, or about four episodes.<br><br>The telecast date of the series finale remains a closely-guarded secret because Channel U wants to keep Channel 8 on its toes, sources say.<br><br>'The point is to withhold it for as long as possible so that Channel 8 will not be able to stage a 'spoiler' with a special programme during the finale,' says a media watcher who declined to be named.<br><br>And it's not just bored Chinese housewives or retirees who tune in. The show draws students from primary school to polytechnics, and professionals in their mid-20s to their late-30s, says Channel U.<br><br>There are also non-Chinese viewers, with AC Nielsen figures showing 54,000 of them aged 15 and up tuning in.<br><br>Among them are graphic designer Norlyn Yaicob, 21, her housewife mother, who is in her 50s, and her 27-year-old sister.<br><br>'We got hooked by its compelling portrayal of family life, which covers every age group you can think of,' she says.<br><br>'You don't need to be Chinese to dig its humorous antics and dialogue as long as there are subtitles.'<br><br>Housewife Chong Bee Leng, 61, finds it 'great reality TV, because it portrays what everyday families face in trying to get along with each other'.<br><br>More importantly, you can jump in at any point and not feel too lost because the plot is easy to piece together, says administrative co-ordinator Zubaidah Saat, 25.<br><br>She is also drawn by its mix of conservative Asian values as well as its broad stereotypes, such as how characters from mainland China are depicted as greedy.<br><br>Freelance translator J.S. Ng, 27, points out how women in the show are given subservient, self-sacrificial roles.<br><br>'The series encourages us to be homemakers like Louise Lee's Ren Shan, the perfect daughter, wife and mother,' she says.<br><br>'The successful and more educated ones are usually prevented by the plot from developing their careers. They end up choosing marriage and a family.'<br><br>Those who don't are portrayed as temperamental or desperate.<br><br>Though Ms Ng does not agree with these values, she found herself 'sucked' into the show.<br><br>'Now I feel like I've stayed with the family for a long time, and it's funny how you thought it would never end, and you don't want it to, but it has to, at some point.'<br><br>A Kindred Spirit airs on Channel U, Mondays to Fridays, at 7 pm. Reruns air on Saturdays and Sundays from 7 to 9 pm.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Ratings up with Nancy Sit<br><br>A KINDRED SPIRIT may be the trump card of the 18-month-old Channel U, but it was not an instant hit with viewers.<br><br>Mr Man Shu Sum, chief operating officer of SPH MediaWorks, says it got off slowly. 'When we started airing it at prime-time in July last year, it only got a 3.9 per cent rating,' he recalls.<br><br>It took the TVB-produced show three months before it hit double-digit viewership, but this was something he had anticipated.<br><br>'The same thing happened in Hongkong back in 1995. The first 200 episodes were not very popular and TVB even wanted to kill it off.<br><br>'Then they introduced Nancy Sit into the show and that's when ratings picked up.'<br><br>The series' proven track record in Hongkong and other markets prompted Channel U to acquire the TVB production two years ago.<br><br>It aired initially on Mondays to Fridays from 7 to 8 pm.<br><br>After viewers warmed up to it, Channel U increased the frequency to six days on Dec 16, and seven days a week from March 17.<br><br>Thanks to A Kindred Spirit, Channel U's prime-time share has overtaken Channel 8's since May this year, according to figures provided by AC Nielsen.<br><br>This, despite the latter channel putting on blockbusters like an adaptation of the Qiong Yao classic Romance In The Rain.<br><br>The closest the two stations came to a draw at prime-time was when Channel 8 pitted Kopi-O II against A Kindred Spirit in July.<br><br>But findings by Taylor Nelson Sofres, the research agency used by MediaCorp, show that on average, Channel 8 is still ahead in the prime-time race, with 55 per cent versus Channel U's 45 per cent.<br><br>Mr Man declines to say how much MediaWorks paid for the series as well as for the repeat run of A Kindred Spirit which started last Saturday.<br><br>But he adds that it was Channel 8's loss for not picking it up when it was available on the market.<br><br>This was way before Channel U announced in January last year its exclusive five-year-deal with TVB. Under this, it can have the first pick of at least 400 hours of programming from the Hongkong broadcaster.<br><br>While Channel 8 was aware of the popularity of A Kindred Spirit, sources say that its sheer length - more than 600 hours - exceeded the station's annual quota for acquired programming from TVB.<br><br>Still, while A Kindred Spirit enjoys high ratings, there has been no significant jump in Channel U's advertising revenue. 'No advertiser is foolish enough to put all their budget in one time-belt,' says Mr Man.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Who will win this time?<br><br>NEITHER of them will admit it, but both Channel U and Channel 8 are gearing up for the next prime-time showdown when A Kindred Spirit ends next month.<br><br>Can Channel U maintain what it claims is its prime-time lead over Channel 8 when its most popular programme completes its course?<br><br>Channel U is tight-lipped about when it will air the series finale. A recent move seems to suggest that it is trying to prolong the last lap of the soap opera.<br><br>On the weekend of Nov 2 and 3, it replaced without any prior announcement A Kindred Spirit's 7 to 9 pm screening with movies.<br><br>This reduces the number of episodes shown from 10 per week to six, which also stretches out the soap opera a little longer than originally planned.<br><br>Irate viewers called in to complain. A result of this: Channel U started a weekend re-run of the serial from last Saturday.<br><br>Meanwhile, both stations are keeping mum on what they will roll out next month.<br><br>Sources point to a few prime-time contenders that Channel U might use.<br><br>But none look as mammoth or as compelling.<br><br>There is Healing Hands II which stars Bowie Lam, Kit Chan, Ada Choi and Flora Chan. This is a sequel to the successful medical drama shown on Channel 8 last year.<br><br>There are also a few period dramas, namely The Legendary Four Aces starring Nick Cheung and Bobby Au Yeung; Duke Of Mount Deer 2000 produced by Wong Jing; All's Well Ends Well starring MediaWorks' Celest Chong; and Virtues Of Harmony starring Nancy Sit, Michael Tse and Lau Dan.<br><br>Only Virtues, a hit TVB drama into its 200th episode and which is still in production, comes close to A Kindred Spirit.<br><br>Already showing on VV Drama (StarHub Channel 55), it features many members of Kindred's cast such as Sit, Tse and Lau. It also explores, though in a more comic manner, the same familial subjects.<br><br>Channel 8, on the other hand, is said to be launching the 60-part Springs Of Life on its 7 pm slot sometime next month.<br><br>Set in the 1960s and helmed by Chew Chor Meng, this is a follow-up to 2000's Walk Of Life, which satirises the rivalry in Singapore's Chinese restaurant trade.<br><br>The MediaCorp channel is also working on a second wave of home-made family-type dramas. These include Vive La Famille II starring Chen Shuchen and Huang Biren and the 100-episode Holland Village which is still in pre-production.<br><br>Shown earlier this year, the first wave - Vive La Famille, Beautiful Connection and No Problem - was widely regarded as riding on the wave of A Kindred Spirit as they tackled similar themes.<br><br>But dismissing this, Mr Chang Long Jong, chief executive officer of MediaCorp Studios, tells Life!: 'In the late 1990s, we also had a string of family-oriented dramas like Driven By A Car and Family Affairs which did well.<br><br>'Our focus is to get our programming right and to keep to our prime-time plan of 70 per cent local and 30 per cent acquired programming for our 7 pm and 9 pm drama timebelts.<br><br>'While A was one of the better programmes we could have looked at, its end will mean more opportunities for us to gain an upper hand.'<br></div>
