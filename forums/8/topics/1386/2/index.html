We can't scrape the cells off an underdeveloped foetus, cos this may injure her.<br>But when she is older, chances is some of her skin cells will drop off and mix with the fluid around her. What doctors do is simply extract this fluid and search for her cells which will then be used for DNA printing.<br><br>Hence DNA printing is not really a solution here, unless you want the baby to be born regardless of who the father is.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well no matter if this story is true or not, we got a case here and maybe we should help lor.<br><br>Well 1st of all you went straight into sex with the ger, think knowing her only on the 1st day. So pls confirm and make sure that the day the 2 of u have sex, she is over 16!! If she is ....good.....if not, dun ever think of making a police report cause you are asking for trouble lor. But then, if she's above 16, think consider family dispute, police won't interfer unless accused of rape. But the fact remains that the u of u have sex several times.....can't be forced sexual acts what, so think no case too. This is a big mistakes on yr part.<br><br>And oh yes, not trying to scare you but u did better do a medical check-up as well. Just in case.<br><br>You are only 18, are you ready to accept her as yr the other half or not? which i seriously think u should not and that u can't possibly afford to 'keep' her ard (imagine what ah lians will want to have, hmmm....). Also, personally i think that she start to have sex when she's under 16 liao and that the baby may not be yours also. You may be just a suay kia who happen to fall into her trap.<br><br>Talk to yr parent lor......if they want u to marry her, then go ahead......since u like her a bit too......if not, seek for their advise or like what many pple say, call the SOS helpline.<br><br>Regards</div>
