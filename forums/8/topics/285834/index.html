            <div class='col-md body'>A friend of mine recently sent me a piece she wrote on uncovering the depraved world of Child prostitution.<br><br>I read it and felt chills down my spine....especially the part where interviews were conducted with Child molesters who have been convicted and claim to have changed and are looking for a fresh start.<br><br>I then went online and researched on the psyche of these child molesters and this sexual fascination they have with children. In alot of the diagnosis, it is considered a mental illness which can only be curbed...not cured. This means there is a chance for relapse, given the right situation and conditions, and they might hurt another child. This disturbs me.<br><br>Do people with this "disease" deserve to be given a second chance?...<br>Do you think it's worth the risk?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, child prostitution is only possible when two groups of people exist - those who forced this children into prostitution and those who 'visit' these kids for prostitution.<br><br>Firslty, the first group of people whom we assumed forced these kids into prostitution is often seen as sick. Treating a child whom some isn't fully mature and pass puberty. Doing so not only cause them physical pain but the emotional pain is much more worse than one can imagine. The child would be so tramautised that it leaves an emotional scar in his mind which might haunt him or her forever. Such people should be condemned and should be punished harshly.<br><br>Secondly, people who visit these kids for prostitution. Such people should deserve a much worse punishment than the abovementioned. I mean, why resort into children? It may be some desire which they desperately wanted so much. But seriously, it's not something moral to do. Children their age should spend their years having a wonderful childhood and stuff and not being treated that way. These groups of desperados should be tortured in my opinion but well, a dozens of stroke to leave a painful scar on their bloody butt is nothing as compared to those pain and moetional scar experienced by those kids.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Clandestine:</div><div class="quote_body">It is a mental illness which finds the person relating sexual arousal to children.<br>Yes....this can be a controlled feature in them...and to those who have not commited such acts and have sought counselling or threraphy to handle it, then yes...It is an act that can be prevented.<br><br>My question however is IF you think a person who has ALREADY commited the act once and given in to the temptation, should be allowed a second chance to "try again"...is it worth the risk...<br><br></div></blockquote>actualy thinking about it, theres nothing really wrong with having sexual preferences towards children. It's not a crime, its just another different preference, abeilt one that society in general is not prepared to accept. (think homosexuality)<br><br>The only problem is they have no legal way to assuage that preference. but the same could be said of a person who likes say sm but is unable to find a partner who is willing. or even a normal person who does not want to patronise paid sex but is unable to find a sexual partner.<br><br>The main problem is the person gives in to the temptation and does the act of molesting/raping a child. But how is that different from a normal rapist or molestor or even a robber. The only real difference is the natural tendency of us to protect the young, but the reason why the person acts is mainly the same.<br><br>In that sense the risks are the same and the considerations should be the same. if you want to give 2nd chances or even just release the rest, you would have to release the child-molesters too.</div>
