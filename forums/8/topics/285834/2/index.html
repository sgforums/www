(think homosexuality)<br><br></div></blockquote>I do not wish to slam your personal opinion on the subject matter....<br>However, for the sake of discussion...<br><br>Homosexuality is between 2 consenting adults who have same sex preference. Society SHOULD not have a say in what two adults choose to do with each other, to each other. I understand that you used "homosexuality" in this context as an example of how society's ever judging gaze is fixed upon many "grey areas"....but be carefull not to confuse readers that the two grey areas are of equal magnitude just because they are both grey.<br><br>A child(or a minor if you will) is not of capacity to make choices for himself/herself in the areas of love,sex,marriage...etc simply because they cannot grasp the severity and implications of these decisions.<br>Adults see themselves as people who are to defend a child and guide a child to being brought up in an upright and moral manner.<br><br>When a child is made to have frivalous sexual relations with other men for a source of income...by another adult....How is this not to be viewed as being a crime?<br><br>When an adult is drawn to a child's innocence, and finds a sexual need to be intimate with said innocence despite knowing that the implications of his actions will lead to self gratification at the expense of another human being's well being(mind and body)....how is this not to be viewed negatively??<br><br>Preference is a term used when people of intellectual, who are able to weigh out cause and effect and make decisions based on this,  choose their preferred scenario.

Society SHOULD not have a say in what two adults choose to do with each other, to each other. I understand that you used "homosexuality" in this context as an example of how society's ever judging gaze is fixed upon many "grey areas"....but be carefull not to confuse readers that the two grey areas are of equal magnitude just because they are both grey.<br><br>A child(or a minor if you will) is not of capacity to make choices for himself/herself in the areas of love,sex,marriage...etc simply because they cannot grasp the severity and implications of these decisions.<br>Adults see themselves as people who are to defend a child and guide a child to being brought up in an upright and moral manner.<br><br>When a child is made to have frivalous sexual relations with other men for a source of income...by another adult....How is this not to be viewed as being a crime?<br><br>When an adult is drawn to a child's innocence, and finds a sexual need to be intimate with said innocence despite knowing that the implications of his actions will lead to self gratification at the expense of another human being's well being(mind and body)....how is this not to be viewed negatively??<br><br>Preference is a term used when people of intellectual, who are able to weigh out cause and effect and make decisions based on this,  choose their preferred scenario. A child does not come under this category.<br><br></div></blockquote>Well, very often i speak of such stuff not from personal convition but merely trying to be objective. I personally find peadophiles some what repulsive.<br><br>you mistake the preference/liking for the act. The preference itself is nothign illegal. wrong in your eyes maybe but only as wrong as say homosexuality to some one who adhors it.<br><br>the person can have desires for young children, but as long as he/she does not do anything in line with the desire it is nothing wrong. Just as how you can have urges to kill some one or rape or rob or cheat but as long as you don't do it, it doesn't really matter.<br><br>thats for what i meant. merely the thought/desre is not a crime, as long as you do not commit the act.<br><br>and for the sake of argument. all the arguments for paedophilic behaviour are that of a particular mindset, that is that the children should be protected and that harming others for self-gratification is bad. thats societal conditioning at least to some extend; you might feel differently if say you came from a culture where child prostitution is the norm/expected/even honoured, or one where robbing of others is alright. It's wrong from one perspective, but it might not be from another.</div>

It's not a crime, its just another different preference, </span>abeilt one that society in general is not prepared to accept. (think homosexuality)<br><br>The only problem is they have no legal way to assuage that preference. but the same could be said of a person who likes say sm but is unable to find a partner who is willing. or even a normal person who does not want to patronise paid sex but is unable to find a sexual partner.<br><br>The main problem is the person gives in to the temptation and does the act of molesting/raping a child. But how is that different from a normal rapist or molestor or even a robber. The only real difference is the natural tendency of us to protect the young, but the reason why the person acts is mainly the same.<br><br>In that sense the risks are the same and the considerations should be the same. if you want to give 2nd chances or even just release the rest, you would have to release the child-molesters too.</div></blockquote></div>
