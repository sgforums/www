            <div class='col-md body'>I was in Secondary 2 and I went cycling with friends at ECP. Near Fort Road, I was racing with another friend when I tried to cut across from the bicycle track to the walking path when I buang-ed into a tree. Fell on the rough pavement then after getting up, I realised that the skin + flesh on my elbow were scrapped off, exposing a glimpse of the white bone beneath. Still have the scar till date to remind me of the trauma.</div>
