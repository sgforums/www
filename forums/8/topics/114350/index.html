            <div class='col-md body'>Airline.....<br><br>I was taking a domestic flight from one state to another.<br>Supposed to reach there before noon so that I could have lunch in the 2nd destination.  Woke up very early for the morning flight (at 4 am).  Arrived in airport at about 6.30 am.<br><br>The flight duration was 2 hours only.  As I woke up so damn early and slept so damn late (about 12 midnight) the night before, I was really sleepy and dozed off the moment I got on the plane, even before take off.<br><br>After the plane took off, I sort of heard some annoucements by the pilot.  It sounded like bad news, cuz the pilot said something like... "Today is not our day". I thought it's some usual annoucement, probably some bad news on the weather or delay in arrival time.  So I pushed now the back rest and continued with my nap.<br><br>Just then, the passenger next to me told me to lift my backrest up as we were landing soon.  He said that we were going back to the original destination, where we boarded our plane.  I said "Har?  What?"  He said the pilot said there was something wrong with the aircraft -- Mechanical Fault!!!<br><br>I was like...  OMG!  Didn't they detect the problem before takeoff???  Then a couple of Singapore travellers said "No wonder SQ is known as the best.  It is known to be using new aircraft only.  After a few years, they will sell away to the not-so-good airline (which I think they are referring to the airline we were taking)".<br><br>When we were at the airport once again, there was nothing to do except waiting.  I practically spent 1 whole day at the airport .  I walked all the shops there and spent the whole time walking from one end of the airport to the other except during lunch.<br><br>After lunch, the airport announced that they were not able to repair the aircraft.  This means that the damage was really bad and my question of "Why didn't they detect this earlier?" popped up again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Airport....<br><br>I managed to get a seat on a different aircraft of the same airline.  Finally, I arrived at the new destination in the two-hour flight.<br><br>I looked for the Belt number for baggage claim. It said "Belt No. 4".  Ok.  That was pretty straightforward.  So I proceeded to No. 4.  I waited and waited.  Then I heard a few passengers of the same flight saying "Belt No. 5.  Belt No. 5".  For a moment, I thought I understood the display wrongly.  As I walked to Belt 5, I looked up the display screen again and I was right.  It did say Belt No. 4.  If I didn't hear the other passengers, I could have stood there at Belt 4 staring at other people luggages.<br><br>Naymind.<br><br>I went over to 5.  Again, no luggage for me.  Guess what.  My baggages were on the floor away from Belt 5 near to the toilet, together with a few other luggages belonging to other travellers.<br><br>Again, I heard the same Singapore passenger commenting "No wonder Changi Airport is no. 1"  And I had to agree!</div>

As you know, you need to turn off the phone while on flight.  I did so when I departed Singapore.  After that, I entered the wrong pin twice and my SIM card got locked.<br><br>Naymind.<br><br>I checked in to the hotel.  I went around for Internet Cafe, so that I could email the phone line provider in Singapore for help.  Dun have!<br>I found a computer terminal for internet surfing at the shopping centre and it cost about S$3 per 15 minutes!!!  Naymind....  The machine only accepted one type of coins -- $2 (their local currency lah )!!!  I didn't have.  Only dollar notes.<br>Good grief.  Naymind.  Tried making calls.  I couldn't find any public phone that accepted credit cards!!!  So, I decided to be contactless for the rest of the trip.  I was on holiday anyway.</div>
