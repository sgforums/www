I enjoy being alone, and I enjoy not talking also... the silence makes my inner-self more serene in a very obscure way... I dunno if you can imagine that sort of things...<br><br>As for finding it difficult to communicate to others, relax.... you think other people actually care whether you communicate to them or not? Or do you think others who are more vocal actually communicated themselves?<br><br>To all, I'm not trying to instill some anti-social ideas into AD's mind, just that generally, people will think that they can't communicate becos they dun speak much, which is not exactly true.<br><br>Silence to me is also a form of communication. Well, sometimes, I like to remain quiet and listen to people becos I dun know much of the topic, or I know the topic, but wants to hear more of other's output. Keeping quiet means I dun feel like telling, or I've nothing constructive to contribute... nothing wrong with dat huh...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>AD, learn to enjoy being a loner, cos the world is getting over-crowded, and being by yrself is the only way you can achieve peace of mind... human only serves to complicate matters....<br><br>Those who feel that what I've written sounds gray, pls think it through again... what I've written is just but a small bit of this ugly world...<br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming?
