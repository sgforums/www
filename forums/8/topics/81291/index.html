Cos it make sure that the students really have to understand the subjects in order to score in them. Wherelse in method 2, any student with an above-average memory strength would be able to excel in the subject.<br><br>Method 2 is academically better for students.<br><br>I think exams should be discontinue in the future. Presently, past-exam papers are so easily obtained. Students are not thoroughly tested based on their understanding of the subject. Instead, they are judged by how many past-exam papers they have done. It just doesn't show anybody that the students actually knows what they are learning.<br><br>I strongly suggest that academic promotions should be based on individual assignments/projects. A good student in the past may be just somebody with excellent memory...and in the end, he is just  going to end up as just like another nerd in the society. I feel that the future good student should be somebody with real talents throughout his academic career. And this is the kind of people we need as our future government/superior/leader.<br><br>Say if a child is gifted in mathematics but really poor in science, based on our current system. He will probably end up as a nobody...like another person like you and me. That is probably because the requirement for him to become a mathematician requires much more subjects than just mathematics. But if his talents/interest in mathematics is discovered at a young age, his academic career could be tailored in such a way that he will be  concentrating more on mathematics and be a real mathematician at a young age. Well, that's just an example...I also don't know the requirement needed to be a mathematician.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>
