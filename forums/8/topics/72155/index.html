            <div class='col-md body'><strong>What sure way to attract girls than to have babies or doggies in tow, right? Well, only if you prefer poop to darling nosey aunties<br><br>Marc Lim </strong><br><br>MOST bad ideas originate when you are either drunk or desperate. In my case, I was both during my cousin's wedding last year.<br><br>Amid the free booze and endless questions from relatives about why 'Marc, the earliest to start dating' is still single, I decided enough was enough.<br><br>No more dealing with nosey aunties. And no more offers of matchmaking me with 'this nice girl' they met the other day.<br><br>I made it known, at least to the people at my table, that I was going to make a conscious effort to find a partner.<br><br>Suddenly, everyone was an expert, especially from the 'we're so happily in love' couples.<br><br>'No point trying to meet girls at clubs, they're probably not the marrying kind,' offered a friend's wife.<br><br>'Also, don't fall for the myth that women you meet at the frozen food section are good catches,' said her husband. 'It only means they eat a lot.'<br><br>In the end, they came up with the foolproof method, or so they claimed - babe magnets.<br><br>Definition: an object which will help draw a woman's attention. And the table voted unanimously that babies and puppies were sure bets.<br><br>Babies because they show that the guy is sensitive, caring and tender. And puppies because a guy with a dog implies that he is not afraid of commitment, and thus, won't shy away from a relationship.<br><br>I took up the challenge.<br><br>I mean, how hard could it be? Besides, I had two sure bets.<br><br>As it turned out, babies would give me my first chance.<br><br>My cousin from the United States had just flown into town with his American wife and their three-year-old son and nine-month-old daughter.<br><br>His kids fit the bill of the perfect 'magnets' - Christopher is a talkative American-accented toddler and cute rosy-cheeked Trina has a smile to light up any would-be partner's face.<br><br>I offered to babysit them for the day which I had all planned out. Lunch at McDonald's at East Coast Parkway, followed by a walk along the beach.<br><br>I picked them up, popped Barney into the car stereo and we were set.<br><br>As luck would have it, we rolled into a parking lot just as two 20-something women were getting out of their car. I made my move.<br><br>Christopher opened the door and got out, but not before I offered a very audible 'say excuse me and be careful not to hit the lady'.<br><br>'Excuse me,' said Christopher in the cutest three-year-old voice possible. It worked like a charm and it got their attention.<br><br>'Oh what a cute boy!' squealed the woman who emerged from the passenger seat. 'How old is he?'<br><br>'Three,' I answered as I eased Trina into the stroller. 'And this is his sister Trina.'<br><br>'How precious! Can we touch her?' asked the other.<br><br>'Sure,' I replied as I rolled the stroller towards them.<br><br>Just as they were about to make contact, the stroller snapped shut, with Trina in it. How was I to know that you need to lock these darn things open before they are ready to go?<br><br>Trina screamed her head off as I struggled to retrieve her and, needless to say, I blew my chances with the two women.<br><br>There was no way they were going to hang around a wailing baby, a shocked three-year-old and a 27-year-old moron.<br><br>French fries and ice cream came to my aid and it was not long before the children were normal again.<br><br>But I did not account for poop. Either I must have freaked out poor Trina or she is lactose-intolerant because, boy, did she go.<br><br>I thought I was prepared, armed with extra diapers and baby wipes, but no amount of army training could have prepared me for what I saw.<br><br>I re-introduced myself to Barney, and sent them home.<br><br>So much for babies.<br><br>But as it turned out, dogs did not offer too much reprieve either.<br><br>As I did not even make it to the beach my last time out, I thought I would head back to East Coast Park.<br><br>I wanted to portray a macho image so I arranged to pick up Chuck, my friend's yellow labrador, at the beach and promised to send him home.<br><br>Chuck proved a much better option than babies and within an hour of jogging with him - and picking up his poop - I had met three fellow 'dog lovers' and even obtained the telephone number of a cocker spaniel's cute owner.<br><br>Things were going great until, during the drive back, Chuck decided that he had hidden a bone in my car's back seat.<br><br>He started digging at the leather seats, leaving deep scratches with each rapid paw movement.<br><br>I turned to scream at him, neglected to watch the road and bumped into the car in front of me. It was not a big accident, but one nonetheless.<br><br>The woman with the cocker spaniel did call, but she suggested a foursome date - us and the two dogs.<br><br>At that point, I was not exactly looking forward to taking Chuck out again, so I passed.<br><br>I suppose the wedding table guests were right. Babies and dogs are indeed babe magnets, but I don't think I have the patience to put up with either one for the time being, even if it is just to meet women.<br><br>So here I am, still single, but at least I can eat at McDonald's in peace and have an intact back seat.<br><br>As for finding a partner, I have left it to the age-old method that is even better than babe magnets.<br><br>Nosey aunties.</div>
