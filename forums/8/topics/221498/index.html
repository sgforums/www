            <div class='col-md body'>TRUE story - EC at Jurong West<br><br>I was looking for a rental apartment and I spotted an Executive Condominium in The Straits Time Classifieds. It was in Blk XX, #XX-XX,<br>The XXXXXXX, located at XXXXXXXX XXX, at Jurong West extension, near Jalan Bahar, it was near to my work place and and the price was attractive!<br><br>The agent who advertised turned out to be the owner himself (I found out later that it was so because no other agent would want to<br>help him market the unit after showing their first prospective tenants). So I arranged a viewing with the agent cum owner and rented<br>it on spot because I was then desperately in need of a place to stay.<br><br>When I reached the apartment, I saw a BIG Cross on the main door, I'm a catholic so I didn't take it to heart. I viewed the apartment, I found that it was renovated nicely and I was told by the owner that the he and his wife had only stayed for a short while and<br>moved out because it was far away from their work place.<br><br>The owner looked nice enough, a gentle speaking man, I was in urgent need of a place to stay and it didn't take me long to put a deposit- I was thinking, I'm just renting a place, not buying and the<br>price was extremely cheap and I could have the whole 3 bedroom aparment for myself at an incredible rent, no need to be fussy.<br><br>As the owner had bought the EC from HDB direct, they can't sell the EC yet(5 yrs rule) so they could only rent the place out for now.<br>I came to know from neighbours later that more that 5 families had come and gone during these time. The neighbours also told me the actual<br>reason the owners left was because the family had problems, lots of financial problem.<br><br>The husband owed the loan shark lots of money, even the security guards had to be instructed to stop debt collectors from coming to the<br>house. The family was breaking up. The husband was seeing another woman and he wanted a divorce. The wife refused and hence they<br>quarreled everyday. So please check with the surrounding neighbours before you rent or purchase a flat which now I learn. Ok! now I will<br>listed all the incidences happened during my two months there.<br><br>1) One night after watching TV alone, I think it was about 2.00am and I was walking back from the living room past the dining room<br>to the bedroom to sleep, I heard a boy's voice(very clearly) calling my name once and instinctly I turn my head to my left where the voice came<br>from. My whole body went cold when there was nothing there at all! I rent the whole place for my own and there could be no one else in the<br>house!<br><br>2) It was in the afternoon, I was washing hair in the bedroom toilet. As I was sitting on the edge of the bath tub bending forward<br>holding the shower above my head washing my hair, suddenly, I felt that someone gave me a hard push above my head. I was unable to see that<br>time cos my eyes were covered with shampoo, but I could discern a black shadow in the form of a 'human(?)' in front of me. Again, there could<br>be no other person in the house!<br><br>3) (This one is real spooky) It was when I met a neighbour next door. I was instructed not to talk with the neighbours cos the owner<br>had rented out the whole unit illegally, so this was the first time I had talked to my neighbour. Then, during our conversation, they<br>mentioned, "Where is your son?" I told them that I am single and I stay alone but they insisted that they saw themself, when I left the<br>main door open while I was in the hall watching TV on the sofa, there was a boy playing next to me and he was about 3 yrs old!! Both husband &amp;<br>wife saw that!<br><br>4) There was one evening at about 11.00pm. I was having my bath then when I turn to face the wall behind me, I got a shock! There was<br>a black figure like a human child on the wall! I was shaking like a leave and naturally used the hot shower spray and spray to that<br>direction. Nothing happen at all so I quickly rushed out.<br><br>5) This last one is the final straw I was able to take before I decided to forfeit my deposit and shift out to my friend's place. I<br>forgot to mentioned that all this time during the night when I was sleeping in my locked master bedroom, I always heard noises like<br>someone twisting my room handle and trying to open the door. I did checked many times to no avail. One evening after watching TV, I went back to bedroom to sleep. As I<br>entered the masteroom, I got a shock! There was a pair of deep lighted shinning green eyes on my PC screen in the room. The PC was not even<br>switch on!! Just to make sure it was not a fault, I even pull out the plug from the socket!! The pair of eyes was still there!! Then suddenly the TV in the living room was switched on and the volume<br>turned to the highest! I just ranout of the house without even locking the door and stayed at the guard house till the next moring!<br><br>I moved that morning!! This is a series of true incidences witnessed by me, I have been more diligent in going to church lately after this.<br><br>The last thing I heard, the owner is trying to sell the EC now as it's already reached the 5 yr occupation period. Take care and take<br>note of the address when hunting for a home!!!<br><br></div>
