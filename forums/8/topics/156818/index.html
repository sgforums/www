            <div class='col-md body'>hmm.. to some poly students, maybe the increase in fare for poly students abit unfair.. but then again, jc students r in a sense treated more as 'school kids' (like sec sch).. whereas poly students get the privilege to be treated as 'young adults'.. the edu system b/w jc-s n polys is juz being different, nt biased.. jc students wear their uni.. turn up at 7.30am every weekday fer morning assembly.. hav our attendance taken everyday.. thats probably the reason y we still hold our sec sch concession passes... so we pay cheaper..<br><br>haha.. n yar.. i think the part about jc students lookin down totalli on poly students only applies to a minority. we do acknowledge the fact that there r certain courses offered by polytechnics that hav good future prospects but most of the time, we (well, at least most of my jc friends and i) dont look down n discriminate people who come from poly.. the main reason behind that is kinda simple- jc students fail to interact with poly students often. thats y there's this barrier b/w us.. leadin to several misconceptions.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> cheers..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if i'm not wrong ITE is also a form of tertiary education but yet they pay student fares..and the only difference is that they wear a uniform..so what we have to pay more just because we don't buy uniforms,so must contribute money in another way?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

Or are you just generalising.... in fact I've never heard of such a thing before until you mentioned it.....<br><br>and whats with JC students being cream of the crop?.. lots of bright students with single digit O level grades choose poly too.. it's just a matter of what a person's interested to study.... eventually when they do well, they'll still end up in a university. Most of my poly friends are university undergraduates now...<br><br>From my point of view, of course it's unfair having to charge poly students adult fair.... maybe the govt did consider the age range of poly students.. not all of them are in their 17s and 18s.. there are alot of older students in their early 20s... and if they charge all poly students including those in their 20s student fare... are those NUS, NTU, SMU students gonna complain too? Why their in their early 20s and yet they have to pay the adult fare?<br><br></div>
