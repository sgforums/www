It exposes us to different views and teaches us that there is always room for many opinions.<br><br>But Diversity should not lead to a class system.<br><br>I think VB's point was JC and Poly students has always been equal, as such, both set of students share the same thinking and thoughts.<br><br>But then again, I beg to differ. If both educational institues churns out uniformed students, why not call poly and ITE JCs as well? Why is there a need for the institutes to be named differently?</div>
