You go to school so that you can contribute economically to the country in whatever way possible.. which is what the government wants... oops  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

This is my humble opinion anyway but I feel that out education system no longer leaves much room for our personal growth .. but more on how we can make singapore richer.. That is why we see so much bullshyt in the education system nowadays.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>As for why JC students and Poly students pay diff amt of bus/mrt fares.. please read my earlier post on which one is tertiary education, which one is not..<br><br></div>
