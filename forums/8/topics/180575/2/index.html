That's RP life.<br><br>In the case of popular or fashionable courses, yes, they can be irresponsible. But it is also the education system and the world out there.

During JAE counselling sessions, some seniors in the course may mislead the students. They always say "our course very good lah" "super fun" etc etc..... Something needs to be done on the level of transparency at such sessions.<br><br>The best thing is to speak directly to the lecturers or the directors of the respective schools. Funnily, I dont see much students coming for the JAE counselling session. I was a JAE student counsellor for 3 days.</div>
