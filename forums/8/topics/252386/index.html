            <div class='col-md body'>Ok maybe i'm just sensitive or over reacting, but i just wanna hope to hear some comments about this...<br><br>a friend of mine, ok not really, arpound 4 - 5 years older than me, went into ns and came out and study.<br><br>Ok from my point of view, people coming out from ns should be mature?<br>Judging from another friend of mine that came out from ns, he's like mature and looks like "Man of All Wisdom" kind.<br><br>This guy. kinda appear childish to me. or rather immature.<br><br>There was one, in the canteen/foodcourt (or watever u call it), went to eat with that guy and his friends. We found a place, and sit down. Placing their bags on their seat (i assume).<br>Then 1 of my another friend just came down from lesson and took a seat there. The table is make up of 6 seats, just enough for me and my friend + him and his 3 friends. Then the "incident" (or watever u call it) came. That guy return with his food. Suddenly took his bag and sit at other table. i asked him why. he replied: "someone took my place, i not song". I was like  wtf? we dun even noe its his seat, since his bags isn't there. and even though its his seat, isn't this a bit too childish? or is he just petty?<br><br>Then yesterday, we played a game of dota together (i did not invite him and neither i will), he's just new. taugh him here and there. he just keep dying and i just tell him the same old thing again and again, "watch ur hp" and "buy items plz", and then he told his friend i scold him. Althought his friend doesn't really care and i still hang around with them. In the end he suddenly leave the game. then i told him in msn, "next time leave plz tell us, u suddenly leave, me and my other friend will be fucked up" then he replied "then dun play lor". then he blocked me.<br><br>And he can go around calling people noobs or saying bad things about them. but if people say bad things about him, he will just get angry.<br>And to him is like, teachers are like dogs?<br>Oh right, from my point of view, if u wanna ask a question when a teacher is busy doing his stuff or wat is to wait for him to finish his work or to just say "Excuse me".<br>NO, he just shout over the teacher name and use his hand (like calling a dog) to ask the teacher to come. Even if the teacher is occupied with other things he will just keep calling the teacher.<br>From what i see, alot of people in my class did the same thing as me. Went up to the teacher and ask and say "Thank you" when done, or if the teacher is walking around or near u just rise ur hand.<br>And when the teacher is teaching, he will just keep assume his correct. and the when argue starts, he will just suddenly leave the room.<br><br>Ok sorry for the long essay but i dun really know how to summarize everything and describing the situation might be the best to show what i'm thinking.<br>Btw i'm 18 and his around 24 or 5. well both of us got 4 gpa in 2 terms so i can't really critizie on his results. Well sadly to say we are from ite, so 4 gpa might noe even be 2 in poly :s<br><br>Ok just to hope to receive some comments...</div>
