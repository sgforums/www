            <div class='col-md body'>I'm a more shy guy okie.. and this is how a more appropriate approach for ur prob.<br>well if u have got her number thru' frens then she may be upset and be annoyed if u call her just like that, unless she's those who dun mind. If not I think it's good to start with a smile, or casual get-to-know-u chat in sch. Get some frens to intro lorz..<br><br>Smiles do work miracles.... There was a sweet looking ger in my former sch.. Everytime, when we pass each other, I always look and smile at her.. from there we became frens... slow but I think it will not frighten her away...<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br><br>[This message has been edited by Bear (edited 04 September 2000).]</div>

But the difference is that when a gal call up a guy, he would never ignore the call or be rude towards the person, but on the other hand if it's gona be a guy to call the gal, and if she is having a bad day(femaleproblems) that's it!you can just hang up the phone...
