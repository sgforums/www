            <div class='col-md body'>Below is an extract from a blog by a M'sian girl. It offers a very interesting personal view on the secret why M'sians dislike S'poreans so much.<br><br>*START*<br><br>" after being in singapore for about a year, i have discovered the secret of why malaysians dislike singaporeans so much. ha ha. in the past whenever my mates start pokin fun at singaporeans or critizing them, my first thought is ...why are they being so nationalist? after all we are so closely related. due to the fact that many singaporeans are actually malaysians. over the past year, i have met many singaporeans who are "look at me, i am better than thou". sheesh. in the beginning i used to put up with it and shun it aside. today, i'm like..look here dude, if you think that singapore is better than malaysia, you obviously haven't been to KL. not like KL's like the most fantastic city in the world or anything, but hey, we've got more than you will EVER have. singaporeans are so proud of the fact that they're the regional center for south east asia and so many people from other nations are seeking employement here. it's like a hit and run thing. how stupid can they get. we're just here for the money. do you see us giving up our citizenship in the other country and settling down here and contributing to your country? ha! 9 out of 10 of the foreigners i know here are just in for the cash. give em max 10 years and they're out. even the caucasians are getting bored and getting out. since i stay in holland v, which singaporeans term to be happening, and which i find boring compared to KL, the trend of expatriates leaving can be seen. used to see so many caucasians in the local supermarket, but now, less. most malaysians come in and earn the extra buck to bring back to KL and build em mansions. haha.<br><br>btw, for those of you that have the stereotype that singaporeans are very fluent in english, that's just WRONG. the ah beng and ah lian persona did not surface out of no where. yes, there are some really well educated singaporeans which speak good english, but there are, the extra type that speaks broken english. you'll be so suprised. there they all, all looking good and professional, working in an MNC, sometimes a MANAGER, but when they open their mouth, gawd, you'll think that you're talking to the fish monger. but of course, there are some that can speak ok english. gosh, i totally had a culture shock when i discovered all these. not to mention the level of kiasuism. another trend i've noticed is how MNCs always bring in the cream of the crop from KL and promoted them to management in singapore. so if you think that all those big managers and CEOs are singaporeans, check again. they're malaysians with singaporean permanent residency. out of my 4 bosses, 3 of them are malaysians. suprise suprise. i don't understand how singaporeans, knowing all these facts, can still be so arrogant by just being singaporeans. i mean like, they like to job hop around, cuz they can. that's nothing to be proud of. no wonder the turn around in companies are so high.<br><br>all in all, the worse trait i hate the most is how they like to put down other people. thinking that they're better than others. i once had a colleague that was so proud of the fact that he had a degree, like the look at me, i'm better than you attitude. dude, you have a degree and so does everyone else on the street. sheesh. people i know, poke fun at others just for the sake of putting them down. many think that i'm sarcastic when ppl try to joke with me, i'll fire them back. their idea of a joke is saying something to make you look/feel bad, and laughing about it in a group. mind you that they never do this alone. there must be a whole bunch of people around to laugh at their joke. i don't want to give them the chance of picking on me, cuz i know when they start, they'll never stop. i don't only see this happening in my company, but in different groups of people as well.<br><br>many people always ask me why i do not want to apply for singaporean permanent residency, since many ppl hanker after it. and here i am, with all possibilities of getting PR once i apply, but not wanting it. i can't give a definite answer why, but my sole reason is, i want to have as little as possible to do with singapore. not like i'm planning to settle down here anyway. i'm proud to be malaysian. even after i leave for aus, i'll still maintain my malaysian citizenship. i'm sorry to have such an outlook on singaporeans, no matter what i believe that there are some out there which does not fall into the category that i've just mentioned, but of course, there is a rotten egg in every basket. my idea is this, don't be arrogant just cuz you think you're better than others, cuz there is always someone out there who is better than you."<br><br>*END*<br><br>The above passage was reproduced from a blog entry at the following URL:<br>http://www.google.com.sg/search?q=c...g&amp;hl=en&amp;start=3<br><br>Note: The above URL is a Google cached page as the original page where this blog entry is located may have expired.
