              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>BY JANICE HENG </strong></p>
              <p><br>STARTING salaries for university and polytechnic graduates hit a new high last year, according to preliminary figures in the Manpower Ministry's annual report on wages.</p>
              <p>  University graduates had a median monthly starting pay of $3,000. This is up from $2,900 the year before, when wages - which fell in 2009 - returned to pre-crisis levels.</p>
              <p>  Polytechnic graduates earned a median starting pay of $1,850, up from $1,800 the year before.</p>
              <p>  Those who entered the workforce after national service (NS) drew $2,100, up from $2,000.</p>
              <p>  However, starting pay stagnated at $1,600 a month for post-NS Institute of Technical Education (ITE) graduates. For fresh graduates, it rose only marginally to $1,300, from $1,291.</p>
              <p>  Mr David Ang, executive director of the Singapore Human Resources Institute, said the stagnation was not cause for alarm, as 'the current levels (of pay) are quite reasonable'.</p>
              <p>  Their starting pay might have stagnated last year because there were large increases previously, he said. The starting pay for ITE graduates in 2007 was $1,400 for post-NS graduates and $1,217 for fresh graduates.</p>
              <p>  The report, released yesterday, compiled data from surveys by the institutes of higher learning.</p>
              <p>  Among those from four-year degree programmes - not including law and medicine - the highest median starting pay was $3,500. This was the sum drawn by aerospace engineering graduates from Nanyang Technological University, and industrial and systems engineering graduates from the National University of Singapore.</p>
              <p>  The Government has been encouraging investment in those fields, and creating demand for specialist skills, said Mr Yousef Ayub, head of Kelly Engineering Resources which is part of recruitment firm Kelly Services.</p>
              <p>  The highest-paid polytechnic graduates were in the health sciences: optometry ($2,950), and diagnostic radiography or radiation therapy ($2,300).</p>
              <p>  For ITE graduates, post-NS graduates with a Higher Nitec in information technology had the highest starting pay of $1,731.</p>
              <p>  Employment rates were highest for polytechnic graduates, at over 92 per cent. But more university graduates landed full-time jobs compared to their polytechnic counterparts.</p>
              <p>  Of university graduates, 86.4 per cent found full-time permanent jobs, while just 67 per cent of fresh polytechnic graduates and 80.1 per cent of post-NS ones did so.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 30pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">... but car washers are worst paid</span></span></p>
              <p><br><strong>Last year, the median gross monthly pay of car washers was $750, according to MOM's annual occupational wage report. Car washers and polishers had shown up in MOM's annual lists of bottom-paying jobs since 2006, with their pay ranging between $920 and $1,200 before hitting the bottom last year.</strong> -- PHOTO: ALAN LIM</p>

              <p><strong>BY TOH YONG CHUAN <br>and WALTER SIM </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>WHILE the plight of poorly paid cleaners has often made headlines, another group - car washers and polishers - have turned out to be worse off.</p>
              <p>  Last year, their median gross monthly pay was $750, according to the Manpower Ministry's (MOM's) annual occupational wage report yesterday.</p>
              <p>  That puts them at the bottom of the wage ladder.</p>
              <p>  Car washers and polishers had shown up in MOM's annual lists of bottom-paying jobs since 2006, with their pay ranging between $920 and $1,200 before hitting the bottom last year.</p>
              <p>  In contrast, workers who clean offices and other buildings saw a marginal uptick in monthly pay to $815 last year, from $800 in 2010.</p>
              <p>  Three other groups round up the bottom five occupations - stevedores who load and unload ships, construction labourers and odd-job workers. They earn less than $859 a month.</p>
              <p>  At the top end are managing directors and chief executive officers who made $16,684, up from $14,765 a year ago.</p>
              <p>  Other plum jobs were trade brokers ($12,408), company directors ($11,485), foreign exchange dealers ($11,000) and commodities and derivatives brokers ($10,936).</p>
              <p>  But some top earners in 2010 experienced sharp falls in income last year. General practitioners who made $10,786 in 2010 took home $8,196 last year.</p>
              <p>  Fund managers - the third- highest earners in 2010 at $13,873 - suffered an income cut of more than half to $5,746 last year.</p>
              <p>  The MOM wages report, which is based on questionnaires sent to nearly 3,900 companies covering 262,000 full-time workers, does not provide specific reasons for the increase or decrease in monthly pay in various occupations.</p>
              <p>  There is no data on the profile of car washers and polishers, said a MOM spokesman.</p>
              <p>  Checks with unionists also drew a blank on whether these workers are union members.</p>
              <p>  When The Straits Times visited several car washes in petrol stations in Toa Payoh yesterday, most people were reluctant to talk.</p>
              <p>  Many are foreigners rather than Singaporeans as most 'will not work such jobs', said a kiosk supervisor.</p>
              <p>  At one car wash, all the staff were foreigners.</p>
              <p>  At another, only two of the 10 employees were Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>  But the emergence of car washers and polishers as the worst-paying occupation does not completely surprise Mr Zainudin Nordin, MP for Bishan- Toa Payoh GRC.</p>
              <p>  Some of them have sought help at his weekly Meet the People sessions, said the chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Manpower.</p>
              <p>  He added that the work and pay conditions of this group deserve closer monitoring to determine if their wages continue to fall or stagnate.</p>
              <p>  But Mr Lewis Phua, boss of car-grooming firm Dino Car Care, said a distinction should be made between car washers and car groomers. While car washers may be paid below $1,000, the starting pay of car groomers is above $1,200.</p>
