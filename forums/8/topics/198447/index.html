            <div class='col-md body'>From the Afterlife Knowledge Forum here :<br>http://www.afterlife-knowledge.com/cgi-bin/yabb/YaBB.cgi?num=1151861251/0#2<br><br>Hi Matthew,<br><br><blockquote> Sometimes when I read of theories about raw vegetables, or Argon in the atmosphere being elements necessary to live forever or without cancer, I have to laugh. </blockquote>The inert gas argon, when properly stimulated, dissolves negative thoughtforms. It would be the inert gas Xenon, that has healing, regenerative properties.<br><br>However, your compulsion to "have to laugh" here is on another matter altogether - you're laughing at the FEAR that (you perceive) is the underlying motivation behind "wanting to live forever" or "without cancer". This is really quite a separate matter from the motivations of which I speak of - namely to improve the quality of human life, so as to maximimze opportunities for life, experience, growth, evolution, assistantiality, relationships and love.<br><br>You see, disease, cancer and suffering, these are completely unnecessary, and are signs of imbalance. Imbalance on all levels. On a physical, biological, chemical, toxicological level alone (let's speak of psychospiritual and karmic imbalances later), it is due to an unnaturally high presence of environmental, industrial and dietary toxicity. This is simply put, not healthy, not natural, and in need of healing.<br><br><blockquote>The human lifespan may be lengthened, but we are all destined to live on this plane of physcial reality for a limited period of time.  Immortality in the physical plane may be a self-imposed limitation - many do not understand this, and seek it (as well as fear death). </blockquote>Here again, you're focussing on a totally separate subject matter - that of fear (false evidence/ideas appearing as real). The foolish fear-based idea of wanting to "live forever" on the physical. Which is counter-intuitive, and counter-productive. As everyone who has understood the purpose for physical incarnation (see <a href="http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Heart.Of.God/IAC/index.htm" rel="nofollow">*here*</a>) understands, physical incarnation and physical REINCARNATION, is a deliberate tool for human consciential evolution - the purpose of human existence.<br><br>Again, understand that I speak of a completely separate matter here - of promulgating the truth, that disease is an imbalance, that sufferng is unncessary, that healing (including for cancer) is totally possible.<br><br><blockquote>However, I do not see cancer or any disease as being due to diet or man's shortcomings.  Sometimes they are part of our life in the physical plane. However genetics, interactions with carcinogenic substances in a city envirnoment and at work, and our spiritual quests may promote cancer in spite of a perfect diet.</blockquote>Again, disease, including cancer, is not necessary nor desirable, from a spiritual perspective. Oh yes, there are of course cases of all kinds, including that which the individual (or entire family, in the case of genetically determined cancers) has chosen for him/her/themselves, for personal karmic reasons, the opportunity to experience cancer and (potentially) its healing. But from the viewpoint of the higher self and guides &amp; helpers, they understand with compassion the choice/appropriateness/necessity for this, for certain individuals and perhaps for a lifetime or so, but it is never a case of 'punishment', which is the all-important message that is the point here.<br><br>Once people understand that from a higher spiritual perspective, from the perspective of the guides &amp; helpers, suffering, disease and cancer, is NOT necessary nor desirable (if karma calls for it, by all means balance it, but do it well so there is no more unnecessary counterproductive time wasted than there has to be. This is important to grasp).<br><br>Now, Hilarion has spoken at length about the role of viruses, including the bird flu virus, viruses which case cancers, and so on. He spoke on this subject on the Spring Equinox 2006 channeling here :<br>http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Heart.Of.God/Hilarion/Hilarion_On_Viruses.htm<br><br>However, even more recently, in the Summer Solstice 2006 channeling, Hilarion continued on the subject matter in far greater detail. I hope that everyone interested will get the opportunity to read it (once Jon, the channeler, gets it posted up on his website, probably by the end of the year). In fact, those interested in Hilarion channelings can subscribe (at a very reasonable cost) to the Quarterly channelings in audio CD format.<br>http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Heart.Of.God/main.htm#Hilarion<br><br>Among the many important points brought up by Hilarion, on viruses -<br><br>1) Viruses are here to help, and are not to be feared, because by their infection, they help the body to be rid of the toxicity in the body, that is the true cause of the disease.<br><br>2) In addition the the physical, chemical and biological causes, there are always psychspiritual and karmic aspects to almost all diseases and cancers, which must *simultaneously* be looked at and worked on, if optimal healing is desired. Hilarion has in the past spoken on this psychospiritual and karmic aspects in the book "Body Signs", and for individuals wishing to understand the karma behind their medical condition correctly, a <a href="http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Heart.Of.God/main.htm#Hilarion" rel="nofollow">Hilarion Reading</a> is always recommended.<br><br>3) Having a healthy, raw diet, high in raw fats, raw proteins, and specific raw foods for healing specific diseased conditions, is the best way to work with viruses. That is to say, if your body is completely free from toxicity, even the AIDS virus, the bird flu virus, and all viruses known to cause cancer, will have no effect on your physical body.<br><br>4) However, Hilarion observes that, in today's 'modernized society', the degree of environmental, industrial and dietary (processed foods) toxins is so pervasive and extreme, that almost NOBODY now on Earth, even those who have had years, or even a complete lifetime of raw diet, is sufficiently free from toxicity, to the extent that all viruses will have no harmful effect on the body. Therefore, Hilarion advises caution, but one that is enlighted by understanding, and not one darkened with fear.<br><br>5) After all that's been said, the point remains that people must understand the true problem, which are not viruses and bacteria (which medical science has wrongly identified as the root cause of disease), but the toxins due to human greed and foolishness (ie. poorly understood consequences of greed motivated industrialization without regard and consideration for Mother Earth and the welfare of all living species, higher spiritual understanding and love). This must be properly understood to be the true root cause of diseases, and the true role of viruses and bacteria be acknowledged (as helpful).<br><br>Finally, again people must understand that DISEASE IS NOT NECESSARY. SUFFERING IS NOT NECESSARY. HEALING IS NOT ONLY POSSIBLE, IT'S COMPLETELY IN YOUR OWN HANDS.<br><br>Matthew, once again, your well-intentioned sharing is appreciated, but I suggest that in addition to observing the foolishness of fear-based motivations (eg. foolish fear of death), it is also helpful to head in the direction of personal empowerment (ie. taking self-responsibility for one's own healing) and important to let people (eg. visitors to the forum) realize, that they DON'T have to suffer, they DON'T have to be crippled with disease or cancer, that there is A LOT they can do, and that there is a HIGHER MEANING to it all.<br><br>In healing the disease or cancer, or an emotional suffering, the higher spiritual purpose is always for the growth of the soul, for more understanding, growth, light and love - Evolution. And THIS is the purpose for all experiences. And one CAN CHOOSE, to accomplish this goal via HEALTH, JOY AND LOVE, instead of the limiting, unnecessary, counterproductive way of DISEASE, SUFFERING AND LIMITATION.<br></div>
