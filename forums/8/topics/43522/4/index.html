In fact i think u can hear it all the time its just that the house have to be really really quiet and that often happens only late at night when everyone is asleep. If u are alone at home in the day and u keep really quiet u will also hear a lot of funny noises and once your imagination starts to run wild, u will freak out.<br><br>guys don't be paranoid la <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ...those marble sounds u used to hear is probably really just the children upstairs playing with marbles lah..thats why u only remember hearing it when we were younger when marble games were still quite common. another reason i can think of is becoz of the way hdb flats are build. There is a small hollow space for pipes and cables in the concrete between u and your neighbour and it is common to have fine cracks there especially if the flat above has changed their flooring(very common in hdb flats). Therefore a small piece of rock dropping and hitting a pipe can also result in the marble sound. as for those furniture shifting sounds in the middle of the night, all i can say is that not everyone does sleep early. A simple drag of the chair in the dead of the night will also sound loud to the person below. So thats my logical reasoning to those 'ghostly' sounds in the middle of the night. Remember, whenever u feel that u have encountered with a ghost it is mostly just your mind at work. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> </div></blockquote>firstly, u gotta know that ur floor is a concrete slab and below this slab, it's a STRUCTURAL BEAM and after which is ur neighbour's floor slab. the beam is between 2 STRUCTURAL COLUMN. when i say STRUCTURAL, i mean without it ur house will collapse and so, all pipes and watever steer clear of these structural components. by thw way, ur pipes stay in the kitchen-wc area and dun expect any pipes to run here and there in ur ceiling, cos it's not the case. so, there are absolutely no empty spaces between ur ceiling and ur neighbour's floor. so no small rocks can drop and hit some pipes in the middle of the night cos it will never happen.<br>now regarding the 'marble sound' a thought and explanation is that because on the outside of ur floor slab and ceiling, u'll have a layer of 12mm or 1.2cm reinforced concrete plastering. so this layer of plastering may have contracted at night and there comes the sound. because it's realli quiet in the night and so this small effect can be heard.<br>it's my own thinking though i'm not a 'ghost master who got the 3rd or 4th eye' or some people who knows contrator who tou gong jian liao and put marble into ur floor slab. i'm only an architecture student <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>ok, as some suggest it may be contraction of pipes in the concrete which creates sound. sounds logical for the shifting of furniture thing. but for marbles? saw one reply which insists that it is children playing. but does everyone has a marble playing kid living above them? coincidence?<br><br>some ppl say that coz of ppl changing floors and therefore a rock drop down? but have u heard the sound? it goes tock................. tock.......... tock..... tock.. so it will prolly need a certain height to attain that sound.<br><br>and architecture student. can i assume u r still an architecture student currently? so u study how buildings are built right? but did u guys study on how the buildings were built in the past as well? or did u study only in theory? so is there a difference between the theory in the past and the present?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well as i said, in terms of buildability, ur house will definately collapse on u if there are marbles in the slabs or beam. u asked me in theory if there's a difference, i suppose yes. but in practice, please be logical, u cant have some empty spaces between your beams and floor slabs inserted with marbles and it can still stand til today. well maybe a layman will think that way cos they dun have much knowledge of how a structure can stand.<br>and may i ask u, wat profession are u in?<br>i may be still a student in this field but the explanation i give are in theory and this theory is practiced for the whole time. and this is logic. u expect ur ceiling to have holes inserted with marbles or some pipes running around ur house? u gotta be kidding.</div>
