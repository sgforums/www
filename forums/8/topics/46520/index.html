My lecturer then said "Do u think Guiness is trying to reach out to you, a 25 year old young yuppie?"<br>I said "I dun think so, their target customers are more likely more matured adults in their late 30s and above."

If you ever advertise your product to the masses and try to be all things to all men, you will fail miserably. The secret of big brands and why they survive, like Mercedes, BMW, Gucci etc is becos they target and only advertise in places where their customers will see them. Will Gucci care if I poor kid who earns less than $2000 like their ads? NO, they are more concerned about whether those affluent people who are likely to buy their products like their ads.<br><br>Advertisements are very interesting.

But it should also that while topics like SEX would attract attention anywhere in the world where there is MEN hehehe, SEX actually doesnt SELL products in Singapore but in Japan, SEX actually pushes SALES of a product, Interesting huh hehehehe. So looks like Singaporeans still do not respond well to sex-selling.<br><br>Well TV is of cos a mass media, just like Radio (Singapore is one of the few countries where radio is considered a mass media simply becos of our size.). But dun be surprised if i tell you that advertising on a mass media does NOT imply that I am trying to reach the masses.<br><br>Ok example. Say I am selling a imported soccer magazine. And i did a research and find that my target customers who are most likely to be males, between18 - 40 (primary market), who is interested in soccer news etc and i also found out that their media habits include watching TV at Prime Time slots. They dun listen to radio and doesnt respond well to pop ups in internet. So how do i reach them with my message. Through the media that they tune in to of cos! logical? Now, since i only want to sell to this group of people, i would tailor my ad in a way they will understand and like my message and eventually buy the magazine. Of cos, anyone else who sees this message and does not fall into the target group, we would welcome them to buy our magazine, but they are hardly our focus of our advertising because they are our 'secondary target', which means bonus customers to the advertiser. Thus, even in a mass media, an advertisement is very targetted, becos in 30 seconds, you cannot try to tell 10 different messages to 10 different groups of people. Buying habits differ from group to group.<br>As for how the primary target is chosen, that is another issue by itself but once it is chosen, all advertising and marketing efforts need to focus on them. If you notice, Mercedes advertise on TV too. Do they expect masses to buy? No, it is likely they know that people whom they want to buy the cars would be watching TV at that time. This is target advertising.<br><br>I think i am like giving lecture leh hahahaha sorry pardon me.</div>

In the case of Dynamo,i do not know cos i never monitor it anyway. Butin advertising, sales are not always the objective. If you realise, many advertisements are there to create associations with the brand, which may not directly translate to sales.<br><br>Think Benetton. How would u describe Benetton? Their ads are always provocative and very controversial and thus in a research done, it was shown that their branding works, most pple think that Benetton is an unique brand that is very concerned about social issues. However, though the branding objective was achieved and Benetton ads awarded many creative awards, sales never picked up...I dun see Benetton around anymore....<br><br>As for Yunnam and Rainbow Aquarium, one would suspect that their advertisements are largely in house. Which means they do it themselves! There are production houses out there who are more than willing to just film whatever u wan. Advertisements are not always produced by agencies. Of cos there are some advertisements which bombed big time. WHatever it is, advertising is an interesting issue that no one can fully understand, even gurus from Ogilvy admits that there is no right or wrong in advertising, we can only say that our opinions matter to them if we matter to them.</div>

But it should also that while topics like SEX would attract attention anywhere in the world where there is MEN hehehe, SEX actually doesnt SELL products in Singapore but in Japan, SEX actually pushes SALES of a product, Interesting huh hehehehe. So looks like Singaporeans still do not respond well to sex-selling.<br><br>Well TV is of cos a mass media, just like Radio (Singapore is one of the few countries where radio is considered a mass media simply becos of our size.). But dun be surprised if i tell you that advertising on a mass media does NOT imply that I am trying to reach the masses.<br><br>Ok example. Say I am selling a imported soccer magazine. And i did a research and find that my target customers who are most likely to be males, between18 - 40 (primary market), who is interested in soccer news etc and i also found out that their media habits include watching TV at Prime Time slots. They dun listen to radio and doesnt respond well to pop ups in internet. So how do i reach them with my message. Through the media that they tune in to of cos! logical? Now, since i only want to sell to this group of people, i would tailor my ad in a way they will understand and like my message and eventually buy the magazine. Of cos, anyone else who sees this message and does not fall into the target group, we would welcome them to buy our magazine, but they are hardly our focus of our advertising because they are our 'secondary target', which means bonus customers to the advertiser. Thus, even in a mass media, an advertisement is very targetted, becos in 30 seconds, you cannot try to tell 10 different messages to 10 different groups of people. Buying habits differ from group to group.<br>As for how the primary target is chosen, that is another issue by itself but once it is chosen, all advertising and marketing efforts need to focus on them. If you notice, Mercedes advertise on TV too. Do they expect masses to buy? No, it is likely they know that people whom they want to buy the cars would be watching TV at that time. This is target advertising.<br><br>I think i am like giving lecture leh hahahaha sorry pardon me.</div></blockquote>wow. where did u study? i would think advertising is part of marketing. did u do marketing communication?<br><br>anyway there were alot of ads mentioned here.. oh yes i mus remember to mention the visa ads. true that good ads doesnt convert to good sales. but at least the company stand a better chance of reaching out to more people and perhaps when people r faced wif choices between brands the ad tt most impress them would be the final choice.<br><br>i always thought of ads as a kind of art not different from movies, short films and so on.. except their duration is so much shorter and hence they haf to be more effective and create a bigger impact within a shorter span of time. and i feel oso that they transcend race, religion, and possibly age, and hence can really be quite powerful fully utilised. but this notion has yet to be proven yet... i dun remember any ads that had been so powerful as to be able to influence a large proportion of a population. but still .... i guess respectable producers of ads would view their product as works of act too...</div>

Yeah u are right, advertising is just but a small part of marketing, or rather Integrated Marketing Communications. Ya i took Marketing Communications, its a compulsory core subject.<br><br>Yeah in the end i think yes we do want people to like our ads, why not right, i was just pointing out that even if an ad is not well liked, a product may not do badly too....ya but certainly, no advertisers start an ad to want people to hate it hehehe.<br><br>It is an art indeed. Just like any art, there are theories but art is challenging because it takes theories and apply it diiferently. To me, theories are published findings of another human being and waiting to be proven wrong. So it always excites me to go thru the process, hey what should i do in this case etc.<br><br>I however disagree that advertisements can transcend religion and even race. Even in Singapore itself, a multiracial culture, it can be hard. And this is a whole new study of cultural advertising by itself, but in short, advertising should be targetted at a group's culture not the culture of the whole nation. For example, Organ Donation advertisements do not get good response from many muslims becos it is in their beliefs that it is not right to do so, but of cos there are many more muslims who donate their organs nowadays. The issue of sensitivity to culture in advertising is forever an issue and thus it can be quite difficult to transcend religion and race. You can refer to Hofstede's 5 dimensions for more details.</div>

It all depends on the advertiser. For example, an Ad that says "50% off, come buy Now!" obviously wants to increase salesin the short run more than anything. An ad like Coke's "Ministry of Enjoyment" is a branding exercise, wanting u to associate Coke with fun so whenever u having fun at parties, games or watever, u would think of coke.<br><br>Agree with u that the amount of 'Noise' made do make an impact but then again it was shown by research that louder noises does not mean better brand recognition and more importantly brand association. A good example for me would be 'Adam King'. with all the noise it is making, it now makes me feel that Guiness is very lame, i dun noe what they are trying to do, firstly u get a 'classy' guy to represent Guiness, the next moment u do some big scale pole dancing at a neighbourhood kopi tiam, the IMC of Guiness just doesnt fit.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting topic... I am also a marketing student so heres my 2 cents worth....<br><br>i cannot agree more with the importance of a clear target audience...<br>with tat i do not think that the commercials like dynamo and the weiwei ad (the washin powder ad with pple dancing) suck cuz its the audience its gonna attract... it may sound stupid to pple like us because of its lack of depth blar blar blar but come to tink of it which one of us actually buys washin powder or even wash clothes for a start?? the ad is done to get attentation of housewifes which currently falls in the catergory of aunties, it gets the msg across with pple statin it as an effective washing powder as the same with dynamo. and aunties like them would find simple msg like tat appealin and understandable and its easier to leave an impression in their mind with ads like this thus the next time they shop in NTUC or watever, the man in white (or the group of pple dancin singing the familiar tune) might pop up into their mind and when it does, chances of them actually might juz buy the product cuz its msg in the ad is clear and concise....<br><br>Can u imagine having those "thinkin" ads for commodites like this? it might appeal to us as a good ad made for better viewin but does its target audience able to comprehend the msg the ad is tryin to get across??<br><br>Thus the difference in style of is due to the difference of target audience....<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
