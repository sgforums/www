But those greedy agents, both overseas and local wanted to earn more money by not extending their permit, and instead bring in new bloods so as to earn the fees again. In the end, most have no face to go back to see their family because for them, it is a lost in money, lost in work and lost of promises. Therefore they wander off and remain illegal here selling illegal cigarette, doing odd jobs, anything...just to make money.<br><br>There is another group of foreign workers who are directly engaged by companies, these are mostly chinese, mynmar and thais, they are much more taken care of with housing and proper working condition.<br><br>However, having said all, some indians or bangalas who make money here by being the leader or so call boss left hand men, get lots of money both as  leaders, drivers and also supply of labourers from india. Some of them, being naive to city life here, spent all their money on gals, drinks, leisure etc etc and in the end, also have no money saved.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>First of all, as an illegal worker with no ID, he should have been more cautious with his actions and try not to break any petty laws so as not to attract attention from any authorities, be it NEA or Police or even the street sweeper. Throwing cigarette butt around ... he was careless. Very careless.<br><br>Also, I believe when he made the decision to jump over the wall, he didn't know that behind the wall is a 15m drop to the tarmac. It was an intense moment for him, perhaps running at the fastest he had ever run before in his life. I can't imagine what was going through his mind the moment he realised what he had done, having gone over the point of no-return after jumping the wall. It must have been like a slow motion for him, as images of his loved ones flashed through his mind before he landed. Very traggic. Again, I can't imagine and don't ever wish to know the amount of regret and pain he must have felt after he jumped the wall.<br><br>While we like to poke funs at illegal immigrants (FT as you all like to call it), please remember that our forefathers were immigrants to Singapore not too long ago. Your grandparents, even some of your parents. Singapore is an immigrant country. You are lucky that your family arrived here 1 or 2 generations earlier than these illegals today. Next time, whenever you plan to insult illegal immigrant, please remember that that's how the people treated your grandparents last time when they first arrived in Singapore.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by zhaozhilong:</div><div class="quote_body">There was no such thing as "legally or not" back then. There was no such thing as a passport back then. You must be delusional. Most of our ancestors came here with a bag carrying only clothes and very little money, without any documents. I don't know where did you get the idea of "legally". What you should say, is that back then Singapore was a free for all port. Anybody who managed to reach the shore can enter and find a job. What, you thought there were customs checkpoints? You probably thought the Woodlands checkpoint already existed at that time too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Regarding all the contributions that our forefather did, I know they're admirable. But tell me, did they make the contributions before they enter Singapore? Or did they make the contributions within 10 minutes of entering Singapore, so much so that it earned them their rights to stay in Singapore? The fact is, the contributions only materialized after many many years of staying in Singapore.<br><br>Of course in 2007 we can't anyhow allow people to come in and stay here. But don't use the 'contributions' argument because all contributions can only be seen after at least 10 years of working in Singapore.<br><br>By your logic, then the people who came to Singapore as early as year 1880 would have had the right to deny all those who wanted to come in after say year 1920. Why? Because according to your logic, they can say:"No you cannot come in. I have already made contributions for the last 40 years. What contributions have you made? So no you cannot come in. " I bet your forefathers didn't arrive here before 1920 did they.<br><br>It's okay to deny illegal immigrants today. But if you use insults on them, you are just indirectly insulting your forefathers. But you'd probably say:"oh but my forefathers toiled and worked for a living blablabla...". Yes but there must be a starting point for working hard. You have to start somewhere. </div></blockquote>Answer to paragragoh 1: As long as no one catches you  its legal.<br>Answer to paragraph 2: they made the contributions so that we can become Singapore<br>Answer to paragraph 3: The blood we shed we forfathers don't get paid. u work here don't tell me even bangla don't get paid?<br>Anser to paragraph 4: don't talk about donkeys years ago lah...why not talk about india and china 5000 years ago? how about we look at ants and dinosaurs?<br>Answer to para 5 : i wasn't insulting my forefathers...i was insulting my forefathers's and the illegal's forefathers back in india and china thousands of years ago.<br><br>so to all illegal immigrants..u won't have to runa dn hide if u have ID. sg very small where u can hide for how long?<br><br>as for the one who died i am glad he did. a n=better way off  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
