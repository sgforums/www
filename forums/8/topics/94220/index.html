            <div class='col-md body'>If you are a real dog lovers, you won't mind how old is he, whether is he approached death (of cuz I'm not saying about getting a dog with alot of illness, WAITING to die... but there are really GREAT dog lovers to do so)  You won't be suprise to see that either...  My dog is in pink of health, vaccinated every year, dewormed, sterilized and hyperactive and smart dog with lots of alertness... I don't wanna give him out to others too if I'm in the pink of health... I'm still hestating to give up you know... I just wanna check if there are really real adoptor around...<br><br>No puppy sorry.. cuz I'm not those buyers that buy and abandon.... sorry...<br>I'm against breeding too... cuz they are alot of ppls who are only buying pets for their interest, when they lost their interests, they will find ways to abandon them... so why must we breed and increase the size of the dog population?  Why not adopt one and give them a real nice home?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes dear all, thanks for replying to my posting... I think I will pend my posting for giving him out for adoption first... I still can't bear to let him go off from me... I actually gave him up for adoption in March but I sort of fetched him home not long ago from the adoptor's family cuz the adoptor has passed away in May.  They did not take good care of him, having fleas on him when I fetched him home.  When I see it, make my heart pain and hurt.  I cannot scold @#@$@# at them but to pity my boy.<br><br>Recently I had my asthma on the past wed and had to rush all the way to the night clinic for doc.  I was given oxygen to breathe which is a very worse condition for me compared to previously.  I was so scare yet I can't bear to give him away.  My parents wish that I can really give him to others so as not to see my health becoming poorer and poorer due to the allegy and asthma attack.  My whole mind and brain was so upset by this... noone to speak to as everyone of my frds and family keep asking me to give up.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  How I wish I have the chance to recover and take care of him til his death.<br><br>Anyway, I have edit my posting as *PENDING FOR ADOPTION* I hope I can still keep him with me.  I just brought him for sterilization last Fri so I wanna take care of him on my own first.  Thanks everyone.  So sweet to have all your concerns.</div>

Since you mentioned that your parents will object to it, I doubt you can have any pet of your own at home.  If I want to find a potential adoptor for him means the whole family have love the dog not only the adoptor.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Anyway, thanks for your thoughts.
