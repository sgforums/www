The Bar next to it is no longer in operational.<br>Remember my last visit had a chat with Mr Lim, ask him why he don't move and he said that the shop was inherited from his father and therefore the shops at the 4 floor level was privated owned one. Therefore he waiting for the Bank to offer him a good price otherwise he said he will be stay as long as he can. Now he doing more and PC installation and hardware then selling games now. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
