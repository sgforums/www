            <div class='col-md body'>The much awaited NEL may opens for operation on Saturday 21 June 2003. (If my analysis is not proven wrong)<br><br>LTA and SBS Transit have said that the NEL may opens latest by Friday 20 June, but the chance of opening the entire MRT line for operation on a Friday is very very low. In the past, all MRT lines and LRT lines started operation on a Saturday, so that's explain why the chance of opening the line on a Saturday is higher.<br><br>But, if LTA and SBS Transit decide to open NEL earlier on this Saturday, 14 June. Then today will be the day they make the announcement, so people who are taking the NEL, watch out for the news today.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NO CHANGE FOR BUS FARE, FARE DIFFERENTIAL FOR NEL<br><br>1. The Public Transport Council (PTC) approved today the fares for the North East MRT Line (NEL),<br>a state-of-the-art fully automated underground heavy rail system. The fares for NEL will be distance-based and include a fare differential ranging from 5 cents to 25 cents. (Please see Annex.)<br><br>2. To help ease the travel costs for Singaporeans during these difficult times, SBS Transit will implement the approved differential pricing for NEL in two phases.<br><br>3. For the first three months of operations, the fare differential for NEL ez-link adult fares will be lower by 10 cents. As such, commuters on the first fare band will pay 59 cents and enjoy lower fares than the existing MRT fares. Those at the higher end will pay a maximum fare differential of 15 cents instead of the approved 25 cents. Senior Citizens who pay the minimum adult fare during the off-peak hours will also enjoy lower fares, by 10 cents, for the initial three months. They will only need to pay a flat fare of 59 cents during the off-peak.<br><br>4. Child concession fares and the monthly Train Concession Pass charges will be priced at the prevailing rates as those currently charged for the existing MRT.<br><br>Why differential faresÂ…<br><br>5. The fare differentials for NEL are necessary as a result of the system being fully underground. This is because:<br><br>a. For the comfort of commuters, all NEL stations are fully air-conditioned. This results in higher electricity costs, compared to ground-level stations that are not air-conditioned.<br><br>b. For an underground system, there are additional safety features, such as platform screen doors, fire protection systems, ventilation fans etc built-in to ensure the safe operation of the system. These systems incur electricity and maintenance costs that are not necessary for an above-ground system.<br><br>As a result, we estimate that the increase in operating cost of an underground system compared to one above ground is about 10%.<br><br>6. In addition, the 27-hectare depot that houses the NEL trains, which was built at ground level, became effectively underground with the construction of a deck above it. This site is zoned for light industrial development and forms an important part of the corridor development strategy in the future.<br><br>7. All in, the increase in operating cost as a result of having a fully underground system and a covered depot is $10.3 mil. The fare differential will go towards defraying this increased operating cost.<br><br>8. Even with fare differential, the NEL is expected to operate at a loss in the early years of operation. This is largely due to lower ridership as a result of slower developments in new towns such as Sengkang and Punggol.<br><br>Benefits to commutersÂ…<br><br>9. The NEL brings significant savings in fares, travel time as well as improved comfort and added convenience to those living along or travelling to the north-east corridor. The comparison of bus and rail services below show the cost and time savings that commuters stand to benefit from travelling on NEL as compared to travelling on bus:<br><br>Journey Trunk Service Express Service NEL<br>From Sengkang Interchange<br>to Dhoby Ghaut Station $1.23 $1.98 $1.49<br>70 mins<br>(Svc 85)  63 mins<br>(Svc 502)  20 mins<br>From Hougang Central Interchange<br>to Outram Station $1.33 $1.98 $1.54<br>73 mins<br>(Svc 147)  45 mins<br>(Svc 511)  22 mins<br>From Dhoby Ghaut Station to<br>Hougang Central Interchange $1.13 $1.83 $1.39<br>53 mins<br>(Svc 111)  44 mins<br>(Svcs 512)  16 mins<br><br>We are confident that the greater comfort, convenience and savings in travel time which the NEL brings will offer value for money to commuters.<br><br>Through-Journey FaresÂ…<br><br>10. For commuters travelling between the NEL and existing MRT system, the fares payable will be Â“through-journeyÂ” fares; ie. the fares paid will be broadly distance based as if the commuter had made the journey on one system. This is unlike the situation for journeys between the NEL/MRT and the bus where two separate fares are paid and a transfer rebate is given.<br><br>11. In addition, commuters do not have to worry about how their fares will be calculated when travelling between rail systems. Fare calculation will be as seamless as their journey when transferring between rail systems at the interchange stations. The through-journey fare system will automatically calculate the correct distance-related fare for each journey.<br><br>SBS Transit not applying for bus fare increaseÂ…<br><br>12. SBS Transit has also decided not to apply for a bus fare increase this year. This is despite the fact that operating costs increased in 2002 and our ridership saw a drop of 3.8 percent. GST also increased by 1 percentage point amounting to an additional $4.4 million in cost for 2003. This largely eroded the slight fare adjustment last year.<br><br>13. As a responsible public transport operator, we hope maintaining the current bus fares and implementing the NEL fare in phases, will keep the travel costs down and help commuters tide over this period of uncertainty. We will continue to take all possible measures to increase operational efficiency and contain our operating costs.<br><br></div>
