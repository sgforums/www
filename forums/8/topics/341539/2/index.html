              <p>Dude, that is a reject, but in a polite way. (with "another time perhaps" but never.) <br>If she wanted to go out with you but have other plans at that point of time, she will initiate another meetup with you, but did she? I assume it's a no. <br></p>
              <p>You tried twice, how about giving it another go? Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>Okay the previous times I've asked her if she'd like to go out
              with me, she always replies with "another time perhaps :)"</p>
              <p>Last night I texted her after conversing with her about her
              recent trip overseas, asking her "Hey, do you think maybe I could
              take you out for a movie sometime?", with her replying "hmm movie,
              we'll see about that :)"</p>
              <p>i don't understand what she meant :/ help me someone!</p>

              <p>Dude, that is a reject, but in a polite way. (with "another time perhaps" but never.) <br>If she wanted to go out with you but have other plans at that point of time, she will initiate another meetup with you, but did she? I assume it's a no. <br></p>
              <p>You tried twice, how about giving it another go? Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>sometimes she makes it look as though she might be interested in
                  me too, and yet too sometimes, she just suddenly shuts herself out
                  completely. shes oh so very confusing.</p>
              <p>i've told her how i feel about her, shes told me to take it slow
                  but i don't even know if she feels the same way towards me and i
                  dare not ask.</p>
              <p>anybody here believe in signs? i call her bumblebee, and ever
                  since the day i met her, 6 months ago, ive been seeing bees all
                  over.</p>
              <p>the first bee was a dead bee though, that was right under my
                  flat. then after that i've been seeing posters using bees, bee
                  playgrounds, bee banners, and all sorts of things using bees.</p>
              <p>i'm thinking, all of these might be signs, but i might just be
                  dumb and it might all just be coincidental you know?</p>
              <p>and for some reason, i keep feeling like shes the one.</p>
              <p>shes the only thing ive been thinking about for these past few
                  months.</p>
              <p>sometimes i want to text her things like "my heart thinks of you

                  closer to you than to me. my heart cares more about you than it

              <p>it's in ur imagination.</p>
              <p>if she's interested, she will show her interest, and go out with you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i know this stupid idiot, totally insane, at city harvest bible study, he thought this girl interested in him, so he flashed her. he kept insisting the girl was interested in him, because she kept looking at his direction. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so moral of the story is.. just because you think it is so, please have a reality check.</p>
