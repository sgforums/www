              <p>sometimes she makes it look as though she might be interested in me too, and yet too sometimes, she just suddenly shuts herself out completely. shes oh so very confusing.</p>
              <p>i've told her how i feel about her, shes told me to take it slow but i don't even know if she feels the same way towards me and i dare not ask.</p>
              <p>anybody here believe in signs? i call her bumblebee, and ever since the day i met her, 6 months ago, ive been seeing bees all over.</p>
              <p>the first bee was a dead bee though, that was right under my flat. then after that i've been seeing posters using bees, bee playgrounds, bee banners, and all sorts of things using bees.</p>
              <p>i'm thinking, all of these might be signs, but i might just be dumb and it might all just be coincidental you know?</p>
