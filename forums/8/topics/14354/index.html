            <div class='col-md body'>M'sia tried to lure potential BIG SHOTS to invest in the country and suceeded doing so.  BMW made M'sia its regional centre in the Asia-Pacific region.  Airlines are changing bases - S'pore to M'sia. Where are the freight companies?  Freightage too expensive in Singapore?  PSA losing business to M'sia?  Now M'sia is upgrading their Military hardware and capacity.  Dear Brothers/Sisters, do you guys sense something?  Something real wrong.  M'sia has all this while accused Singapore of being "insensitive", "arrogrant", "problem finder" etc.  The Straits Times was right in saying that M'sia should also consider S'pore's feeling and not always using the media to stir "thoughts" among the M'sians on claims (in the newspapers) about Singapore.  For example, Singapore profiting from the sales of treated water and the tudung issue (just two).  Malaysia had many times over the last 10 years display their unhappiness and discontentment over the water and other bilateral issues.  Why am i writing all this?  I want fellow Singaporeans to realise the seriousness of the this issue.  Have you wondered why the Parliament raised concerns on whether Singaporeans will die for their country?  We must not forget that many many people took great pain and effort to build this country.  We need to work hard for the future of Singapore.  Yeah, you people might think this is rubbish or know you must work hard for Singapore but the point is this - we WILL NOT allow situations such as now to ruin our country.  We must not forget that we're surrounded by muslim nations.  Muslims work together, as one.  One speech by Lee Kuan Yew and Indonesians started burning our flags and protested outside the Singapore Embassy in Indonesia.  Where are the most hardcore Muslim/Islamic militants found?  Which area is the Al Queda terrorist network focusing on?  South-East Asia.  Don't get me wrong!  Islam teach people to be good.  It's because of the extremists that use the name of Allah and Islam for their terrorist actions therefore hurting the reputation of Islam.

            <div class='col-md body'>everything sounds in order except airlines.<br><br>nope airlines are not moving to malaysia as yet. Malaysia in fact has lost quantas, british airways and lufthansa to name a few.<br><br>This is one industry where cutting costs alone will not suffice. Top notch service and safety inspections are critical also. The management and infrastructure is available and kicking here. This is clearly doubtful over there since major airlines have decided to call it quits.<br><br>Even it they lower other costs, they gonna face dilemmas; who's gonna foot the bill for all these subsidies? They have to consider their nation's reserves..their plan to lower costs and woo major players is succeeding for now.<br><br>In a few years time, when they drain their capital reserves, they're gonna face  possible monetary problems. Their finance minister (what a coincidence! it is Mahathir!) must manage their cash flow carefully or risk ther glorious plan backfiring in their faces.<br><br>Whether Malaysia succeeds, only time will tell.....and our own desire to make new ground and headway to stay in the lead. Or risk getting caught cold.</div>
