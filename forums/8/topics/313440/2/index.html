              Aquarians are very selective about who they mix with. If you can't even gel with her as a friend, you're not gonna get anywhere. And I don't mean the problem lies with you, cos there's nothing you can do about it.

              <p><br> ok Miss Tiny , let me ask u hor ...</p>
              <p>does an aquarius lady , fancy a much more matured man than
              someone age close to them ?</p>
              <p>or an aquarius , they doesn't mind a married man , unlike some
              other stars ? As long as both clicked ?</p>
              <p>I got this funny feeling ....</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Yes, they do fancy matured men, but not in terms of age, as long as Aquarian women feel that their partner is independent and matured enough, regardless of their age. (This is just my point of view since I'm an Aquarian, not sure about other Aquarians)</p>
              <p>I'm not sure about ur female friend, but I think she's kinda interested in you. Aquarians may be weird in some way, but they are harmless ok.. Their way of showing their emotions are a bit different from other horoscopes only.</p>
              <p>They may seem cold on the outside but actually filled with emotions inside them. It's really hard for guys to understand what they are thinking about, so u have to win their trust first.</p>
              <p>I don't think ur friend said "I Love U" just for fun, I mean who in the hell would say that for no reason. But just dun toy with their feelings, they will come back to u for revenge. Lol..</p>

              <p>Yeah.. Somewhat they are a bit flirty but when they have a bf, they will tend to keep a low profile and won't flirt that much.</p>
              <p>I dun think they are those one leg step 2 boat type of persons, but of course every horoscope will have these type of ppl.</p>
              <p>I think we Aquarians tend to remember those people who had hurt us. They are not bizzarre lah... just that they have this mentality "be nice to me and i'll be nice to u".</p>

              <p>One example , my current spouse : Sagittarius</p>
              <p>Saggitarius is the search for freedom type of personality , everything they do , they never put others as first considerations , it's always put : "Will my freedom be tight down ? "</p>
              <p>Saggitarius always got those "0strich head in the sand " mentallity , as in , when problem arise , they will chose to remain quiet , and see . They will never find a solution to solve the crisis . Until problem is so severe , then they jump down from Raffles City and died , like that !</p>
              <p>All my Saggi friends all similiar one , damn complacent type of personality .In times of problems , Saggi never solve their own problems , it's usually someone else to solve for them .</p>
              <p>Saggi never will make good decisions . Because of their in search of freedom and peaceful personality , they would always go thru the short-cut solution , which is not the best solution .</p>
              <p>Saggi can never be a good parent , cos children for them is a burden . All they want is peace and freedom .</p>
              <p>All in all, i hate Saggitarius , one of the most fuck-up character in the horoscope .</p>

              <p>Taurus ....</p>
              <p>No.1 is money and career !!! Men ior women .</p>
              <p>No.2 is family .</p>
              <p>I admit 100% to that .</p>
              <p>To a Taurus , money can be magical . Nvr tell a Taurus Money cannot buy happines , to a Taurus , money can do alot of things .</p>
              <p>Taurus - No money for them is a disaster .</p>
              <p>Because they have a desire for money , that make them possible to make the best for the family .</p>
              <p>Taurus can be a very good father or a very good mother .</p>
