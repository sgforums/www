            <div class='col-md body'>Yummers...<br><br>Let me offer a slightly different take on this thread. I guess I am being presumptious but please bear with me. Friendship is ephemeral at best. Truly. Even those who you think will stay frens with you forever and ever (when u r in your teens).<br><br>All of a sudden, it's the late twenties and people marry. Their family/spouse becomes more (much more) impt to them than frens. Yah, you can still maintain that contact, but the friendship is altered at a fundamental value because their spouses' views has direct bearings on your relationship. When u r there, u'll know.<br><br>When u start working, frenships change too. They become "networking". Nodes leading to other nodes. At a surface level, they are still your frens. New people you meet are "frens" but in reality (whether you see it as such is another matter), you become part of the networking chain. SDS has changed its function as a match making society to an unabashedly forum for young professionals to network.<br><br>Just don't expect too much. Rely on yourself to get you through life.<br><br>cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am really greatful to have such wonderful friends around me. I must amit, I don't have that many friends, but I would rather take quality over quantity. But now I am wondering. Is is really possible for a guy and girl to be just best friends? What I mean was, Well, I wasn't too intersted in this girl, but when I became to know more about her, I started to like her very very much.( She and me are very close. Like Bro and Sis.) If you see the TV show "Friends" you can see what I mean, cause they also show good friends falling in love with each other.. Is it just me?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Cantofire (edited 16 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm...for the past few years..i have been thinknig of whther gal and guys can be good friend.. Few months back i think of this wuestion again... Hmm..I feel tht possible for gals but not for guys.  As for guys, u just have to hold back yourself and let the like feeling goes off on it own..Even how mcuh u like her u got to withold yourself from telling her IF U STILL WANNA BE TOgether...  But hor, even if u got no motive towards the gals,,,they might still think u are after them...and they will tried to distant u... from past experience....:-)<br><br>Theoritically, i think it's not possible for guys.. But if u can control your feeling , practically it's possible :-)<br><br>[This message has been edited by patie (edited 16 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>firstly, i want to thank u all for posting your replies. i really appreciate it. when is one most likely to find a true friend??? i mean at what age is it the most possible for one to find a true friend?<br><br>mayb it's just not time yet.......for me to find my true friend.....somehow, i find the people around me (in school) very hypocritical......they are just so engrossed in their own stuff that they don't bother to talk to you (heart to heart) not to mention give someone (a friend) a hug now and then, and whenever they are feeling down....seen a few of my friends cry because of this. maybe it's cause of the up coming examinations, but i don't see why people who claim to be someone's good friend can neglect her at the point where she needs the most care and concern........</div>

I have a lot of aquaintance and well, some of my friends became my aquaintance after some time.<br><br>But I'm really glad I have this 3 best frens, of which, one is my boyfriend.

Basically, I'm quite tom-boyish (in character) and I can't stand some ladies-associated character.

            <div class='col-md body'>willa: undeniably, u are right. people do become more and more hypocritical and materialistic as they grow older. materialistic, mayb not that much, but hypocritical, yes. it's really a great pity that we have to lose our innocence....and pure minds to come into the real world....sometimes, i feel sooooo sick... sick of myself, for being such a hypocrite. sighz......let's just hope i can find a true friend to go thru' the rest of my life with me. i would be contented with only one. =)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>true friends do not always have to be with u physically as long as they exist in your heart...u know that u can always depend on them and they will give u their support in whatever u do. they will always have time to listen to u and give u encouragements. they may not always be correct and they may not be perfect, but u can always see something special in them. even when u are angry with them, u know that u still love them very much and all they have is good intentions for u.i have understood the meaning of true friends from 3 very special ppl that i have known for 6 years.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>tHe BeSt aNd MosT bEaUtiFuL tHinGs iN tHe wOrLd cAnnOt bE sEEn oR tOuChEd. tHeY mUsT bE fELt wItH tHe hEaRt...</div>
