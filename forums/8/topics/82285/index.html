            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">by Sheik Cockman</span><br><br>The president of the S-League Federation, Mr. Goh Suk Kok, came out with this guns blazing after an unkind comment made by Mrs. Beachie Bhai-Lim, president of the Singapore Netballers Federation, who had stated that football didnÂ’t deserve to be considered a core sport.<br><br>Mrs Bhai-Lim had made these comments in response to the SSC granting football another year of core sport status, in preference over netball. Mr. Suk Kok did not take it lying down.<br><br>Â“Who the heck plays netball? Only tall girls and pondans right? Like that you might as well make sewing a core sport!Â” retorted Mr. Goh Suk Kok.<br><br>Mrs. Bhai-Lim had stated that the nationÂ’s football results had been less than inspiring of late, with recent humiliating defeats to the British Councils under-11 team still fresh in memory. She added that the level of interest in the S-League was also waning, with diminishing crowds and muted interest in the national game.<br><br>Â“Nobody even knows who is playing or who is managing anymore. Every team in the S-League loses to each other 10-2!!!!Â” she exclaimed to the national press about three weeks ago.<br><br>Mr. Goh replied with, Â“First of all, she should take off her sunglasses. She looks like Yoko Ono. Second of all, the S-League is more popular than ever! Who wouldnÂ’t want to see has-beens from Africa battle it out with fat ang mors from Australia? Attendances may be down to about 200 per game thatÂ’s true, but itÂ’s because they are all watching from the nearby flats. They donÂ’t want to pay, you see!Â”<br><br>Â“If you total up all the free tickets we give away, plus the people in the flats and the ground staff, we get healthy crowds of 250 on average per game. ThatÂ’s still 230 more than the average netball attendance. Tell that to the cow!Â” spat out Mr. Goh.<br><br>Mr. Goh however had one suggestion to make netball reach core sport status, Â“They should play with nothing but bikinis or something, then definitely they will get my support too! Lingerie also can.Â”<br><br>When informed of Mr. GohÂ’s comments, Mrs Bhai-Lim went berserk, screamed Â“Tell Suk Kok toÂ… to you know, lah!Â” and punched our reporter in the face, thus saving her maid from having hot water thrown on her or something.<br><br>(Our reporter is on leave again for 2 weeks, for injuries suffered whilst covering this story.)<br><br>from <a href="http://www.talkingcock.com" rel="nofollow">www.talkingcock.com</a></div>
