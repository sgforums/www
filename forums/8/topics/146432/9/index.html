But the effort is quite weak, and more often than not, nuthing is done.<br><br>The Islam received backlash from the rest of the world, and many responded to these backlash by joining the ranks of terrorists. Even the Muslims themselves suffer, Taliban in Afghanistan, fundamentalists in Iran, even Saudi Arabia suffers at its complete avoidance of the terrorists issue.<br><br>Looking at the rest of the major faiths right now, I fear the second faith that may take this route is Christianity.
