B4 u guyz asking me, i would like to tell u that yes, i am a christian, a catholic.<br><br>Do apologize for what u had heard from some of our disrespectful brothers and sisters, who do not understand the meaning of respect. But as a matter of fact, no matter what religion u are in, be it christians, buddhist , hindu or muslims, there are always black sheep, and this is always the truth. So i hope u guyz do not hurt the majority becoz of some minority by generalizing chrisitanity as a whole and attack them. I do understand ur anger, however we should give and take as i believe there are some taoist and buddhist out there also do criticize christianity.<br><br>Another reason that i would like to voice out is respect. I had never seen even a thread, from a christian ; just start a thread to criticize buddhism. ( correct me if i am wrong) but i do see alot of buddhism/taoism believers are doing this to us; thus i hope u can interprete urself.<br><br>Second, maybe you should consider other ppl believe as well when u do practice ur own belief. Would u like a person shouting infront of ur door, singing religious songs right infront of ur door step and when u question them,  why is that so, they would reply, my belief state i must do that. I bet u will find this very unacceptable right. Although i do respect ur belief, the same apply, i felt very disgusted when i open my door, and right infront of my hdb door step i see piles of ashes infront and not to mention some flew in to my unit. And being told that u shdnt sweep them,  u shdnt step on them becoz the belief says so, is indeed very frustating at times. Because it is ur belief not mine. I will sweep. So , what i am trying to raise out is, can one be more considerate, respect other ppl religions by sweeping those ashes away, instead of living them infront of ppl house and in the middle of the walk way.<br><br>Try to stand in the shoes of our other fellow believers, do u think it is nice to have this ashes flying into muslims houses, infront of indians door step. We dont voice out becoz we respect. However, pls also do your part. I am mentioning this scenario becoz, it might be one of the cause, the frustration of others due to this scenario that "criticize" this belief.<br><br>Thank you.</div></blockquote>Well, for one thing, u are right to say its unwise of people to burn paper money in places other than the assigned bin, and burning them in pathways which also mess up the place when the wind blows<br><br>but i have bones to pick, when i see that u mentioned taoists and buddhists are the one bashing christians here<br><br>how u noe? u checked up on those guys? from past topics, a lot are self confessed atheists too and they discuss mostly on attitude of some christians<br><br>besides, there are also christians bashing non believers too, i guess u havent been in here long enuff....</div>

Although the 7th month has its origin in Buddhism, called Ullambana Dharma, not many people know the true meaning and purpose of it. Buddhists do not believe that the hell gates open on the 7th month nor in burning hell notes. As I have mentioned in another post, burning paper originally was done near the corpse to prevent germs from damaging the corpse. But later in Chinese folks tradition it developed to something else. Buddhists however, do not suscribe to this belief or practise.<br><br>To find out what the 7th Month is truly about, pls read this article: <a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no1a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no1a.htm</a> or come to the thread in my forum regarding hungry ghosts, <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=139490" rel="nofollow">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=139490</a></div>

Load of crap i say.<br><br>Just be a lil' more tolerant during this month, and shut their mouths if nothing good comes out of it. Every religion have their own customs what. At least we don't go to interchanges and tell them to come to a 'party' or some 'concert' or whatever, when their true intention is to get u to go to their church and try to convert you. Seriously, if one wants to convert, does he need so much persuasion or nagging?<br><br>I'm not referring to ALL christians of course, just a small grp of black sheep. And these small grp irritate the hell outta me. Like at my condo, got this family, this also complain that also complain. When their neighbour's baby cry, some more wanna pick a fight with them. But when their own baby cry, nobody can say anything. Their baby is baby, other ppl baby is not baby is it? This has nothing to do with religion of course. But i just notice that most of these ppl who love to complain over small things, but never look at themselves, are, well, you know what religion i referring to.
