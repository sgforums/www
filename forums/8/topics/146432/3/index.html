            <div class='col-md body'>I think we need to separate the issues from whether the original comments were religiously motivated or life-style motivated. It is rather unfortunate that most of the vocal Christians are middle-class folks who sometimes even forget that they are Chinese.<br><br>On the issue of burn sacrifices for the dead, sometimes comments are made not because of intolerance but because of safety issues. I'd seen one such rituals done in a cul-de-sac amongst trees in high winds. The fire was so large that I became concern that it might be blown towards the trees and starting an inferno. So if I were to make an issue, it is not because that I have become an intolerant Christian but I am more concious of the safety factor.<br><br>I live below a Catholic family that have children who enjoys dropping marbles on their floor at all hours of the day. The adults would indiscriminately pour dirty water off their balcony windows and the water landing on my balcony.<br><br>I would not sing Karaoke beyond 10.30 pm, do not allow my children to play marbles in the house and do not do any fixing and repairing beyond 10 pm.<br><br>There are nice non-Christians as well as nice Christians, vice-versa there are rude Christians as well as rude non-Christians.

Although the 7th month has its origin in Buddhism, called Ullambana Dharma, not many people know the true meaning and purpose of it. Buddhists do not believe that the hell gates open on the 7th month nor in burning hell notes. As I have mentioned in another post, burning paper originally was done near the corpse to prevent germs from damaging the corpse. But later in Chinese folks tradition it developed to something else. Buddhists however, do not suscribe to this belief or practise.<br><br>To find out what the 7th Month is truly about, pls read this article: <a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no1a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no1a.htm</a> or come to the thread in my forum regarding hungry ghosts, <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=139490" rel="nofollow">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=139490</a></div></blockquote>Thats not the point of this thread.<br><br></div>

Sometimes knowledge can dispell misunderstandings and  I would like to relate to everyone, Christians or not, about my Master, Venerable Shen Kai.<br><br>My master used to be a Christian Pastor in China because of a vision earlier that he has to bring bliss into the world and humanity. He was active in preaching and also wrote Christian books. He has many Pastor friends, and due to their influence, he started to insult and say bad things and putting down Buddhism (e.g It is Demonic, Evil, Superstitious, etc). He had no idea what Buddhism was, but just followed what the other pastors did.<br><br>His University lecturer seen that he has been trying to convert people in such ways, therefore he went to talk to my Master himself. He said - knowledge seekers like us from the university should not resort to such uncivilised ways of preaching. Not only is that not likeable by people, it will also bring down the name of the University. Why dont you instead research into Buddhist scriptures and teachings, and then write a book/critique on Buddhism? I will give my full support in that.<br><br>From then on, he researched into all the teachings of Buddhism and found that it is flawless and was the teaching that he wanted to bring to the people. Being repentant of his earlier action, he renounced as a monk.<br><br>So, people who want to put down other people religions must in the first place go and learn more about it - otherwise it will be hated by others.

Is he suggesting that it would be beneath you to have recourse to such 'ways of preaching'?<br><br>Does he not know that by appealing to your pride to keep your instincts in check, he is actually bringing about a situation wherein you will seem to yourself to be virtuous because of your success at keeping your instincts in check, even though you will in fact be a very proud person?<br><br>Does your master not regard pride as a sin?<br><br>2) 'From then on, he researched into all the teachings of Buddhism and found that it is flawless and was the teaching that he wanted to bring to the people. Being repentant of his earlier action, he renounced as a monk.'<br><br>Response:<br><br>If your master found Buddhist teachings flawless, then that must be because he had found the teachings of other faiths to be flawed; and if he then wanted to bring the message of Buddhism to the people, then it had to have been the case that he was fully aware of the fact that by disseminating Buddhism in this way, he would necessarily have been forced to imply to his audiences, that the messages preached by the other faiths were all flawed.<br><br>This being the case, your master too is engaged in the act of criticising (albeit not overtly and in an uncivilised fashion) the messages preached by other faiths.<br><br>Moreover, if your master felt that it was necessary for him to become a Buddhist in order to repent of his earlier action, then it is obvious that he has not fully understood Christianity; for on any sound view of Christianity, it would be simply wrong that one should communicate the message of Christianity to a Buddhist by the method of persuading him that his faith as a Buddhist is in every sense demonic.<br><br>3) 'So, people who want to put down other people religions must in the first place go and learn more about it - otherwise it will be hated by others.

            <div class='col-md body'>Too many hypocrites around siah.  People condemning someone for bashing a religion, yet, they're doing that exactly that.  From what I have read so far, a good 90% of you don't know a thing about the "other" religion.  Knowledge is a cure for ignorance.  Go learn about the one your bashing and maybe you'll know why they practice what they practice and be slightly more tolaerant  (sp?).  Do you know why we have "racial harmony day" for Primary schools?<br><br>Kids will be kids and humans are bound to err.  People say things without thinking it through.  If you have never screwed up once in your life, step right up and bash.  If not, try to remember what it felt like.</div>
