            <div class='col-md body'><br>1) know lah, but 99.99999999% of ang-mohs are Christians mah. so?<br>i'll tell you. So these bananas think it's real KEWL to be like them, so they take up that religion.<br><br>Response:<br><br>There are more Christians today in Asia and Africa combined than there are in the West (or at least, this appears to be what one census has established); moreover,  a significant proportion of those who would describe themselves as 'Christian' in the West do not accept many of the articles of the historic Christian creeds, and an even greater proportion of them would probably not be willing to live the sort of lives that would be in conformity with historic Christian teaching on morality.<br><br>What this means is that one cannot describe Christianity as being any longer the 'white man's religion'.<br><br>For your information, the ancestors of 'the white man' were themselves pagan; and they were converted to Christianity largely by the efforts of the first Christian missionaries (who were racially, of course, of Semitic descent).<br><br>Even if there are 'bananas' who think it 'kewl' to become a Christian by way of showing forth their 'white insides', this does not mean that there aren't any legitimate reasons for becoming a Christian or that Christianity isn't true.<br><br>2) 'also,.......i wanna emphasize that even if some of the other religions, like Buddhism and Toaism have missionaries that keep "harrasing" others to convert, they're very rare in numbers, compared to Christian missionaries.<br>how many? more likely 1 : 500 or worst. '<br><br>Response:<br><br>This statement of yours may unfortunately be true.<br><br>However we have to realise that, Christians, unlike Buddhists or Taoists, believe that all of mankind is in a terrible predicament because of the problem of what Christians call 'sin'; and they also believe that the only solution to this problem was provided by the Man whom they call Christ.<br><br>As a result of this belief of theirs, they believe that it would be morally obligatory for them to do whatever it is that they possibly can so as to bring it about that the aforesaid solution should come to be applied to as many persons as possible.<br><br>It follows therefore that there is a significant likelihood that some of these Christians should go overboard in their attempts at fulfilling what they would probably think of as a moral obligation that is binding on themselves; in other words, such persons may employ means that are illict or show a great disregard for the rights of the individual to privacy and respect, in their efforts at meeting this obligation.<br><br>When we add the number of such persons to the number of persons who propagate Christian for ignoble motives (realising in this connection here the ease with which Christianity in the very nature of the case should lend itself to being exploited by such persons, in view of its teaching on the universality of sin and the solution to the problem posed by it), we find, of course, that it is hardly unsurprising that Christian missionaries should far outnumber Buddhist and Taoist missionaries.<br><br>Nonetheless, if Christianity is true, then one can appreciate the rationale behind Christian missions and nothing you have said about the comparative numbers of Christian and Taoist and Buddhist missionaries, serves in the least to suggest that Christianity is untrue.<br><br>3) 'want another example of how Christians wanna control non-Christians' life? ....u know how this sex position got the name "missionary"? because in the early centuries, a long time ago, Christian missionaries travel to most parts of the world to encourage and emphasize on this kinda position. yes, exclusively this position and nothing else, because they believe it's right. can you.......BELIEVE this????? KAN ni na!!!!! '<br><br>Response:<br><br>It is still the teaching of the Catholic Church that certain sexual positions should not be adopted lest a sin should be committed by the persons adopting these positions.<br><br>Either this teaching is true or false; if it is true, then obviously the fact that some people might want to propagate it for the sake of controlling the lives of others, will not in the least serve to undermine its truth, while if it is in fact false, then once again it will still be the case that this teaching will not have been rendered false by the various ignoble uses to which it might have already been put by certain persons.<br><br>For my part, I accept its truth and that to me is the reason why this teaching ought to be heeded.<br><br>4)'what next? tell a non-Christian like me to pray for 10 mins before touching the food, cos' the food is from the Almighty, even though i didn't work, i'll get it.......cos' it's from the Almighty, right? '<br><br>Response:<br><br>If you didn't work, then you probably couldn't afford a meal and so the question would then be whether you had ever had it in your power to work so as to be in a position to afford a meal.<br><br>Granted then that your use of your power of working (so to speak) was what had enabled you to afford a meal; it would still be the case however that if there were a God (along the lines of the sort of God believed in by Christians), such a God would have had to have been the one who had given you this power and also the one who had governed and superintended every instance of its use by yourself.<br><br>This being the case (and assuming there were such a God), the food that you were about to eat (and which you had already paid for, on account of the fact that you were able to afford it) can be regarded as a gift to you from God.<br><br>To know this God (as a Christian knows Him) is therefore to be aware of one's obligation always to remain thankful to Him for all His gifts.<br><br>It is not absurd therefore to say one's grace before his meals.</div>

As far as i am concern, i am catholic and they do not practise coaxing ppl. Again, to those that my brothers and sisters in christ had offended thee, sorry.<br><br>But one thing upset me is generalization that i see here. U can CRITICIZE the ppl , but please due to respect do not criticize a religion. [b]no religion is bad</strong>, be it christian, muslim , hindu or buddist. Each teach a human moral value, but it is those individuals practising it that minority tarnish the name terriblely. So please, dont every sentence u type, u scold " stupid christians, u idiot chrisitians ," as it is greatly unmoral.<br><br><strong>To Ogbunwenzeh, Nikar, hxm and no problemo</strong>, i do not know what religion u r in, if u r in Buddism, please practice ur karma, if u r muslim there is a thing call God and u do pray 5 times a day. As i mention, every religion has a black sheep, perhaps u u guyz do have one, u r not far from it by showing this amount of respect.<br><br>EVERY religion do have some clashes, i was once approach by a palm reader, he kept following me and ask me to let him read his palm. I turned to him, said politely, sorry i dun believe in palm reading , he scolded me saying that i show no respect, scolding me that u chinese dont even believe ur own original belief, and do curse that something will befall on me. I just walked away.<br><br>SO, the point is, do i accept him as a black sheep, a minority of a belief, or do i come to SGForum and start thread " STUPID BUDDHIST/TAOIST palm reader go CURSE me" ?? Having a direct attack on a religion will spark religion war. It is they way u think and interprete things, u can say whatever u want, but i do hope that every word u say please be responsible for it for it can hurt a millions, and kill a millions too.<br><br>Thanks to all.
