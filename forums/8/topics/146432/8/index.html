No offence to those who doing this but hope can keep to one name so friends can remember you easily.<br><br>There are good and bad people including to those who do not have any beliefs.  Some christians do keep to their faith and beliefs that humbly practicing their religious life without lamenting about any other religions.

B4 u guyz asking me, i would like to tell u that yes, i am a christian, a catholic.<br><br>Do apologize for what u had heard from some of our disrespectful brothers and sisters, who do not understand the meaning of respect. But as a matter of fact, no matter what religion u are in, be it christians, buddhist , hindu or muslims, there are always black sheep, and this is always the truth. So i hope u guyz do not hurt the majority becoz of some minority by generalizing chrisitanity as a whole and attack them. I do understand ur anger, however we should give and take as i believe there are some taoist and buddhist out there also do criticize christianity.<br><br>Another reason that i would like to voice out is respect. I had never seen even a thread, from a christian ; just start a thread to criticize buddhism. ( correct me if i am wrong) but i do see alot of buddhism/taoism believers are doing this to us; thus i hope u can interprete urself.<br><br>Second, maybe you should consider other ppl believe as well when u do practice ur own belief. Would u like a person shouting infront of ur door, singing religious songs right infront of ur door step and when u question them,  why is that so, they would reply, my belief state i must do that. I bet u will find this very unacceptable right. Although i do respect ur belief, the same apply, i felt very disgusted when i open my door, and right infront of my hdb door step i see piles of ashes infront and not to mention some flew in to my unit. And being told that u shdnt sweep them,  u shdnt step on them becoz the belief says so, is indeed very frustating at times. Because it is ur belief not mine. I will sweep. So , what i am trying to raise out is, can one be more considerate, respect other ppl religions by sweeping those ashes away, instead of living them infront of ppl house and in the middle of the walk way.<br><br>Try to stand in the shoes of our other fellow believers, do u think it is nice to have this ashes flying into muslims houses, infront of indians door step. We dont voice out becoz we respect. However, pls also do your part. I am mentioning this scenario becoz, it might be one of the cause, the frustration of others due to this scenario that "criticize" this belief.<br><br>Thank you.</div></blockquote>i am a catholic it seems this is true because they even try 2 put us catholics down ... but not for all christians jus for the majority who go to a particular church c*** h****** theres a minority of nice christians i know who are great ppl too .</div>
