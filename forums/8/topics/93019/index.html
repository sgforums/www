            <div class='col-md body'>T'ai Chi Ch'Â¨Â¹an, Taijiquan, Tai Chi Chuan, or commonly Tai Chi or Taiji (ÃŒÂ«Â˜OÃˆÂ­, or simplified ÃŒÂ«Â¼Â«ÃˆÂ­; in pinyin: tÂ¨Â¤i jÂ¨Âª quÂ¨Â¢n literally supreme ultimate fist), is a Nei chia ("internal") Chinese martial art which is known for the claims of health and longevity benefits made by its practitioners and in some recent medical studies. T'ai Chi Ch'uan is also known as a "soft style" martial art.<br><br>T'ai Chi is best known as the slow motion routines groups of people practice every morning in hundreds of parks across China and, increasingly, other parts of the world. In T'ai Chi classes one is taught awareness of one's own balance and what affects it, awareness of the same in of others, and appreciation of the practical value in one's ability to moderate extremes of behavior and attitude at both mental and physical levels.<br><br>T'ai Chi Ch'Â¨Â¹an is called an art of moving meditation that is nowadays sometimes considered a form of alternative medicine by Westerners. While its practitioners have historically considered it primarily a style of martial art, T'ai Chi theory and practise is indeed largely formulated in agreement with many of the principles of traditional Chinese medicine. Besides the general health benefits attributed to beginning and intermediate level T'ai Chi training, many therapeutic interventions along the lines of TCM are taught to advanced T'ai Chi students in traditional schools. T'ai Chi Ch'Â¨Â¹an as physical training is characterized by its requirement for the use of leverage through the joints based on coordination in relaxation rather than muscular tension. This coordination is seen to improve balance, flexibility, stamina and to open the circulation.<br><br>The study of T'ai Chi Ch'Â¨Â¹an involves three primary subjects, in the following order:<br><br>Health - an unhealthy or otherwise uncomfortable person will find it difficult to meditate to a state of calmness or to use T'ai Chi as a martial art. T'ai Chi's health training therefore concentrates on relieving the physical effects of stress on the body and mind.<br>Meditation - the focus meditation and subsequent calmness cultivated by the meditative aspect of T'ai Chi is seen as necessary to maintain optimum health (in the sense of effectively maintaining stress relief or homeostasis) and in order to use it as a "soft style" martial art.<br>Martial art - the ability to competently use T'ai Chi as a martial art is said to be proof that the health and meditation aspects are working according to the dictates of the theory of T'ai Chi Ch'Â¨Â¹an.<br>The Mandarin term "T'ai Chi Ch'Â¨Â¹an" translates as "Supreme Ultimate Boxing" or "Boundless Fist". The solo training routines known as forms, pushing hands (two person training, choreographed and freestyle) and the acupressure massage and other manipulations taught by traditional schools are designed first to improve the T'ai Chi students' stability, looseness in the joints and muscles and to provide a deeper level of relaxation than previously available by repeatedly and deliberately taking them through their complete natural range of motion. The slow, repetitive work involved in that process is said to gently increase and open their internal circulation (body heat, blood, peristalsis, etc.), while the postural requirements introduced in the first classes are conducive to relaxing and deepening the students' breathing. Over time, proponents say this enhancement becomes a lasting effect, a direct reversal of the physical effects of stress on the human body. This reversal allows much more of the students' native energy to be available to them, which they may then apply more effectively to the rest of their lives; families, careers, spiritual or creative pursuits, hobbies, etc.<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>T'ai Chi Ch'Â¨Â¹an is seen by many of its schools as a variety of Taoism, and it does seemingly incorporate many Taoist principles into its practice (see below). It is an art form said to date back many centuries (although not reliably documented under that name before 1850), with precursor disciplines dating back thousands of years. The explanation given by the traditional T'ai Chi family schools for why so many of their previous generations have dedicated their lives to the study and preservation of the art is that the discipline it seems to give its students to dramatically improve the effects of stress in their lives, with a few years of hard work, should hold a useful purpose for people living in a stressful world. They say that once the T'ai Chi principles have been understood and internalized into the bodily framework the practitioner will have an immediately accessible "toolkit" thereby to improve and then maintain their health, to provide a meditative focus, and that can work as an effective and subtle martial art for self-defence.<br><br>Teachers say the study of T'ai Chi Ch'Â¨Â¹an is, more than anything else, about challenging one's ability to change oneself appropriately in response to outside forces. These principles are taught using the examples of physics as experienced by two (or more) bodies in combat. In order to be able to protect oneself using change, it is necessary to understand what the consequences are of changing appropriately, changing inappropriately and not changing at all in response to an attack. Students, by this theory, will appreciate the full benefits of the entire art in the fastest way through physical training of the martial art aspect.<br><br>In a fight, if one uses hardness to resist violent force then both sides are certain to be injured, at least to some degree. Such injury, according to T'ai Chi theory, is a natural consequence of meeting brute force with brute force. The collision of two like forces, yang with yang, is known as "double-weighted" in T'ai Chi terminology. Instead, T'ai Chi students are taught not to fight or resist an incoming force, but to meet it in softness and "stick" to it, following its motion while remaining in physical contact until the incoming force of attack exhausts itself or can be safely redirected, the result of meeting yang with yin. Done correctly, achieving this yin/yang or yang/yin balance in combat (and, by extension, other areas of one's life) is known as being "single-weighted" and is a primary goal of T'ai Chi Ch'Â¨Â¹an training. Lao-Tzu provided the archetype for this in the Tao Te Ching when he wrote, "The soft and the pliable will defeat the hard and strong." This soft "neutralization" of an attack can be accomplished very quickly in an actual fight by an adept practitioner. A T'ai Chi student has to be well conditioned by many years of disciplined training; stable, sensitive and elastic mentally and physically in order to realize this ability, however.<br><br>Wu Chien-ch'Â¨Â¹an, co-founder of the Wu family style, described the name T'ai Chi Ch'Â¨Â¹an this way at the beginning of the 20th century:<br><br>"Various people have offered different explanations for the term T'ai Chi Ch'Â¨Â¹an. Some have said: 'In terms of self-cultivation, one must train from a point of movement towards a point of quiescence. T'ai Chi comes about through the harmony of yin and yang. In terms of the art of attack and defense then, in the context of transformations of full and empty, one is constantly inwardly latent, not outwardly expressive, as if the yin and yang of T'ai Chi have not divided apart.' Others say: 'Every movement of T'ai Chi Ch'Â¨Â¹an is based on circles, just like the shape of a T'ai Chi symbol. Therefore, it is called T'ai Chi Ch'Â¨Â¹an.' Both explanations are quite reasonable, especially the second, which is fuller."<br><br>[edit]<br>T'ai Chi training and techniques<br>As the name T'ai Chi Ch'Â¨Â¹an is held to be derived from the T'ai Chi symbol, the t'ai chi t'u (ÃŒÂ«Â˜OÂˆD, pinyin tÂ¨Â¤ijÂ¨ÂªtÂ¨Â²), commonly known in the West as the "yin-yang" diagram, T'ai Chi Ch'Â¨Â¹an techniques are said therefore to physically and energetically balance yin (receptive) and yang (active) principles.<br><br>"From ultimate softness comes ultimate hardness." The core training involves two primary features, the first being the solo form or ch'Â¨Â¹an - a slow sequence of movements which emphasise natural movement and relaxation. The second being different styles of pushing hands or t'ui shou (Ã�Ã†ÃŠÃ–) for training "stickiness" and sensitivity in the reflexes through various motions in concert with a training partner in order to learn timing, coordination and positioning when interacting with a training partner or opponent. Pushing hands is seen as necessary not only for training the self-defense skills of a soft style such as T'ai Chi by demonstrating the forms' movement principles experientially, but also it is said to improve upon the level of conditioning provided by practice of the solo forms by increasing the work load on students while they practise those movement principles.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The solo form should take the students through a complete, natural, range of motion over their centre of gravity. Accurate, repeated practise of the solo routine is said to encourage circulation throughout the students' bodies, maintain flexibility through their joints and familiarize students with the leverage associated with the martial applications implied in the forms. The major styles of T'ai Chi have forms which differ somewhat cosmetically, but there are also many obvious similarities which point to their common origin. The solo forms, empty-hand and weapon, are catalogues of movements that are practised individually in pushing hands and application scenarios to prepare students for self-defence training. In most traditional schools (the modern Yang style being a conspicuous exception) different variations of the solo forms are practiced; fast/slow, small circle/large circle, square/round (different expressions of leverage through the joints), low sitting/high sitting (the degree to which weight-bearing knees are kept bent throughout the form), for example.<br><br>Other training exercises include:<br><br>Weapons training and fencing applications employing the straight sword (jiÂ¨Â¤n Â„Â¦), a heavier curved sabre, sometimes called a broadsword (dÂ¨Â¡o ÂµÂ¶, which is actually considered a big knife), fan, staff, 7 foot spear and 13 foot lance (both called qiÂ¨Â¡ng Â˜ÂŒ). Less commonly known weapons still in use are the large Bagua sabre, halberd (jÂ¨Â« ÃªÂª), cane, rope-dart, Three sectional staff and steel whip.<br>Two-person tournament fighting (san shou Ã‰Â¢ÃŠÃ–);<br>Breathing exercises; nei kung (ÂƒÃˆÂ¹Â¦ nÂ¨Â¨igÂ¨Â­ng) or, more commonly, ch'i kung (ÂšÃ¢Â¹Â¦ qÂ¨Â¬gÂ¨Â­ng) to develop ch'i (ÂšÃ¢ qÂ¨Â¬) or "breath energy" in coordination with physical movement. These were formerly taught only to disciples as a separate, complementary training system. In the last 50 years they have become more well known to the general public.<br>T'ai Chi's martial aspect relies on sensitivity to the opponent's movements and centre of gravity dictating appropriate responses. Effectively affecting or "capturing" the opponent's centre of gravity immediately upon contact is trained as the primary goal of the martial T'ai Chi student, and from there all other technique can follow with seeming effortlessness. The alert calmness required to achieve the necessary sensitivity is acquired over thousands of hours of first yin (slow, repetitive, meditative, low impact) and then later adding yang ("realistic," active, fast, high impact) martial training; forms, pushing hands and sparring. T'ai Chi Ch'Â¨Â¹an trains in three basic ranges, close, medium and long, and then everything in between. Pushes and open hand strikes are more common than punches, and kicks are usually to the legs and lower torso, never higher than the hip in most styles. The fingers, fists, palms, sides of the hands, wrists, elbows, shoulders, back, hips, knees and feet are commonly used to strike, with strikes to the eyes, throat, heart, groin and other acupressure points trained by advanced students. There is an extensive repertoire of joint traps, locks and breaks (chin na), particularly applied to lock up or break an opponent's elbows, wrists, fingers, ankles, back or neck. Most T'ai Chi teachers expect their students to thoroughly learn defensive or neutralizing skills first, and a student will have to demonstrate proficiency with them before offensive skills will be extensively trained. There is also an emphasis in the traditional schools on kind-heartedness. One is expected to show mercy to one's opponents, as instanced by a poem preserved in some of the T'ai Chi families said to be derived from the Shaolin temple:<br><br>"I would rather maim than kill<br>Hurt than maim<br>Intimidate than hurt<br>Avoid than intimidate."<br><br>all quoted from en.wikipedia.com<br>still more from tat side and aso from tat webby zhang sanfeng exists...<br></div>
