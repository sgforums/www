            <div class='col-md body'>Never had this problem before, but maybe because I'm male.<br><br>I think its their culture to kiss you on the cheeks. Its their way of greeting everyone, so there should be nothing to worry about.<br><br>What I noticed( but not confirmed) was that the two people would actually lean a bit forward and if the other person's body language is not appreciative, then no kissing happens. Hugging is less of a problem I think, because its more superficial than kissing. But thats my view.<br><br>As for being kissed on the lips without permission, to me thats a bit overdoing it. Maybe if its a peck then forget it, but if its more sleazy than that let it be known if you are uncomfortable. I'm sure there are better suggestions though.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa: If its not normal for you than let them know, even if its normal for them. You can't be forced to do anything you are not comfortable with. If they did it innocently then they will know you are not comfortable with it, and there would be no harm done. If they did it intentionally then they will know that they can't get up to any hanky panky without your permission.<br><br>No sound advice, but just want to add that you have no obligation to go out with them or anything, so I'm not sure why you sound concerned with being "dao". I don't even know what that means.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 03-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well Rinoa, kissing and hugging may just the 'ang moh' culture, they don't really kiss on your lips (kissing on lips is not usual, I stay in Australia for quite sometime). If they want to kiss you on the lips, I think you must be quite pretty and they probably have been eyeing you quite sometime.<br><br></div>

Yesh, I mean really shove. Do it to the sternum because it takes the wind out of them. And bouncers (here anyway) would support you instead of him.

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess it's their custom and perhaps at times they do abuse the liberty of their custom. It all depends on how you take the incident, if you just take it as a friendly gesture, it's alright I suppose.<br><br>I had been guilty of asking to kiss a gal during a Christmas party in UK, everyone was in a jolly good mood and I was told it's alright to steal a kiss.. and I just did it. It was a friendly gesture.. but kinda funny, coz I dun even know the gal name.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>goodness girl....i thot u were talking abt ppl on the streets or something. maybe i am conventional, but i think if it happens in a pub or disco, it's never really an innocent thingey. perhaps it's a little better if it's at a party or an outing with frens and you actually know the ppl or they were introduced to you. the thing tho is this. if i were a foreigner and i came to another country, i would be wary of my gestures whether or not it comes naturally to me to grab, kiss and hug in my own country.<br><br>i guess if the guy or gal does that to everyone upon meeting or departing then i think it's okay. but if you're singled out for special attention, then maybe that's something else. same goes when ur overseas. some cultures do dat more than others, but kissing is usu restricted to the cheeks or one of those kisses-in-the-air types with ur cheek next to theirs. i usu only see pecks on the lips from older folk. but maybe i'm sua-ku.<br><br>in reply to ur first qn, well i guess i would respond with a quick hug, with the body not too close to them (does it happen to guys as well???). actually if i didn't know them and they opened their arms to hug me, i'd prob just blink at them. personally to me, any contact kissing with a stranger is a no-no....but that's just me.<br><br>to ur second qn, if they wanna kiss u on the lips for the first time and u dun noe them, esp if it's in a bar, u can either offer them your hand or turn down the offer saying the things u girls are always so good at saying. you are very chio issit? get all this attention from ppl? maybe that's why.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa,<br>you have to look at the situation and the condition.  if it's a gathering between friends that you haven't sen for a while, then a hug or a peck on the cheek is permissible, otherwise, it's bordering on taking advantage of a girl.<br><br>if you are not comfortable with the kissing bit, before they make their move, just give them a handshake and a stern look that you don't want anything more than a handshake.  i can't describe it, but it's a body language that u must exert.  it's not an air of unfriendliness, rather a cautious one.  so there's no reason why you should be branded a snob just by doing it.<br><br>i know that there's a saying that goes when in Rome, do what the Romans do, but i don't think you have to live by that, after all, you're not Roman, so why act like one?  besides, people from France and Italy and the likes, they tend to take advantage of Asian girls, so don't be fooled.<br><br>being aloof is not a bad thing, just don't be a goof...hehehe... =)<br><br>------------------<br>Underneath the Southern Cross I stand...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa: If u see a kiss coming your way, and if it's aiming for your lips, do what Princess Diana did to Charles. Turn slightly so that the kiss falls on your cheek. The guy will be slightly embarassed by the little twist and maybe you will get across the message that you're not their kind of girls.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>haha! i think i can see the problem but it's a little hard to resolve....and yes it would be a little tiring to be on your guard all the time. but if it really bothers you then i guess u do have to be a little more alert when ur abt to be introduced or abt to say hi (or bye)....<br><br>it's hard to be natural abt these things i guess but practise helps. if it was me, i'd prob stick my hand out first for a handshake. and try not to get pulled in for the hug while you're at it. again, it's how you do it, like a body-language kinda thing (in fact i think there are some books on body language that tell you how to avoid a hug!). usu if the first person gets the handshake it's a little strange if the other ppl behind hug you (tho some ppl are very thick-skinned). so get the first one right. and if you have to hug then make it a quick one and pull back just as quickly as you went forward....acutally i don't know nuts abt this stuff....but it seems common-sensical enuf i think (i hope)....as for the kissing part if it's a quick hug chances for a kiss are reduced and in any case it'll be on the cheek and prob only be a peck. dunno if this helps....<br><br>don't think the look matters too much, tho if a guy is just hugging u cos u look good, then it's prob not a culture thing! looking dao may deter some guys here but maybe not over there....maybe since u look very much like the party-animal kind, ppl may think ur more open to it. but just be firm and friendly if u dun like it. you don't have to throw both arms around the fella. maybe just one arm round and with the other u can place your hand on his arm or shoulder or something (that's to push him away)....dunno if any of this makes any sense....i'm still waiting for someone to hug me in the streets.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> so i don't have any first-hand experience!<br><br>but don't be afraid to offend if you really don't like it. but do it tactfully. the guy will prob think it was his fault cos he was being too friendly. (that's prob the secret behind it: make it seem like it was his fault, not yours.)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Worm...<br>well...in my case its different of cos if some parents of my friends were to do a bear hug and a kiss on the cheek it is fine...but with all the above scenerios...I got hugged two times by the same guy with 5 mins cos he was so happy to see me as I was "his favourite lady"..just becos I helped him to wash the dishes after Thanksgiving dinner. And he hugged me when he saw me and hugged me again when I said if he needed any help to wash dishes, he can call me anytime, and he hugged me again. Maybe I should not be so helpful afterall..oh..and he say I love u after that..Weird ...still feels weird...<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>aiyoh....i think that's a bit too obvious right or not? is that fella attached or not? my sis met some weirdos in canada before too, so i don't think it's a matter of being more open all the time. sounds like he's trying to be funny. either that or he's highly expressive and easily grateful....next you're gonna tell me he cries whenever he reads abt the violence in the world? haha!<br></div>
