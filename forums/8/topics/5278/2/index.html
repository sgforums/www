            <div class='col-md body'>I guess if you are caught in a compromising position unprepared, e.g. in a bear hug, you might want to show body language which says "I don't like this". You can try to lean away from the guy, or turn your head, or tense up a bit. If somebody is doing it not out of other intentions i.e. not eating beancurd, then he should sense that and let go or back off. If not, then I honestly think the only thing you can do, if you don't want to create a stir, is to stay away from him.<br><br>I thought girls seem to be able to tell if someone's intentions are honourable, because of your female instincts. I suppose this is the time to use it to assess the situation then act accordingly.<br><br>Still, its difficult lah. Bottom line is, if you feel uncomfortable, its inappropriate. I also agree that having people you know around does help.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa, seems to me like there is a double standard here. You don't know how to react if the guy is a foreigner but you sure know how to give a shove or a tight slap if the guy is local. Am I right to say this? Can't a local be equally friendly when giving you a hug or a kiss?<br><br>So what if the guy is from a different culture? It is your own principle that matters.
