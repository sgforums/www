              <p>Ok. This is the situation.</p>
              <p>I am the only child.</p>
              <p>Parents divorced in 1996. The house use to belong to my father and mother. When they divorced in 1996, father sell the house to my mother so the name of the house is now under my mother.</p>
              <p>Mother never get marry. I, mother and grandmother stay together in the same house. Mother got some siblings but not close and don't stay together</p>
              <p>I got a few questions to ask:</p>
              <p>1. Say my mother never make a will and she die. Will I automatically get the house?</p>
              <p>2. Say my mother die and never make a will and my grandmother is still alive. Will the house go to my grandmother and me together or how?</p>
              <p>3. Say my mother die and never make a will. Can my grandmother and her siblings employ a lawyer to fight to get the house?</p>
              <p>4. Say my mother die and she got make a will. The lawyer doesn't know that she has died or the law firm has already closed down. So the will become invalid lor since the lawyer did not come forward to present it?</p>
              <p>5. My motherr made a cpf nomination, give 50% of her cpf to me and another 50% to my grandmother. Say my grandmother died and my mother never change the nomination. When my mother die, will the remaining 50% cpf also got to me or how?</p>

              <p>Ok. This is the situation.</p>
              <p>I am the only child.</p>
              <p>Parents divorced in 1996. The house use to belong to my father
              and mother. When they divorced in 1996, father sell the house to my
              mother so the name of the house is now under my mother.</p>
              <p>Mother never get marry. I, mother and grandmother stay together
              in the same house. Mother got some siblings but not close and don't
              stay together</p>
              <p>I got a few questions to ask:</p>
              <p>1. Say my mother never make a will and she die. Will I
              automatically get the house?</p>
              <p>2. Say my mother die and never make a will and my grandmother is
              still alive. Will the house go to my grandmother and me together or
              how?</p>
              <p>3. Say my mother die and never make a will. Can my grandmother
              and her siblings employ a lawyer to fight to get the house?</p>
              <p>4. Say my mother die and she got make a will. The lawyer doesn't
              know that she has died or the law firm has already closed down. So
              the will become invalid lor since the lawyer did not come forward
              to present it?</p>
              <p>5. My motherr made a cpf nomination, give 50% of her cpf to me
              and another 50% to my grandmother. Say my grandmother died and my
              mother never change the nomination. When my mother die, will the
              remaining 50% cpf also got to me or how?</p>
