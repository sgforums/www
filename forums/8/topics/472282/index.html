              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p>Due to my body shape, I would like to wear low-rise jeans (for men).</p>
              <p>However, the shops I've checked so far do not have low-rise jeans for men.</p>
              <p>They either do not have low-rise jeans (Denizen), or they claim they do, but it's not really low-rise (Levis; Giordano). For low-rise jeans, the distance between the crotch and the edge should be around 20 cm or less. Such jeans can then be worn relatively low, on the hips.</p>
              <p>So, I would really appreciate it if someone here can tell me  where I can get low-rise jeans for men. Maybe you don't know which specific shops sell them, but if you know where (which shopping mall, for example) I may be able to find them, please also do let me know. </p>
              <p>(Now, I do realize that women's jeans are generally low-rise. So this would be the last resort for me. But I am hoping to get men's jeans).</p>
              <p>Also, I was wondering if people can recommend a good place where I can get custom-made pants (not too cheap, but not too expensive either). Again, my slightly unusual body shape means that off-the-rack pants do not fit me very well.</p>
              <p>Thanks everyone!</p>

              <p>(1) If you are not too oversized, like still have bigger size pants over and about your nominal waistline, buy 1 or 2 inches bigger than your build. there you have it, all any brand also can be low rise. make sure buy branded or kinky underwear, like that low rise can see panty band and a little butt crack is the in-thing!</p>
              <p>(2) The solution is money. got money just walk into any tailor shop throw the money and tell them do for you on the spot. what size what color shape also can. that's how cosplayers cum up with their costumes.</p>

              <p>Thanks for taking the time to reply to my post. I am not overweight at all – quite the opposite. And I'm not interested in showing any underwear or flesh – that's not the purpose of me wanting to buy low-rise jeans. I am actually male. </p>
              <p>I already tried the method you suggested. It roughly gave me the look I was looking for. However, the crotch area was quite saggy and that looks aweful. Plus, the back pockets are not in the right place when worn low. The reason obviously is that those normal jeans are meant to be worn mid or high on the waist rather than on the hips. So I really can't wear these jeans low.</p>
