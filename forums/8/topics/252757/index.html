            <div class='col-md body'>source base can have 3 sources. 1: picture, textual and statistics ( this has never come out for olevels before ).<br><br>It seems difficult.. but actually the scope of questions asked is quite limited.<br>they'll definitely ask you the MESSAGE of the source. This message that u write on the answer sheet must not lift any word from source itself.<br><br>for example: You see picture of this smiling person taking a baseball bat and whacked himself on his head.<br>The message is he is an idiot. I can infer this from the way he continues to smile even after being hurt, and the fact that he hit himself on his head, which is a stupid thing to do.<br><br>Basically theres these things u have to answer.<br>1: provenance of the source ( who wrote it, where is it published, when is it published)<br>2: Message of the source + inference ( how u drew this conclusion )<br>( inference must have 2 at least. You can use factual, tone bla bla. Dont use tone if ur not good at it, because very easy to get kosong if u infer wrongly. )<br>3: Intended audience ( can be the local people / international audience, depends)<br>4: Intended response ( from the audience ). aka purpose of this source la.<br><br>then there'll be this usefulness of this source. ( is source E useful in determining that he is an idiot? )<br><br>: source E. (idiot's mother) Oh yes, he's been like this since young. I wouldnt go so far as to call him an idiot, but he's definitely what you term as intellectually challenged. he often indulge in self-multilation acts too, but doesnt seem to feel pain at all.<br><br>So you cross reference with the earlier picture.. picture confirms that he practices self-multilation and that he doesnt feel pain. You can also infer that he is an idiot from picture too. So is source E useful?<br><br>YES.. because picture confirms what source E is saying ( proceed on to list similarities ). therefore, source E is useful<br><br>Then is reliability questions.<br>Is source B reliable?<br><br>In such cases you have to look at the provenance. Lets say the topic is on the japanese government, and the source is a japanese citizen but the topic puts japanese government in a negative light. In such cases, the source gets enhanced reliability because as a citizen, he is expected to support his own government ( however u must be certain that he isnt sprouting rubbish la. have to make ur own judgement ). or u could always prove that its not reliable but i find it alot more easy to lose marks in. You also have to look at the tone of the source. Is the source being very biased ( employing alot of strong words)<br><br>To look for tone u have to have a good command in english.<br>boss says: i am very angry.<br>boss says: i am very upset<br><br>which one sounds more neutral? The later sentence is the neutral one. So you have to pick up nuances such as this when u read the source.</div>

This message that u write on the answer sheet must not lift any word from source itself.<br><br>for example: You see picture of this smiling person taking a baseball bat and whacked himself on his head.<br>The message is he is an idiot. I can infer this from the way he continues to smile even after being hurt, and the fact that he hit himself on his head, which is a stupid thing to do.<br><br>Basically theres these things u have to answer.<br>1: provenance of the source ( who wrote it, where is it published, when is it published)<br>2: Message of the source + inference ( how u drew this conclusion )<br>( inference must have 2 at least. You can use factual, tone bla bla. Dont use tone if ur not good at it, because very easy to get kosong if u infer wrongly. )<br>3: Intended audience ( can be the local people / international audience, depends)<br>4: Intended response ( from the audience ). aka purpose of this source la.<br><br>then there'll be this usefulness of this source. ( is source E useful in determining that he is an idiot? )<br><br>: source E. (idiot's mother) Oh yes, he's been like this since young. I wouldnt go so far as to call him an idiot, but he's definitely what you term as intellectually challenged. he often indulge in self-multilation acts too, but doesnt seem to feel pain at all.<br><br>So you cross reference with the earlier picture.. picture confirms that he practices self-multilation and that he doesnt feel pain. You can also infer that he is an idiot from picture too. So is source E useful?<br><br>YES.. because picture confirms what source E is saying ( proceed on to list similarities ). therefore, source E is useful<br><br>Then is reliability questions.<br>Is source B reliable?<br><br>In such cases you have to look at the provenance. Lets say the topic is on the japanese government, and the source is a japanese citizen but the topic puts japanese government in a negative light. In such cases, the source gets enhanced reliability because as a citizen, he is expected to support his own government ( however u must be certain that he isnt sprouting rubbish la. have to make ur own judgement ). or u could always prove that its not reliable but i find it alot more easy to lose marks in. You also have to look at the tone of the source. Is the source being very biased ( employing alot of strong words)<br><br>To look for tone u have to have a good command in english.<br>boss says: i am very angry.<br>boss says: i am very upset<br><br>which one sounds more neutral? The later sentence is the neutral one. So you have to pick up nuances such as this when u read the source. </div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
