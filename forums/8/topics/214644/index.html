            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>Taken from today's business times</strong></span><br><br>Sentosa IR: The best bet<br>What would you like to see in the Sentosa integrated resort? Of the three bidders, who would you be putting your money on, and why?<br><br>THE Sentosa IR is a family-oriented resort compared to the Marina IR which is geared towards MICE. As such, there should be plenty of entertainment and activities geared for the families. Waterparks are great since Sentosa is a resort island. However, the waterparks should be very different and innovative compared to the run-of-the-mill wave pools and water slides which you can already get in Singapore. In addition to the waterparks, there could be a theme park with an established brand name like Universal Studios or Disneyland. The theme park should have a substantial part which is air-conditioned given our hot tropical climate. Together, these parks must be able to keep a family entertained for a stretch of three to four days to make it a worthwhile experience.<br><br>While everyone's favourite appears to be Genting due to its tie-up with Universal Studios, I am putting my money on CapitaLand-Kerzner to win the bid. I feel that CapitaLand, after losing the Marina bid, will have learnt from its experience in the previous bid and make a bid which is more palatable to the awarding committee. Further, as one of the leading property companies in Singapore and South-east Asia, it must feel that it should have a presence in at least one of the two IR projects in Singapore. Its partner Kerzner also has great success in its Atlantis resort, which is the closest any of the bidders has come to transforming an island into an IR.<br><br>- Wee Piew<br>CEO,<br>HG Metal Manufacturing Ltd<br><br>I WOULD like to see Genting get the deal. They were reported to want to invest the biggest amount, which means in theory they have more money to do things.<br><br>From a business angle, I feel they are 'local' enough to understand the region and its people. I strongly believe a key success factor to any tourism business is for it to be attractive and successful with the local audience. Examples would be Crazy Horse (not too successful) and the Zoo (very successful with the locals). With their years of experience handling Singaporeans at Genting Highlands, they should be able to work well in attracting the local market.<br><br>I like the potential that Genting can cross-sell various gaming destinations, with its Highlands, its UK unit of Stanley Leisure, and even its Star Cruises ships. The unique experiences it can create by rotating its operational staff, for example, would add a different dimension at the tables. Like the very posh tuxedo approach of gaming at London's Clubs that only an Englishman can project, a la James Bond Casino Royale.<br><br>The development of a new Universal Studios attraction would be great. Instead of a traditional theme park, where many rides and attractions are outdoor-oriented, I think the Universal concept can be well served in an indoor-centric design, which would be better-suited to our hot climate. It would be interesting to see how the whole resort will be designed. With the large amount to be committed, there is a very good chance of it being a truly Uniquely Singapore attraction.<br><br>- Joey Chang<br>CEO,<br>AXS Infocomm<br><br>THE Sentosa IR will be different in concept and infrastructure from the Marina Bay IR as it will appeal to a more Asian clientele. As an island resort, the Sentosa IR must complement and blend with the existing Sentosa attractions and hospitality amenities. Thus, it will be more family-theme type of attractions and special events that will attract and retain visitors.<br><br>Sentosa IR should position itself as a Singapore icon for events venue. Thus, it has to work closely with all key government agencies to promote the national calendar of events/campaigns for both Singaporeans and foreigners. My preference is for the Genting-Star Cruises bid as it has the Asian cultural flavour and clientele to match its Sentosa IR project.<br><br>May the best player take the trophy.<br><br>- Derek Goh<br>Executive Chairman / Group CEO,<br>Serial System Ltd<br><br>THE planned Sentosa integrated resort presents a very exciting opportunity for Singapore as it will help our country to jump ahead in the increasingly competitive regional tourism industry. The Sentosa integrated resort should capture the essence of a top family entertainment destination, as well as a leading business convention destination, for a wide appeal to tourists in the region and worldwide.<br><br>It is difficult to say who will emerge the choice operator for the Sentosa integrated resort, but I would think that Kerzner International/CapitaLand would be a strong contender. With its renowned branding and experience as a world-class operator, they also have a strong partner in CapitaLand and also possibly an award-winning design by prize-winning architect Frank Gehry. I believe Kerzner International/CapitaLand has what it takes to build a world-class entertainment and business destination appealing to all classes of tourists from around the globe.<br><br>- Michael Lam<br>Managing Director, Asia South,<br>Compuware Corporation<br><br>A FABULOUS skyline with bright lights into the night. Lots of activities throughout the day, with a 'city which never sleeps' thematic experience at each quarter perhaps. That's what I would like to see at Sentosa. It should attract MICE businesses from all over the world and also appeal to locals as a good 'leisure getaway' for families.<br><br>All the three bidders are preparing to 'out-innovate' and 'out-create' each other. All the bidders are good contenders and they have a good chance to outbid one another. However, I think the Genting International consortium has a better mix of 'East meets West' combination with experiences and capabilities in casino-cum-theme park management, Star Cruises and resorts management, giving them the edge over the other bidders. The Genting International consortium will leverage on each other's strengths to build a truly integrated resort in Singapore to offer premier entertainment and exciting theme parks. I believe Genting already has a very broad customer base in Asia, with a proven track record in their development of new and existing markets. With these, plus promising a strong financial commitment, they might just win the bid.<br><br>- Angeline V Teo<br>Principal Consultant,<br>d'Oz International Pte Ltd<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SENTOSA is very much a family location - with the other attractions already on the island being a mix of history, leisure and entertainment. The integrated resort should maintain this flavour - a mix of activities that can be enjoyed as a family, and the emphasis on 'active' rather than 'passive' pursuits would be ideal. In addition, attractions and facilities that are youth-friendly so that groups of teenagers can go there alone - for leisure activities that extend beyond hanging around a mall. Further, I do very much believe that there needs to be a decent grouping of free activities that can simply be enjoyed.<br><br>For long-term tourism and differentiation, a uniquely Singapore attraction should form a part of the proposal. Finally, it would be great to further develop Singapore's event potential with an exhibition/concert hall that can host shows such as Cirque De Soleil on an ongoing basis.<br><br>- Stephen Wong<br>Country Manager Singapore,<br>Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd<br><br>THE Sentosa integrated resort is an excellent opportunity for Singapore to not only embark on establishing a casino on the island-state for the first time - and in turn attracting greater tourist revenues - but also to provide a diverse array of activities that are family-oriented. Many of us would probably like to see a good mix of entertainment options, including a casino, a theme park, and restaurants, that cater to a wide array of visitors - whether they are the rich and famous, business travellers, or families with children. Whilst attracting foreign visitors will bring in substantial amounts of tourist revenue for the Republic, the integrated resort will also serve the local community well by offering more fun-filled choices for leisure.<br><br>If I may place a bet, I would like to put my money on Genting International, which has Universal Studios as its partner. Universal Studios, which has its expertise in theme parks, would be able to draw large crowds, in addition to attracting the ones who are keen on exploring the casino-related activities offered by the integrated resort.<br><br>- Pramod Ratwani<br>Vice-President - Asia Pacific and Middle East,<br>Aspect Software<br><br>I WOULDN'T put my money on any of the three bidders ... because I am not thebetting kind. The three contenders are experienced and world-class players in their own right. The differentiator will be how well each contender understands the Asian market and the vision of the Singapore government.<br><br>The Sentosa IR is to be a family-oriented resort. I look forward to attractions that will appeal to the entire family, from the young to the elderly. Even those who are less mobile or disabled should be able to find things that will appeal and cater to them. Wholesome activities or events where the entire family can participate together will be ideal. Indeed I hope that the Sentosa IR will be better known for its wholesome family attractions than for its gaming halls, an IR Singapore and Singaporeans can be truly proud of and can market as a wholesome tourist attraction for families.<br><br>- Tan Sek Wah<br>General Manager,<br>Green Dot Internet Services<br><br>THE Sentosa IR presents a unique opportunity for Singapore on several fronts. With the right bidder the resort will increase the time and money visitors spend in Singapore, making it less of a 'stop-over' destination and more of a target holiday destination in itself. This will create value and add another facet to the current tourism spectrum. The IR will also contribute to the MICE segment, attracting major international meetings and conventions and increasing the number of business travellers.<br><br>The challenge for the three bidders will be to strike the right balance between their target audiences: family, adult and business. This means ensuring a balanced mix of hotel and convention facilities, retail and tourism attractions. Above all, this is an opportunity for Singapore to differentiate itself from the regional gaming options, staking out its position with a world-class facility attracting top-drawer tourists and conventioneers.<br><br>And in this era of high technology, the needs of the resort go far beyond the built environment. The successful bidder will have to give full consideration to creating a world-class communications infrastructure to support the modern-day business and leisure traveller, allowing visitors to stay connected with their world while away from home or office.<br><br>- Charles Reed<br>CEO,<br>InterTouch Pte<br><br>AMONG the three bidders, I personally feel that Genting should be selected. I would also invest in Genting and Star Cruises. I have been a Gold Card Player in Star Cruises from the day they started in Singapore. Genting, as a casino and a theme park in Malaysia has been very successful. Without fail, every Chinese tourist coming to Malaysia would visit Genting. Star Cruises' Virgo is a very successful cruise for tourists and gamblers. Having run Genting and Star Cruises for years, they understand the needs and wants of Asians, and the database they have is phenomenal.<br><br>Working with Universal Studios, a very startling theme park, Genting and Star Cruises will make Sentosa very attractive and exciting. They have also invested in the UK. Many members of the UK casinos will also come to Sentosa. Star Cruises and Genting also own Norwegian Cruise Line, from which they will also attract many customers. Currently, they have marketing offices in India and China and many other Asian countries. Thus, they are way ahead of the other two bidders. Genting and Star Cruises are an obvious choice.<br><br>- Ng Kong Yeam<br>Group Executive Chairman,<br>Sino-America Tours Corporation Pte Ltd<br><br>GIVEN that Marina Sands seems more focused on the convention business, it makes sense for Sentosa's IR to lean towards leisure and entertainment. I think the bidder that can provide the most complete and unique 'family entertainment' destination should come out tops. Genting International/Star Cruises appear to have an interesting proposal with a US$1 billion-plus Universal Studios theme park as an offering. Although Kerzner/CapitaLand may possibly tie-up with Disney, a fourth Disneyland in Asia does not feel like an exciting concept.<br><br>Despite being an unaccomplished betting man, I would put my money on Genting/Star Cruises. In addition to the Universal Studios component, they are well teed-up to deliver a cruise-cum-resort offering, using Singapore as a cruise base for SEA. We've already seen a dark horse win the Marina bid, so anything could possibly happen.<br><br>- Deb Dutta<br>Vice-President of Asia Pacific/Japan,<br>Brocade<br><br>ONE of the best things about being in Singapore is undoubtedly the food. It is no secret that Singaporeans eat and drink with passion. Many visitors are drawn to Singapore by the quality and variety of food available here. It would be promising for Singapore to boost its reputation as a food lover's paradise. Just like our tourists' favourites Newton Hawker Centre and Lau Par Sat. The idea is to house all the hawker-centre variety of food and drinks under one roof in the integrated resort.<br><br>Going on holiday is usually a family affair. And our integrated resort should be the perfect holiday destination where kids and their parents can spend a fun-filled day. It should be an enjoyable trip where kids and parents would always remember.<br><br>We want it to be family-oriented and this is good news for Genting, which is a mass market player with 40 years in Asia. We want a holiday concept that allows the visitor to enjoy world-class cruising to Singapore. And onshore at Sentosa, visitors will have the opportunity to take in the sights and sounds of the local culture, cuisine and shopping. All these can be mixed and be very interesting. The experience will differ from that elsewhere, further enhancing our position of being Uniquely Singapore.<br><br>- Dora Hoan<br>Group CEO,<br>Best World International Ltd<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>WITH its proven track record in hospitality and gaming, I believe Genting will be able to leverage on Universal's popularity, excellent knowledge and experience in the leisure and theme park sector. Everyone loves Hollywood blockbusters. As there is no other Universal Studios theme park outside of the US and Japan, Singapore will be the best gateway for Universal Studios in the Asia Pacific.<br><br>Apart from being centrally located in the whole of Asia Pacific, no country can match its holistic offer in terms of air, rail, road and sea connectivity, political and social stability, security, speed in execution, transparency, telecommunications, cleanliness and tourist friendliness, as well as the universal languages spoken by the multi-racial community.<br><br>The challenge for Genting is the balancing of peacefulness associated with the name of Sentosa and the excitement that will be generated by Universal Studios. If selected, in order not to be just another tourist attraction hype, apart from the expected massive marketing campaigns, the new resort has to work towards generating positive word of mouth through the new visitors, past visitors of other Universal Studios theme parks, as well as visitors to other theme parks such as the Disneyland in Hong Kong.<br><br>No matter who wins, I am looking forward to the new Sentosa, which has evolved from a Malay fishing village in the 19th century into a multi-billion-dollar mega tourist and local enjoyment hub.<br><br>- Kelvin Ang<br>CEO,<br>ECI<br><br>BOTH IRs will sit on very different sites and the locations will play a big part in their design, facilities and the sorts of clientele they try and attract. The Sentosa IR will need to be more family-oriented than the Sands at Marina Bay, which is focused on the MICE market. The lush, tropical surroundings of Sentosa are better suited to more themed resort incorporating family attractions. The winning bid will need to fit into Sentosa's fun, family lifestyle and of course provide the tourism appeal, design, investment and partnerships that the government seeks.<br><br>If I were a betting man, I'd have my money on Kerzner International and CapitaLand, but it is of course a very hard race to call, especially if the investment amount becomes the clincher. But Kerzner has a proven track record of establishing and managing world-class destination resorts such as Atlantis in the Bahamas; and backed by CapitaLand's property management experience in Asia, you have a powerful consortium.<br><br>- Steve Russell<br>President and CEO, Asia-Pacific,<br>Salesforce.com<br><br>AS SINGAPORE strives to cope with a decline in birth rates and foster a more conducive family environment, I would love to see the integration of a family-themed concept within the island. Having said that, I also believe that there needs to be a balanced offering for the different target audiences that will catalyse new tourism investments.<br><br>Sentosa has always been a little 'out of the way' for most Singaporeans. But it is my hope and belief that in seven years' time, it will be as Mr Advent of Eighth Wonder says: 'The most talked about resort destination in the history of the world.'<br><br>Singapore's experience in city planning and in the management of the environment is exemplary and world-class. The development at Sentosa needs to be an experience that will engage all the senses and explore unexpected definitions of architectural use and style.<br><br>We need to create a brand that is seen as the warm-weather destination of choice for travellers to this region. The resort also has to be aligned with the government's tourism objectives, with strong appeal to international visitors and Singaporeans alike.<br><br>A secondary area of concern would be to find new ways to add value for family-based customers and to keep the resort constantly renewed and refreshed as well as at the highest end of the market.<br><br>Regardless of who wins, I envisage the integrated resort in Sentosa to be an iconic development that would further propel Singapore as a top tourist destination in Asia.<br><br>- J Anton Ravindran<br>Group CEO &amp; Co-Founder,<br>Genovate Pte Ltd<br><br>THE integrated resorts aim at developing Singapore into a world-leading visitor destination. The enthusiastic response by the three bidders and their respectable concepts and ideas to build the Sentosa integrated resort is a vote of confidence for Singapore tourism and leisure facilities. Problems of IR projects belong not just to the people who live nearby but to the nation as a whole. They are not problems of technology and finance, but of organisation, maintenance and management. Proper management of the flow of tourists, and good maintenance are therefore important.<br><br>The integrated resort of my choice is the one with capability to bring in visitors because of its operational know-how and international network and experience, ability to run the resort as a viable and lively business concern, and with ideas and concepts that are stimulating, with some innovations.<br><br>- Tan Kok Leong<br>Principal,<br>TKL Consulting<br><br>I AM sitting on the board of advisers for the Asia Spa Institute which recently concluded a two-day executive programme course in Singapore on 'Integrated Tourism'. The course was thought-provoking and presented us with exciting ideas on how the spa, wellness, health, medical, tourism and hospitality sectors could work together hand-in-hand. For the Sentosa IR I would like to see this integration. Singapore, by virtue of our infrastructure, great medical facilities and expertise, and warm hospitality, has great potential in the medi-spa and medi-tourism market.<br><br>Each of the three contenders has its strengths and at this stage it would be very tough to predict who would be awarded the project. I wish them well and look forward to working with them in a concerted effort towards our goal of integrated tourism.<br><br>- Theresa Chew<br>CEO,<br>Expressions International<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : The Genting International and Star Cruises consortium has proposed to build four theme parks at a cost of S$5.2 billion at the integrated resort in Sentosa.<br><br>It includes a Universal Studios theme park and three water-themed attractions.<br><br>Spanning 49 hectares, the proposed resort - Resorts World at Sentosa - will feature three water theme parks.<br><br>They include the world's largest oceanarium - the Quest Marine Life Park - with 700,000 dolphins, bat rays and open ocean fish.<br><br>Jeffery Jouett, CEO, Dolphin Quest, said, "There are all kind of experiences in our park. The opportunity to be in a shark cage and dive in with hammerhead sharks and tiger sharks and to feed them from that shark cage or to snorkel along...There will be restaurants and bars completely submerged where you'll be surrounded by fish of the ocean and whale sharks as you dine, drink and have a meal."<br><br>Visitors can also enjoy "water-coasters" and rides that wind through lush greenery and forested areas, or try out the surf pool at the Equarius Water Park.<br><br>A centrepiece of the resort will be a Maritime Museum offering a multimedia experience by simulating a shipwreck.<br><br>It will be built by famous museum designers Ralph Appelbaum Associates.<br><br>Genting's proposal also includes six hotels and spa with over 1,800 rooms for both leisure and business travellers.<br><br>Those looking for more thrills can head for the Universal Studios theme park with 16 rides designed specially for the Sentosa resort.<br><br>And the fun is set to continue after sundown.<br><br>The bidder says its experience will come in handy when marketing the resort.<br><br>Lim Kok Thay, CEO, Genting Group, said, "Star cruises has been a tourism player here in Singapore for 12 years now. They will have a huge role to play in terms of helping packing the pre-cruise and post-cruise packages with Resorts World at Sentosa, primarily targeted at the base market, which is India and China."<br><br>Genting also plans to inject S$200 million every year to reinvent and refresh attractions at the proposed resort.<br><br>This will ensure the resort remains appealing and encourage repeat visitation.<br><br>The resort is expected to attract 10 million visitors and generate S$15 billion in tourism receipts by 2015.<br><br>Genting is up against contenders Eight Wonder and the Kerzner-CapitaLand consortium for the Sentosa project.<br><br>The winner will be announced by the end of the year.<br><br>Responding to the media, Genting says it could make a gaming revenue of between S$1 billion and S$2 billion a year from the resort, which will open in 2009. - CNA/ms<br><br></div>
