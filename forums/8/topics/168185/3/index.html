When he arrived at the place, the<br>officer is not around except for his colleuage. The customer got angry u turned unruly towards the colleauge demanding thing, the other colleauge simply said no. There is a newspaper article to teach people a lesson if they turned vulgar, call police.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>it is easy for you to say. i presume you dont earn $1000 odd and have to take all kinds of %#^^ from people. </strong><br><br>Well all in service line are subjected to customer demands and complaints. Compare service to service line jobs, 1K+ is still better than being a full time cleaner which takes back only abt 650 each month and nowhere near 1K. Or maybe can consider coffee shop helper or dish washer etc... they are also taking back much lesser.<br><br>So maybe for ppl in service line think abt your compatriots in service line also but yet take so much less home than you. Those thoughts will soothe you after a bad day of customer bombardment? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

A fren of my is working so he got this chest pain. He went to meet the cardiologist n the latter mentioned nothing wrong could be due to stress.<br>The cardiologist upon hearing my fren from Indonesia asked how long he stayed in Singapore, the reply more than ten years. The doctor replied please do not get stressed by the local.</div>
