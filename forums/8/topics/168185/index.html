            <div class='col-md body'>Reasons for bad service standard in sg.<br><br>Unappreciative of the server.  As I am working I serve my customer with passion I try my best to make each customer feel welcomed and make their stay enjoyable . But all the effort I canÂ’t even get a thank u. those ppl simply take it as a must to give them gd service, they deserve it .  So it greatly discourages severs to give gd service, since there will be no difference between gd and bad service because we are treated the same manner . This is a mindset very common in this industry. My point is to point out if u want gd services be appreciative , a simple thanks or smile means a lot to the servers. Cause it implies that our effort are being recognized, and it will worth all the work.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>P.S: donÂ’t flame me I am just pointing out something I felt. I had seen some of the worst ppl treating servers like their dogs.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> And yet many ppl complain service standard in Singapore is dropping.

And the sauce was on my shirt and apron. He didnÂ’t even say sry or wad. And he did it in front of his frds like so proud that he was so rude to me . He smile at me and that smile of his really make me feel like throwing the plates on his face follow by a suplex and a choke slam . This is just one out of the many. But thank god I was able to hold my cool and walk off.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>And one thing , have u ppl notice that the customers giving us trouble is mostly male ? Well for my case it is male guys with their g/f trying to be in charge.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> </div></blockquote>yeah, if not then its one of those aunties,<br>there's one guy who patronised us recently when he found that shopping here would give him a rebate on his bill<br>from what i know he should have received it in his mail , and his wife seems to be aware of it and got embarassed and went off<br><br>when he insisted that we must call up the bank to comfirm for him, even after we tried to tell him its a rebate in his bill and not a discount<br>he kept saying this is bad service and we should call up the bank immediately to comfirm<br><br>hello? does he know the difference between rebate and discount ? needless to say , being in our position we had to call up the bank , and well what do you know? its a rebate<br>and thoughout the whole thing we tried to smile and kept our temper ,the moth*r fuck*r 's attitude was<br>"i'm spending here, and the customer is king"<br><br>not a single word of thanks and the best part is<br>his parting words<br>"thats how things should be done!"</div>
