            <div class='col-md body'>hahahahaha.<br>really cannot believe i failed on today's attempt.<br><br>had my test at about 3pm+ in the afternoon and when i go out on the road, i was like so happy! The road was very clear and there were not much cars. So i drove with confidence and while on the way back to the driving center, i thought i would surely pass. So i was smiling all the way while the tester asked me to follow him to the room. We sat down and he started to lower his head and mumble something which i couldnt understand. And after 5 mins of mumbling, he gave me a FAIL.<br><br>ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Still cannot believe how i failed.<br><br>So i took the result slip and see what mistake i had made. And OMFG! 2 points in the circuit and 38 points outside the road. He actually gave me 26 points for failing to take precaution when apporaching pedestrain and this interlink with dont know what and 26 points gone?? The best part is that i already tried my best to by pass that bangala worker who was trimming the grass near the curb while positioning himself on the middle of the road!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>Actually i dont mind failing if i had tried my best and valid reasons were provided. Even my instructor told me that i'm the only student of his that has even met his requirement and he was very sure i would pass even on the first try.<br><br>hahaha sorry for this long post but i really need to rant out this injustice. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Also sis and bro who had passed their driving test, may i know how you guys please the tester? Because he showed me this 'black' face through out the test and never talked much, just instructions to make right/left turn etc etc.<br><br>SIANNNNNNNN. Feeling very down now. The feeling's like you died without knowing the reason why.</div>

The road was very clear and there were not much cars. So i drove with confidence and while on the way back to the driving center, i thought i would surely pass. So i was smiling all the way while the tester asked me to follow him to the room. We sat down and he started to lower his head and mumble something which i couldnt understand. And after 5 mins of mumbling, he gave me a FAIL.<br><br>ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Still cannot believe how i failed.<br><br>So i took the result slip and see what mistake i had made. And OMFG! 2 points in the circuit and 38 points outside the road. He actually gave me 26 points for failing to take precaution when apporaching pedestrain and this interlink with dont know what and 26 points gone?? The best part is that i already tried my best to by pass that bangala worker who was trimming the grass near the curb while positioning himself on the middle of the road!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>Actually i dont mind failing if i had tried my best and valid reasons were provided. Even my instructor told me that i'm the only student of his that has even met his requirement and he was very sure i would pass even on the first try.<br><br>hahaha sorry for this long post but i really need to rant out this injustice. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Also sis and bro who had passed their driving test, may i know how you guys please the tester? Because he showed me this 'black' face through out the test and never talked much, just instructions to make right/left turn etc etc.<br><br>SIANNNNNNNN. Feeling very down now. The feeling's like you died without knowing the reason why.</div></blockquote>u r a girl? why didnt u dress up sexy to distract the tester?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
