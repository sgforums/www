            <div class='col-md body'>Is it lawful for female to wear trousers or things that pertained to male?<br><br>Deuteronomy 22:5 says, Â“The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the LORD thy God.Â”  The word pertain is defined as Â“to belong as a part, member, accessory, or product; to be appropriate to something; to have reference toÂ” (Merriam WebsterÂ’s 11th Collegiate Dictionary).<br><br>The question is, Â“Do trousers or pants have reference to men, or to women? They have reference to men. Questions like, Â“Who wears the pants in the family?Â” has reference to the man and his place of leadership in the home (and to women who try and usurp that authority; hence, they are said to be wearing the pants in the family).<br><br>Just go to a public restroom, and see which door has the pants on it, and you will quickly see that even the world knows that pants Â“pertainÂ” to men. Some women quickly say that they only wear Â“pants for women.Â” The problem is that no one can see the TAG on the inside, but only the APPEARANCE on the outside. Can you imagine public restrooms with pants on both doors? Which door would you use? You cannot see the tags on the pants (because they are on the inside). From the outward appearance, there is no way to tell what door is the menÂ’s and what door is the womenÂ’s. The result would be CONFUSION. Some would go in the wrong doors, and there would be screams and/or great embarrassment as the result.<br><br>It is the hypocritical Pharisees that kept the letter of the Law, but not the true spirit of the Law. The true spirit of the Law here is that there is to be a CLEAR DIFFERENCE in the LOOK of men and womenÂ’s CLOTHES. If you are looking close enough to see tags or certain cuts, you are looking too close at the bodies of other people.<br><br>God wants a difference in the LOOK of clothing Â— not just the LABELS. It is the LOOK that causes LUST Â— not the LABEL. If men and women look similar in the way that they are dressed, then people look over their bodies for the differences in the way that God made men and women to tell which they are Â— male or female. Those are areas that people should not be staring at, and areas that cause lust.<br><br>God has also ordained that there be distinct differences in the length of hair. I Corinthians 11:14,15 says, Â“Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him? But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.Â”<br><br>If men dressed like men, and had short hair like men should have, no one would ever have to look them over to tell what they are Â— male or female. If women dressed like women should, and had long hair like women should have, then no one would ever have to look them over to tell what they are Â— male or female. The whole unisex fashion system (same style clothes and hair) is but another subtle work of the devil, and many Christians have fallen for it.  Many Christian women have their hair cut short, and dress just like men.   Many Christian men have long hair like women, and wear all kinds of feminine jewelry.  They are adding to the confusion of this day, and the immoral perversion that is abounding.  Remember, you can get mad when someone tells you the truth about dress and hair styles, but one day you will answer to God, and He is the One who had written,  Â“The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the LORD thy God.Â”</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You should know it is not against the law at all, whether it's religious law, ethical law, or any other laws.<br><br>The biblical quotes u studied, u have to understand something. Those are not principal or fundamental religious teaching, those are just norms. Dressing norms. At that time. You should not confuse it with a religious teaching such as not to kill, not to steal, and so on.<br><br>Because a dressing norm is included in the bible, u should make notice not to take it as something holy or sacred or need to be preserved to this day.<br><br>There are lots of other norms included in the bible. Many of these norms have changed in today's society.<br><br>I think u should really make notice between norms, which were written for that time, and true religious teachings. The Bible has many things inside other than religious teachings, like wars and norms and even birth lineages.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ah Gong:</div><div class="quote_body">Is it lawful for female to wear trousers or things that pertained to male?<br><br>Deuteronomy 22:5 says, Â“The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the LORD thy God.Â”  The word pertain is defined as Â“to belong as a part, member, accessory, or product; to be appropriate to something; to have reference toÂ” (Merriam WebsterÂ’s 11th Collegiate Dictionary).<br><br>The question is, Â“Do trousers or pants have reference to men, or to women? They have reference to men. Questions like, Â“Who wears the pants in the family?Â” has reference to the man and his place of leadership in the home (and to women who try and usurp that authority; hence, they are said to be wearing the pants in the family).<br><br>Just go to a public restroom, and see which door has the pants on it, and you will quickly see that even the world knows that pants Â“pertainÂ” to men. Some women quickly say that they only wear Â“pants for women.Â” The problem is that no one can see the TAG on the inside, but only the APPEARANCE on the outside. Can you imagine public restrooms with pants on both doors? Which door would you use? You cannot see the tags on the pants (because they are on the inside). From the outward appearance, there is no way to tell what door is the menÂ’s and what door is the womenÂ’s. The result would be CONFUSION. Some would go in the wrong doors, and there would be screams and/or great embarrassment as the result.<br><br>It is the hypocritical Pharisees that kept the letter of the Law, but not the true spirit of the Law. The true spirit of the Law here is that there is to be a CLEAR DIFFERENCE in the LOOK of men and womenÂ’s CLOTHES. If you are looking close enough to see tags or certain cuts, you are looking too close at the bodies of other people.<br><br>God wants a difference in the LOOK of clothing Â— not just the LABELS. It is the LOOK that causes LUST Â— not the LABEL. If men and women look similar in the way that they are dressed, then people look over their bodies for the differences in the way that God made men and women to tell which they are Â— male or female. Those are areas that people should not be staring at, and areas that cause lust.<br><br>God has also ordained that there be distinct differences in the length of hair. I Corinthians 11:14,15 says, Â“Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him? But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.Â”<br><br>If men dressed like men, and had short hair like men should have, no one would ever have to look them over to tell what they are Â— male or female. If women dressed like women should, and had long hair like women should have, then no one would ever have to look them over to tell what they are Â— male or female. The whole unisex fashion system (same style clothes and hair) is but another subtle work of the devil, and many Christians have fallen for it.  Many Christian women have their hair cut short, and dress just like men.   Many Christian men have long hair like women, and wear all kinds of feminine jewelry.  They are adding to the confusion of this day, and the immoral perversion that is abounding.  Remember, you can get mad when someone tells you the truth about dress and hair styles, but one day you will answer to God, and He is the One who had written,  Â“The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the LORD thy God.Â”</div></blockquote>come on.. this is a modern world... what do u expect..?

You should not confuse it with a religious teaching such as not to kill, not to steal, and so on.<br><br>Because a dressing norm is included in the bible, u should make notice not to take it as something holy or sacred or need to be preserved to this day.<br><br>There are lots of other norms included in the bible. Many of these norms have changed in today's society.<br><br>I think u should really make notice between norms, which were written for that time, and true religious teachings.
