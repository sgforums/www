              <p>I was only away for 8 days, but I login to receive 18 hate mails from fellow forumers. I’ve noticed a common trend in what many have said about me...that is, that I’m a pompous asshole/misogynistic fucker. And while there may be some truth to that…Well, I didn’t know what to think about it. I mean, while  being called a “societal rubbish” or I have my compassion compared to that of a snake or a dog, I thought I’d let you know more about the other side. It’s only fair to give you both perspectives of the quagmire that is me. </p>
              <p>So before we travel to the other side of the moon, I’d like to apologize to you readers who think I’m some big asshole pig…I don’t mean to prove you wrong. =)</p>
              <p>I suggest that you grab a box of tissues, dim the lights, and put on some Air Supply. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> I present:</p>
              <p> 48 Things you shouldn’t know about me, but I’m telling you anyways…</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. I’d like to quit smoking some day. </p>
              <p>2. I’m a cat person.</p>
              <p>Dogs are alright and all; I just appreciate the cat's disposition.</p>
              <p>3. I could have made an easy pussy reference there and I didn’t.</p>
              <p>4. When I’m sick, I take baths.</p>
              <p>I usually take showers, of course. But when I’m sick or in a bad mood, I draw the water, pour a glass of Absolut and take a bath. It’s a pretty standard norm, for me at least, to have your sister in the tub with me also. She says likes the bubbles, but I think she likes my phallus.</p>
              <p>5. I’m only kidding. I admire your sister and fully respect her wishes to sleep with me.</p>
              <p>6. I’m only kidding. I appreciate her and accept that she’s a lesbian.</p>
              <p>7. I sometimes smoke menthols. </p>
              <p>8. There are certain liquors I dislike, whiskey being one of them.</p>
              <p>I love gin and vodka, though.</p>
              <p>9. I prefer fried chicken over steak, liquor over beer, and books over movies.</p>
              <p>10. I recently cancelled my subscription to FHM.</p>
              <p>11. I wash my hands after I use the bathroom.</p>
              <p>12. I wash my hands after masturbation.</p>
              <p>13. I run out of soap often.</p>
              <p>14. I find guys who use weapons in fights to be biggest pussies.</p>
              <p>15. I have a very big soft-spot for graceful, lady-like women.</p>
              <p>16. For a girlfriend, I’m a gentleman </p>
              <p>Yep. Even with all of this talk of whores and woman management. Though I should say that I’m NOT a gentleman to stupid sluts or girls I just generally dislike. I could care less about opening the door for a bitch.</p>
              <p>17. In Secondary 2, I was stood up on a date by a SCGS girl because i flirted with her sister during the track and field nationals.</p>
              <p>18. I didn’t kill the bitch.</p>
              <p>19. I don’t speed.</p>
              <p>Not really because I’m a pussy. More because my car can’t go over 90 km/h. And the audio system is damaged. And the windshield wipers don’t work. And there’re a few dents on it…</p>
              <p>20. “Jenny Was a Friend of Mine” is one of my favorite songs.</p>
              <p>21. I’ll sing in the shower or in my car, poorly.</p>
              <p>22. When my roommate aren’t here.</p>
              <p>23. I lie about my penis size.</p>
              <p>24. I underestimate it so it won’t scare girls away.</p>
              <p>Didn’t expect that, eh?</p>
              <p>25. I love my family.</p>
              <p>26. I just thought about my parents after writing about my penis.</p>
              <p>27. Sick.</p>
              <p>28. I love you mom.</p>
              <p>That’s better.</p>
              <p>29. I support homosexual marriage.</p>
              <p>30. I could have said “if both chicks are nice-looking” there, but I didn’t.</p>
              <p>31. I just used the term “nice-looking”</p>
              <p>32. I used to blush when I bought condoms</p>
              <p>33. I bought condoms from my grandma</p>
              <p>34. I obviously have an odd mental connection between my family and sex because of this.</p>
              <p>Obviously, I'm just fucking around. My grandma was a cashier at shop&amp;save.</p>
              <p>35. I hate to lose, but I’ll intentionally let up if I’m beating the piss out of somebody in a sport/video game. I try to be secretive about it so that the person losing feels better about things.</p>
              <p>Winning 11 and tennis are the only exceptions.</p>
              <p>36. My favourite soccer player is Cesc Fabregas but I destest Barcelona.</p>
              <p>37. Rain depresses me. Sun has the opposite effect.</p>
              <p>38. I have an iron stomach, yet will never drink milk with fried food.</p>
              <p>Milk + grease= sickness</p>
              <p>39. I eventually want to get married, have kids…the whole deal</p>
              <p>40. I dislike rich people. A lot. </p>
              <p>Not because of jealousy, but because wealthy people generally don’t realize what life really is about, in my opinion.</p>
              <p>41. I keep two pictures on my desk: one, a drawing of a Yellow Volkswagen Beetle by my little cousin who was 7 at the time of its drawing and is now 10; two, the photo of "Dale Carnegie" leadership workshop I attended back in 2005.</p>
              <p>42. My good friend Gardner killed himself jumping off a HDB flat nearly 4 years ago. November 19th, 2008. Nothing has changed me more than this.</p>
              <p>43. I like going to and participating in class</p>
              <p>44. I am what I eat</p>
              <p>Explained: Oh c’mon. You knew it was coming. Besides, if I’m going to lie about everything else in this list, I might as well have you thinking I’m eager to lick them down there.</p>
              <p>45. I'm not.</p>
              <p>46. When I say I’m going to do something for somebody, I do it. No excuses.</p>
              <p>47. I call men older than me “sir” and women older than me “ma’am.” I say “Please” and “Thank You” and I wave at traffic when they let me in or help me out. I immediately hate fucks who don’t do any of these.</p>
              <p>48. Last year, when I was in exchange in Lyon, I jumped off a bridge that’s about 30m off the ground into a river. It was the biggest rush of my life; but, I’m never doing that shit ever again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And if you can't deal with this: </p>
              <p>Fuck you kindly. =)</p>
              <p> </p>
