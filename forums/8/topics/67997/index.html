Some agencies screwed up in Thailand,' government spokesman Jakrapob Penkair told journalists halfway through a regional ministerial conference on avian flu in Bangkok yesterday.<br><br>Laying the blame on the agencies, he said there had also been a 'misinterpretation of procedures' and inadequate information relayed.<br><br>'Thailand has now been accused of covering up the outbreak of bird flu. The Prime Minister denied this,' said Mr Jakrapob.<br><br>'He made a distinction between a cover-up...and inefficiency.'<br><br>A contrite Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra told the conference yesterday the situation made him realise that no matter how much the government was mindful of past lessons, mistakes and human errors were always possible.<br><br>He assured delegates from 10 countries that his government's top priority was to get the situation 'well under control'.<br><br>He spoke even as two places in Bangkok - including the world famous Chatuchak weekend market - tested positive for the virus and poultry culling continued.<br><br>The cull was estimated to have destroyed 10.7 million chickens in affected areas by Tuesday night.<br><br>Mr Jakrapob said the people responsible for the 'screw-up' would be punished, but declined to identify how many would be affected.<br><br>'It depends on how grand a scale this mess goes up to,' he said.<br><br>Earlier on Tuesday, several senators said they could impeach ministers responsible for the inaccurate information that had delayed Thailand's eventual admission about the bird-flu outbreak.<br><br>Despite Thailand's strenuous denials of a cover-up, more doubts have been cast over the kingdom's credibility.<br><br>Only last week, the European Union (EU) lauded Thailand for its defence against a possible bird-flu outbreak. Now, the EU - sounding visibly stung by Thai denials - said the kingdom's word was not enough for it to lift a ban on Thai chicken imposed last week.<br><br>'In these circumstances in which we have seen non-transparency, only a complete reliance on Thai assurances does not seem to be the best way to go forward,' an EU spokesman was reported as saying by the Associated Press.<br><br>Japan - which together with the EU are the biggest markets for Thai poultry - has also not lifted a similar ban on Thai chicken.<br><br>Meanwhile, Thailand's Cabinet has approved 3 billion baht (S$130 million) in compensation for farmers hit by the outbreak. Earlier this week, two Thai children were confirmed to have died of bird flu.<br><br>Thailand's change of fortune is ironic, given that it had earlier declared this year to be the year of food safety.</div>
