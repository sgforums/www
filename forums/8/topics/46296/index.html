            <div class='col-md body'>Well, it seems that to totally understand this issue, we gotta bury deep first to find out what's really happening. Some of the following is gotten from information privy amongst the union members at the moment.<br><br>First, majority of pilots accepts pay cut, only the union management is rejecting the move.<br><br>Second, there's a big issue about not firing foreign pilots. Alpha-S (Alpa-S? Alfa...  whatever) says that SIA should retrench (aka fire) foreign pilots first then any pay cut consideration with local pilots can be considered.<br><br>SIA's position is that they should not retrench foreign pilots as this is a sign of "betrayal" to these pilots. Singapore is depandant on expat pilots and retrenching them when times are bad and recruiting them with bonuses equal to emperor's ransom during boom time gives SIA that bad image.<br><br>Anyway, this is the picture I was given... SIA is asking local pilots to take a pay cut and go on no-pay leaves every 2 months. And at the moment, flights are cut like 30-40% meaning not as many pilots are needed.<br><br>But for the foreign pilots, they are not ask to take this approach, they are still paid as per normal, and with reduced flights taking place, they are basically idling on the job. Sitting around not flying and getting paid.<br><br>I guess it is so unfair that local pilots have to bear the brunt whereas foreign pilots still enjoy SIA perks during SIA's gloomy times.<br></div>

First come first serve rules.<br><br>If your late, you fly sectors on holidays. not very nice.<br><br>depending on the pilot's aircraft type, for example 747-400 on a trip to LA, they will be doing 2 sectors with a stop over at HK<br><br>So to say, 4 hrs to HK, 1 hr stop over (1 sector completed)<br>after turnover personnels are done with the cabin mock ups, the flight crew depart HK on 16 hr Flight to LA.<br><br>On this flight depending on bidding and pilot schedules, this would either be a 3-4 man crew or there will be an exchange of fresh pilots to continue from HK Bound LA.<br><br>Should the same crew from SIN be flying all the way to LA, CAAS dictates no pilot are allowed to fly more than 10 hrs on long hauls and no longer than 8 hrs on short hauls, therefore spare crew, usually a first Officer or Capt and a Second Officer, takes over in monitoring flight progress.<br><br>To conclude, all 4 crew members get paid for flying only 10 hrs each on a 20 hrs based flight. which also mean they get paid even when resting the rest of the 10 hrs.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Flight Cadet Officer:<br><br>Last i heard SIA is redrawing all its A340-300s and replacing them with B777/ trading in with Boeing for more B777 etc. Why is this so? Wont it affect some E-Tops ruling imposed by CAAS? Moreover the A340-500s will be coming soon.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not too sure about the pilot industry so I shall not comment. What I wanna comment is about basic human behavoir.<br><br>If a person has been drawing at X dollars per month for so many years and use those money to buy cars houses stocks shares etc, eat good food go shiok entertainment, one day say cut to X / 2 who will take it? Afterall one is used to the life style sustained by X dollars. Think this simple observation span across all industries. People juz cannot get used to adjust their expectations once those comfortable X dollars can no longer bring them what they want.<br><br>Take a look at civil servants, old batch of people say iron rice bowl if can go inside beat dead no go out. But what we see is they are now retrenching too! Iron rice bowl expectation has been shattered and people from previous era are still getting used to this new reality harsh truth. Changes are painful and some people juz cannot accept it.</div>
