              <p>I feel that proposal ring must have a certain value lah. I definitely will put more money into buying a really nice proposal ring for my future wife to be. I think anything between 7-10K is something I am comfortable with. My rationale is that if I can afford it (of cos after intensive saving up lah haha), I would want to give her something to remember and something as a symbol of my committment to her other than the wedding band. Somehow as guys while we may not understand it, girls just have an emotional attachement to RINGS especially proposal rings. And sometimes unfortunately, for those people who wants to search for the "PERFECT" ring for proposal, it always does not come cheap, so it either you fork out for it or you compromise.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BUT HOWEVER, this kind of thing is really personal. VALUE of the ring represents nothing really. It must be something you are comfortable with. When my brother in law proposed to my sister, there was no proposal ring but he gave a committment to my sis and to us that though he is poor now, he will ensure that my sister will be loved and taken care of. I guess that alone is better than any proposal ring.</p>

              <p>Why? Because proposal ring is used to show off to her mother, relatives, best friends, colleagues, secret lover/admirer.</p>
              <p>If the proposal ring is ultra splurged, her mum &amp; dad will be happier and more willing to marry her daughter to you. This is important cos you will need her parents to give you a lifetime of free advertising to their daughter, imagined if both of you quarrel in the future after marriage, she will of course run home to her parents, and which higher power do you think you need to help you to save your marriage? Her parents of course!</p>
              <p>If the proposal ring is ultra splurged, you will make her and her parents the envy among her relatives. This will show her how much you cared for her and her family, and she will be happy, grateful, give you more love and might even be more willing to fulfill all your after wedding fantasies. This is important cos that ONE RING will grant you a second chance just in case you screw it up in the future. She is more likely to overlook your mistakes for the sake of that ONE RING. Treat it like a phoenix down in those Final Fantasy game ok? If you know what I meant.</p>
              <p>If the proposal ring is ultra splurged, her best friends and colleagues will be sooo envious of her and she will be happy that you actually cared to give her FACE in front of her best friends and colleagues. Her best friends and colleagues might give you some help to reduce the magnitude of your future screw up and you can be assured that they will be talking about the legendary proposal ring that you have given her. This will help her to grow if not to maintain her love for you as time goes by.</p>
              <p>If the proposal ring is ultra splurged, all her secret lovers/admirers will run far far away from her with their tails between their legs!!! Cos they cannot afford to shower her something that even came close to your SUPER RING, and those losers will most probably flood the Aunt Agony forum with all their kns topics. At least you will be worry-free and can confidently tell her you have faith in her even though you don't. Unless got some retarded guy want to splurge to win some housewife's love, that's is unlikely to happen to you unless all your neighbours are gay couples.</p>
              <p>Anyway, guys who cannot afford to splurge on a decent proposal ring won't stand a chance with me. At least $30k for a proposal ring please.</p>
              <p>But that's my opinion, clones and ginn-nars can go play arcade and playground...I won't entertain their post.</p>

              <p>Wedding bands can buy $1k-2k ones...but must splurge on proposal ring.</p>
              <p>Why? Because proposal ring is used to show off to her mother, relatives, best friends, colleagues, secret lover/admirer.</p>
              <p>If the proposal ring is ultra splurged, her mum &amp; dad will be happier and more willing to marry her daughter to you. This is important cos you will need her parents to give you a lifetime of free advertising to their daughter, imagined if both of you quarrel in the future after marriage, she will of course run home to her parents, and which higher power do you think you need to help you to save your marriage? Her parents of course!</p>
              <p>If the proposal ring is ultra splurged, you will make her and her parents the envy among her relatives. This will show her how much you cared for her and her family, and she will be happy, grateful, give you more love and might even be more willing to fulfill all your after wedding fantasies. This is important cos that ONE RING will grant you a second chance just in case you screw it up in the future. She is more likely to overlook your mistakes for the sake of that ONE RING. Treat it like a phoenix down in those Final Fantasy game ok? If you know what I meant.</p>
              <p>If the proposal ring is ultra splurged, her best friends and colleagues will be sooo envious of her and she will be happy that you actually cared to give her FACE in front of her best friends and colleagues. Her best friends and colleagues might give you some help to reduce the magnitude of your future screw up and you can be assured that they will be talking about the legendary proposal ring that you have given her. This will help her to grow if not to maintain her love for you as time goes by.</p>
              <p>If the proposal ring is ultra splurged, all her secret lovers/admirers will run far far away from her with their tails between their legs!!! Cos they cannot afford to shower her something that even came close to your SUPER RING, and those losers will most probably flood the Aunt Agony forum with all their kns topics. At least you will be worry-free and can confidently tell her you have faith in her even though you don't. Unless got some retarded guy want to splurge to win some housewife's love, that's is unlikely to happen to you unless all your neighbours are gay couples.</p>
              <p>Anyway, guys who cannot afford to splurge on a decent proposal ring won't stand a chance with me. At least $30k for a proposal ring please.</p>
              <p>But that's my opinion, clones and ginn-nars can go play arcade and playground...I won't entertain their post.</p>
