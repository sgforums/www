              <p>wah lao! $1 - $2k pi sai size. I saw one in Tiffany and co! One ring easily cost $20k and above.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By the way, If i buy the ring.. I only get to use it once or twice. MOST of the time, I will leave it in the house. I think what matter most is the wedding bands.. not the proposal rings?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>erm. diamond industries. Any recommendations?</p>

              <p>Wedding bands can buy $1k-2k ones...but must splurge on proposal ring.</p>
              <p>Why? Because proposal ring is used to show off to her mother, relatives, best friends, colleagues, secret lover/admirer.</p>
              <p>If the proposal ring is ultra splurged, her mum &amp; dad will be happier and more willing to marry her daughter to you. This is important cos you will need her parents to give you a lifetime of free advertising to their daughter, imagined if both of you quarrel in the future after marriage, she will of course run home to her parents, and which higher power do you think you need to help you to save your marriage? Her parents of course!</p>
              <p>If the proposal ring is ultra splurged, you will make her and her parents the envy among her relatives. This will show her how much you cared for her and her family, and she will be happy, grateful, give you more love and might even be more willing to fulfill all your after wedding fantasies. This is important cos that ONE RING will grant you a second chance just in case you screw it up in the future. She is more likely to overlook your mistakes for the sake of that ONE RING. Treat it like a phoenix down in those Final Fantasy game ok? If you know what I meant.</p>
              <p>If the proposal ring is ultra splurged, her best friends and colleagues will be sooo envious of her and she will be happy that you actually cared to give her FACE in front of her best friends and colleagues. Her best friends and colleagues might give you some help to reduce the magnitude of your future screw up and you can be assured that they will be talking about the legendary proposal ring that you have given her. This will help her to grow if not to maintain her love for you as time goes by.</p>
              <p>If the proposal ring is ultra splurged, all her secret lovers/admirers will run far far away from her with their tails between their legs!!! Cos they cannot afford to shower her something that even came close to your SUPER RING, and those losers will most probably flood the Aunt Agony forum with all their kns topics. At least you will be worry-free and can confidently tell her you have faith in her even though you don't. Unless got some retarded guy want to splurge to win some housewife's love, that's is unlikely to happen to you unless all your neighbours are gay couples.</p>
              <p>Anyway, guys who cannot afford to splurge on a decent proposal ring won't stand a chance with me. At least $30k for a proposal ring please.</p>
              <p>But that's my opinion, clones and ginn-nars can go play arcade and playground...I won't entertain their post.</p>
