            <div class='col-md body'>Aiyah, even if JC student also, why cannot go clubbing? Don't tell me, just because of A levels must 24 hrs study one? Those who flunked because they go clubbing is not a good justification of why A level students must not go clubbing. If you can balance your time why not? Maybe too much clubbing might have an effect on the studies lah, but I think the thread open by the threadstarter is innocent. What's wrong with just answering the thread? Why is there a need to go into the poly vs jc war again? Some people have the preference of which crowds they want to mix in and that is not wrong.</div>
