            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>about 2 years ago, i moved into a rented room at a condo in bukit timah. The 3 young people who rented it to me were not the actual owners, but they sublet to me. i was stupid and too trustful and did not ask 4 any contract. The 1st month was ok. 2nd month onwards, the electricity kept being cut on and off. when i asked the 3 fuxkxers, they instead asked to borrow $ from me. I did not so they say since i dun lend then no electric loh!(My rent does not require me 2 share bills. anyway i missed a few days work cos of this matter. i finally asked the guy and he totally ignored me. I called 999 and....what a mistake,cos i 4got i had no contract. They told the police i was intruder and wanted me out of there in 24hr...<br>It was the beginning of the month and i had juz paid them the rent for the new month...So i was not really able to pay the rent and deposit 4 a new place.<br>I was told to pack..My big TV was a hassle..The security guard pitied me and helped me move all my things(+ the heavy t.v) to the guard house. In the meantime i could quickly find a place before i removed my barang from the guard house.<br>(Dun ask me why at that time i did not seek help from my family)<br>Through the papers, i got to know a female property agent.  I honestly told her i did not have alot $ left.<br>She told me to bring my things to her friend's house whose room was available.she had already spoken 2 her.<br>Who knows,her friend was another bitch..When she met me she said she had changed her mind about renting.<br>I was lost,and crying. The agent started crying too! She said as a mother she would not want to see her child one day in my situation.<br>She was pissed off at her friend.She then moved all my barang(alot) into her mercedes and bought me to an apartment she had already sold but the new owners have not moved in. She told me to stay there 4 a few days. The next few days she brought me around til i finallly found a place. Guess what..<span style="color: red;">She paid the 1st month rental and deposit 4 me, and did not ask any agent comm from me</span> Sometimes, ppl say a stranger is kinder than the ppl around u <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>Thanks Mrs Chu <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Thank u Mr Security guard of Parc Palais</div>

PRC with PRC will also fight.<br>They are quite ill bred and all think they are princess or prince. Spoilt to the core. B!tches and wh0res! Hate them to the core!<br><br>I stayed with a M'sian once - the house has no landlord. She first time move to SG. She boss me around like she own the house and demand I give way and whatever. She comes in at mid night and wash her laundry till 3 am - on purpose she waste water because she was asked tp pay extra for the water. She cooks and then leaves the place with bits of food and oily floor. She used the kitchen for her "side line business". Then when I ask her to help clean up the house, she claims she only rent the room. The rest is my responsibility. I had to wash the toilet for her, including the kitchen and living room which actually only she use. I don't hang around these area.<br><br>She also had issues with her working permit and once she was detained at customs. Then she like to whine endlessly about her boss, job and whatever to whoever even when all you ask: "How was your day?" She would go into a 5 hour long discussion to download her issues. I had once made this mistake - cannot sleep till 4am. She also very bad temper. When I ask her to go, she destroyed my sink, toilet and whatever she can do to irritate me. She think she is boss and tells me that the new owner welcome her and help her move over. I tot to myself, of course you act nice in front of the landlord. She also act nice to my landlord until when she wanted to leave, then she show her true colors, screaming into the phone, making demands and etc. YThen my landlord come and tell me that no wonder I cannot stand her and finally understand why I ask to have her out.  Very nasty Msian. Horrible people.<br><br>So from there on, after PRCs, M'sians, I decided to just eat less and pay the rent for the whole damn house and stay by myself. I cannot find nice people to stay with, then I better not stay with anyone..<br><br></div>
