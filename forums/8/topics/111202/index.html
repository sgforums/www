            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>The 65 year old man and his wife ran the hawker stall for 6 years.<br>Start work at 5.30 AM and close shop at 10 PM. That is over 17<br>hours in a 24 hour day. 7 days a week, keeping the makan shop<br>open.<br><br>End of the month they have to borrow money to make ends meet.<br>Not much, just 500 dollars or so from friends and relatives. Soon<br>enough, they ran out of friends and relatives willing to loan them money.<br><br>Their health was in bad shape. The man suffered from high BP and<br>moderate diabetics. The woman took an afternoon nap sitting on<br>a stool in front of the stall when business is almost nil.<br><br>All this for what ?<br>They were paying 6000 dollars a month as rental for the stall to<br>the coffee shop owner. In 3 months arrears, he took action. Asked<br>them to sign over their 3 room HDB flat as security or he said he<br>will take them to court to get back the 18,000 dollars owed to him.<br><br>Luckily for the couple, one regular customer whom they had approached<br>for a loan, decided to take the matter seriously. He made them sit down<br>one afternoon along with a couple of his church members. Here is<br>what he roughly told the aged couple. He had a calculator in front of him.<br><br>" You have been running this stall for 6 years, every day, every week<br>for 16 hours non-stop, working like dogs. You have paid almost half a<br>million dollars as rent to the coffee shop owner during these six years of your old age life.<br><br>What you have now is a debt for 18,000 dollars for all this effort.<br>Close your shop, stop your dreams and kill your hopes.<br>The system here is heavily against you. It will make you work like a dog and suck all your blood till you have nothing left. Just pack your<br>things and go. Me and my colleagues here sincerely advice you<br>to close shop and stop feeding the landlord.<br><br>This is the advice we have given to over 20 stall holders who could<br>not see how the odds are against them due to their ignorance.<br>Live your old age with what little you have left."<br><br>Last week the couple tearfully closed their shop and bid goodbye<br>to their fellow stall holders. It was not easy, as they looked around<br>their familiar surroundings for the last time.<br>Yes, everything was over for them. They knew that. Their great<br>Singapore dream was miserably over. The end of a long, tiring and utterly hopeless road.<br><br>Somehow, in that agony of theirs, they must have felt a sense of<br>ecstacy, as they walked away for the last time from the place.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another case:<br><br>The man aged 40 something running a hawker stall selling<br>fishhead curry. Slog for over 10 years. Business was good<br>then for him and he could pay the rental of 7 K plus.<br>Then Maxtor and other MNC plants in the area closed and he lost business income dramatically. That was in 2000.<br><br>He has been running the business since then, hoping for better<br>times and paying the rent from his savings. But business has been going bad to worse and now, The landlord is after him as he owes<br>over 42K and filed a case against him plus closed down his stall.<br><br>Desperate, he got a contract to supply mid day meal packs<br>to some Sembawang Ship yard employees. Profit margin was<br>very low. He hired a cheap foreign worker to help him pack<br>the meal packets in his flat. But the worker was an illegal.<br><br>He was arrested for hiring an illegal worker and spent<br>3 months in jail. He lost all and has a police record now.<br>Saw him yesterday with a close cropped head. Only then he<br>tells me about his prison stay.<br><br>I cannot under any circumstances say that this man is lazy,<br>stupid or lack business sense. He is an extremely hard<br>working person, knows his trade and willing to take risks<br>even to succeed.<br><br>If he can fail, then it cannot be due to his shortcomings.<br>It was because in today's condition it is almost a losing<br>game for most businessmen. So imagine the fate of others<br>who are less able than him !!!.<br><br></div>
