              <p>Alright. I love clubbing. But I have a bit of a problem.</p>
              <p>You see when I start dancing in the clubs. Sometimes there are girls who come up and dance really close. Okay. Sometimes 4 girls. So Ill be dancing with one of them, as in really close dancing. they know im dancing with them. Sometimes they push their friends toward me. they have their backs really close to my front.I try not to go too close, just enough room for my hand to put through. to avoid any discomfort.</p>
              <p>My problem is. I have no idea what they want, whether they are interested or not, and what am i going to do with 4 girls? ask all of them to go for a drink? Wouldn't taking one girl out be like making the other 3 jealous? So............ I just dance.</p>
              <p>And after 10minutes they move on. okay sometimes it can get hurtful, I have to be honest. lol.</p>
              <p>There was once a girl came up to me, she was sweet had a great smile, great sense of fashion, mongolian, around 21 years of age. We had a great time. we even had a passionate kiss at the end. Before her friend took her away to the toilet, and she ignored me the whole night after that.</p>
              <p>Now can anyone help me with this? how can I make the night more interesting for them and me? or one of them and me? I would like to have a girls point of view on this.</p>
              <p>I can't share this with any of my girlfriends, because most of them are my so called "gay buddies".( ignore that if you don't understand lol)</p>

              <p>Just go with the flow, need lots of patience.</p>
              <p>You need to entertain all her girl friends, especially the leader of the group. The leader is usually the most outspoken and confident, the girls will usually listen to her advice because the leader is more experienced in clubbing. So when the group likes you, you can get your girl.</p>
              <p>If you focus too much on only the girl and ignores the rest, most likely will fail.</p>
              <p>No 1 rule: Dont be desperate. If girls think that you are desperate, there goes your chance. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
