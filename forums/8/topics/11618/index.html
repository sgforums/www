            <div class='col-md body'>Like what Jelly baby has said. Depend on which trade the workers do. Normally only the main contractor's workers stay with the project throughout. Sub contractor's workers come in only when there job is ready to commence and leave once their job finish.<br><br>Duration of a project depends on a lot of factors. The type of construction method. Type of building to build. Number of stories, project with basment take longer time.<br><br>------------------<br>It is true that we don't know what we have got until we lose it<br>It is also true that we don't know what we have been missing until it arrives.</div>
