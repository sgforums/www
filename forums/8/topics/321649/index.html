              <p>I have enough of racism in Singapore. Too many incidents - pissing me off..</p>
              <p>e.g.</p>
              <p>1. a non-chinese comes for interview. when he was leaving, my colleague passed a remark "don't want leh.. eee.. non-chinese one"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. neighbours making big hoo ha about an indian neighbour (and this with highlighting the word "indian" in their posts. even go as far as making comments such as, who would want to have an indian neighbour if they have the choice? when i complain about my chinese neighbor who is extremely anti-social in behavior (leaves rubbish at the refuse area floor, instead of throwing it into the chute), no one cares. all swarm to the poster with the unpleasant experience of having an indian neighbour (this is in their opinion, not mine)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. when some smartass starts a topic flaming non-chinese in forums, moderators take long to shut down the thread, sometimes, not at all. but when the mud-slinging turns on the chinese, within a few posts the thread is shut down.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>sigh.. feel so disappointed in the state of things in singapore. in the first place we should be preaching racial ACCEPTANCE, not racial TOLERANCE. because with TOLERANCE, it still means lack of understanding and unwillingness to udnerstand differences.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I agree with what you said in your last paragraph.<br><br>However there are people in these forums who stand up and defend minority groups when a racist thread is posted, and at least one threadstarter was reported to the police. The subsequent threads are usually a reaction to the former and that's why they get locked early.<br><br>The other two examples happen too regularly, sadly. Racism also takes root when people forget to focus on the rotten individuals and start crying "fucking Chinaman/ang moh/Paki/etc".</p></div>

              <p>O fcourse they'd show only the good things on tv, since
                                      singapore tv often tries so hard about being politically correct,
                                      and do you really think bad things get shown on tv?</p>
              <p>when i was a schoolkid i used to think there's racial harmony in
                                      singapore. but then i realised, just because you don't have
                                      uprisings and strikes and riots doesn't mean there is racial
                                      harmony. most people (usually the majority) just grind their teeth
                                      and bear with whatever they don't like about minorities, but when
                                      an opportunities present themselves, they will not hesitate to
                                      speak bad about them. i had so enough of these people.</p>
              <p>do you know once my colleagues even asked me if my husband
                                      smells just because he is of indian origin? if you have never been
                                      in that situation before, you would just think that racism is
                                      someone else's problem. well, it is not. tensions do run high a lot
                                      of times with such insensitive anc closed minds which are willing
                                      to learn anything outside of their own cultures and one day, trust
                                      me, the social fabric will be torn if things remain the same,.The
                                      thing is the majority usually feel racism is something that doesn't
                                      happen in that backyard, for a simple reason.. because they are not
                                      on the receiving end of it. they will always think places like US,
                                      Australia are worse, but are they? to have a really fair perception
                                      and balanced view, why not ask the minority in singapore whether
                                      they feel more accepted in their homeland or elsewhere?? then only
                                      you can get a fair answer.</p>

              <p>i noe their timing is weekend afternoon</p>
              <p>so i watch my movie after they sing karaoke, around 8+, so i
              watch from 8+ till midnight</p>
              <p>although i also create a lot of noise, we still live in
              harmony</p>
              <p>It is hard to say whether there is racial harmony in singapore,
              there is and there is not</p>

              <p>I agree with what you said in your last paragraph.<br> <br> However there are people in these forums who stand up and defend
                      minority groups when a racist thread is posted, and at least one
                      threadstarter was reported to the police. The subsequent threads
                      are usually a reaction to the former and that's why they get locked
                      early.<br> <br> The other two examples happen too regularly, sadly. Racism also
                      takes root when people forget to focus on the rotten individuals
                      and start crying "fucking Chinaman/ang moh/Paki/etc".</p>

              <p>do you know once my colleagues even asked me if my husband smells just because he is of indian origin? if you have never been in that situation before, you would just think that racism is someone else's problem. well, it is not. tensions do run high a lot of times with such insensitive anc closed minds which are willing to learn anything outside of their own cultures and one day, trust me, the social fabric will be torn if things remain the same,.The thing is the majority usually feel racism is something that doesn't happen in that backyard, for a simple reason.. because they are not on the receiving end of it. they will always think places like US, Australia are worse, but are they? to have a really fair perception and balanced view, why not ask the minority in singapore whether they feel more accepted in their homeland or elsewhere?? then only you can get a fair answer.</p>

              <p><br>At least that is yr colleagues who asked.

              <p>I told them if that if they wanna stereotype does that mean that Chinese guys will cheat on their wife and gamble away the family income and drink themselves silly at the same time and then murder the entire family when the debtors come knocking on the door <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
