              <p>I guess I don't have a racist perspective, but I have to assess their character first, so I'm judgemental on the way they carry themselves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have pretty cool friends, pretyy much modern cultured people from all races.</p>
              <p>My indian friends tend not to bathe in rosemary; which they claim gives them that indian smell which some dislike.</p>
              <p>I respect one of my indian friends for being an excellent dancer(male), came up with a routine and did a solo just to buy time for the crew to change. Very impressive, receieved the crowd's cheers like sun on the skin</p>

              <p>Racial harmony......it depends on how u want to define it....and how u want to measure it...</p>
              <p>To a certain extent, racial harmony is possible, very much so.</p>
              <p>I would even say, in Singapore society today, there exists a pretty good racial harmony.</p>
              <p>The things people say here in this thread.....about examples of personal remarks....gestures.....preferences.....and then say these things signify there is no racial harmony....I think is abit wrong.</p>
              <p>Maybe in some people's minds, racial harmony is when these particular instances totally disappear, but I think this is very unrealistic, and not what racial harmony is about.</p>
              <p>Since we are humans, we will definitely have preferences, and discriminate people who are not like us, whether by age, gender, or race.</p>
              <p>This kind of 'discrimination' is innate and ingrained in our mentality, just like monkeys.</p>
              <p>I think we shouldn't take these instances too seriously and read too much into it. Be a little more accepting of the limits of us as people.</p>
              <p>Especially on cases when unpleasant remarks are said. Those people will probably say similar things about fat people, for example. Or rich people. That is just a matter of personality.</p>

              <p>Depends, no matter what race you are, if you carry a racist
              mindset or you are being too sensitive, then all these racist
              stuffs will happen, if you talk to people based on the fact that
              they are people, then everything will be ok. When I see mats
              sitting at void deck making a nuisance of themselves, I go in my
              head "malays..." FYI, there NEVER was a time when I walk past a
              group of mats at a void deck late at night after a night of hanging
              out did they NOT passed some comments about me.</p>
              <p>For example before NS, I had long hair, kinda like the emo
              style, and then I was wearing a punkrock shirt. They had to say
              something like "emo shit" just to pass their day. And all they were
              wearing were soccer jersey and shorts. Thats the problem with some
              of them, they feel that only Malays can wear band shirts and go
              into music, chinese youths are all ah bengs who listen to techno
              and wear Flesh Imp stuffs, any chinese who wear Atreyu shirt or
              Metallica shirt are "poseurs", "step only". (I heard this from a
              malay himself).</p>
              <p>But my best friend is malay. Some of my close malay friends told
              me to ignore them because they are bringing disgrace to
              themselves.</p>
              <p><br> And of course, I have encountered racist indians too. Whenever I
              ask some of them why they drink so much, they will be like "dey! I
              Indian la!". Ok, perhaps that is a joke, but I have encountered
              some who ask me to intro chinese girls to them because "I want to
              fark at least once in my life a chinese girl, they more tighter
              la!" or "you all chinese the dick small la, I indian you know? My
              one big!".</p>
              <p>But I got nice indian friends who always cook briyani for the
              rest of the people in my camp.</p>
              <p>Then likewise, there are a few racist chinese also. I have
              personally encountered chinese females on the train on a sunday
              night covering their noses and making a disgusted face at all the
              indian workers. True, perhaps you may not like how they smell, but
              do you have to openly show your disgust for them?</p>
