            <div class='col-md body'>Oh yes...I have this album too.<br><br>I will think that it may not be everyone's cup of tea.  Its very dark as in most of the songs reflect the dark side of the human race.  And some songs in there sound very 'chi chiam' becoz of the tone texture created by adding the orchestra.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Its like ma jiam the 'whole world' lamenting about the 'sad and terrible' things happening everywhere (which are created by humans to harm humans).<br><br>If you like this album, you can try Alanis Morisette's 'Jagged Little Pill'.
