            <div class='col-md body'>go MI for your first three months, then when your O's are out, go to a JC.<br><br>Believe me, many of my friends came by this route, be they from neighbourhood schools or top schools like RI or NYGH.<br><br>I just like to say that, even though I came from one of those higher-ranked secondary schools, I thankfully cleared the 'got-standard' prelims. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>And btw, for your info, my junior who is in JC1 now and was at MI for 1st 3 months told me, there were a big bunch of the top5 sec school students there,because they have been slaughtered by their prelims.</div>
