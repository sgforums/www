              <p>Open book refer? huh. which book. Did you even completed ns yet?
              Warning shot, as in skywards? when the fellow is 3m or less away
              from you, that is suicidal, because by the time u fired skywards
              his knife would be in you. Wah lau eh. I am a new forumer
              here leh, but I seriously dunno where some of the opposers' ideas
              came from. Warning shot, tackling by unarmed combat or Tbaton,
              shoot legs etc... The officer got like a split second to make his
              decision. A decision which will decide who is the one lying down...
              To those who serve ns in police b4, esp the frontliners, you know
              all the elements jeopardy oportunity and ability is there in the
              case featured here.</p>
              <p>So is it ok if the one who died or seriously injured is the
              officer instead? No. Call me pro govt, call me pro police,
              whatever. If the officer is wrong, I would say so. Just commenting
              based on the facts available so far... If wrong, I will say wrong.
              If right, I will say right.</p>

              <p>Anyone who went thru Police Training / NS would see that this is a clear cut case fulfilling the SPF RoE. (A,O,J as mentioned.) Those who do not, simply lack the relevant knowledge of how it works.</p>
              <p>The accused had already killed 1 and he would continue to kill to get his way out.</p>
              <p>I bet the officer involved would'nt even have to write much for his report.</p>

              <p><br>Please don't think too much. If you were there i bet you'll panic. You try going to outram mrt station (which is underground) and shoot in the air lah. On top is the ceiling and other levels, not clouds. What if the bullet richochet and hit the crowds?</p>
              <p>Lets not be armchair generals (or police officers for that matter). Only the officer who fired the shot has the right to determine if he did the right thing or not, not us. Anyway, there is general consensus that he did cosidering the facts involved. As much as we wish no one died, this is the way it is. Seriously, get your facts right.</p>

              <p>but then again  who would have time to think properly in such a situation . so i dont think the police officer should be blamed .</p>
