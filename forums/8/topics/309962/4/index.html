              <p>Too little time to react. Given you are in the situation, would you hit the leg or hit the body? Which is a bigger target, a higher % of hitting and not missing (bullets might ricochet and hit innocents, that's worse right???)?</p>
              <p>Well since it's an enclosed area the policeman can only give verbal warnings, and if that doesnt stop the aggressor, it's time to shoot him.</p>
              <p>Granted, it would be a whole lot easier if you shot him on the other side of the chest, or your aim is like that of those Hollywood movies. lol.</p>

              <p>yeah lor, I wonder why the policeman did not shoot at that guy's little toe. That would guarantee to have that man hopping around. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
              <p>If I am not wrong, our policemens' revolvers don't shoot like cowboy guns. I think they need to firstn squeeze the trigger, to cock the weapon, then squeeze again to fire. When they decide to shoot, they got to do it quick. They cannot panic and fumble, or they be the one that's dead. Then we'll be saying "He got gun what, why never shoot!"</p>
              <p>Singapore no more warning shots, highrise flats, built up area, dense population, enclose space, etc., now only loud verbal warning. And if the suspect charges, even with a toy knife, or iron pipe, he had it. His best chance is to run away from the policeman, they will not shoot.</p>

              <p><br>Policeman revolvers can be shot like cowboys :) but you will most proability miss !! What mancha discrible is the double action shooting which ensure more acurate shooting.</p>
              <p>Frankly most patrol policeman do not get to shoot enough to be good at shooting at all !!! But don't worry, because singapore police have switch to Taurus Model 85 with laser sight and speed loading, which is seening very good result ... they been on target most of time since the change :)  compare to last time without laser sight ....... they been know to miss even with 2 or 3 rounds at close range !!! But even with laser sight, it is too difficult to get a accurate leg shot !!!</p>
              <p>Yes this time lethal force been used .... which is truely questionable !!! Why did the police chose to confront the man direct thus force the shoot !!! Could they have taken the other approach of clearing out the others people from the station and getting train to by-pass that station first ..... which would have contain the person ..... which allow them a lot more choice of action .... !!! <br><br>Frankly i find it distrubing that the police possible due to the high security .... seem to be too eager to enage in this incident !!! They seem to choose to go for direct confrontation, which trigger lead to the shooting ! Which is a dangerous and uncall for move...... !!! frankly containment would have been the safer choice , even if you decide to take him down .... at least you have clear out the by-standers ..... !!!! <br><br>Seem to be police too eager like the UK case .... try to be hero ... of direct confrontation !!!</p>
              <p>I do not question the shooting - as the person is arm and charging at police !!!</p>
              <p>But I do question why the police chose to approach him directly to  trigger the shooting !!! Should they have not try a more safe indirect approach of clearing out the place and contain him .... which could have not lead to shooting !!!</p>

              <p>Actually,say 10-20yrs back there would not be such public outcry.People would not critic so much about the cop's shooting abilities, but rather say such a pity life was loss. With the internet..every incident big or small, so long it makes its way to the mainstream media there will be a large amount of criticisms to the actions/inactions taken. Alot of public opinion are formed by the public in such instances.</p>
              <p>Anyway,any idea if the cop who shot that chap is a MRT / normal police officer or from the SOC? As if I'm not wrong, the SOC chaps are armed with Swiss-made Sphinx 3000 9mm pistols,not sure if they are compensated, but still even if its not compensated double-tapping is no issue.No experience with revolvers though.</p>

              <p>in Virtual Cop.. those guys are running at u guns blazing right ?  he he..  think the situation is kinda different. Cops are trained. To manhandle , use force only when necessary. Unless he got radiod that suspect is ARMED n Dangerous and someone got killed already. Extreme measures to be taken. aar.. like that i will whoop out my shottie. N pump it at his face. =P</p>

              <p><br>He was just fxxking luckly that he is armed with a Taurus Model 85 with laser sight which help him a lot to shot well !!! But i do question on his training.</p>
              <p><br>Why ? Because he just trigger a shooting in a packed crowded place infront of a lot of singaporeans and tourists risking their lifes !!!  Ok he was lucky .... things went well, he may be call a hero ...</p>
              <p> <br>So what the guy just kill someone, the police should still have put more thoughts to the by-standers !!! But what happen if things went wrong .... by-standers are going to die ..!!  What happen if the bullet have over penetrated. What happen if he missed and bullet ricoshae . What happen if the man instead of charging toward them, charges into the crowds and take someone hostage !!! </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A well train police would not have try to approach the guy to trigger this shooting incident with so many by-standers so near !!! They should have taken a more careful approach to clear others out first and contain him before trying to approach him ....which by then even if they need to shoot - the risk of by-standers casaulties is minised !!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>. Why ... what happen if they confronted the man ... he did not charge</p>
