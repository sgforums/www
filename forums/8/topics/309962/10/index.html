              <p class="miccontenttext">At about 1.50pm today, Police received a call for assistance at the hawker centre at Blk 221B Boon Lay Place. Two officers were despatched to the scene.</p>
              <p class="miccontenttext">On arrival, officers were informed by members of public that a Chinese man in his 40s, armed with a chopper, was sitting at a table. Our officers returned to their vehicle and retrieved their shields. They returned to the hawker centre and approached the man. When the man saw the officers, he picked up the chopper laid before him on the table and charged towards the officers.</p>
              <p class="miccontenttext">Our officers shouted at the man in English and Mandarin to put down the chopper, but he ignored the warning and continued advancing towards the officers with the chopper in his right hand. One of the officers then drew his revolver and fired a shot. A scuffle ensued which resulted in our officers subduing the man and placing him under arrest.</p>
              <p class="miccontenttext">No one was injured, apart from one of the officers who suffered minor abrasions on his arm. Police are investigating the matter.</p>

              <p>Nosense. It's never a justification for a policeman to shoot and kill a man holding a knife. Why didn't the policeman shoot his shoulder?</p>

              <p><br>ok, intention to disarm or intention to kill, one point to note.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the other, richochet effects are tremendous. a warning shot to any object other than the suspect would be deemed dangerous to the members of public. a gas leak or like what others said, debris, may injure the members of public. besides, the worst case scenario is that the ricochet affects the member of public, suspect fatally stabs PO, PO dies, suspect stabs more people and goes postal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>a shot to the body, considering suspect is charging, limbs move faster, body position stays consistent. a miss would mean someone would get injure, other than the suspect.a shot at such a small reaction time frame is justified due to the course in which the torso is the main area in which the PO should target to prevent further harm to the POs, the members of public and the wellbeing of everyone around there, including the suspect. what to do? the shot hit the vital organ(heart?), he is plain unlucky he died, bt an aim to the torso would include vital organs. thats what you get for charging with a weapon. he would most probably been hanged for his deed(murder) and death by police is due to his impulsive nature which caused the PO to intervene.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>POs have a gun for something, to disarm suspects during dangerous times. as such, this is such a time in which it was in an urban area with many people, therefore, an aim out of range of the suspect would jeopardize the safety of others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> lets talk about probability,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the probability of a ricochet would be high, and if PO does not hit the suspect, the probability of being harmed increases by the miliseconds.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the probability of shooting a limb MIGHT deter the advance of the suspect but there is a chance he may still proceed, heard of the mentally unstable guy who had 4 shots before he dropped?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the probability of STOPPING THE ADVANCE OF THE SUSPECT would be highest in the event of taking a shot to the torso.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>therefore, i say it is justified, once again.</p>

              <p>OK!. Based on the report he fired a shot and hit the ground (floor), still before he decide to fire he would have considered his target, the surrounding and the line of fire. This case he has the time, remember he went back to get the shield, and approach a second time.</p>
