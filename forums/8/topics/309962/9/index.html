              <p><br>tmd u think the policeman got the chance to choose where to shoot isit? Imagine u were him in tht situation la.</p>
              <p>A person chiong towards u with a 20cm long knife,he was just a few feets away from u. By the time u take out ur gun,he would be like what,10cm away from u? During tht period u think u have time to aim where to shoot meh?</p>
              <p>And fyi,for a normal person to pull the trigger,it would take 1 sec +. Becos the hand need to send a signal to the brain the action to pull the trigger</p>

              <p>P226 is not easy to shoot ar...Last time we stand 15m from a stationary target which is of human size and we are asked to shoot. Walao can miss one ar. I can hit about 35/50 shots. The passing mark is 25/50 shots and a sizeable amount of people actually fail the pistol test.</p>
              <p>15m is 1.5 times the length of a shuttle run nia also can miss sia. But better than carrying bow and arrow la. so heavy. My hit rate for bow and arrow is probably even worse.</p>

              <p><br>You already said accused.</p>
              <p>Since when does an accused become a convict?</p>
              <p>If the police can be a judge, jury and executioner.</p>
              <p>Why bother to have a judicial system?</p>
              <p>I guess in Singapore's case, if you are accused of something</p>
              <p>you are already a convict.</p>

              <p>Guilty till proven innocent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The duty of the police is to apprehend leh, let the courts decide based on evidence given.</p>
              <p>For all we know, the man could have some mental problems, all that is needed is to lock him up in a mental institution.</p>
              <p>If you think that all mad person should be shot dead, then maybe you can start at Woodbridge Hospital.</p>

              <p>situation 1.</p>
              <p>Person takes a knife and run towards a police officer. Police officer draws revolver. Warns Person. Person still charge towards Police Officer, Police Officer aims for the leg and shoot. Hits the Person at 3meters away. But Person still charges towards Police Officer, Officer aims the 2nd leg and fires again, This time, the person is just a few cm away, he fell and stabbed onto the officer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Situation 1A.</p>
              <p>Person takes a knife and run towards a police officer. Police officer draws revolver. Warns Person. Person still charge towards Police Officer, Police Officer aims for the leg and shoot. Bullet misses the person and ricochet off the floor, injuring a group of member of public, he aims the 2nd and shoot. This time it hit the target. But person is too near the to the officer, he stabbed the officer</p>
              <p>Situation 1B</p>
              <p>Person takes a knife and run towards a police officer. Police officer draws revolver. Warns Person. Person still charge towards Police Officer, Police Officer aims for the leg and shoot. Bullet misses the person and ricochet off the floor, injuring a group of member of public, he aims the 2nd and shoot. This time it missess again. and it ricochet to hit another group of member of public. the person charged and stabbed the officer.</p>
              <p>You must SHOOT to DISARM. and how 2 DISARM? U must shoot the PERSON.</p>
              <p>The HIGHEST PROBABILITY OF SHOOTING THE PERSON is to AIM THE BODY.</p>
              <p>WHEN u play counter strike or any shooting games, dun tell me u aim for their hands n legs.</p>
              <p>when u aim the BODY, the risk of hitting any vital organs is confirm HIGHER, but what is ur objective? IT IS TO DISARM THE PERSON.</p>

              <p>The duty of the police is to apprehend leh, let the courts decide based on evidence given.</p>
              <p>For all we know, the man could have some mental problems, all that is needed is to lock him up in a mental institution.</p>
              <p>If you think that all mad person should be shot dead, then maybe you can start at Woodbridge Hospital.</p>

              <p>"It's never a justification for a policeman to shoot and kill a man holding a knife."</p>
              <p>I guess its all right with you then to shoot and wound a man holding a knife.</p>
              <p>When a PO shoots, I don't think he know if the shot would kill or wound. There are several vital points in the body that would be fatal if hit. The heart for sure. The brain maybe fatal. The chest, when the lungs is punctured, maybe. The neck is fatal, particular if the juggular vein is severed. The stomach, abdomen might be fatal, particular if the liver is punctured by a spinning bullet. Than again the bullet may hit a bone and ricochet towards a vital point. There is also the possibility that the PO wants to kill, and aims for the heart, but misses the organ by a mere half cm, the person would survive. There are people who have receive multiple gunshot wounds and survive. And also as in this case, one shot, and he is dead.</p>
              <p>Why don't he give warning shots, shoot his legs, his arms, his little toe, and now his shoulders, its easy to critise.</p>
              <p>I say in this incident, the PO is justified in shooting the suspect, and just too bad the fella died.</p>
