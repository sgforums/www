              <p>The guy probably knew his fate, considering he had only a 15cm knife Vs 2x SPF officers each armed with a service revolver. Seriously, what was he expecting? That SPF trained to use revolvers but carry for show only meh? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And to the poster who suggested shooting at limbs, consider this: limbs present a much smaller target, they are in constant motion towards the officer. Body on the other hand (no pun intended) is 1 big target and remains much more constant. If the round had missed, likelihood is A) hit random ah pek taking train or 2) ricochet off the floor/wall and hit some random ah lian taking train.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The fact the the SPF officer even had the wits to draw and fire, all things considered, shows that staying in SG, you can sleep in peace since SPF has well trained personnel patrolling the streets.</p>

              <p>i think those who think the policeman should have done otherwise are having the thoughts that perhaps there were other means of subduing the suspect since he was only armed with a knife and not a firearm which will pose a more immediate threat. afterall a life is lost in the process.</p>

              <p>Wait, that person shot was a suspect at that time. So killing him might be
              worse thing that one could have done if he is innocent. That is why, in the
              news, they added this very important detail “the suspect is seen charging at
              the police waving his knife" Like all news, always take it with a pinch of
              salt. They are after all news they want us to hear. Who knows, it could jolly
              well b a cover up.</p>
              <p>Once heard a similar new, about some suspect charging at the police and
              ended shot. But the funny thing is the bullet enters the suspect from his back,
              exiting his chest.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am not trying to imply anything but just to keep an open mind.</p>

              <p>Anyone who fired a pistol will know that firing at a moving target is hard, not to say aiming at his limbs which are damn small and moving at a faster rate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If they miss, they will have to fire another shot again, that means tons of reports to write.. but what's worse is that if the PO miss, the guy would have already stabbed the PO.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm pretty sure verbal warnings are given to the attacker before the PO shot him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The PO did the right thing by firing at the attacker. Yes, I know the police are trained in unarmed combat, but they don't practice it everyday, so trying to defend against a armed attacker with bare hands will be one of the dumbest move the PO can do.</p>

              <p>Just a question, are policemen taught unarmed combat?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't get me wrong, I'm not doubting the event here and not gonna say that the policeman was wrong to shoot or something like that. Just want to discuss on some stuff.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Could</span> he have use unarmed combat on that guy? 43 year old, unless the guy looks fierce and skilled with the knife hahas.. And if I'm not wrong, there were 2 policeman..</p>
              <p>It was at close range right? So I guess to aim and shoot the bugger in the legs or some other body parts just to immobilise the guy and put him out of the capacity to put anyone in danger, is not possible? Or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">could</span> the policeman have done so? Or perhaps the chest was a bigger surface area to aim at haha..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps, in such a given situation, all theories learnt goes down the drain and basic human instinct to survive kicks in for the policeman. I don't know what you guys think? Luckily the policeman never miss sia his shot..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just some space for discussions, those who want to flame, I will ignore.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hmm i really doubt they will even think of using unarmed combat on the guy especially when he was charging at them. Considering that they suspected he was involved in a murder half an hour before. I wouldn't want to take any chances..</p></div>

              <p>What if the police miss? there is load of ppl behind. Then again, how was this picture taken?</p>
              <p>From CCTV? but cctv are black and white mostly. Dun tell me it is from someone HP. so the police was there shouting stop dun run, rise ur hand with his gun drawn... then this photographer 1st instinct was to take his HP out to take picture??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"></p>
              <p>The picture is taken a few sec after that guy drop form the shot rite? else why no blood yet. and the police gun held high.....</p>
