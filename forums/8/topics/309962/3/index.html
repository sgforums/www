              <p>If react out of self-defence with no time to give warning, use of force will be justified. Apparently, the suspect might have been armed and dangerous.</p>
              <p>However, if the policeman fired multiple shots, then I think he'd have a lot of answering to do.</p>
              <p>Give another moment to hesitate when a man pounce at you and you'll be dead if the suspect did have a weapon in hand.</p>

              <p>i heard tat it's by chance the police were there when they saw e suspect. they din noe he killed a guy earlier on. wanted to spot check him cuz he was very suspicious looking. lols. and so 'heng' sia e guy. but i still feel that e police shldn't have shot the man's chest. i believe they in spf hav learn alot of self defence skills. besides, it's a knife tat he's holding, not a gun. the police could have easily brought him under control if they have right defence skills. or if there's really a need to fire, it should be at the lower part of the body.</p>

              <p><br>Dun agree with you.</p>
              <p>There is no rule that you can use gun when your enemy have gun.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Self Defence, the Policeman can defend himself. Then fight for how long? Then the suspect finds that he can't kill the Police Officer, he goes for a member of public (public place) who is not trained. Hold hostage and etc...dun waste time and risk other ppl life. The Police officer acted correctly by not being 'Steven Seagal'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lowert part of the body? why some have the idea of shooting ppl at the lower part of the body?? shoot his balls off? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>So long as he does not die, he lives to kill another person. He has killed one, already death sentence. So why not try to kill more, probably police or prison officers, while waiting to be hanged.    </p>

              <p><br>Dun agree with you.</p>
              <p>There is no rule that you can use gun when your enemy have gun.</p>

              <p>Self Defence, the Policeman can defend himself. Then fight for how long? Then the suspect finds that he can't kill the Police Officer, he goes for a member of public (public place) who is not trained. Hold hostage and etc...dun waste time and risk other ppl life. The Police officer acted correctly by not being 'Steven Seagal'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lowert part of the body? why some have the idea of shooting ppl at the lower part of the body?? shoot his balls off? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>So long as he does not die, he lives to kill another person. He has killed one, already death sentence. So why not try to kill more, probably police or prison officers, while waiting to be hanged.    </p>

              <p>Well...considering that the cop only fired one shot.Are people
              in the SPF taught to do double tap?Cuz in such a life-threatening
              situation, 2 shots are better den 1. But also wondering, why no
