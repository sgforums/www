              <p>Not that we take it for granted, but the .38 bullets generally do not over-penetrate a human body.  Rounds such as these are made to transfer as much kinetic energy to the body as possible.  IIRC, thats also known as "stopping power."  A person hit by it, will stop.</p>
              <p>The average Singaporean Policeman spends about 2 years in training, or at least so claimed MM Lee.  I'm sure they are more than aware of innoncent bystanders when they actually have to draw their weapon and fire.</p>

              <p><br>i thought he was armed with a knife. imagine you are being attacked by a man with a knife at a short distance. would you have time to think what you should and not do? of course natural reaction is to protect yourself first. its human nature. if the armed attacker is of far distance( is to be judged by personal opinion), then he can aim his leg or arm, or whatsoever.</p>
              <p>if the victim think so much, he may be the one lying there liao.</p>

              <p>yeah lor, I wonder why the policeman did not shoot at that guy's little toe. That would guarantee to have that man hopping around. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
              <p>If I am not wrong, our policemens' revolvers don't shoot like cowboy guns. I think they need to firstn squeeze the trigger, to cock the weapon, then squeeze again to fire. When they decide to shoot, they got to do it quick. They cannot panic and fumble, or they be the one that's dead. Then we'll be saying "He got gun what, why never shoot!"</p>
              <p>Singapore no more warning shots, highrise flats, built up area, dense population, enclose space, etc., now only loud verbal warning. And if the suspect charges, even with a toy knife, or iron pipe, he had it. His best chance is to run away from the policeman, they will not shoot.</p>

              <p>i strongly agree. it is not up to us 3rd party to analyse how the 'victim' should react. you can see as nothing dangerous, but to the victim, it could meant life and death at that point of time.</p>
              <p>it is like a teacher who trying to educate the student, ended up being complained about his method. we should not ever jump to conclusions as to who is wrong and right. 3rd party has no right to judge. we are not even there!!</p>

              <p>really? (not trying to be sarcastic) but i think perhaps they don't want to release anything to the public? maybe only the related ones know what happened? otherwise, maybe those incidents happened at raised platform stations which are older compared to NEL where there is better coverage.</p>

              <p>Remember that they say they are upgrading them to recordable ones, after the  non recordable ones are made public. Also they using the terrorist bombings in UK as excuse to install lots and lots more cameras all over the country.</p>

              <p>Why dun u ask, why must that guy charge at the police with a knife? But then again, i wasnt there to see if what was claim is true. Thing have a way of being told in favour of the one still alive since the suspect is dead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for shooting the leg, .... hmmm let role play what is going on in the mind of the police; What if, I miss? What if I hit him but he carry on and stab me, killing me? What if I miss and hit someone else? What if this was another guy that happen to look like he is charging my way with a packet of tissue? There can be 1000 "what if" but I only have a split sec to choose,fight or flight, his life or mine.</p>
