              <p>hello!</p>
              <p>I just graduated from Ngee Ann Poly Mass Communications and thinking of doing a degree programme right here in Singapore. But the problem is i m having a dilemma. Which is a better school? MDIS or SMa? SMa offers a double degree in either PR, Journalism and some new media thingy n it is under Murdoch Uni. While MDIS is under Oklahoma State Uni, and at the end of my course, i need to go the their US campus for a mth to take 3 modules there.</p>
              <p>I was wondering if anyone could share their experience in either school and stuff? thanks!</p>

              <p>go SMa no need hesitate. i m currently doin my degree in Mass Comm wif them n i hav to say i m pretty impressed so far. there were glitches in the admin but hey, which offshore degree program has no admin problems? at least SMa rectify any problems asap, with proper comm procedures. n they have student consultants for individuals. my class had quite a no. of students who switched from MDIS due to its poor admin. IMO MDIS is super overrated bcos of their advertising and visibility in media like radio n newspapers.</p>
              <p>in terms of recognition, i guess all overseas degrees r the same, apart from ur Harvards and Oxfords etc.</p>

              <p>i was from mdis and have switched over to SMa. admission wise, both are equally problematic. but at least the SMa side got back to me asap even though they can't rectify the problem at that moment.</p>
              <p>personally, i feel that y are they so prompt is cuz they have just started this so-called international study centre at their current 'campus' and have to wayang to others.</p>
              <p>as for the scheduling of classes, i personally feel that MDIS is a little better than SMa. if there are any make up classes for SMa, it will be on Saturdays and i do not like to burn my weekends. at least for MDIS, they will arrange it to be on a weekday. that's all for now. shall update as and when i go along.</p>
