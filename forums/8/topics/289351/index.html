            <div class='col-md body'>in a bit of a situation here. hope can get opinions from you guys!<br><br>ok im currently in my last semester in uni, which is finishing in december. so i'm actively looking to secure a job before my graduation.<br><br>so the situation is there's this Company A who told me that im selected. however, due to me not graduated they did not really make me any offer yet. so up to now everything is just a verbal agreement.<br><br>however, they did tell me they will make me a provisional offer. but its been a few weeks already and there's still no concrete offer yet. i did called them up a few days ago but they just told me the same thing, that they will get back to me with the provisional offer.<br><br>then there's this Company B, who i went for interview lately, and they seem pretty interested to make me an offer. the interviewer was really positive and she told me that an offer will be coming up pretty soon.<br><br>now comes the hard part. Should i accept Company B's offer when it comes or should i keep faith with Company A's promises?<br><br>im actually more inclined to work with Company A but until now they are unable to make me a concrete offer and this sort of makes me feel insecure. im afraid if i reject Comapny B, i might end up with nothing in the end.<br><br>what would you do?</div>
