              <p>Ever since the beginning of humanity, which is dated 6,000 years ago, there have always been sightings and documents about unknown objects that can travel very quickly. All through out time, there have been numerous and various sources that indicate such a thing may be existent.</p>
              <p>For example, every prehistoric and historic writing (religions and such) contained documents, pictures or writings, about UFOs. They even portrayed the 'visitors' as 'ancient astronauts', and there were monuments displaying the ancient astronauts' figures.</p>
              <p>Also, lots of governments around the world have been revealing astounding truth about their UFO files. For example, the Mexican government revealed a mysterious UFO tape that can be found easily on the internet. The British government recently disclosed secret documents about their own intelligience about UFO's. Different countries such as China, Japan, Brazil, and even Canada have experienced former government workers announce that UFO's are real and need to be taken seriously all over the world.</p>
              <p>Nowadays...</p>
              <p>6% of the world publicly claim to have sighted one or more UFO's</p>
              <p>2-4% of the world claim to have experienced a UFO abduction</p>
              <p>About the 6% of global UFO sightings, 75% of them turned out to be probable, after tiresome and exhaustive scientist investigation</p>
              <p>And don't forget those thousands of UFO whistle-blowers who have showed solid proof of UFO's and a government UFO cover-up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This forum is for anybody to share any information or opinions. I ask for anybody to post informing videos about this subject, and everybody is welcome.</p>
              <p>(Just do not be mean to each other)</p>

              <p>I see your point, arapahoe.</p>
              <p>But the reason why I take the subject of UFO's is not because of the statistics. It is actually the numerous ex-government agents from many different countries who show lots of proof about it. For example, Paul Hellyer, the ex-Canadian politician ( he was a pleasant person) who actually made a huge speech saying that UFO's definitely exist and that the powerful governments of Earth have been hiding numerous things.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you can, type in 'UFO Paul Hellyer' on youtube, and you will find his famous 8 minute speech there.</p>
              <p>What do you think?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S.</p>
              <p>The UFO's in those pictures are assorted, but some UFO's have been sighted by whole cities. Such as the triangular-shaped UFO many years ago that the whole city saw in Belgium.</p>

              Let me tell you my logic and it's really simple.
              
              1) The UFO only fly around, they never communicate with humans therefore can conclude they do not want us to know they are around.
              
              2) If they have the god damn technology to fly to Earth in that flying saucer, why do they even have to on their lights sometimes to let some people spot them... can't they see in the dark by using abit of technology? again, if they have the technology... would they fly around like a comet and let everyone know they are there?
              
              Again! If they could fly here, what makes you think they need to come so close to Earth to do an analysis on Earth? Humans here can observe and analyse other far-away planets without having to fly down there

              <p>2) Who knows, skali they have their own standards of having lights on space-crafts like how we have on our air-crafts..Wot does seeing in the dark have anything to do with flashing some lights? Again, why wouldn't they?</p>
              <p>If they could why not? Humans ourselves would love to travel to other planets to witness others ourselves instead of sending robots or use telescopes..</p>

              <p>I see your point, arapahoe.</p>
              <p>But the reason why I take the subject of UFO's is not because of the statistics. It is actually the numerous ex-government agents from many different countries who show lots of proof about it. For example, Paul Hellyer, the ex-Canadian politician ( he was a pleasant person) who actually made a huge speech saying that UFO's definitely exist and that the powerful governments of Earth have been hiding numerous things.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you can, type in 'UFO Paul Hellyer' on youtube, and you will find his famous 8 minute speech there.</p>
              <p>What do you think?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S.</p>
              <p>The UFO's in those pictures are assorted, but some UFO's have been sighted by whole cities. Such as the triangular-shaped UFO many years ago that the whole city saw in Belgium.</p>

              <p>i think you have to look at Nasa footage there is one really unexplained. But recently there is a movement gaining strenght from retired airforce personnel to press President Obama to release documents on UFO.</p>
              <p>But do check on Nasa footage. There is one that's worth taking serious study. but do not confuse by all the space debris.</p>

              <p>there is one effect that needs to take into consideration. when your mind cannot determine distance it create - Ponzo illusion.</p>
              <p>If you have the opportunity go try this out.  (i experienced it; is freaking fun)</p>
              <p>Travel to a desert dirt road where visible horizontal plane can be observed .....make sure there are no human habitate around. When it get pitch dark and no moon light; start driving. Now at a far distance have only 1 car coming your direction. The light from the car will project a round light. But because we have no visible reference point we therefore cannot judge the distance. But this light presumably travel towards you on the same path. The light  move irregularly up down left right because path is not even.</p>
              <p>In any case i experience the irregular light for a good 30 minutes until we drove pass each other. Mind you I am driving at close to 100Km/h in pitch dark environment.   So i was guessing for the last 30 minutes what was that light......</p>

              <p><strong>Fantagf</strong>: I know what you are saying, but there are actually voluminous information on UFO's. For example, 11% of the US says the saw a UFO. Also, look at all the ex-government whistleblowers who say that various government groups have had contact, for example the renegade factions of the CIA.</p>
              <p><strong>MyPictureBook</strong>: I see your point. But, there have been a great effort by government inteligiences to mesmerize and condition the public into ridiculing the subject of UFO's. Obviously, that has really worked, when observing some of the people who replied to this topic.</p>
              <p>Actually, a great number of ex-politicians have volunteered to even swear in front of the American Congress that some governments like the US are truly in contact with ET's.</p>
              <p><strong>Deino</strong>: You make some very good points. I agree with you, what you say is right according to lots of sources of mine.</p>
              <p><strong>Angel7030</strong>: You said 'UFO ice cream' hahahaha! Still, we want to see your true opinion please, not a silly joke.</p>
              <p><strong>Stomp661</strong>: I understand you, but I'm sure even you'll be more interested if you do some profound and insightful research.</p>
              <p><strong>Fatum</strong>: Funny picture, but the only people who should wear "tin-foil hats" are the people who ridicule subjects they fear and feel uncomfortable with.</p>
              <p><strong>Arapahoe</strong>: I think that you are very good because you express your own unique information and experiences, but do not think the only UFO sightings are those that only one human being saw or photographed. There have been times such as in Belgium  about two years ago in which a huge, visible, triangular-shaped UFO was seen hovering over the Earth. And every single person in the city saw it. It was visible, clear, and even photographed. It also reached the newspapers at that time. Unfortunately, now, we humans have degenerated and devolved into a weaker society that likes to ridicule what they fear.</p>
              <p>Humanity fears the unknown. Do not listen to stupid movies with 'monster' aliens, otherwise that will put in a manipulated vibration of fear and disorientation.</p>

              <p>Indianapolis News Channel 8 released a video taken of St. Peter’s Basilica in Vatican City showing what appeared to be an unidentified flying object moving across the upper left portion of the screen. The video, taken from a network feed camera at around 6:00 am Roman time, was filmed as Pope John Paul II lay in state.</p>
              <p>In light of these mysterious quotations, it makes me wonder - what does the Vatican know that we don’t?</p>
              <p>My all time favourite UFO Sighting.......while the attempted to code message of science vs religion but UFO....amazing perharps one cannot ignore the possibilities that our collectives unconsious already encrypted with UFO.</p>
              <p>The question is how..........?</p>

              <p>The <strong>collective unconscious</strong> is a universal datum, that is every human being is endowed with this psychic archetype-layer since his/her birth. We may also describe it as a universal library of human patterns of behavior, or the <a href="/forums/8/topics/glossary.html#Wise_old_man"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,Times NewRoman; color: #0066cc;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sage</span></span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,Times NewRoman;"> in man, the very transcendental wisdom that guides mankind.
