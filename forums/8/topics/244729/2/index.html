It wasn't written on blog but on our sch diary. Much worse because the whole class could read about it. But the problem was, I didn't offend anyone. This particular kid felt threatened because all the attention was on me. I ignored the whole thing because I couldn't be bothered with this jealous kind of people. In the end, that kid gave up and apologized (indirectly).<br><br>You know what? This kind of people have too much time on their hands. If they are mature enough, they should keep things to themselves or talk things out with you but seems like this girl just wants to get attention. Unfortunately, you can't do much about it because it's her own blog and she can write whatever she wants. All you can do now is not to think too much about her. Don't bother with her blog. If you need some moral support, you should seek help from your trusted friends, parents or teachers. Good luck.<br><br></div>

Exactly! And I wrote some sh|t bout her in my blog too.. but it wasnt for her to read.. Just for my pals.. And as my outlet.. But she found my blog somehow..  I dont noe wat'll happen when school starts.. but i dont really care.. it wasnt meant for her eyes anyway.<br><br>So yeah.. My advice is... such people arent worth ure time so dont bother. Insecure people put others down to feel better bout themselves.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>And friends dont try to hurt eachother. She isnt a friend. True friends are there for you and help you along not kick u when ure down.</div>
