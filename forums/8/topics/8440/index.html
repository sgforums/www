            <div class='col-md body'>singlish only benefits those who already have a solid grasp of the english language. it's an illusion that one can switch with ease between the two forms of spoken language if they don't even have a good foundation in standard english. by persisting or continuing to speak in singlish because they're comfortable with it, they're just harming themselves in the process.<br><br>i've been told countless times that i don't speak like a local, that my english is too proper, too uptight and so to accommodate friends and to make them feel comfortable, i do speak singlish, i don't deny that it's really fun and at the risk of sounding really arrogant, i can switch between the two with ease as my foundation in standard english is pretty okay. most caucasians whom i've come into contact with have no problems understanding me when i speak that "uptight" english and vice versa. however, my favourite choice of spoken language is mandarin.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>just an additional opinion, speaking singlish all the time or most of the time does corrupt one's standard of proper english over time, so it's best to use singlish sparsely if one wishes to retain one's standard in the english language.<br><br>[This message has been edited by ingÃ©nue (edited 25 July 2000).]</div>
