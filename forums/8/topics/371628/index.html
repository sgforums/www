            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hey, would like to ask everyone for an opinion. If you're given a choice to study in University of Melbourne and Monash University ONLY in Australia, which one do you think is the best to pursue for your Commerce degree? Many say that MonashU gives you more hands on work which is closely related to the real working society, but based on ranking, it is much lower compared to Melbourne University. However, UniMelb is known for arts faculty and Commerce is part of it. It is more well-known, prestigious and recognised. Would like to hear from you guys for advice. Thanks!</p></div>

              <p>Hello,</p>
              <p>Personally, I would choose University of Melbourne as opposed to Monash University.</p>
              <p>As you have already mentioned, University of Melbourne is undoubtedly much more well-known and prestigious. However, I have heard before that Monash University is rigourous and companies recognise that. Hence, a degree at Monash University may be an advantage. I am not sure whether a company would choose a degree from University of Melbourne or Monash University since one is more prestigious and another more rigourous.</p>
              <p>Have you taken a look at the campuses? University of Melbourne is a beautiful campus in the city. The buildings are similar to Victorian architectural style (buildings in the 1850s) whereas the campus of Monash University is modernised. University of Melbourne is undoubtedly a more conducive campus to study in.</p>
              <p>Anyway, which University are you leaning on?</p>

              <p>during my stint in Monash (which was over 15 years ago), i was taught by almost ALL who were professionals in the field..</p>
              <p>they had very few acaedamics in the Caulfield Campus..</p>
              <p>there were boring practicing accountants with spreadsheets, flamboyant mathematicians teaching us statistics, scary solicitors scaring the bejezus out of us during contract law, CEOs on strategic management..</p>
              <p>the only one who were acaedamics were those who taught us microeconomics and macroeconomics.. and they dabbled in the outside world with consultant jobs to corporations..</p>
              <p>my friends from Melbourne Uni at that time said their professors were mostly acaedamics...</p>
              <p>since you're there, go do your own market research..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>p.s. since this popped up again.. remember.. when abroad, use the time to live like the people there, mix around and learn about their culture and everything... go on road trips, see the sights, experience what it is like living (not visiting) a foreign land... this is an education in itself which is not to be mistaken for the piece of paper you're getting</p>

              <p>NSW is not bad too, but poll 9 out of 10 people on which they think is the best university in Australia they will say Uni of Melbourne or ANU. <strong>Reputation</strong> before anything else. That is the truest thing to say about education and value of your degree in the marketplace.</p>

              <p>For me,</p>
              <p>I'd say Melb Uni.</p>
              <p>well, ima student in yr 12 this year, Im studying in Sydney, and im also looking around Unis. Half my family lives in Melb, so i travel to and fro quite frequently.</p>
              <p>Seriously, Melb Uni is better than Monash. and it also depends on which campus you are at and where you stay.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Eg, If you stay somewhere along flinders st or Swanston St, then its much more practical to go to melb uni,(bleh, many trams head towards melb uni from there). + the rep of Melb uni is much better, just by taking a look at the ENTER scores, ( i think, or isit called ATAR, cause its supposed to be standardised this yr).</p>
              <p>If im not wrong Monash Uni is in the outskirts of the city. Just slightly more than an 30mins to reach from Melb central.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>eg. for medical sciences in Melb Uni, ENTER req is approx 99.5~99.95</p>
              <p>- which only the top 0.05% of the students sitting for a VCE that year will qualify for.</p>
              <p>Whereas for Monash Uni,</p>
              <p>for the same course of Med sciences, its about 84~85 ENTER.</p>
              <p>Note: where a difference of 1 ENTER point represents a shift of an approx 1000 places.</p>
              <p>I understand that as you've stated, you want to pursue Commerce. The differences in ENTER for your preferred course choice is about there as well.</p>
              <p>Well, ENTER scores basically reflects the demand of the course, and a low ENTER means that the course is low in demand.</p>
              <p>therefore, if no one wants to go to a certain Uni which is unpopular, why would you?   ( in this case, im comparing it between the ENTER scores for universities).</p>
              <p>So its a direct interpretation that Melb Uni IS better than Monash, and they DO get the better students there.</p>
              <p>Well,</p>
              <p>correct me if im wrong, but certain courses in Monash Uni are not recognised by certain countries like the UK, whereas for Melb, it is. yep.</p>
              <p>thats what i think.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All the best!</p>
