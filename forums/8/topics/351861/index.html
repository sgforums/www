              <div class="snippet" style="line-height: 1.2em;">Meanwhile, the metal shutter at an underpass linking Suntec <strong>City</strong> to CityLink <strong>Mall</strong> came down, effectively cutting off access. A woman caught in the crush <strong>...</strong></div>

              <p> </p>
              <p>You know what really caused the congestion not reported in the papers?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The damned stupid security guards.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One of them was carrying a loud speaker, an Indian man.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The underground City Link Mall has four entrances. Suntec, Raffles MRT, Esplanade and at the middle an entrance/exit in the building next to Marina Square.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the IT show on, and the rain, of course you will find lots of people underground. There were no problems until some idiot security guards decided that there were too many people and CAUSED THE CONGESTION.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So what should they have done? The should have stopped people going into the underground from the exits and letting people out only or at least let people in by batches.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What did the idiot security guards do instead? The put up barriers, baracades right in the middel of the underground link and tried to force people to go out through the exit at the building next to marina square in the middle.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>WTF!!! People are coming in relentlessly from the various entrances and all of them were forced to go out through one small exit and they can't go over to the other side because of the barracade.</p>

              <p>When you go out through the exit that leads to nowhere, you were faced with pouring ran.</p>
              <p>So people got really fed up and went back down into the underground.</p>
              <p>Those that want to proceed to suntec, went back down on the right (steps, escalators) and squeezed along the wall for about 50 meters and after 50 meters there was no congestion.</p>
              <p>Those that wanted to go to Esplanade/Raffles MRT went down on the left, and squeezed along the wall for about 50 meters and after 50 meters there was no congestion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There was no congestion after 50 meters!!!!</p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The 100 meters congestion at the entrance/exit in the middle at the building next top Marina was caused by the damned stupid security guards putting up barracades to force people to go out through the middle exit.</span></span></p>
