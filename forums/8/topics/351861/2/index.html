              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What I was most angry about was that they CAUSED the congestion and confusion.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">What the hell were they thinking of when they choked off the tunnel full of people, in the middle of the tunnel, by erecting barriers inside the middle of a tunnel full of people and with people still coming in from the entrances?</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">If they wanted to stop people from going inside the tunnel, hello, you stop people at the entrances, not erect barriers in the middle of the tunnel.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The second thing I was most disgusted with was that the media as far as I can see, did not say anything about the real CAUSE and simply blame it on the IT show.</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Let me repeat. They let people into the tunnel. At the middle of the tunnel, they setup barricades on the right side (effectively closing half the tunnel, the other half, on the left side, congested with people) causing a huge congestion forcing people to go out through the exit on the left.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why is that stupid? They should simply stop people from coming into the tunnel, not let them in and then stop them from going to the other side by blocking their way causing a huge congestion.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The barricades created a bottleneck and people were still coming into the tunnel, innocently, only to be stopped in the middle that is choked.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">I was not at the entrance/exit where they down the shutter... you are right, it is such a ridiculous thing to do, to trap people inside the tunnel! Outside, people can spread out, but inside the tunnel there is no where to go.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">That means that those that found the middle congested as a result of the barrier they put up, walked back to the entrance at Suntec and found the exit shuttered.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Damned stupid security guards. Old People and Young children could have died as a result of their stupidity.</span></p>
