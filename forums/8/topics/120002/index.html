            <div class='col-md body'>Personally I know two of them.  One of them is doing fine.  But the other.... not so good.<br><br>The first one is a relative of mine.  Quite young.  I mean, too young to have the attack, in my opinion.  I always thought that cardiovascular sickness only affects old ppl.  Somemore this relative of mine lives a very healthy life.  He used to smoke.  But quit for dunno how many years liao.  I think about 10 years liao until he got the attack.  He doesn't take any fatty food.  Exercise 4 times a week, usually at gym or jog downstairs.  Once a week take vegetarian food.<br><br>Very healthy right?  But one day, in the midst of his usual jogging session, he felt a severe chest pain.  He felt like throwing up, but couldn't.  He could not breathe well .    He quickly rushed home and told his spouse to send him to the hospital.  His spouse at first thought he was just panting after jogging too much.  But still drove him to a nearby GH.  The doc diagnosed that it was a heart attack.  One blood vessel was blocked.  After the op, part of the heart was already damaged due to insufficient blood flow.  He is right now doing fine, but still needs to go for consult check up.<br><br>The second one was my friend's husband.  He worked in a highly stressed environment and smoked a lot, mostly to relieve the stress.  No exercise, cuz no time.<br><br>One day, while my friend, her husband and the children were at home, her kid suddenly went to the kitchen to tell her that the father was panting.  My friend's husband refused to go to the hospital cuz he was concerned that if both adults were away, nobody would take care of the kids.  He thought he could just rest and the pain would go away.  That was before dinner time.  He was in pain for a few hours.  It was only late at night, probably past midnight, that he couldn't take the pain anymore and his wife, my friend brought him to the hospital.  The doctor diagnoised that three of the vessels were blocked and he has no confident that my friend's spouse could survive thru.  But he did survive after the op.  However, the nightmare is not over.  His heart is so damaged that he had to constantly take a lot alot of pills every day to sustain his life.  He was only 36 while he was having the attack.  Recently the doc found out that his heart has started bleeding.  It's a matter of time that he gets a relapse and dies.<br><br>My friend is now the sole breadwinner of the family.  I dunno how to make her feel better.  She has always been sounding very cheerful and positive.  But who she try to bluff?  How to be positive in this situation?  I can only pretend to believe that she is doing fine, whenever she tells me that she's ok.</div>

For 15-30 minutes each time, I could do nothing but just relax my body and mind and lay down on my office desk.<br><br>And this happened although I exercise quite a lot too.<br><br>Anyway, I've reduced my smoking, taken life easy a bit, gotten less uptight, gotten enough sleep, gotten less hot-tempered, etc.  Now, its OK.

            <div class='col-md body'>well, i still remembered a few yrs ago i went to polyclinic to see doctor cos of 'chest pain' and 'stuffiness in the chest', took ECG, all normal....sometimes i still get the pain, but after very intensive check in the net i realised dat the pain is becos the muscles between the individual rips was 'strained' or 'cramp', so to stretch the muscle i did 'cobras' lift to stretch my rib area....so far so good. the muscle strain might be caused by excercise, like benchpress....should have realised it a few yrs back so after i do benchpress, i will do a few cobra lift b4 i sleep to stretch the ripcage muscles.<br><br>but nonetheless, if u encounter sudden/sharp chest pain especially near the middle chest region, better see a polyclinic doctor ASAP to do an ECG. how much i dunno cos dat time i still sewer servant, no need to pay $ but shouldn't be too ex cos is polyclinic.</div>
