All the fireworks cues are actually coded into a digital code and it is actually overlaid onto the music that is being played during the show. In the event that our digital system fails, we have a manual voice back-up to ensure that we can still control the fireworks."<br><br>In the middle of the show, a minute of multi-coloured fireworks will burst out from the heart of the stadium during the Provost display.<br><br>About 20 props and mobile stages will be rigged with low-level fireworks, hitting as high as 20 metres.<br><br>Said Adam Tan, pyro-technician, NDP 2006, "We have quite a lot of mobile platforms, mobile staging. We needed to introduce a wireless remote firing to control the synchronised fireworks remotely. Therefore we have imported a German system, and this system works well in an environment of close proximity with a wireless device to about 500 metres."<br><br>The climax of the fireworks show is the three-minute grand finale.<br><br>The fireworks will be launched from the practice track, some 200 metres from the stadium.<br><br>They are expected to scale some 250 metres into the sky, providing a spectacular view even for those watching the fireworks away from the stadium. - CNA /ct</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yo all forumates, heres a good place i'd like to recommend u guys to view the fireworks display.<br><br>Go book a room in ritz carlton under their fireworks fiesta package. u get a bird's eye view on the whole fireworks performance.<br><br>Last sat during the Superband finals which was also the fireworks performance with the italian theme, i was at ritz carlton. Seriously i get to watch superband and the fireworks at the same time. No blockage cos the fireworks was just straight ahead of my room. No need to tilt head upwards to see also.  Took a video with my view cam if got time i'll load it up in youtube and post the links for u guys here who have missed the fireworks display on the 5th august.<br><br>Package of the fireworks fiesta includes a 1 night stay at ritz marina view ( this view is the most power view of the hotel liao.) Breakfast buffet for 2 at the hotels restaurant called Greenhouse. Service there is very good.<br><br>So those of u who wants to see the fireworks of the next coming few weeks, u can try getting a room in ritz. the price of the package is $330 with all the +++ included. feel free to ask me on any of ur questions, i'll answer u if i can.<br><br>For NDP itself u can get a room of the kallang view in ritz. u also get to see the full stadium from there.</div>

Also, we have the possibility to stop the fireworks at anytime according to what can happen during the fireworks."<br><br>His team of 12 men worked round the clock for the past week to put up the spectacular show. - CNA /ct</div>
