But that's still fine. Then when i was looking for the right size (i was alredy in the shop for ard 15 mins then), none of their staff ever offered any help. And even when i approach the staff very politely to get me the right size, from the time i spoke to her till she chuck me the shirt, there wasn't a single word from her.<br><br>And right till the point i paid for my purchases, there wasn't a single "thank you" or in fact any word from the staff.<br><br>As i observed, there are basically like 3 regular staff there- 2 malay gal who seemed more experienced and a younger boy who looked like a temp. The young boy was slightly more approachable but his 2 colleagues were just stonic and indifferent ...<br><br>The rude and somewhat weird staff there jus spoilt my entire shopping experience... at some point, i even felt like i was imposing on them! But to think back, i spend 100 plus each time i patronise to get my business wears and this is what i am getting?!<br>I dun expect SIA standard treatment but for a shop supposedly carrying a more up-market range, the customer service there is plain repulsive.</div>
