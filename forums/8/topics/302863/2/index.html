Absoutely no help was offered to any of the customers there, and any request for sizes were met with a blank, silent response from the staff.<br><br>Customer service is virtually non-existent in the shop - in fact at one point, i even felt like i was imposing on the staff. Can u imagine me as the consumer having to smile and implore politely for the staff to get me a size, and there wasn't a single word uttered by her, other than a slightly irritated look on her face.<br><br>Was i expecting too much or were the staff just having a bad day?<br><br>But thinking back, if i could get enthusiastic or at least friendly service staff at a budget clothing store or fast-food outlet for purchasing a $2 burger, I really don't see why I should be subjected such treatment at a shop where i pay a few hundred for my shirts.<br><br></div>
