Today the ruling came out.<br><br><span class="large">[b]HE LOST!  WAHAHAHAHAHAHAH</span></strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Monday, June 25, 2007; 4:18 PM<br><br><strong>The D.C. Superior Court judge who ruled that an administrative law judge deserved nothing in his $54 million lawsuit against a neighborhood dry cleaner over a pair of lost pants "chose common sense over irrationality" said the attorney who represented the Chung family, owners of Custom Cleaners.</strong><br><br>"Obviously, it's a great day for the Chungs, and honestly it's a great day for American justice," attorney Christopher Manning said at a Monday afternoon press conference outside the Chungs' store. </span> Link <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/25/AR2007062500443.html?hpid=topnews" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br><br>And what's even better, the Chungs prevailed in court against pearson's lawsuit.  Now they get to sue Pearson for the real money, all the money that the Chungs had to pay the lawyers to defend themselves against this "lawsuit" AND damages against Pearson for trying this stunt in the first place.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Keep in mind that there's a racial angle to this lawsuit.  Pearson thought he could get away with it because the Chungs were Korean (Asian) Americans and that they would never fight back! That's the image of Asians here in the States.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>great day for american justice that allowed successful sueing for unlabeled hot coffee from mac. talk about hypocrisy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

The system relies to a far greater extent than might make any of us comfortable on goodwill and the self-correcting mechanisms of the courts. Judges do have more leeway to toss frivolous or vindictive court actions than they generally take advantage of. Lots of folks have argued that this case should have been tossed early on, but when you have a smart guy like Pearson, and perhaps more important, someone for whom cost is no issue, then there really aren't a lot of brakes that can be slammed to stop the thing. Money is the crucial factor here: Ordinarily, the ability of a really ticked-off plaintiff to make life a living hell for a given merchant or other defendant is limited by the ability of the plaintiff to pay for his court action. But when the plaintiff is a lawyer who is happy to put 1,400 hours of work into a case, as Pearson says he did here, then that natural braking action becomes irrelevant.</span><br><br>here is my fav part:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Alexandria, Va.: Seriously, Pearson cried at one point? What's the story behind that?<br><br>Marc Fisher: Pearson wept twice. He was at the point in his narrative where he came back to the dry cleaners seeking to pick up his pants, only to be presented with pants that he said were not his. At the moment when he told the court about how the Chungs insisted these were indeed his pants when he was certain they were not, he seemed overwhelmed by the surreal nature of the encounter and began to weep. He had to halt the proceedings. When they resumed after a break, he again cried as he told that part of the story.<br><br>Oddly enough, Mrs. Chung broke down in tears at almost exactly the same point in her testimony.<br><br>These were very potent pants.</span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>
