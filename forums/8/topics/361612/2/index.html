              <p>A gentle reminder,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dear HDB dwellers,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please be remind that you do not have the right to purchase or so call buy a HDB flat room. You only lease from them, what you are paying only can last you 99 years, perhap only two generation the most down your family line. My advice is to buy freehold property, you will gain more on the resale market.</p>

              <p>I think you really need to compare PSF( per square foot ) price between the two types of HDB.</p>
              <p>If I am not wrong.. smaller apartments have a higher PSF cost than bigger apartments.</p>

              <p><br>Wha??? it all depend on locations and the demand of it, not really depend on PSF, u think like our private house ar?? sometime i visited fren house in Bukit Merah and Punggol is so much different, Bukit merah toilet small small, but punk sai very expensive, Punggol toilet big big and punk sai less expensive.</p>
