Rest are either too short or long.<br><br>85" of the women's lubricated or funnel or tunnel's length is 3" to 6" long. Rest are normally longer than 6".<br><br>penis is strong, if u are strong urself in ur body if u do not masturbate often &amp; have a healthy lifestyle, &amp; also sex to the extent that u do not over / Under do it.  nothing to do with race. try some korean ginseng or some other remedies to make it stronger, nothing to be ashamed of, if u shoot too quikcly, or get a girlfriend to practice for long lasting sex.<br><br>women who got a big diameter vagina before having a baby is cos of their body structure, normally the bigger a women's hips, the bigger &amp; easier for her vagina to be or to get a big diameter &amp; difficult to adjust to smaller diameter penis size. But a thin women does not confirm that she will have tight vagina either. but generally they tend to have one.<br><br>Sorry about the science lesson under this topic, but I thought girls &amp; boys who might think that caucasian are stealing our girls cos of our dick size then it's not true.<br><br>The reason is simple, caucasians boast about scoring asians &amp; tight hole, cos most of their women start Scre**** as soon as they reach puberty, &amp; western body structure &amp; skins gets loose quickly, so by the time a western girl reachs maturity, she owns a tunnel instead of a funnel &amp; since caucasian boys masturbate often too, cos they culture &amp; their doctor says it's ok, so they also have often have loose dicks compare to asian men who feel guilty after "shaking hands with sherif"  &amp; tend to do it less.<br><br>now back to topic again. both asian men &amp; women &amp; caucasian men (mostly)  caucasian women (some) tend to be with each other cos they are either tired of their race, or they want to boast around about their relationship with someone else. Or both these races think that the other race are good in bed &amp; some of the asian women simply like caucasians cos they hate themselves &amp; their race, so by becoming mixed in a caucasian culture they can get rid of that background &amp; to get their kids different from them at least.<br><br>Rencently I checked that a very high number of westerners &amp; jews in particular are adopting chinese kids from china, cos they are not having enough babies &amp; to promote their religion into the chinese world.<br>(sorry going off the topic again)<br><br>ok. more is coming, for now it;s enough.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>better life? don't make me laugh.  Most caucasian guys with asian gfs are out for a fling.  In the end, they will go back home and get a wife who shares the same identity, background and ideology.  Less those who need to depend on the asian woman to make a living.<br>In the rarer cases where both really get together, I pity their kids for losing their identity.  Just like American-Chinese, neither fully accepted nor trusted in the American society for not being a true blue American, and not accepted in the chinese society as well.<br>This is a modern world, but ancient prejudice still applies.</div>
