            <div class='col-md body'>Here is another  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><strong>Chuay Pek Lang, 23, Sarong Party Girl</strong><br><br>So bad, you know!<br>I just read in the Straits Times, got some chao ang mor journalist write that all these Asian women are flirting with ang mor men and tempting them away from their wives and children!<br>That's not true! The ang mor men are also tempting me, what.<br>It's two-way temptation.<br>I'm tempting them away from their frumpy wives with their water-retaining ankles, while they are tempting me away from typical stoner Singapore men with their boring lifestyles.<br>I also think it's very unfair to call Asian women who prefer ang mor men 'sarong party girls'.  I mean, we rarely wear sarongs.  It covers up too much.<br>People always ask me why I only want to date ang mor men.<br>It's because ang mor men treat their women with so much more respect than Asian men do.<br>Asian men are only interested in having us so that we can have children and form a family. Asian men see us only as wives. In their eyes, we are these boring, quiet, obedient and meek mice.<br>Whereas what the ang mor men see are sexy, long-haired, provocatively-dressed sirens.<br>In other words, unlike Asian men, they see us as individuals and not stereotypes.<br>That's why I'm doing whatever it takes to snag an ang mor - dressing sexily, getting tanned within an inch of skin cancer, growing long, straight hair.<br>I'm doing it so that I can retain my dignity and respect!<br>And why go out with Asian men? They always eventually have affairs with prostitutes in some foreign country, leaving their poor wives behind. Ang mor men are not like that at all!<br>Some more Asian men are not as socially sophisticated as ang mor men.<br>For example, when I'm at a bar, I can approach an ang mor man, even a stranger, anytime and they will chat with me, buy me drinks. So pleasant!<br>Whereas these Asian men are downright unpleasant - always coming up and trying to chat and buy me drinks. I mean, they're complete strangers! What do they think I am? The sleazeballs!<br>My favourite place to meet ang mor men is Boat Quay.<br>I think there is something magical and romantic there, right next to the water.<br>One of my ang mor boyfriends also believes it's some sort of magical tradition for Asian women and ang mor men to meet by the waterside.<br>He said that on every pier in every Asian country, there are always Asian women there waiting to meet ang mor men! Isn't that nice?<br>Which is why when people call me racist for preferring ang mor men, I always disagree.<br>Racist is when you think of another race as inferior, whereas I think of another race as superior.<br>Some more, there's proof that ang mors are genetically superior to Asian men.<br>I mean look at chap cheng babies. So nice looking, with big, round eyes. Not like Asian babies with their slitty, chicken eyes.<br>So how can I possibly be racist? These people, ah, all talk cock.</div>

There are typical SPG who got laid by caucasian men once and start thinking that they are one level higher than the other asians.  They will condemn men and women of their own race, without thinking that they were once swimming in the testicles of a asian man and came out from the womb of a asian woman.<br><br>I have come across one lady whose caucasian lover or husband ran away with another caucasian when she was pregnant with the ang moh's baby.  For twenty years, she single-handedly brought up the child.  Today, she is about forty, and still goes ga-ga over caucasian men.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> Dunno..? But I think some of them can cook quite well...? And in terms of GENERAL KNOWLEDGE and CULTURE, Caucasians (note. not only men...) are generally up to it...? I'm not saying that Asian guys are not good and such.... And I'm just saying GENERALLY... But it doesn't say much about individual's character though...? But by SIMPLE PROBABILITY, you should very well understand why the females choose Caucasians...? Think it's something like the same theory as why MOST men would go for pretty women....?<br><br>And one more thing to add...? YUP... Like some have mentioned in here, I don't like Asian women who goes with a Caucasian and think that she's one flair above the rest of the ASIANs.... I think such people HIT the JACKPOT BIGTIME.... &lt;- That is they SUCK BIGTIME!!! But STILL.... It's THEIR LIFE...  -_-`~ So I won't care a shit lah...
