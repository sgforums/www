            <div class='col-md body'>I think some of the arguments are quite one-sided.<br><br>In *normal* relationships, the girl only sleeps with the guy after she is sure about being together with him. She enjoys his company enuff to want to move to another level. It's usually not a case of using him as a sex machine.<br><br>People usually don't dump their partners becos of bad sex. It's the EFFECT of bad sex- you get so damn bored, you can't help it, so you start looking around. Not to say you should act on that of course.<br><br>Why do people have bad sex? It's more than a lack of foreplay or pre-mature ejaculation. The guy just doesn't know how to do it properly. It's not like in the porno VCDs where the girl screams in ectasy about everything and anything. FYI, these only act out your fantasies, they DON'T teach you how to be a better lover. Sexual satisfaction is seen from the pt of view of the guys.<br><br>Okie, how this small lesson on sex education helps.<br><br>BTW, I'm not even THINKING of dumping anybody. I'm just afraid that he'll get bored and start looking elsewhere.<br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 09-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why not take a break this Christmas or New Year? Try doing something different, book a hotel room (I wld suggest Westin, the view is shiok!), have a bath together, candlelite etc. These may sound corny but no harm trying, sortof like a getaway from the normal routine, u neber know wat a little romance may do.<br><br>Another thing, try taking the lead here, tell him wat u like and dun like. U dun have to be too direct, moan and groan a bit here and there, and he will get the idea. I believe he wants to satisfy u as well.<br><br></div>

Don't have anything comments about that.<br><br>But I do know that if a guy sucks the nipple of the girl's breasts as stimuli, she might get very turn on and even get very wet.  Yes, wet!  Trust me, I know!  Then it's really up to her to decide how she wants to be satisfied.  Either she wants you to put your "little guy" into her very wet you know where, or she might want you to get her wetter with your tongue.  Most of them prefer the tongue, only if you know what you are doing.  You should see their facial expression when they cum.  She might even screams when she cum.  Not only she will get satisfied, but your ego will get sastisfied too, since you will feel like a real man for knowing how to satisfy your woman.<br><br>Ok!

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks guys for the comments.<br><br>firewire... one of my best buds is in England. He's coming back in one or two week's time. He knows my problem and will probably help me get one if I ask. Anyway, there's nothing between both of us. He's gay.<br><br>And yup, I know about the nipples, earlobes, neck, inner thigh, clit... blah, blah blah (sorry, getting embarassed *smilez*) They make me very aroused and that's it, no more. That's the most frustrating part.<br><br>ForeVer, I've had this same problem for two years and I HAVEN'T turned so desperate yet. You make me sound like a character out of a really campy porno VCD! In fact, it's the opposite way round. I'm so frustrated, I DON'T want to do anymore of it.<br><br>Nope, my current relationship is not based on sex. We still laugh a lot together, hug, and hold hands. Been through a lot of shit together.<br><br>qhm, thanks for the recommendation. The site was educational. But are some of the photos fake? Had a good laugh over some of them. Told loverboy to take a look. He doesn't seem to happy we need outside help. Keeps saying "I don't know" when I ask him how he feels about working on our sex life.

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for all the suggestions.<br><br>Feeling much better now. Went on a shopping spree and blew a few hundred $$$ on clothes. The salesgirl keeps telling me I have a great figure and that I look good in everything, so I couldn't resist  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Seriously, girls don't dress up to impress guys. They dress up to feel good. Either that or to compete with other women. Hiak, hiak! Shopping is really therapeutic, man!<br><br>Sorry for all that crap. Okie, serious now. I've thought about it while I was shopping. Loverboy have stood by me through so many crises. Heck, we have even broke up twice. But today, we're still together,  really enjoying each other's silly jokes and little affectionate gestures. It's difficult to imagine life without him. At the end of the day, even if things don't improve, I'll still be by his side. Emotional satisfaction is much harder to come by than sexual satisfaction. Anyway, loverboy is perfectly happy with our sex life right now, so I shouldn't worry about him straying.<br><br>Yup, done it in public before. In a toilet cubicle for the diabled, one of those that's separated from the ladies/gents. Once, I asked him to accompany me to the toilet in the middle of a movie, then surprised him by pulling him into the empty female toilet for a quickie. We've also done it in the open, under the stars- at the 5th floor washing line at one of the new halls in NTU (ha, ha, Angela Shang will surely kick us out if she finds out!)<br><br>Okie, shall we wrap this up? Don't want to corrupt other young impressionable minds.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>purr:<br>a relationship does not just include sex. If the breakup is due to that reason, no point in staying together anymore. It will seems like being together is only for one purpose, that is to have sex. Anyway, not to discourage you but sales are sales, ever heard of salemans is the biggest liar? hehehe<br>I know that coz I do sales too. It's not my will but I try my best already. You hate the customer but still have to smile at him. What to do, my livelihood. But if the customer really pizz me off, I will scold them, dun bother to earn their money even if they want to buy the product.<br><br>AS for you, it's good that you and your loverboy is going well. I have gone thro' ups and downs with my gf too. Life is still bad due to pressures on her side but still within control now. The issue now comes to meeting the parents or not!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Just a gentle reminder, don't think so much about sex in the relationship. If he really loves you, he won't mind whether if you are good in bed tho it's a plus point. AS the chinese saying, to capture a man's heart is thro his stomach. I think they should change it to "thro' his pant"!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>why, bishamon? why bish?<br>coz he's God of War!!<br>But I'm a peacelover! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aiyah, Bish, I dun go into a relationship only for the sex lah! In fact, I didn't do it with all my exes. I'm not obesessed with sex. I'm concerned with the EFFECTS, if any, that bad sex will have on our relationship.<br><br>I think that for a serious relationship to work, you will have to lay bare your vulnerabilities and insecurities. There is really no place for any delusion, I feel. One day, the bubble will just burst and she'll hate you for the lies, no matter how sweet they are.<br><br>But you're right. Life is one big trade- you buy and sell everything. I'm willing to sell sexual satisfaction for emotional satisfaction.<br><br>BTW, I'm good at it *smirk* He's the one who's satisfied. I'm the one who's not.<br><br>And yup, good cooking is impt. My mum's cooking is terrible and all of us, including my dad, avoids eating at home if we can help it. There's a lot less warmth in the family becos of this, I feel.<br><br>Hey, good luck with your relationship. Meeting the parents and getting into their good books is very important. I've met his parents and his mum always talks as if she's certain we'll get married. Makes me feel weird. If we ever break up, I suspect she'll blame me. A bit scary, huh?<br><br></div>
