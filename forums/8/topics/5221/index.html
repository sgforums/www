            <div class='col-md body'>Purr,... is there any kind of foreplay at all?  A lot of times, sex can be quite ...not good  if there's too little pre-stimulation...and most guys are guilty of just wanting to hop the bones straight off the bat...I also guilty some time (sometimes ok...:-)...but I find that it feels quite numb if there isn't sufficient stimulation...ie-foreplay....also same with my Exes (plural of Ex)...hee hee:-)  That might be the problem....<br><br>If you talk to him and nothing is happening, I would suggest trying to understand what it is exactly that gets you going...and if you want to get satisfied, you gots to get him to do the works for you...tongue bath, lightly chew on your neck and ear lobe, then move on down to your stomach area...of course after which you must make him go down on you totally...:-)  If your whole sex thing is about just putting the thing in and moving bcak and forth every night...you will get bored and numb after a while...Get some variation...like some nights he MUST make you come in different ways...<br><br>night 1: come using his tongue....<br>night 2: come using the penis...blah blah blah...or variations...I mean you won't get to know what it is you want to be feeling if there's no experimentation going on...sorry, i'm juss assuming you dun experiment...apologies if you do...<br><br>Sorry if people see this post as a bit rude and sexual, but juss trying to be helpful without being pornographic...:-) dun know if it works tho...:-)<br><br>Anyway, if he's the selfish sort, then there's really nothing you can do about it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'll have to agree that communication is very important.<br><br>Like someone said earlier, sex is not the only part in a relationship, but it sure is an important part. So if its not working, the one thats not happy will have to talk to the partner. Same thing will apply if it gets boring- Discuss what to do to spice it up. Or you can ask the opinions of the many forumites of course. Talk usually works, especially if the other parts of the relationship e.g. intellectual compatibility, are going strong.<br><br>I haven't tried it myself though. I just read/heard about these things from many sources and it sounds like the sensible way to treat the matter.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 08-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Got a confession to make. I broke up with an ex after being togther with him for one year. Reason- yup, bad sex.<br><br>We had an okay relationship. He was a nice, devoted chap. We even talked about the M word. (Okay lah, marriage) But sex life sucked. Sometimes, it hurt. Other times, I was so bored I just wanted him to get it over and done with. I never had an orgasm with him. I did make some noise about this and he tried to last longer. Didn't help. Just prolonged the pain sometimes  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Of course, I did tell him whenever it hurt. He just finished as quickly as possible. I wanted it to stop IMMEDIATELY but out of love, I put up with it.<br><br>After a while, I just began to wonder if I could face a life where I'll never have an orgasm. I decided I couldn't face it. Sooner or later, I'll have an affair. The thing is, I'll hate myself if I ever had one. Around the same time, I also began to get attracted to another guy. I was filled with guilt. So in a moment of great stupidity, I confessed to him that my mind had started to wander (of course I hadn't done anything yet and I didn't name the other guy) and complained that our sex life sucked big time. I thought honesty was the best policy in a relationship. His ego couldn't take the blow. I suggested that we work at the relationship but he couldn't face me anymore. So we broke up. Sigh.<br><br>The thing was, at the end of the relationship, I loved him but I wasn't in love with him anymore. It hurt a lot nonetheless.<br><br>This happened two years ago. Now, I'm filled with dread the same thing will happen to my present relationship. I think I can put up with never having an orgasm becos he makes me laugh and we're happy together. I'm just afraid that my boredom will rub off on him eventually and he'll start looking elsewhere. Sign.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't you think it depends on the individual? A person with a high sex drive would attribute sex as an important factor in a relationship then one with a lower sex drive... However is that reason enough to break up? Best not to keep on dwelling on the issue coz if you feel your partner is giving you bad sex. Prolly by then you already have "phsycoed" yourself 50 to 80%  to give up the relationship.<br><br>A bad sex life I think is something that can be improved....

            <div class='col-md body'>purr,<br>i suppose sex is an integral part of a relationship.  but breaking up with a boyfriend or separating from a husband due to lack of enjoyment in the sex department is a little rash.<br><br>think about it, the physical side of a relationship will not last for the long run. when both of you are in your twilight years, isn't the communication and the compatibilty between you two will be the things that will keep both of you warm at night?  isn't the feeling that you have a soulmate with you for the rest of your life better than the orgasm? what i'm trying to say is ego and pride CAN be overcome...don't throw away a good relationship just because of sex (once again, i'm not ignoring the importance of it)<br><br>if you ex can make you laugh, he can make you laugh for as long as he could speak and as long as you could hear him say it.<br><br>if your ex can make you have multiple orgasms everytime you have sex, then he can only do it for so long, before time takes its toll.<br><br>sorry for sounding different and (admittedly, lame).<br><br>------------------<br>the statement below is true.<br>the statement above is false.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey dun worry Purr...i read your post properly and didn't think you broke off with him but the other way around...:-)<br><br>Anyway to everyone else...I think your views are correct also, but we must remember that being sexually unsatisfied by your partner can create serious frustrations over the short and long run...I think that if the sex isn't good, then it's your perogative whether to move on or not.  Man I personally hate frustration...It's absolutely the woirst feeling a human being can have...even worse than getting dumped...<br><br>I mean, in an ideal world we would never break off with someone just because the sex is bad...but bad sex can lead to a lot of unhappiness and that unhappiness can lead to a lot of ...blah blah blah....u get my drift...<br><br>In our world...which young person wants to commit their whole life to someone who isn't interested in how they feel or how satisfied they are...so many fish in the sea.  I for one would hate to live the rest of my life without ever experiencing satisfaction...if later in life it declines that's fine...as long as it ever happened before...but for people who have never experienced it..go find it.......It's like saying young people shouldn't rock the boat if nothing is wrong except for that one thing....I think at the least, most people want someone who is at least balanced and not leaning too far to being selfish and too far in being generous...I take that back...most people want generous mates...ha ha:-)<br><br>sorry, my views are opposite from most would think.  Ok can't elaborate more...have to do something...Dun worry Purr U shouldn't feel guilty about it, you're still young and that makes it alright....now if you were 30 or 40 then that's another story...ha ha:-)</div>
