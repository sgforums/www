            <div class='col-md body'>First a bit of my religious background. My family is Taoist, I went to a Catholic secondary school and I go to friends' cell group gatherings. I believe in each religion as all of them teach its followers to do good.<br><br>Sometimes when I am vexed, I like to head for the *Si Ma  Lu Guan Yin Miao* where I can tell her what's bothering me. Sometimes before bedtime, I do pray to God too, telling him about my day. I think I am a pretty mixed up follower  :p<br><br>Answering Liquid's question, I recall having read that religion was a huge tool in ancient times for community leaders to rule over their followers. It was their power to understand the divine or the supernatural that places them above the community. Think ancient China when the village chief makes up stories of the Lightning and Thunder God's wrath to explain storms or other natural phenomenon. So I will tend to say Man made God... mighty invention... BUT this is not a statement. I am not well learned in all religions and I may be wrong  :p<br><br>Personally, I feel that when you have been spreading a religion for thousands of years, it is hard to diffentiate between truth or fiction. As long as religion is not abused to rule over followers with a weaker mind, or to make them do irrational things, I am willing to listen to anyone who says that Man made God or God made Man.<br><br>Sometimes I envy my friends who can find unwavering strength from HIM. I am not a very religious person and I guess friends are my greatest support. I dont know when I shall find my own religion but mebbe when I am rich and successful and I get more paranoid, I may turn to Buddhism like Richard Gere! Meanwhile, I shall keep my options open and explore the world of religions!<br><br>------------------<br>You are my first star at night, I'd be lost in space without you<br>I'll never lose my faith in you,<br>How will I ever get to heaven if I do</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, LiQuid!,<br><br>I am an atheist, actually, I want to respond to the atheism thread of yours, i.e. I don't believe in God. I believe that God is a waste of time. I think that religion is a jumble of false assertions and claims, with no basis in reality. The conception of God is a product of the human imagination... I can't conceive<br>how the postulate of the Almighty God helps us in any possible way... What I observe is that this premise leads us to such unproductive questions as why God permit so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors which He could have prevented.. God was invented to explain mystery. God is always invoked to explain those things that you do not understand. Now, when you finally discover how something works, you get some laws which you're taking away from God; you don't need him anymore. But you need him for the other mysteries. God is something which man crafted to ward off the fear that lies in his heart against the natural forces.<br><br>Though you may not think what I believe, but it does not mean that you are wrong. We are entitled to our own opinions and beliefs in my conception.<br><br>Of course, religion has seriously impeded science in the past millenia, particularly during the Dark Ages for Christianity. Every great scientific truth goes through 3 stages. First, people will claim that it conflicts with the Bible. Next they say it had been discovered before. Lastly, they say they always believe it, and what hypocrisy is that.<br><br>Just my 2 pennies worth.... Have a good day..<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights. However, love is not about finding someone to relieve you, but love is about you devoting your heart and soul to love that someone, even if you know that someone do not love you the way you do."<br>- Prodigal</div>
