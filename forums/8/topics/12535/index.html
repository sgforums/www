            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>The purpose of this message is two fold:<br><br>1.	To expose the unscrupulous practices of UOB Kay Hian towards the remisiers who are trying to transfer to another stockbrokering house.<br><br>2.	To warn everyone who has friends or relatives working as remisiers about the consequences of joining UOB Kay Hian.<br><br>An article about this issue can be found in the Â“Lian He Zao BaoÂ” of the 24th of October 2001,  on the upper right portion of the finance column, on page 21.<br>Link: <a href="http://www.zaobao.com/cj/cj004_241001.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.zaobao.com/cj/cj004_241001.html</a><br><br>Basically, UOB Kay Hain will offer 6 months of zero brokerage to the customers of any remisiers who are trying to transfer to another stockbrokering house, regardless of the reasons (may it be personal, a dislike of UOB Kay HainÂ’s new policies or otherwise).<br><br>I know the full details of everything that happened because I know one of the affected remisier personally.<br><br>The offer of 6 months of zero brokerage to the customers of any remisiers who are trying to transfer to another stockbrokering house by UOB Kay Hian is unscrupulous for the following reasons:<br><br>1.	This is a bully tactic and a direct way to threaten any remisiers who wishes to transfer out of UOB Kay Hian to another stockbrokering house for any reasons. The offer of zero brokerage for 6 months will, very likely cause the remisier who is transferring out of OUB Kay Hain to lose most of his/her customers, as such a good offer by UOB Kay Hian to the customers is very hard to pass up. I firmly believe that the remisiers are not slaves, and they are not under any obligations to stay in any stockbrokering house, and as such, this tactic that is employed by UOB Kay Hian is not right.<br><br>2.	If the remisier were to lose most of his/her customers, then effectively, his/her career is destroyed. The agreement between the remisier and UOB Kay Hian is merely an agency agreement, with the remiser as the agent to the customers. The customers does not, in any legal fashion, belong to UOB Kay Hian. On the contrary, to my knowledge, the customers of the remisiers I know are mostly brought into UOB Kay Hian from another stockbrokering house, and they are mostly signed up by the remisers themselves. This fact puts more weight on the argument that the customers actually belong to the remisier. Furthermore, this offer of 6 months of zero brokerage as an effective deterrence to remisiers who are leaving a stockbrokering house is unheard of in the Singapore Stock exchange until the 24th October 2001.<br><br>3.	The reasons given by UOB Kay Hian for implementing this policy is to prevent the loss of customers at this economic downturn, but does this reason warrant the destruction of a remisierÂ’s career? Personally, I see this as a very ugly scene of how a large stockbrokering house can abuse its power to achieve its own ends, on the great detriment of the remisiers.<br><br>Please forward this to any of your remisier friends if you care about their careers.<br><br>If you want to help these remisiers in any way, or would like to see justice done, I might be able to get the affected remisiers to talk to you, just send me a message.<br></div>
