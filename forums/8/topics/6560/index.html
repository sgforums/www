            <div class='col-md body'>Well, to me, in pornography, women are treated as sex objects and it promotes promiscousity. Sex should come with love. But you dun see that in pornography.<br><br>Hence if youngsters are exposed to pornography they tend to accept the fact that it is alright just to have sex without love. That is very wrong i think. You want your CHILDREN to think this way ?<br><br>Another thing. There are many types of pornography (dun ask me why i know so much). And some are really sadistic, they are really bad for you.<br><br>R(A) is good enuff i think.<br><br>And my principal (YES ! PRINCIPAL) once said,"dun see too many naked women, next time your wife lie naked in your bed, you'll have no reaction!" haha, but i think very true ... so guys, watch out !

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks terence for your reply, here's my answer, hope they clear your doubts<br><br>&gt;&gt;why are they bad for us? and the causal effects are...?????<br><br>One catagory which I refer to is Child Pornography. Well, by watching it simply promote child pornography and you'll see more missing children in India. Well, i can't go on here .... i think it is just sick. Hopefully you get wat I mean<br><br>&gt;&gt;ohhhhh, i see. is that why ALL gynecologists, life-drawing artists and nudists are impotent and/or have no sex life????<br><br>If you notice, I was writing that para in a joking tone. Btw, I never use the word "ALL" and I used the words "I think", so you can by all means disagree with me. It is just my personal opinion. One thing to add, when internet is not so hot in Singapore, any nude pics will be a big hoo-ha. But now, when my frens see nude pics, they may say "aiyo, not nice lah, show you another one!" or "aiya, this web site so lousy, introduce you a better one!" Well, maybe it is just my frens. But, pple have seen so much nude pics nowadays that they started to become selective. In the past was "grab wat you have." Is it because we have seen too much? Is there a sign of mental impotency here ? I am not sure myself. Just a comment.<br><br>&gt;&gt;why do you sanction R(A) and not porn?<br><br>like wat i had stated before, porno promotes sex without love. But not R(A). In R(A) shows, there is a story line, reason for couples to have sex and so and so. But in porno, you just have pple shagging, nothing else. I hope i am right with this. I am not very experienced with porno ! haha, maybe terence is ... hehe ... enlighten me ???<br>Btw, R(A) show is not about sex all the time wat. If you had watched the show Smoke, you would notice that there was NO single nude scene at all. And in R(A) shows, women are not portrayed as sex objects, they are pple with life and have feelings, they are HUMANS ! In porno, they are simply sex OBJECTS. I think that is not healthy.<br><br>Hope that answer your questions. Cheers !<br><br>p/s would any ladies like to comment on this ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Terence and little man:<br><br>i think porn's sole purpose is to show people having sex and to titillate the viewers.  In this sense they are bound by 'pornography rules' like thou shall not talk too long or else the viewers money will not be well spent and no romance (like true love) should be apparent in the movie.  Well, at least as far as I know I've never seen couples in porn kissing passionately and then looking at each other with soulful eyes.<br><br>art on the other hand has other purposes.  Maybe the nude/sex scene is important for the story line, maybe it's a kind of symbolism, but they do not <strong>have</strong> to arouse lust in the viewers.<br><br>Btw, what I said is greatly influenced by what the writer of Lolita said regarding this debate.  He received a lot of flaks for writing that novel.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>R(A) movies are a form of art i think...so i guess it's ok...<br>but porn is usually distorted and does not aim to "educate" nor is it considered YI SHU...<br><br>in my opinion...there is nothing wrong wif nudity...we are born into this world naked anyway...and sex is a necessity in life ...to reproduce and ensure our continued existence (yah.....oso for pleasure.....)...but if nudity and sex are abused (like in porn)then i dont think we shd encourage it at all...<br><br>wats the intention of watching err...adult movies?...is it solely for enjoyment...like watching any other movies?...or are u just trying to get some "reaction"?...hiaK~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Freeman !<br><br>[littleMan, professionals are only a group deciding on wat is ok for the general viewers to watch]<br><br>They are not just any group of people who are PAID. They are *trained* professionals. They have guidelines on wat to cut and wat not to cut. And they have to answer for wat they cut.<br><br>[they have no choice, its a job]<br><br>Whether they have choice or not isn't important as long as they do their job right.<br><br>[We would'nt be surprised if they themselves have copies of pornos, is'nt it!]<br><br>You are very right ! But that is their personal life and I dun know how this will affect their professionalism.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>is there some sort of inbuilt bigotry that develops after spending too much of your life in s'pore????<br><br>littleman,<br><br>'Ok ok, another example ok ?? Rape.'<br><br>so are you saying now that watching porn will cause people to run out into the streets and rape??? is it not possible for a person to watch porn for a laugh? believe it or not there are some who can distinguish OTT campy sex from real life. it would be nice if you could provide evidence of the causal effects porn has on the number of rapes.<br><br>"i never say YOU WILL BECOME IMPOTENT. Just a possibility that i believe in."<br><br>well, let me repeat then, YOU ARE WRONG. how the hell can looking at naked women make one impotent? perhaps you could take time out and explain to me, silly old me, how this happens? i never had the benefit of superstition or ignorance. i say, does staring at dogs make one want to pee on fire hydrants?<br><br>"Well, that's why we need the censorship board ! The professionals will decide. I'm no professonal in this field."<br><br>true blue s'porean. what me? no i don't work here, not my department, don't ask me, i don't want to get involved...the passivity of the typical s'porean is only broken when it is safe for him to complain.<br><br>cheerio<br><br>------------------<br>When I was a kid, I used to pray every night for a new bicycle. Then I realised that the Lord doesn't work that way, so I just stole one and asked Him to forgive me.<br><br>Emo Philips</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, LittleMan,<br><br>I don't think that pornography can cause so much detrimental effects to people. I think the more you try to censor something, the more people get curious and rebel by doing that something, and finally regret it.<br><br>I was debating on the legalisation of hard core porn recently, and was put on the side that we should legalise it. Well, there are 2 arguments for this :<br><br>1)Redundancy : I would base my argument in the context of UK. In UK, pornography are divided into soft core and hard core. Soft core is showing of women's breast and love making without erection of penis and the penetration act. Then one wonders why such an classification. It is so ridiculous. Furthermore, people can download hard core porn from the internet. No matter how hard you try to control, there is always a way. Of course, I would say that we should not go to extremes like showing children get raped, or people having sex with animals, perhaps, people cannot handle the truth and that leads to my second point :<br><br>2)It is a way of life : having sex is a way of life, prostitution is a way of life whether you want to see it or not. What is so horrible about it? Well, if you ask me, I was walking home at 3 am in the morning one night after coming back from Oxford, and I pass by the street and saw a couple having sex in a telephone booth under a temperature of 10 degrees Celsius, and plus their screams and moans. So, big deal, not that it is something strange where I have to scream. If you don't show the harsh facts, people are sheltered and make noises on things which seemed so trivial...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt;&gt;so are you saying now that watching porn will cause people to run out into the streets and rape???<br><br>When I gave the example of rape, i mean rape pornography which is a sadistic act (i mentioned sadistic act om my earlier post) Sorry, i did not make myself clear.<br><br>&gt;&gt;true blue s'porean. what me? no i don't work here, not my department, don't ask me, i don't want to get involved...<br><br>Why not you explain to me how a reflow soldering of PCB in Surface Mount Technology differs from A through-hole technology and which is better ?<br><br>Well, i think i shall reiterate that opinions are like religion, u dun change a person's religion by just arguing with him. Well, Terence I respect your views. I am not saying that you are wrong, you are very right to have your own views and believe in them, i do admire that. But I believe this forum is for pple to share opinions and not a place for pple to be judged, thanks Terence and everyone else who shared their opinions with me. I have learned a lot and had looked at pornography from many different angles. But before things turn sour and ugly, I will like to rest my case for this thread.<br><br>Cheers !</div>
