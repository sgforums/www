              <p>Ang Mo Kio means “Red Hair Bridge” in Hokkien. It actually refers to a disused bridge that links the western part of the current Ang Mo Kio estate to the Thomson Estate.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The Red Hair referred by the locals was a British Lady called Lady Jennifer Windsor. Lady Windsor was the wife of Lord Windsor, a wealthy merchant who had a huge estate in the Upper Thomson Area in the 1920s till after World War II.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">It was a tragic incident that linked Lady Windsor to a unnamed crossing that bridged a stream running off the Pierce Reservoir.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The incident happened in 1923 when Lady Windsor lost 3 of her children; Harry, Paul and Angela. The 3 children were supposed to have visited a family friend staying in the Upper Thomson area, and were lost in the woods. It was later found that the 2 boys were playing by the wooden crossing when a sudden gush swept them away. Their bodies were found about 2 miles from the bridge. However, the body of Angela was never found.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Since that eventful day, locals started hearing cries of a little girl and that prompted Lady Windsor to stay by the bridge for the rest of her life. She told her close friends that she had heard her daughter voices by the bridge and she wanted to accompany her soul. Lady Windsor would spend the whole day by the bridge, reading or knitting. People soon gotten used to her perpetual presence by the bridge that they soon refered the bridge as the “Red Hair Bridge”; which in its right sense should have been called “Lady Windsor Bridge”.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Lady Windsor passed away in 1963 and it was only thereafter that locals no longer hear the voices of the little girl. Today, one could still see the disused bridge near the intersection of Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 and Upper Thomson Road.</p>

              <p>Unlikely to be true. Windsor is the Royal Family name of the United Kingdom. It is hard to imagine why a member of the Royal family would be residing in Singapore. Even if indeed a royalty decides for some strange obscure to reason to be in Singapore, they should be well looked after by hordes of bodyguards and hence little reasons for them to be lost in woods.</p>
