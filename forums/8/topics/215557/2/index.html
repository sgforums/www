            <div class='col-md body'>Haha that reminds me. I bought a Samsung camera at Audio House (Liang Court) on Sunday. I thought his service was pretty gd! He answered all my qns with patience and i left the shop a happy customer.<br><br>Then nightmare came, after 20 odd pictures, the camera hung several times. And worse, when i took pictures at night, the images were 99% hazy and distorted. So i went back too the store. Another salesgirls standing next to him informed me that Samsung is one of the worst brands. I was stunned, why didn't that chap tell me earlier?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Then he asked me to return the SD card reader with the box. Problem is, i had already thrown it away during the afternoon! So he asked me to pay $12.<br><br>Look: not my fault camera spolit, made another inconvenient trip down and asked to pay? I stood firm and insisted on non-payment. He also stood firm, quoting the company's policy. I asked to see the manager but the manager frowned. Then, finally he relented and even gave it to me.<br><br>Well, i won't say the overall customer service is really gd now, anyway, not my business. I have gotten what i want when i exchanged for a Kodak camera. I will definitely think twice abt going back there now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
