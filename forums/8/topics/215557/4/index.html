Can't we ask a bit more although the thing is cheap? we are still spending money and dun want to buy the wrong stuff.<br><br>if a customer is extremely rude and unreasonable, then i guess it's forgivable that the saleperson do flare up a bit. but for the threadstarter's case, it's definitely the saleperson who's in the wrong.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would not who is in the wrong nor right as we are not there in person and like what people has always said. Pass down information and message can always difer from the actual message. First of all:<br><br>01) Isn't it rude to cut into another customer's conversation? I believe the saying of first come first serve comes into place and patience from a customer is needed. If there is only 1 sales person at that time. I have been to Funan IT mall before and i have seen 2 sales person on duty and at times 3. Why am I always there? Simple, I am there as I have a few clients who I have business dealing. So why not go for another sales person instead of the lady? Sex preference?<br><br>02) If so, the sales girl has shouted, me being a customer will definately argue back. But to what the writer has writen, he seems to just accept and nothing further to what he has done after being shouted. I find this funny as me being a customer, I will definately argue back.<br><br>03) Since the customer is in a rush, beside pasta mania is a handphone shop. If I aam rushing for time, I will just hop to the other shop and check since the sales person is serving a customer - Makes sense? But the writer didn't, that makes me wonder as how tight was his timing or how rush he was. Unless he was waiting for a chance to have a chat with the sales girl and got fed up as he was not being notice. - Makes sense?<br><br>04) Honestly, I doubt that the sales girl is shouting. No people in the sales line will shout to a customer. BUT I believe if the sales person might have raise her voice a little higher. Possible! But not shouting.  And not to forget, the environment at Funan is busy with people and noise. Or was the sales person far from the customer?<br><br></div>
