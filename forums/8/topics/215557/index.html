            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Oct 17, 2006<br>Rude sales service at Nokia outlet shocks customer</strong><br><br>While I agreed that service standards among Singapore retailers were not outstanding, it was for me still tolerable. Unfortunately, after an incident last Sunday, my impressions of local service standards took a sharp dip.<br>I was browsing through the Bluetooth headsets at a Nokia retail store at Funan Digitalife Mall. A female sales staff was attending to a man at the booth. As she was engaged, I waited for her to attend to me.<br><br>As I was pressed for time, I tried to divert her attention to me several times to ask a quick question about the price of a Bluetooth headset I was interested in buying. To my disgust, I was ignored.<br><br>I asked her again and she snapped at me irritably. She asked if I was blind and unaware that she was busy. When I said I wanted to know about the item, she shouted out the price at me.<br><br>To say that I was shocked and appalled at such rudeness is an understatement.<br><br>It is conceivable that I got such regrettable "service" because I was casually dressed in a T-shirt and jeans and perhaps deemed not to be a potential customer.<br><br>If so, this speaks volumes of the double standards and discrimination that have no place in a nation keen to develop its service industry.<br><br>Liu Guoyi<br><br>ST Forum 17 Oct 2006</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>tsk tsk ...its not the first time service staff genna complained.<br><br>Maybe she's the only person in the shop, say, just before lunch time or closing time ....as the writer did not specify the exact time he was at the outlet.<br><br>Or maybe, the customer she was attending to was buying a 1000+ phone, compared to the writer who is only "enquiring" or perhaps, prior to this, he was "enquiring" alot of products already and sales staff already knew that he wasn't interested in buying but just browsing.<br><br>In any case, both customer and sales staff is wrong, but bigger blame on the sales girl.  Frankly, if i am in her shoes, I will be in a fix.  the writer is not close enough for me to serve concurrently (maybe he is a few aisle away).  And the customer i am currently serving, maybe checking out a new phone - i.e. I cannot move away lest he run away with the 1000 dollar phone.  What do I do ? I pretend never see him, he frantically trying to get my attention...see ?  But of course, she is wrong to shout, unless theres a good reason, like he become so irritating and cause the earlier customer to leave without buying...<br><br>The customer is wrong, if I know the sales girl is attending to someone, i will wait,   Its rude to interrupt, just imagine you are talking to someone and I interrupt, rude right ?  Same thing mah.  If I am rushing for time, I will go somewhere...the whole Funan so fu_cking big, don't tell me cannot find another shop sell Nokia headset ?  Somemore if he is so rush of time, then buy another day loh, what so urgent ? Life and death meh ?<br><br>Must be the sales girl chio, he want to jio jio...nah beh....if I am judge, both parties get punished.</div>

The service manager at Causeway Point Care Centre said that the model was new and the housing for this model was not available.<br><br>It takes one week for the housing to arrive.

So I called the Nokia Careline to lodge my complaint. The Careline assured me that they would look into the case and I was given a case number.<br><br>A few day later, the Care Centre called me to say that the housing was available. I was told to go to the Care Centre to replace it.<br><br>As a precautionary measure, I called the Care Centre to confirm that the housing was available. To my surprise, the Care Centre told me the housing had not arrived yet.<br><br>I was very angry that a big organisation like Nokia can make this kind of mistake.<br><br>I called the Care Line and they apologised that it could be due to miscommunication. They assured me again that they would get the Care Centre to call me.<br><br>Sadly, the Care Centre hasn't called me yet. I'm really tired of all this.<br><br>Singapore is always promoting good service, so how is it that Nokia provides this kind of service?<br><br>Nokia has a good service protocol but sad to say, it's not working at all.<br><br>Khoo Geck Soo<br></div>

I think in BKK, ppl are more patient (otherwise the whole BKK will go insane over the traffic jams).  Also, in BKK, you get more service staff, hence you probably won't end up having one sales staff...besides the staff will say, very nicely, "wait a moment pls" ......</div>

As she was engaged, I waited for her to attend to me.<br><br>As I was pressed for time, I tried to divert her attention to me several times to ask a quick question about the price of a Bluetooth headset I was interested in buying. To my disgust, I was ignored.<br><br>I asked her again and she snapped at me irritably. She asked if I was blind and unaware that she was busy. When I said I wanted to know about the item, she shouted out the price at me.<br><br>To say that I was shocked and appalled at such rudeness is an understatement.<br><br>It is conceivable that I got such regrettable "service" because I was casually dressed in a T-shirt and jeans and perhaps deemed not to be a potential customer.<br><br>If so, this speaks volumes of the double standards and discrimination that have no place in a nation keen to develop its service industry.<br><br>Liu Guoyi<br><br>ST Forum 17 Oct 2006[/b]</blockquote>i dun think the sales gal would pass a remark such as "if he was blind" or wad, it would be obviously rude if it was real. i think Mr Liu just trying to make the situation worse. pls, dun always self-judge by the dressing, it is not tat important. its always the way u approach n ur body language. the writer shd use some basic common sense, would a saleperson give up a potential buyer or a "batu" like him when they need commissions to survive.</div>
