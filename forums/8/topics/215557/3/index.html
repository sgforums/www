Once I while I was asking a DBS salesperson about some investment products, another guy passing by overhead something that interest him and cut into my conversation with the DBS salesperson. He proceeded to asked a few follow-on questions until I waved my hand between him and the salesperson and told him to go join the queue. A bloody ar*e with no sense of etiquette like Liu Guoyi.</div></blockquote>i totally agree with you, i hate it when people feel that their time's more important and its ok for them to interrupt others in situations like these . if you can't wait then please come back another time, it is not all right for you to break up a conversation like that and think the salesperson is rude</div>

Unfortunately, after an incident last Sunday, my impressions of local service standards took a sharp dip.<br>I was browsing through the Bluetooth headsets at a Nokia retail store at Funan Digitalife Mall. A female sales staff was attending to a man at the booth. As she was engaged, I waited for her to attend to me.<br><br>As I was pressed for time, I tried to divert her attention to me several times to ask a quick question about the price of a Bluetooth headset I was interested in buying. To my disgust, I was ignored.<br><br>I asked her again and she snapped at me irritably. She asked if I was blind and unaware that she was busy. When I said I wanted to know about the item, she shouted out the price at me.<br><br>To say that I was shocked and appalled at such rudeness is an understatement.<br><br>It is conceivable that I got such regrettable "service" because I was casually dressed in a T-shirt and jeans and perhaps deemed not to be a potential customer.<br><br>If so, this speaks volumes of the double standards and discrimination that have no place in a nation keen to develop its service industry.<br><br>Liu Guoyi<br><br>ST Forum 17 Oct 2006[/b]</blockquote>Im gonna wear singlet,shorts n slippers n go there n ask for the price of everything there. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
