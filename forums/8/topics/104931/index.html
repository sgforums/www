            <div class='col-md body'><strong>NATIONAL MINIMUM WAGE</strong><br><br>The national minimum wage is an important cornerstone of Government strategy aimed at providing employees with decent minimum standards and fairness in the workplace. It applies to nearly all workers and sets hourly rates below which pay must not be allowed to fall. It helps business by ensuring companies will be able to compete on the basis of quality of the goods and services they provide and not on low prices based predominantly on low rates of pay. The rates set are based on the recommendations of the independent Low Pay Commission.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Main (adult) rate for workers aged 22 and over<br><br>Â£4.10 per hour (from 1 October 2001)<br>Â£4.20 per hour (from 1 October 2002)<br><br>Development rate for workers aged 18-21 inclusive<br><br>Â£3.50 per hour (from 1 October 2001)<br>Â£3.60 per hour (from 1 October 2002)</span></strong><br><br>NB: The development rate can also apply to workers aged 22 and above during their first 6 months in a new job with a new employer and who are receiving accredited training.)<br>To check on how the National Minimum Wage applies to you (or your staff), use the TIGER interactive website or telephone the National Minimum Wage Helpline on 0845 6000 678. This is also the number to ring if you think you are being underpaid and wish to make a complaint. You may also email the helpline from the Inland Revenue's NMW website. All complaints about underpayment of the National Minimum Wage are treated in the strictest confidence.<br><br>Inquiry to Stephen filmo@filmo.com<br></div>
