            <div class='col-md body'>30 Things Guys Want Girls To Know!!<br><br>1. We're not as perverted as you think we all are.<br>2. No matter what YOU say, your ex-boyfriend IS an ass hole.<br>3. We like you to give us hugs and kisses sometimes too.<br>4. Don't argue with us when we call you beautiful.<br>5. Don't treat us like shit, what goes around comes around.<br>6. We know you're pretty, that's one of the reason's we're going out with you.<br>7. Don't go into detail about your period. It scares us.<br>8. If you have cramps and we ask you what's wrong, just tell us it's that time of the month and nothing more.<br>9. If you really liked us for us, you would let us think that our mustache, beard, or sideburns looked cool.<br>10. We never shave our legs. So get over it.<br>11. NEVER ask us if you can put makeup on us. It's just wrong.<br>12. Don't make bets about us, because one of your friends will tell us, if you don't.<br>13. When we tell you that you're not fat, believe us.<br>14. We absolutely do not care about the Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC, 98 Degrees, or what any other guy looks like for that matter.<br>15. We may not be able to pee accurately all of the time, but at least we can stand up and go pee.<br>16. Just cause you think you're always right, doesn't mean that you don't have to apologize when you do something "wrong."<br>17. You expect us to say and do sweet things for you, but it would be nice if you did the same every once in a while. We like to know that you love us.<br>18. We can't always be spontaneous, so try to help us make the plans sometimes.<br>19. Don't ask us to beat up another guy for you, cause you might get what you wish for.<br>20. Never kick us in the nuts "just to see what we would say". That's just mean.<br>21. Never pretend like you are going to break up with us and laugh when we believe you.<br>22. Pamela Anderson's boobs aren't fake anymore, but we like yours better anyway.<br>23. Size doesn't matter, except to idiots who don't want a relationship.<br>24. PMS is not an excuse.<br>25. If you want us to put the seat down when we're done, you should put it up when you're done.<br>26. Don't tell us how cute your ex-boyfriend was. That doesn't turn us on.<br>27. And always remember: The way to a guys heart is through his stomach..... and maybe....oh nevermind.<br>28. NEVER ask us to kiss other guys. You might be that comfy with your friends, but to us it's just wrong.<br>29. We always notice how funny it is after your rip out our heart, stick it down our throat and still want to be friends.<br>30. And last but not least: We know you're not always right, but we'll pretend like you are anyway.</div>
