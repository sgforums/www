              <p>He is giving you an excuse, as he does not want to be friends with you.</p>
              <p>Close friends are not pokemons, I am pretty sure one can have more than six of them at anytime.</p>
              <p>However, it is not the quantity of close friends that matter, it is the "quality" of them that matters.</p>

              <p>I was thinking that you are a girl and you really want this guy to be your "friend".</p>
              <p>But it turn out that you are worry about your items which you lent to him ( Fortunately, as the fore-mentioned case will be more difficult to handle ).</p>
              <p>In this case, since he had never been rude to you or whatsoever, just ask politely for your items back. Be direct about it, and then see what kind of reaction he gives you. I have no idea what you lent to him, but the reason why he is friendly towards you might be because that he doesn't want you to chase after him for those things.</p>
              <p>It is worth a try, and after you asked him, you could post here and tell us what kind of reaction he gave you.</p>
              <p>In case you are interested, the reason why I suggest that you do so, is because this could easily tell you what does he think of you as : an acquaintance, a not-so-close friend, or just a living loanshop.</p>

              <p>It will be better for you to stay away from these "trainers" who are only interested in keeping "strong pokemons", as they only view their friends as tools or someone to make use of.</p>
              <p>They will throw you aside or ignore you once you have no value to them.</p>
