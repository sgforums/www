            <div class='col-md body'>sports are an important part of life. they create attitudes which are vital for life. for example, they exercise our determination. they teach people to work well in groups, and have the ability to make us exercise both physically and mentally. sports competitions have the ability to strengthen people's confidence, as well as develop good relationships between different people/countries. I've realized that as I improved in certain sports, my grades and relationships within school got better as well. Competitive sports, such as basketball, soccer, volleyball, etc, are great for improving relationships between different races, simply because, though each race is different, sports never change. Like music, sports can be a bridge between different people.<br>maybe competitive sports DO use up resources. however, the results they reap are all worth it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>writing and publishing ur books do not use resources?? how many trees are cut down each and everyday?? watching a drama?? how much money is put into the media industry?? the surging emotion when u watch a drama is enjoyable u say...the adrenaline rush and the determination to win may be enjoyable to the ones in competitive sports...my point is simple...ur arguement cannot make a stand because ur point is one sided...you are right in a sense yes alot of money is pumped into the sports industry with political issues hanging onto them as well..but did u consider there are also many other stuff out there requiring as much resources and many also be "pointless and not beneficial" eg. ur TV....ur Books..there will always be people suffering and people enjoying at the same second of your ticking watch this is life there's a balance there can nvr be a perfect world we can help to make the world a better place but sports? i think u shud start ur topic from something like "terrorism wat a waste of resources" something along that line....u may not wan to admit but u are basically only looking at things from your point of view and stating what is deemed enjoyable to you may not be to others and what someone might like you may not...what you feel is correct may not be to others thus no point starting this pointless debate.period.</div>

I participate in MUN, and you have no idea how much confidence and determination I gain from going up and talking. what about those who do not have the same talents as me? people are different -- they have their own strengths and weaknesses. those who are artistic gain confidence, discipline and determination through their art. those who sing will sing, those who act will act. what about those who are naturally gifted in sports? should they not be given the opportunity to prove themselves? it is through putting your soul into something and doing the best that you could possibly do that you gain confidence. if people who are naturally athletic are not given the opportunity to practice, what good will it do? will it help the person in any way? why should some people gain spotlight while others are denied the chance, simply because society values certain skills over others? people cant always stay within the confinds of how society thinks things should be.<br>also, sporting events promote world peace. lets say everyone just plays with their friends. okay, that's wonderful, but are their eyes being opened in any way? but being able to compete with people from all over the globe allows people the opportunity to get rid of their former prejudice and instead replace it with tolerance. isnt that what the world needs? education will always be a problem, because there are simply so many things being discovered each day, it is impossible to absorb everything. finance will always be an issue, this is evident by the way society runs. but world peace is something that everyone needs, and holding sporting events may help it reach a higher level. you say, why spend so much money on training? because if athletes are not trained, they will never even have the opportunity to reach their full potential. they will never become who they could have become. do you really want to prevent someone from being everything they want to, and CAN become? aren't athletes human beings just as much as you and I are?</div>

Can you imagine a world without music, movies, sports and entertaintment? People play sports to relax and watch it to entertaint themselves. It would make people unhappy, which is the big picture of our human race, to live a happy life. All work and no play make a dull person and probably an unhappy and unbalanced one.<br><br>2) It promote health and team spirit. Self explantory.<br><br>3) It inspire people to achiveve and win  Like art, sport is a form of inspiration for those who get into it. It;s promote freedom and alot of values. Why? Because you can play a sport with your own creative ideas and values like perservance and courage are omi present in sports.<br><br>4) It is a form of business. Brands like NBA, EPL, NFL, MLB, are generating massive revenues and sports also create jobs for alot of people.<br><br>PersonallY I suggest millitary as a concept is outdated and is the largest waste of resource.

TS can argue dat sports and commercialisation of professional sports is a waste of resources but another forumer can say dat military is a waste of resources too...<br><br>wad TS say is not wrong entirely, look at EPL and many other football or other sports, many of dem are commercialised and business man pluge into such deals or takeovers juz to hope dat dey earn n milk more money out of it...<br><br>i feel dat TS has only seen one side of sports. why nt consider those football players who are really passionate for their sports and the game? if dey arent dat gd in football do u think those clubs would hav signed dem on? it is nt all about money, it is sports. these examples do motivate kids. we cant deny money might be a big influence, but if u do nt hav the skill required, do u think u can earn such an amount of money??<br><br>look at two sides, not juz narrow view of such a thing. it would nt be fair for those who hav put in great effort to excel in their area of interest. everybody has their different strength, the world is nt all about diplomas, degrees, PHD, or even masters, it is abt ur passion, strength and most imptly, hardwork!</div>
