            <div class='col-md body'>what is the point of vying who is the fastest runner, highest jumper and greatest football club.<br><br>sports is a huge economy but it is not useful in terms of earth health and increasing the intellect of human population. i remember reading that some wise men in the past also dislike the idea of sports.<br><br>what is the point of being the best sporting country. pride? A few days of pride? my point is that sporting events is really a huge waste of resources in the world. for profit minded companies, they are happy to earn the money so they will not have any complaints.<br><br>i would be happier if all the resources used for spending on sports can be converted to competition where people compete who has more knowledge based events. if you say that people can obtain pleasure in sports, i agree that supporting ur nations or favorite clubs can bring excitment and happiness when they win. however, the pleasure is little and u will just have to keep watching ur favourite club every weekend to support it.<br><br>at the end of the day, if your club wins, you feel happy for a while only but it does not really make u a better person anyway. you can argue that watching the sporting event is exciting but doing other things can bring happiness also.<br><br>however, i think that people engaging in recreational sports is ok because it does not cost alot of resources. you just need a place and friends and just play together and have fun in the process. in the competitive sports industry, it is however a huge used of resources in terms of building, selling and marketing cost of the industry.<br><br>u might think that i maybe bias against the sports industry and could have talked about other industry like arts and entertainment too. i have not thinked about these industries yet but for sports, i really have to feeling to talk about its unproductiveness because many people in the world is training to be professional sportmens.<br><br>at least in acting, when we watch television, a good drama can really bring emotions which so its a good form of leisure.<br><br>but the nature of competitive sports and seeing who wins is really pointless and brings little pleasure. i think its time for us to change the world mindset of discouraging sports that uses too much of physical competition.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to further elaborate my point. other than sports. all other activities that is about the competition between countries, communities should be scaled down vastly.<br><br>not only in the sports industry.<br><br>i noe that human nature , people like to see and support competiting events. however, i see all these things that try to encourage personal or national or coummity PRIDE is a huge waste of resources...<br><br>i think competition events can exist but need to scale down greatly.<br><br>as environmentalist attenbourgh say, (roughly quoting from him) , we are using too much resources in the world.<br><br>i am okay with people gaining pleasure for themselves in the world but i believe we can continue to enjoy pleasure at a more efficient lifestyle that focus on more activities that are simple and yet pleasureable and yet does not waste too much.<br><br>materialism and many acitivites in the world should really be cut back greatly.</div>

For the fans and supporters, other than feeling excited and happy when your idol win,<br><br>you are simply giving money to an industry that has very little workdone to the world and the increasing of knowledge.<br><br>i do acknowledge that sporting organisation do engage in helpful things with the world like UNICEF links and some of its charitable events.<br><br>however, the money donated is too small compared to the amount of money that is running around in the industry which has very little uses and i especially cannot take it when they speak of it as all in the name of winning and pride.<br><br>does the whole world calling you as the champion of champions and you feeling elated of being best really do anything except making you happy for a short moment.</div>

So is too little of everything.<br><br>A balance is needed. Removing them totally is wrong.<br><br>In sports, if you compete in the right way, without ever going to the extremes of losing weight to perform better, you place your health above pride and money.<br><br>If you do the other way round, you place your health below them.<br><br>When you are too proud, it will bring about your downfall in sports. Nobody will ever be number one forever, there will always be someone who's better than you. But if you are humble, the pride brings you the confidence, gives you the motivation to do better.<br><br>What makes you so sure that the happiness is fleeting? What defines simple? Me as an asthmatic competed in sports and won a bronze. I'm still happy over it. I'm given a chance to perform, and not be degraded as a sick person who can't be active in sports. The pride of winning is still there, it shows that asthmatics can do as well if it's within control.<br><br>Sports is not just about winning, pride, money. Everything you do in life, there's a word called passion. If you have no passion, then my opinion is no matter how much you win, how much you is useless.</div>

Australia is reportedly sourcing for good swimming genes in their population, so they could produce the likes of Michael Phelps.<br><br>Sporting companies are working to improve on their products, because each and every sport is unique, and a specific product is needed to make sure an athlete performs at his maximum and reduce the chances of injuries.<br><br>Governments are supporting it, because of the prize money involved. It's not just medals.<br><br>However, behind all these, what do you think they do this? Researching in genetics to search for particular types might also lead to the discovery of other stuffs. Researching on how to improve a product to reduce injuries will make sports something better to do. You don't want to break a bone and can't exercise for a year, do you?<br><br><blockquote>you are simply giving money to an industry that has very little workdone to the world and the increasing of knowledge.</blockquote>Wrong. Before you learn to run, you must first learn to walk. Just like understanding the knowledge behind sports. You won't understand what the heck are those scientists talking about if you have not studied Biology and related subjects. There's a lot of interconnections between each subject.<br><br><blockquote>i do acknowledge that sporting organisation do engage in helpful things with the world like UNICEF links and some of its charitable events.<br><br>however, the money donated is too small compared to the amount of money that is running around in the industry which has very little uses and i especially cannot take it when they speak of it as all in the name of winning and pride.</blockquote>What defines small? What is the definition of donation? Does it make sense to criticize them then?<br><br><blockquote>does the whole world calling you as the champion of champions and you feeling elated of being best really do anything except making you happy for a short moment.</blockquote>What defines simple? Once you answered this question, it would lead you to discover whether such a happiness is just for a short moment or a permanent feeling.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok..........<br><br>i didnt bother to read the whole thread.........<br><br>this is my opinion:<br><br>1) happiness in a day/month/year/lifetime is all made of little and little of events, when u take 1 small happy event away, a few mins of happiness is taken away........<br><br>2) sports teaches us, perserverence, determination and fairness.....<br>which we get to experience it, rather than being taught.<br><br>3)the only thing that can take down our fats, make our muscle flexible, muscle growth, flexibility of joints, detoxify is by doing some sports........ without them we might have a 60 yrs of lifespan, instead of 80 to 100 yrs normally.<br><br>4)sports do make a part in economy growth.<br><br>5) we build places like stadiums for competition is to encourage ppl to do sports, so that we have the advantage of point 1,2,3 and 4.<br><br>6) ppl starving, while we use money to build stadiums............ ppl starve.... yes they can strive hard together to make money, and we can cut down on wars and put the cost of weapons and machine to the starving ones........</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sporting events invite commercialisation and consumerism, these waste resources, therefore we must put an end to sports? Your argument isn't sound.<br><br>I think we should be asking how we can better manage the use of resources (by using eco-friendly production preocesses and materials) and the distribution of revenues.</div>
