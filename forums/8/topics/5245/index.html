            <div class='col-md body'>I think that is a nasty remark to call gals stupid. Shows that you don't respect them. ^^<br>However as Ariana says, It is the trust factor which matters.<br>Most Gals are smart enough to know who are jerks at the start. But if a guy acts to be really faithful to the gal, then it is possible that the gal grows more interested in the pretender. So causing them to be more open until it is too late.<br>Who says that Love can be perfect all the time?</div>

I hope you didn't really mean that... u make all guys appear like jerks... many of them are though...<br><br>I happened to be attached, and to be frank, I'm quite honest with my GF when it comes to passing comments, or giving feedback... I seldom give sweet nothings... a bit not romantic huh....  I dun wan to tell lies mah... thats a principle... what makes of a relationship when u tell your partner lies???<br><br>I wud think those gers who fall for the sweet nothings of guys hv only themselves to blame... why so easy...  and if they are so easy... dun blame the guys in the end, cos u're the one who trusted the wrong guy... its your poor judgement that got you into this... and remember, there are many bad guys around...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I dun discount the fact that there are guys who truly feels that they are incompatible and ask for a break, and maybe they will be misunderstood as taking advantage of the ger... but thats life lah... good guys treated like bad and bad guys treated like good... thats why I like Gemini... split personality - 50% good and 50% bad... and I sleep most of the 50% good away.... ;p<br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming?

            <div class='col-md body'>gee, it seems like the one u like got into your stated situation, which made u post this post! all I want to say is that, when I see girls who're gullible (not many, but hurts us guys to know when the ger is so pretty and hot :p ) I mean... you can't do nuts about it, really, no matter how much u try to educated them, they will never learn, I mean, track back, they were already stupid in the first place, what makes u think u can make them intelligent? I mean, your post is pointless, it's already a disability they have (stupid) and you've to come along and say they deserve it, worse yet generalize when u say 'gers' implying many girls are like that, which in turn got you all these flames...<br><br>also I don't know why u bother about dumb gers like that, I get turned off immediatly when they succumb to my lies (my mind going "euck, where are her brains, in her ass?)<br><br>bengaboy: but guys pay gros pros to do it, and there is no emotional feelings to it, so it's not the same case. Altho I know of bitches who go around praising guys (handsome, nice car, smart) giving those guys a sense of hope, but her real intention is just to get rides, popularity, support from them not knowing how much it would hurt when they guy finds out she doesnt mean what she says...<br><br>cheating jerks are akin to cheating bitches, we have a fair share of them, so, avoid them ler. diaos.<br><br>but.. another thing is, I find out (this does not include couples, just guys who're still after gers) that, altho you should sweet talk, but you cant talk straight in their face also, so many gers I know cant even take a little opinion or remark, they lash back with irrelavant shit like "WHATever" or worse yet, they merajuk and act like damn childish fools they are... right, the moment I know they're like that, I stop talking to them, so I'm not complaining I'm just relating.<br><br>Anyway, even tho lying is bad, but gers cant take shit, even just a tiniest bit of it from us, so wheres the problem? ok i might have a clue<br><br>Us guys, throw shit at each other since we met, we insult, we call names, thats when we were young. then we grow up, we start scolding each other and correcting their wrongdoings, etc. But thru a lot of bashing altho some dont, some come out wittier and cant take the harshest comments and stuff and know what reality actually means.<br><br>Err f*ck, I'm lost, always like that, dont know what I'm typing. anyway it would be the same case for gers if they have a lot of bitch friends but dont succumb to being a bitch themselves they end up being a boon to society, but how often is that? most gers I know cannot fight bitchiness and end up being one themselves. but these are not the people of the topic.<br><br>It's the gers who've never have bitch friends or been around bitches (group of friends peers) and choose to only be with non-bitches are going to find it hard to face reality when they leave SCHOOL, cause nobody in the society gives a shit for your feelings, cause everyone has enough responsibilities to take care of already than to tend for yours, you should be responsible of taking care your own feelings. but these gers dont know how to cause all their life their friends been there for them, but when they lose them, they're like blind people... actually the all I've said applies to guys too, cause it's quite the same altho it doesnt happen as often to guys cause guys more erm, naughty? active? in all these dirty activites (bitch,bastard)<br><br>eah, I don't know if I'm going anywhere with you, but hey, I dont have time to track back and clean up my msg, I got shit to do too!<br><br>gosh, forgive me for my pointless rant...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there will always be guys out there who sweet talk gers in order to get what they want. they're normally called bastards. there will always be gers who tease and string guys along, which neh-ing about them behind their backs. they're called bitches.<br><br>"bad guys", "bad girls".. they're everywhere. no one doubts their existance. yeah, that girl's damn dumb to fall for the guy's sweet-talking, but, how can you blame everything on the girl? if a lil girl goes to a stranger 'cos he promised her a sweet, and she gets raped, do you say it's all the girl's fault? it's a two-way thing. the girl is gullible enough to fall for this.. or rather, her self-esteem is bad enough that even though she knows he's lying, she cant be bothered. but, what the fuck is the guy doing sweet-talking girls in the first place?<br><br>there's a difference between sweet-talking girls, and simply being charming. it's hard to see it in practice, but they can lead to disasterous results. BUT.. not sweet-talking doesnt mean just frank 'comments', ie thinly veiled insults. hullo?!?! can't you talk about anything else? you dont only have to talk about her you know... not sweet-talking, would simply mean that when you do comment about her, you make SINCERE comments, not only the nice ones, nor only the mean ones. of course, there's the thing about not saying anything unless you have something good to say.. *shrug* it's up to you. i think most girls nowadays are strong enough to stand SOME criticism.<br><br>------------------<br>I believe in the sun, even when it is not shining.<br>I believe in love, even when i do not feel it.<br>I believe in God, even when He is silent.</div>
