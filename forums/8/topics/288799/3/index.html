            <div class='col-md body'>just received this<br><br>Dear Member,<br><br>Thank you for your patience. We are pleased to inform you that the website will open on Friday 9 November and auctions will start on Monday 12 November.<br><br>Through feedback and due consideration, we have made some new changes to our auctions:<br><br>1) A new Highest Single Bid model will replace the old Lowest Unique Bid model. All auctions will start from $0.01, and the successful bidder is the person who places the highest single bid for the auction.<br><br>2) Auction bid price limit. In order to make the auctions affordable and exciting, each auction item will have maximum bid price.<br><br>3) View an auction's current bid price. To keep you updated, the current bids for each auction will be displayed as received.<br><br>4) T-points offset. T-points can still be used by the successful bidder to offset the bid offer. For example, your bid offer for a PSP is $50 and you are the highest single bidder. If you have 45 T points in the Â‘my accountÂ’ section, you can use these 45 T points to offset the successful bid offer and pay the remaining $5 in cash. This means you can buy items at a very attractive price.<br><br>For more information on the Highest Single Bidder model please see our "FAQ"  and Â‘How To BidÂ’ sections of this site. The terms and conditions have been modified too, so please review them before participating in the auctions.<br><br>In appreciation of your continuing support, we have credited your account with 100 T-points.<br><br>Popular auction items make a comeback!<br><br>So join us at www.tatarah.com.sg for more exciting auctions and we wish you happy bidding!<br><br>Yours sincerely,<br><br>Tatarah team</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>who in the right mind will go write in for the new system la. in the past it's like buying a chance and you win, then you win big, just like shopping for $100 get free lucky draw. surely must give a little something for something in return ma. i think its just reasonable. so many people going on whether its legal or what nonsense. got (almost) free chance to get cheap goods also make so much noise. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>THANKS MAN.</strong></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">now its similar to those China telephone scams in the papers recently.</span> Call you waste ur phone bills, then tell you win that you've won prize but to claim the $50000 first must pay $1000 in tax. <strong>In TTR's case its worse!!</strong> You win something that costs $900 but must pay $450 upfront before you even get to see your prize. AND THAT IS EXCLUDING BIDDING FEES!! If I tell you to claim ur TOTO first prize first you must cough up half of it, you play or not?<br><br>In less than a week then suddenly change minds, so not stable!! Lucky I only bidded once for the PSP. Now if I bid and win, think I'll feel more like a stupid loser than a winner =_=<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by picmonster:<br>serious? how do you know about the testing member ID is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">171C4D40</span></strong><br><br></blockquote>and eh? this afternoon it was listed in the results!!!!!!<br><br>the owners taken it down already... wah never expect them to move so fast.<br><br>think they monitor the forums too? cant seem to find the tatarah forum threads elsewhere le. wahahahaha, heng heng i nothing to do go take screen shots =D<br><br>i still nice nice go draw boxes!<br><img src="http://i240.photobucket.com/albums/ff247/ttrulez/TTRselfbidding.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://i240.photobucket.com/albums/ff247/ttrulez/ownersinaction.jpg"><br><br>and go check out their news!! get good reviews by other people then quickly lowball everyone and change their system. thank goodness for forums!<br><br><blockquote><br>STUFF magazine has nothing but praise for Tatarah.com.sg<br><br>Click to read their review &gt; &gt;<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Marketing-Interactive.com waxes lyrical about TatarahÂ’s Premium Products<br><br>Marketing-Interactive.com, the online portal for Marketing Magazine, has done a feature on Tatarah.com.sg. more &gt; &gt;<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Coming soonÂ… Christmas Hamper<br><br>ItÂ’s never too early to shop for Christmas at Tatarah!
