I did, so it is not a case of talk cock only.<br><br>And from what i understand, they will need you to go down to collect back the card that was confiscated. Not sure ur friend have to go or his sis have to go. but if nv go retrieve the card there will be a fine.<br><br>My auntie got caught once. she took out her daug's card to use by mistake and before she realised it she was caught. She didnt went down to get back the confiscated card, and was fined. Exactly how much i cant rmb le though.</div>
