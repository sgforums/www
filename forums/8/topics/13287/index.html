            <div class='col-md body'>In recent decades, there has been a worldwide phenomenon called<br>'globalization'. Like the el-nino weather pattern that swept across the<br>Earth in the late nineties, its spread is inevitable and irreversible.<br>Globalization is intimately linked with the rapid advances in communication<br>and transportation, and indeed, can be said to have had its direct roots<br>from them.<br><br>When two brothers, bicycle makers the both of them, drew up a blueprint for<br>an amazing contraption, they had little or no idea what a storm they were<br>about to create. On paper, it looked like a simple, innocuous device- an<br>engine that was mounted on a pair of overblown wings. They were not sure if<br>it would work, but their vision, courage and perseverance opened a new<br>chapter in mankind's history of accidental inventions. The world was<br>introduced to the first airplane, and how the masses roared in appreciation.<br><br>Today of course, we have planes in abundance. Made of tough titanium and<br>powered by great engines, these contemporary monsters are the distant<br>offspring of the clumsy machine the Wright brothers had first made from<br>recycled bicycle materials.<br><br>But just as today's airplanes are able to take us from one part of the world<br>to another in a matter of moments, satellites have enabled us to communicate<br>with virtually anyone and everyone around the globe. All a person needs is a<br>device called a telephone. Distance is no longer a barrier when a small<br>robot many thousand kilometers above us is able to transmit our voices, and<br>even our images from one corner of the Earth to another; in real-time, no<br>less.<br><br>This, more than anything else has opened up the Pandora's box that is<br>globalization. Communications is the key to real power, and this is<br>evidenced by the fact that some of the wealthiest men on earth are CEOs of<br>news and communications firms.<br><br>Of course, this trend has brought about a revolution of immense change.<br>Superficially, communication has broadened the reach of democracy, allowing<br>greater transparency and more people to participate in the political arena.<br>Deep within the heart of this equation, however, it is still the media and<br>public relations vehicles of multi-billion dollar corporations who wield the<br>real power. Slick advertising and malicious smear-campaigns to discredit<br>products and individuals pay very big tributes to this fact.<br><br>For many communities, the rapid advances in communications have simply<br>overtaken them. China is so beleaguered by accusations of human-rights<br>abuses that they have taken steps to limit their citizens' access to the<br>Internet, the main forum where all these grievances are aired out in the<br>first place.<br><br>For Europe and America, globalization has enabled them to impart their<br>democratic ideals upon third-world countries and developing nations.<br>Colonization no longer takes the form of naval fleets and booming cannons.<br>The simple email has replaced it.  It is a sad fact though, that<br>globalization has had very little effect on humans being more open-minded.<br>Communities have formed very dangerous opinions about themselves - a<br>superiority complex that only manages to alienate countries that are poorer<br>and less developed.<br><br>Today, it is somewhat fashionable to label Islam as an archaic faith that is<br>totally incompatible with the phenomenon of modernization. The newspapers<br>and magazines abound with articles that point accusingly at countries like<br>Afghanistan, Indonesia, Iran and Iraq as vivid examples. In fact, the vast<br>majority of nations that are plunked into the third-world category have<br>Muslims as their leaders. It would seem to many that Islam is the deciding<br>factor, or indeed the barrier between enlightenment and obsolescence. But<br>Muslim apologists would argue that the appalling plight of the Muslim<br>nations is caused by the pervasive influence of western idealism and yes,<br>Islam's number one public enemy; the state of Israel.<br><br>In a very real way, the fashionable impression of Islam in the eyes of<br>non-Muslims, and the apologists' arguments are both sides of what is really<br>the same coin. Both views, however, are not entirely correct, and are the<br>musings of people who are too lazy to dig deeper into the matter.<br><br>Islam is not a retrograde religion that suppresses women's rights,<br>discourages secular education and permits nepotism. In fact, Islam is the<br>direct opposite of everything that has been said about it. All the negative<br>attributes that have crept into contemporary ideology are the result of<br>human failings and the atrocious mistakes that some have committed in<br>interpreting the Quran. Instead of letting Islam guide their paths, some<br>people have chosen to subvert the religion to their own aspirations and use<br>it, more often than not, as a tool to launch their political careers.<br><br>The Muslim apologists are wrong too in thinking that the backwardness of the<br>umma (the Muslim community) is caused only by western secularism and obscure<br>Zionist plots. What an oversimplification this is! Those factors may play a<br>part, but the largest share of blame must come from within the umma itself.<br><br>Why is this so? More importantly, what are the features that contribute to<br>the relative "weakness" of the umma today? There are two main components.<br><br>1. An introverted umma<br>2. Muslim disunity<br><br>I have already touched on the first component; introverted umma, in my<br>previous essay entitled "Do Muslims Love Themselves too much?", so I shall now focus on Muslim disunity.<br><br>It is a sad thing to note that the umma today is splintered into numerous<br>divisions- lines that demarcate race, nationality, family, sects and a whole<br>plethora of other distinctions. In relation to this trend, the Prophet once<br>said:<br><br>"The Jews were divided into seventy-one or seventy-two sects, and the<br>Christians were divided into seventy-one or seventy-two sects, and my Ummah<br>will be divided into seventy-three sects."<br><br>One must not take the numbers literally, of course. It does not mean that<br>the Jews are really divided into seventy-odd sects and the Muslims will be<br>divided into seventy-three sects exactly. What the Prophet was trying to<br>convey was the realization that the Muslim community will be even more<br>divided than both the Hebrew and Christian communities. It was not a cry of<br>victory, but one of lament. Disunity, after all, nurtures weakness and a low<br>self-esteem. In a brutal world, it is the Achilles heel that enemies will<br>undoubtedly exploit. This is probably why the western nations find it so<br>easy to play one Arab country against another. The chinks are already there<br>to find, and it is human nature to drive a wedge between these chinks to<br>keep them open and festering.<br><br>Disunity has and always will be a social malaise that will only get worse if<br>the community that is afflicted does not take concrete steps to eradicate<br>the problem. Unfortunately, even in countries that purport to be Islamic,<br>Muslims represent an economic and political minority. They seldom agree on<br>anything. There is no cohesive and coherent solidarity to speak of, and as a<br>result, the so-called phenomenon of modernization cannot take place.<br><br>Why do I say this?<br><br>It is a fact that for its people to engage in inventive and progressive<br>pursuits, a community must first be comfortable with itself and confident of<br>its strength. Disunity is an illness that imposes a gnawing insecurity on<br>the hearts and minds. Muslims who live in an environment where religious<br>groups aggressively vie for popular political support are constantly<br>assailed by varied and often confusing messages. The problem is exacerbated<br>tenfold if the masses are not educated properly. It is therefore, not an<br>accident that deviant teachings of Islam consistently crop up in the rural<br>parts of countries.<br><br>In the Quran, God clearly condemns disunity.<br><br>"And lo! This, your religion is one religion and I am your Lord, so keep your<br>duty unto Me. But they (mankind) have broken their religion among them into<br>sects, each group rejoicing in its tenets" (Quran 23:52)<br><br>"As for those who divide their religion and break up into sects, thou hast<br>no part in them in the least: their affair is with God: He will in the end<br>tell them the truth of all that they did." (Quran 6:159.12)<br><br>"But people have cut off their affair (of unity), between them, into sects:<br>each party rejoices in that which is with itself." (Quran 23:53.13)<br><br>One of the symptoms of disunity is a chronic resentment for authority. The<br>Prophet warned about this and even went so far as to denounce acts of<br>rebellion; knowing that it would lead to much chaos and unnecessary<br>bloodshed:<br><br>"It has been narrated on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that the messenger of<br>Allah (may peace be upon him) said: One who found in his Amir something<br>which he disliked should hold his patience, for one who separated from the<br>main body of the Muslims even to the extent of a handspan and then he died<br>would die the death of one belonging to the days of Jahiliyya (the dark age<br>before Islam)." (Bukhari &amp; Muslim, Book 20, Number 4559)<br><br>The fault, however, does not lie on the general populace, but rather, on<br>those clergy who insist in teaching an irresponsible form of Islam- one that<br>is paradoxically at odds with reality and in harmony with some form of<br>political aspiration instead. In short, Muslims have relegated Islam to a<br>mere political tool, with which to garner votes and grassroots support. This<br>is the sad plight of Islam today.<br><br>How did this come about? In my previous essay, I mentioned that the umma has been plagued not so much by backwardness, but by<br>inwardness. More and more, the umma has been closing in on itself, so much<br>so that the trend has become virtually indistinguishable from Islam itself.<br>What was once a global Islamic family is now broken up into factions that<br>are based on race, nationality and creed. This is most evident when a<br>government implements schemes that benefit only one race, instead of the<br>whole umma. The Prophet himself condemns such practices.<br><br>"It has been narrated on the authority of Ibn 'Abdullah al-Bajali that the<br>Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: One who is killed under the<br>banner of a man who is blind (to his just cause), who raises the slogan of<br>family or supports his own tribe, dies the death of one belonging to the<br>days of Jahiliyya (the dark age before Islam)." (Bukhari &amp; Muslim, Book 20,<br>Number 4561)<br><br>Race is an illusionary thing. It is flighty and not based on any universal<br>truth except those that are created by men who need superficial expression<br>to stoke their insecurity.<br><br>But this essay is not a censure of any particular race. However, I strongly<br>feel that the direction in which the Muslims have been taking is<br>self-defeating and extremely fatal. One should always be a Muslim first,<br>before being a Chinese, Indian or Malay individual.<br><br>In the Quran's tafsir (concordance), it is recommended that a Muslim<br>community should be led by a Rightful Imam. But it is a sad and almost<br>amusing fact that any Imam who aspires to lead the umma must first face the<br>questions: "Are you a Malay?" and "Do you belong to the Sunni or Shiite<br>Sect?" and "Do you follow the Shafiee or Hanafi School of Thought?"<br><br>Indeed, in such an environment, an environment that the Prophet had already<br>predicted would be the eventual plight of the umma, how can we ever elect a<br>Rightful Imam? No Rightful Imam would ever come about, and this statement is<br>strengthened by the fact that Muslims today seem to be always disagreeing<br>with their own governments.<br><br>But let us not be fatalistic. The belief in fate does not mean that Muslims<br>should resign themselves to the worst lots in life.<br><br>There is a key somewhere, and Muslims must search for that key in order to<br>unlock the vast potential of a community that has suffered from the acts of<br>people who have sabotaged the simple ideology of Islam. There can be no<br>progress until the Muslims take it upon themselves to reach out towards each<br>other and towards those people who form such an integral part of the world<br>outside the umma. This is dawaah (missionary activity) in its simplest, most<br>uncomplicated form.<br><br>With globalization spreading to every corner of the world, it is important<br>for people to have a more practical perspective on world issues. Indeed, one<br>of the requisites for globalization should be the parallel evolution of<br>mankind's thoughts and culture. There can never be any real change if we<br>refuse to treat other cultures, other creeds, other viewpoints on their own<br>terms. Ideas and opinions cannot be suppressed just because they are not<br>pleasant to listen to. The classical umma was a hotbed of opposing opinions<br>and frantic arguments even upon the nature of God. That is the clearest<br>evidence that an Islamic community can succeed and sustain itself. But it is<br>a community that must be dynamic to change and possess a positive attitude<br>towards diversity.<br><br>In this, education is the all-encompassing factor. Each government must take<br>the initiative to develop its own people. Each family must impart upon their<br>offspring the universal value of human life. Instead of focusing on only one<br>particular community in a multi-racial country like Singapore, religious<br>authorities must adopt an open-minded approach by reaching out to the poor<br>and oppressed people of all creeds and cultures.<br><br>Nobody wants violence to happen in Singapore, our beloved country. I love<br>this place, not only because it is a beautiful country, but it is also one<br>of the only nations in the world that manages to have a solid foundation of<br>multi-culturism and multi-ethnicity. When we give up a seat in the MRT, we<br>don't look to see if the person who needs it is a Malay, Indian or Chinese.<br>Our compassion and understanding are our greatest assets. And they will be<br>our most powerful weapons in the fight that is about to come, if it comes.<br>If the whole community, Chinese, Malay, Indian, Muslim, Christian, Hindu,<br>Buddhist treats each other with mutual respect and trust, how strong a<br>foothold can any terrorist group gain in this region?<br><br>In Islam, there is a beautiful concept that is called fitrah.<br><br>"Then set your face upright for religion in the right state-- the nature<br>made by Allah in which He has made men; there is no altering of Allah's<br>creation; that is the right religion, but most people do not know." (Quran<br>30:30)<br><br>Fitrah refers to the nature of man that God has ordained for all mankind.<br>All men were created pure monotheists, but his upbringing and the<br>surroundings push him towards other creeds, other forms of religious<br>expression.<br><br>Fitrah manifests itself when a baby reaches out for his mother's teat for<br>milk; that is a sign of the fitrah working where intelligence has yet to be<br>nurtured. When a human cries out for a god in times of dire peril; that is<br>the person's fitrah reaching out towards the Creator. When the study of<br>genetics established the fact that all animal, plant and human life share<br>the same genetic language of A (adenine), T (thymine), C (cytosine) and G<br>(guanine), we know that the Creator is One who had established One blueprint<br>for life. Fitrah is all of these and much, much more.<br><br>In a real sense, all of mankind are really brothers and sisters. We<br>descended from a common lineage, and it is only the petty amongst us who<br>find segregation such an important preoccupation.</div>
