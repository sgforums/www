Definitely not for those attracted by the pay or similar.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks to those who reply with their tips.  I've just went into MOE's website and read up their relief teacher scheme.  Very good idea, letting people experience teaching before signing on the dotted line and bonding yourself for 3 years.  And I heard from my friend that Singapore Prisons also have a similar scheme, letting people experience the work before committing themselves.  If only the SPF allowed the same thing before bonding me for 5 years...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

MOE approval takes about 2 to 3 weeks, then you either wait for them to call (which is highly impossible) or you go to the schools you are interested in teaching and register with them. Most have a waiting list and require you to fill up some forms. They will call you when they need you. I believe you are working now right? So it might be quite difficult for you to do relief teaching at the same time cos the demand is pretty variable and they can even call you early in the morning to ask if you can rush down. If you are lucky they'll tell you a few days in advance.<br><br>The experience was pretty interesting. You can do two things if you are a relief teacher:<br>1) Be the typical relief teacher and babysit them (ie go in and greet them then tell them they are free to do their own work or just hand them a worksheet and tell them to passup their work to their teacher when he/she comes back)<br>2) Ask the HOD or check if the teacher you are relieving requires you to cover some topics and try your hand at preparing a lesson and teaching it to the class.<br><br>I too wanted to see if teaching was a viable career option for me so I did option 2 and found the experience rather fufilling but of course it must be noted that relief teaching absolves you of alot of the other duties associated with normal teaching duties like being in charge of CCAs, doing work schemes, lesson plans, student welfare etc... No harm trying if you have the time and moreover the pay isn't too bad.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
