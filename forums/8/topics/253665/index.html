            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Peepz. Im just curious...and i wanna soul search on whats really wrong.When girls and guys gets into something serious,like before they enter and after they enter a rellationship.<br><br>Oftenly we realise that guys Love the what we call "Wooing period of a relationship"And when they are told to have commitment...we panic.I dont know if its just for me...but i realised it.<br><br>What could be the causes for such a reaction...and how do we solve it?<br>How many times have u gone through a relationship not knowing what to do next...<br><br>To me Girls are the wierdest,yet cutest creatures on earth.And yet they cause the most problems....Girl likes to think of the wider picture and they want men to give them a sense of security...they want everything to be just right...not too much and not too little of something...when they say ok they really meant no...when they tell u its ok they mean "I think you better self reflect and think about it." and sometimes they really just want u to know everything...they put u in all types of test before they actually settle with u...and i dont mean getting into a relationship.Some does all these only after you are in a relationship...What we would love to call "the honeymoon period".And after that so called best period of a relationship they will put u through all types of test...Girls Love to be showed another part of u....Like if u look like the type of cool guy and sweet...they would u want to appear like u need them and hide behind them....And they always say "Dear Just be yourself".Oh please=P<br><br>You know there are ways to spend the easiest ways to make someone close to you happy...they dont need u to buy them expensive gifts all the time...cause once u do that...whenever you dont...they would think sigh he dosen't love me that much anymore...not knowing that "God dam 5 bucks in my wallet"...Well start small...buy the cheap stuff first and occasionally...u give a sudden suprise of more expensive goods.<br><br>Theres really alot more to Girls then u can imagine...<br><br>Guys are much easier to understand i guess...For the era..We are the more simple type...the type that really just hates to quarrel and rather just say sorry and get it over....But if u continue...we will still try to apologise and if you hit the limit good heavens....<br><br>Theres the other type of guy...the know it all guy...He Appears to know everything...his sweet,understanding,caring and have a super sense of humour...This is the shy flirt...he knows whats his doing...he does the sweetest things at the right moment...he is able to manipulate the situation and make the girl fall horridly deep into love...and once he gets it...he takes a leave...of cause im not saying this always happens but....theres alot of this type of guys...but what can we say...they get the girls....<br><br>I have once got through the most horrid relationship in life...<br>This girl i wont say who...Had the wierdest character and the wierdest parents.The mum was on prozac and sometimes looked alittle insane to me....<br>And the girl...was simply beautiful...she was a eurasian and well how many chances do u get to meet someone like that...They made me cook dinner/join a religion/Get medicine which i had to walk for...and they scolded me all the time...they would call me at any point of the day to run errands...while because i dident want to get the girl scolded i had to help her do her housework...wash the dishes.cook etc...just so she could go online and chat with other guys and flirt the living crap outta them...well yes its retarded isent it?And yet in my mind all i could think was if i love her more she would change but sad to say it dident...If your ever caught in a situation like that let it pass...because frankly speaking if u hold on the only one suffering is u...and pointless...and apparently she made love to a couple of guys while we were together...Life is always full of suprises and u never know that ur falling too deep...what im saying is...if u ever put 100 pc of ur time on someone...better make sure its worth it...or else your just gonna go back to square one...<img src="http://xbb.xanga.com/95ed947305135121978581/t87986607.jpg"></div>
