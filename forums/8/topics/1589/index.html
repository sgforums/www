            <div class='col-md body'>My first time.  I hope I don't offend anyone as I am a guy telling my story.  We all know we wouldn't mind hearing/reading a girls tales about her first time....but since I'm a guy I know it won't be so exciting to read.<br><br>This post is more of a manual for what not to do during ur "first time".<br><br>It was with this girl I met in University.  She was this bi-sexual from my class and for some reason, the first time we talked, I just felt this beating in my heart that I had never felt before.  I felt like I had known her before..maybe in some other life.  It was such a spiritual experience for me.  She told me later that she felt the same way and said that her heart always beats so fast around me and she's never been so excited about going to class just to see me.<br><br>Anyway, to cut a long story short...We went out many, many times and really loved each other.  It wasn't until a month and a half later that we did it.  For some reason, she had this impression that I was this really experienced guy....I never told her the truth about this...:-)  mainly because she pointed it out so strongly.  But the fact was, I was a total virgin...in every way possible.<br><br>She had just moved out of her parents house and into her own apartment when we did it.  I was sleeping there with her on her bed(which we had done many times, but we neevr did it.) and she just went and asked me to "make love to her"....<br><br>I've seen 1000's of porno films before(USA got everywhere), so I thought that it would be a piece of cake.  I was so nervous and very scared, but very excited and had super or uber-butterflys in my stomach... She was also very excited about me finally doing it to her, and spent 5 minutes or more fumbling with the condom package...Tehn i tried to help her open it and we both ended up dropping it over and over again....<br><br>...for christs sake!!!  When I think about it, it was just one damn condom...how difficult could it be.  They even have the tear here mark on it.....:-)<br><br>Eventually we got it opened and we got naked.  She lay down on the bed and spread her legs.  Man, to me, it was the most beautiful sight that I had ever set mine eyes upon.  I whipped out my cock and placed the condom over the head of my (now erect for 10 minutes)cock.  I was so excited it wasn't funny.  I don't remember ever being so excited before.  (I was 19 or 20...can't really remeber but it was after I left Singapore to go back to USA after I graduated from the international school here.)<br><br>The thing was that, as I was rolling the condom over my cock head, it started to shrivel up....!!!!My God!!!!I had no idea why!!! Most times it can even stand by itsef wheteher I want it to or not, but here I was the greatest day of my life and it wasn't going to stand!!!!:-)  It's really funny when I think back about it.<br><br>So what I diod to hide my shame was to turn around and pretend to put it on as I was inching my way to her open legs with my back facing her...Man, what she must have been thinking at that time.<br><br>I yurned around and pulled the blanket over us as I got on my knees.  Lucky that theblanket was covering my shame.  I just kept fumbling with my now limp penis and trying in futile to roll the, by now unrolled, condom over my limp brother.<br><br>By now, she was asking me to "put it in"....ARgh!!!!!Putwhat In!!!!  I had nothing to put in...it was all limpas hell.<br><br>By some miracle, the little guy managed to get half-erect and the condom somehow slipped over it.  Then as I tried to guide my member into her waiting ...uh...vagina (trying to use the correct word here), it started to shrink again.  God, I was happy that the blanket was still covering me.  she must have been wondering why the hell I kept blushing...:-)<br><br>Finally I managed to shove my condom covered, semi-erect cock in after finally finding where I was supposed to put it.  I then thought that this was it.  The defining moment of any guys life.  his first experience.  I visuallised myself as one of those big porno studs and started to pump myslef in and out in what seemed to me like an eternity...and she came and came ....<br><br>ha ha, but really...In truth my visualising myself as a big porno stud to boost my confidence didn't help me in my performance.  After 2 or three strokes in and out,...I was finished....HOT DAMNED!!!!<br><br>I was thinking, what the hell happened????So fast?????If I was thinking that, Imagine what she was thinking (she was very experienced..beleive me-u don't want to know by how much).  It wasn't ike my cock was even going all the way inside either.  AS I said, it was still half limp.<br><br>Man,  I felt like a  total dork...which I was.:-)  Later on, I called my best,equally dorky, friend who had never even come close to having a GF. I was so happy!!!:-), but I wa really embarrassed.  Man, He kept making fun of me...telling me that I should have told myslef I was this big porn stud John Holmes, who has a 9 inch cock.  I told him I was imagining I was a stud, but it didn't help...man....<br><br>So that was my first experience.  My second time wasn't so great either.  I didn't know how to move....dohhhh!!!!...and it about 3 strokes more than the first time....doh!!!!!!!!!<br><br>I usually tell people this story about my first time...not because I'm so pervert or whatever, but I find that it's really funny...and could prove a good example of what not to have happen when u go for it the first time...<br><br>I hope some of u got a good laff from it...cause I was chuckling away while I was writing it...<br><br>Cheers all. and I hope I didn't offend too much.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What can I say ? A well-described story indeed...succint, humourous and many proper biological terms were used. Indeed it can represent a good guide to what-to-do and what-not-to-do during love making !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>So your first experience was at 18 or 19 huh ? That's rather young I would say...I am almost 24 and still never even held a girl's hand before, much less strip for her to see hahaha....<br><br>The problem with experienced girls may be that they demand a lot from the guy to satisfy them, and as a result the guy gets very stressed up (sort of like your situation *grin*). In the end, you get so self-conscious and your own performance that you may fail to really enjoy the act.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Also glad to know you practise safe sex.....always good to hear that !<br><br>As for the rather horny girls who wanted to have a fling with you, I would say that yours was a wise choice. I can't deny the temptation would be there if I were in your shoes (more so if they were pretty and sexy) but to actually go to their house to "watch movies"...well I think it might "cheapen" your image (no offense). Look at it from a guy's point of view - if a girl gives her body away so freely, the guy usually will lose respect for her. Same case may apply here although horny girls may think differently from guys in general (This is just an assumption !).......KUDOS to you anyway for your decision...whether attributed to dorkiness or dumbness or whatever.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>My first time would probably still be a long way off....unless a girl decides to attempt to seduce me for whatever reasons !! Hahaha...let's hope I can resist the urge if it really happens ! =P<br><br>LOL....what a fun topic...cheers everyone !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It wasn't long after that experience that we broke off.  We did get very much closer..more than I thought possible.  For people who have been folowing my post.  She was the girl that broke off with me for another guy (ang mor) because I was just too slow on the uptake and she had to make all the moves in our relationship...I would have to agree.  We did it a few more times, but didn't really get a chance to become expert yet...:-)  Also I had to come back to singapore to further studies.  I didn't like the university in the states...Don't ask...I don't really know why...but I just missed singapore so much.:-)<br><br>Anyway, we ended never talking or writing again.  the only one that i was never able to keep as a friend afterwards.  I tried many times to contact her, but I could never get her, and the letters I wrote never got a reply.  I got really frustrated and angry because I was worried about her(still loved her a lot) cuz she was getting mixed up with all these drugs with the new guy...so naturally I thought the worst when she never replied.  It was a cruel thing to do to me, but..I wrote her a final message that said some not so nice things (totally out of character for me) and tyhat was it.  I just let her out of my mind....But soetimes I still feel that same feeling that I used to feel for her...and even though it happened in SanFrancisco, when I walk around somewhere in Sinagproe, I find myslef thinking abnd feeling her again in my heart....Especially when it's raining and I'm watching the rain hitting the window pane...<br><br>In my own way, I stioll love her very much and always will, as I will always love all my x-GF's...the feeeling never dies...it changes, but it's still there...buried deep inside.<br><br>As for the sex/love.  She was my ultimate first man...and even tho I made an utter fool of myself, I still cherish it and it holds a great part in my heart and mind.<br><br>AS for her being a bi-sexual, she's still dating the guy (must be 5 years now)but she's also seeing a bunch of other people..or so my sisters good friend is telling me (he's one of her BF).<br><br>That's it...my story.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually I had loads of fun.  I have really good memories from that time...Really fond and warm memories that I would never want to forget.<br><br>Sitting at the cafeteria watching chicks walk by...with their frat boyfriends!!!<br><br>Met some really interesting characters who are really young adults.  Going to university overseas brings a change for people.  It almost seems that once u enter, there is a major fundamental change in lifestyle in terms of independence and u just wanna live...it's a really wonderful feeling...and it's perpetuated by being there with people who feel the same way as u do.<br><br>Also, i felt that finally  there was some place that I felt that I belonged...at least more-so than anywhere else.  Altho I love San Fran, and it's where my heart will always be,...I always felt lonely...like the country was alien to me...and the people were alien to me...When I came to Singapore, I just automatically felt that this was where I was meant to be.  Where my being asian makes me one of everyone.  I guess there's less of that feeling of alienation...but I still don't feel like I belong totaly.  Not much, but a bit more...and that's made all the difference..or else I wouldn't stay here...low pay for professionals, few friends(had to rebuild when I moved here)...not an easy thing to do.<br><br>Also, I loved the shopping malls, and YES...Especially the girls....Singaporean girls are so breautiful!!!:-)<br><br>No, I loved it.  Studying here is not anywhere near the experience that it was over there...but I really did miss Singapore.  I just couldn't forget it...how safe and secure I felt.  ...but I still really miss my friends from that time.<br><br>There u have it..:-)<br><br>Happy ...well, happy anything:-)<br><br>[This message has been edited by firewire (edited 02 November 1999).]</div>
