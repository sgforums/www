As such each has it's own agenda how he plays to win, so why should I listen to anybody who recommend to me such and such company just because he has a claim to being somebody with a title or has X number of years of experience or wears a business suit and goes on the evening news to talk abt it.<br><br>The only way anybody makes money from shares is when they cash in their paper gains by selling off their positions on the stock market.

If you wan more than that and quite defensible ie not prone to speculation then REITS are next best choice.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The CPF strategy</span><br><br>If you have small 20-50k CPF idling the best way that I see is to invest it in REITS and collect dividends every quarter. The dividends collected you cannot spend on your private shopping but instead will flow directly back into CPF which is good because CPF pays you interest of 3-4% on outstanding balances. So actually you have a share which will slowly appreciating in value, faithfully pays dividends to your CPF a/c which earns interest here and you are also constantly contributing to it while working. You can look forward to a fairly nice retirement egg in your old and grey years.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The lower your cost strategy</span><br><br>Say you are not earning much dun have much savings but you want to invest to lower your cost of living. You can try the transport stocks like SMRT or SBS, these counter is quite defensible and dividends which you collect would be just abt what you paid to ride MRT for the whole year. So in the end rode  almost for free.<br><br></div>
