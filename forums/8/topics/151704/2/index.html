            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mistyblue:</div><div class="quote_body">Oh i got that kind of racist sh!t from spgs/spm locally and overseas ...<br>Let me put it this way, they are b!tches and they don't know it. I say to hell with these shallow people and all the better they take their attitude and breed over in those ang moh/foreign countries and take all sorts of sh!t there. But if the local men keep complaining and whinning about all this ... it only makes them stand out as losers... and not winners of the hearts of the true gals who are good.  If local guys cannot hold themselves above these remarks ... then I have to doubt their "quality" as well.<br><br>Just as M'sia/Indonesia somethimes unscathering remarks about sg. We can get angry but we do not need to react. We can band closer together or break apart. whatever. But mostly we should always choose our fights and not let every little things bother us so much.<br><br>These women/men who are racist against their own color, are unworthy of my mind to even make me process their existance.  They are not going to be my friends or even anything closer. Their life is their choice. Why should I even be bothered about them? That is the point I do not understand about guys here where they get so worked up over these people to the extent of saying spiteful things against all the local gals - ie imported/foreign gal are better and blah... Serious most of the local gals don't care. If the local guys are confident of themselves, why should they worry about comparisons or even a little degoratory remarks from stupid people. They compare local women to foreign ones as well and we all know there are so much more degoratory remakrs about local gals. Did all the girls slam the guys  or get all worked up? Did the guys simply keep reinforcing their narrow biased views?<br><br>But what is the secret of getting a gal...  that is for every case, something the guy has to find out and not blame society or every gal out there ...<br><br>Nothing shocking. I do not like racism and I will not condone it from whites and especially non-white. I might understand whites having being racist as they are mostly stupid people. But to have my own race do it against me is most insulting. But I should also alter my perception and not have such a high standard of my own race...<br><br>I simply also choose to support my own race because I had dealt with lots of  foreign white sh!t<br></div></blockquote>Its not so much about being confidence. I'm sure the ego covers enough to fool others into thinking these guys in question is confident. Ironic but true.<br><br>Its the constant iteration of the fact that certain races are inferior. An example is that I was from a local JC. Every knows that CJC has the highest abortion rates. Who did a proper research to substantiate that? Everyone accepts that as fact. My 2 years in CJC, I did not encounter any abortion cases and trust me, I was very in the loop when it comes to such gossips. Frankly, there are no abortions going on there! We are not even allowed to enter the student hostels and to ensure that no one climbs into the hostel premises, there is a full time guard sitting there just to watch the gate! Yet everyone still keep saying that CJC gals are loose (in every sense) and that all guys in CJC has slept around a lot.<br><br>Similarly, if everyone, whites and yellow gals, browns and blacks keep saying that chinese are inferior, then at some indetermined time, it will soon be accepted as fact. That warrants preemtive action by those subjected to the negative result of such slanderous remarks. Some guys choose to ignore it, some shoose to whine, others choose to become b!tchy. I'm not saying that the response you see is the best, but bearing in mind human nature, you cannot expect those subjected people to sit around and do nothing, even if it is the best course of action. right?</div>
