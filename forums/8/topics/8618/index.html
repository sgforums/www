            <div class='col-md body'>I tink those operational infantry units shld be using them by now ... seen them carrying it ... weight wise its ard the same as the M16 but I haveta agree its a rather delicate piece of weapon. Wonderz if all the high tech additions will survive harsh conditions n handling ... reminds me of the aiming sight for the M203 grenade launcher ... kinda easy to lose n break ... mayb the SA21 is more suitable for special ops n not mainstream infantry use</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No weapon is good until it has proven itself. Same goes for the SAR21 and Bionix.<br><br>Its cool wif all it's addons, laser targeting scope, plastic magazine behind carrying handle so it won't IA and watnots.<br><br>But it lookz damn delicate, one drop and the whole gun will crack to bits, and explode the moment u pull the trigger.<br><br>M16 is still everybody'z choice, no matter how goddamned long it is and complains about it swinging around while doing yur SOC. Trusty, battle-proven and battle-worthy and rugged.<br><br>These are the 3 deciding factors whether the SAR21 is a flip or a flop. Until US test it in future combats, most guys would still entrust their lifes to their old wife instead of the 'new mistress'</div>

When I held the prototype one it felt lighter than the M16 though. I dunno when we'll be using it at all, scully reservist 13 years over never use..hhaha no surprise.</div>

It'z been out for sometime already though and I dun think I've ever heard of anyone handling it yet.<br><br>My friend who was in yesterdayz NDP complained the weapon being:<br><br>1) A damn heavy piece of plastic<br>2) Very fragile and delicate (drop have to sign extra)<br><br>Watz it wif u guys here? Any comments on this gun for those who've handled it?</div></blockquote>Yeah yeah, we've all read about the latest in high-tech weaponry. About this gadget and that gizmo. The problem is the cost though. Outfitting the entire army with an expensive rifle that might not work, no way. Maybe only specialised units should use them. Let them be the first to find out if the thing doesn't work in the field!<br><br>The old stuff still works pretty well. Like the weapons guerrillas and terrorists use: AK-47, GPMG, TOW Rocket Launchers, Fragmentation Grenades...as far I can tell, the less electronics in a weapon, the better. Would you put your life on the line by using a weapon that can be rendered useless by a few fried resistors? Doesn't sound good to me.<br><br>[This message has been edited by KTE (edited 11 August 2000).]</div>
