              <p>Well you can choose to study at your nearest home 's community centre. I am sure that there bound to have either an air-con reading room or study corner inside the CC for you to study. Also since you mention anywhere near Choa Chu Kang, I remember that a few years ago, there is an "best" quiet and air-con study room open for public at Blk 15 Teck Whye Lane where you can get there through the linkway via Blk 17 Teck Whye Lane or The Methodist Church Of The Incarnation (correct me if I am wrong). I remember that the back of Blk 15 is Choa Chu Kang Zone 2 RC office, Telephone : 67622594</p>
              <p>However for your info unfortunately for you, recently tech whye lane is under going upgrading by Array Engineering &amp; Construction Pte Ltd, and I heard that the study room is temporary shift to Blk 20 Teck Whye Lane near the cosy corner where the senior citizen gather due to inconvenience cause by the upgrading, and the study room look like an made up/built in room most probably create by the upgrading construction worker. You might like to call 1800 7675571 as mention on the upgrading notice if you want to know the actual location of blk 20 study room and use it if you cannot find it. The one at Blk 15, their room seem to be locked with metal gate and not sure it will still be open on weekday or who to contact to use it.Hope after upgrade the facilities is better than new neighbourhood.</p>

              <p>so we are both referring to the same place for lvl 2..</p>
              <p>thanks for highlighting the individual tables..i don't think i'll need it since i'm going with a fren to discuss about business..so need place for 2 person..</p>
              <p>btw, RP libarary, near the tables there, is there sufficient power points for every table?</p>
              <p>as for it being noisy, it's okay, at least there's a library where people can talk and discuss openly without concern of the public library rule of complete silence</p>
              <p>i know that in the individual tables, if i didn't remember wrongly, there is under the table..so does it applies to the round tables as well?</p>

              <p>Well you can choose to study at your nearest home 's community
              centre. I am sure that there bound to have either an air-con
              reading room or study corner inside the CC for you to study. Also
              since you mention anywhere near Choa Chu Kang, I remember that a
              few years ago, there is an "best" quiet and air-con study room open
              for public at Blk 15 Teck Whye Lane where you can get there through
              the linkway via Blk 17 Teck Whye Lane or The Methodist Church Of
              The Incarnation (correct me if I am wrong). I remember that the
              back of Blk 15 is Choa Chu Kang Zone 2 RC office, Telephone :
              67622594</p>
              <p>However for your info unfortunately for you, recently tech whye
              lane is under going upgrading by Array Engineering &amp;
              Construction Pte Ltd, and I heard that the study room is temporary
              shift to Blk 20 Teck Whye Lane near the cosy corner where the
              senior citizen gather due to inconvenience cause by the upgrading,
              and the study room look like an made up/built in room most probably
              create by the upgrading construction worker. You might like to call
              1800 7675571 as mention on the upgrading notice if you want to know
              the actual location of blk 20 study room and use it if you cannot
              find it. The one at Blk 15, their room seem to be locked with metal
              gate and not sure it will still be open on weekday or who to
              contact to use it.Hope after upgrade the facilities is better than
              new neighbourhood.</p>

              <p>so we are both referring to the same place for lvl 2..</p>
              <p>thanks for highlighting the individual tables..i don't think i'll need it since i'm going with a fren to discuss about business..so need place for 2 person..</p>
              <p>btw, RP libarary, near the tables there, is there sufficient power points for every table?</p>
              <p>as for it being noisy, it's okay, at least there's a library where people can talk and discuss openly without concern of the public library rule of complete silence</p>
              <p>i know that in the individual tables, if i didn't remember wrongly, there is under the table..so does it applies to the round tables as well?</p>
