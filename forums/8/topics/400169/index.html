            <div class='col-md body'><p>Off-Topic here:<br><br>Singapore used to have ban on video arcades before. It was imposed on 1 Sep 1983, citing the bad and harmful effects on video games, which influence young children &amp; teenagers (eg. playing truant in school, stealing money to support the habit). The government ordered to shut down all remaining 48 arcade game outlets by the end of August 1983, in order to curb the addiction of video gaming. Parents were very concerned for children who usually spends "useless" time at an arcade and does not even benefit to the society.<br><br>However, with the ban, people would flock to computer shops to rent the computers, but only serious customers would be allowed such as word-processing &amp; programming. In the course of the ban, educational softwares were allowed as long as any games that would not harm the children and becoming a serious addiction resulting in the influential of arcade games.<br><br>Other countries also did consider the ban of video arcade games such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Thailand &amp; Phillippines.</p></div>

              <p>Off-Topic here:<br> <br> Singapore used to have ban on video arcades before. It was imposed
              on 1 Sep 1983, citing the bad and harmful effects on video games,
              which influence young children &amp; teenagers (eg. playing truant
              in school, stealing money to support the habit). The government
              ordered to shut down all remaining 48 arcade game outlets by the
              end of August 1983, in order to curb the addiction of video gaming.
              Parents were very concerned for children who usually spends
              "useless" time at an arcade and does not even benefit to the
              society.<br> <br> However, with the ban, people would flock to computer shops to rent
              the computers, but only serious customers would be allowed such as
              word-processing &amp; programming. In the course of the ban,
              educational softwares were allowed as long as any games that would
              not harm the children and becoming a serious addiction resulting in
              the influential of arcade games.<br> <br> Other countries also did consider the ban of video arcade games
              such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Thailand &amp;
              Phillippines.</p>
