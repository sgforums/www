            <div class='col-md body'>I thought I was being maniac about replying calls but it seems that it is impossible to find a man who will call after he say he will.  When I call someone's handphone/page him and he doesn't pick it up and he doesn't call me back until the next day, it gets me dissapointed and sad.  Firstly, obviously he's not as eager to talk to me as I to him and secondly it's worrying me because I think everyone would get back to someone he likes as soon as possible.  I wouldn't mind getting just a 30 seconds call if he's really busy.<br><br>Is it too much to expect guys to reply calls?  Or am I being a pest and the electronic ringing things have been made in hell to allay my paranoia?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maya, seems to me that he might just be playing a little mind game with you to help spice up the relationship. It boosts his ego to realise that you are concerned about the fact of him not getting back to you. Hee, there is also a possibility that he is just testing if your heart is still with him (I'm assuming that you two are going out). If you don't make a little fuss out of it, he might start wondering if you still care about him as much. On the other hand, he might just want to pull away for a short while. Give him a little space. It is perfectly normal. I learn this through the hard way...<br><br>I understand it feels really sucky to wait in vain for a much wanted phone call from your loved one. Hope you don't have go through this too often. Otherwise, you really need to find a good time to let him know your feeling about it.<br><br>Just my point of view. Hope it helps. Have a beautiful weekend. =)</div>

I think I don't do this because of wanting to track his every movement.

            <div class='col-md body'>Heya MayaJ,<br><br>Dunno where to insert this, so I'll risk being a social pariah and venture off-topic on this thread. Or mebbe it'll even be appropriate.<br><br>Just came back from a prolonged vacation.<br><br>Stayed in the background for a few days. But I see no one around anymore. Colette, T-man, Proddy, Rinoa, Bishamon and all the friendly people are ... *weeps*... gone.<br><br>Seems like there is a sudden big influx of newbies in just one month, and the topics and the postings are declining in quality. Even the flames are lamer than usual. "Kitty's email", "Tet's Veiny Arms" and the longest flirting thread all died out.<br><br>Oh well, such is the nature of forums.<br><br>Should I resume posting?<br><br>Anyone?<br>Barclays<br><br>------------------<br>Welcome to the Afterlife Voice Mail System.
