            <div class='col-md body'>I've Come To Accept That...<br><br>... everybody has dreams, but not everyone is able to realise his/her dreams.<br>... some people just have everything going for them while the rest can struggle through their whole life and come to nothing.<br>... the rich will be richer while the poor poorer.<br>... you may not like what you're doing now, but you just have to continue with it because you have no other choice, and because you do not dare to stray off the "normal" path.<br>... you may not like the path that you have chosen, but many a time, you can't change it because circumstances do not allow you to change it.<br>... there are people who have no idea what they are doing but will eventually succeed in life, while those who think they know what they are doing may eventually come up to naught.<br>... no matter what everyone says otherwise, looks does count to some extent.<br>... those with pretty faces always seem to have it easier.<br>... there will never be total equality between the sexes.<br>... the intensity of our relationships with the people around us change with time and environment.<br>... the person who was once your best friend may turn out to be a stranger, or worse, your enemy.<br>... relationships (friends, love, etc) have to be carefully maintained, like your precious car, otherwise they will become all wrecked up before you know it.<br>... while you may think you have many friends, think again, do you really?<br>... while you think you know a person really well, the truth may turn out to be otherwise.<br>... you can never find a person who is 100% truthful to you.<br>... there are more hypocrites around you than you realise or wish to admit.<br>... you can choose your friends but you can't choose your family.<br>... all parents love their children, but to varying degrees for each child. i.e. parents play favouritism, they don't love their children equally.<br>... one should be satisfied just knowing that one is loved even though one might be loved less than one's sibling(s) because there are orphans out there who have never known a parent's love.<br>... the world will never be a better place as long as humans are part of it.<br>... what is seen as progress may actually be a regression of humankind.<br>... there are more things out there I do not know about, much much more than the things I know.<br>... there are some things you do that others will think are sheer silliness, but as long as you think they are worth your time and effort, just do it!<br>... it is very hard to take care of everyone's feelings. Sometimes, no matter how hard you try, the things you do will hurt someone in one way or other.<br>... the saying "Money is not everything, but without money you have nothing" is very true.<br>... simply accepting the dire situation you're in makes you a loser.<br>... trying to change a dire situation does not necessarily make you a winner.<br>... you just can't rush some things. If it's meant to be yours, you'll get it eventually. If it's not meant to be yours, you'll never find it even if you try hard.<br>... like it or not, there are some things you just have to let go of.<br>... constantly looking back and thinking about what you should have done and what you should not have done in the past brings nothing but regrets. The more often you think back, the more regrets you will have.<br>... we are always taught to look to the future, but thinking about the future inevitably brings up the past and the regrets of past that many are more than willing to forget. Like it or not, we will always be stuck in this vicious circle of thoughts as long as we live.<br>... even though I hate the way the society works, I still have to live in it no matter what. I can't just go and die, can I?<br>... trying to solve problems by death is sheer escapism and a totally selfish thing to do. While you might think all your troubles have been solved with your departure from this world, you have given the people around you nothing but more trouble and grief, as though there is not enough to deal with without you adding to it.<br>... things are always easier said than done.<br>... there are far too many things out there that you wish to change but can't, so just accept it! That's life!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Extracted: A Lesson In Life<br>Sometimes people come into your life and you know right away that they were meant to be there, they serve some sort of purpose, to teach you a lesson or help figure out who you are or who you want to become. You never know who these people may be - your roommate, neighbor, professor, long lost friend, lover or even a complete stranger who, when you lock eyes with them, you know that very moment that they will affect your life in some profound way.<br><br>And sometimes things happen to you and at the time they may seem horrible, painful and unfair, but in reflection you realize that without overcoming those obstacles, you would have never realized your potential, strength, will power or heart. Everything happens for a reason. Nothing happens by chance or by means of good or bad luck. Illness, injury, love, lost moments of true greatness and sheer stupidity - all occur to test the limits of your soul. Without these small tests, if they be events, illnesses or relationships, life would be like a smoothly paved, straight, flat road to nowhere. Safe and comfortable but dull and utterly pointless.<br><br>The people you meet who affect your life and the successes and downfalls you experience - they are the ones who create who you are. Even the bad experiences can be learned from. Those lessons are the hardest and probably the most important ones.<br><br>If someone hurts you, betrays you or breaks your heart, forgive them for they have helped you learn about trust and the importance of being cautious to whom you open your heart to. If someone loves you, love them back unconditionally, not only because they love you, but because they are teaching you to love and opening your heart and eyes to things you would have never seen or felt without them.<br><br>Make every day count. Appreciate every moment and take from it everything that you possibly can, for you may never be able to experience it again.<br><br>Talk to people you have never talked to before, and actually listen. Let yourself fall in love, break free and set your sights high. Hold your head up because you have every right to. Tell yourself you are a great individual and believe in yourself, for if you don't believe in yourself, no one else will believe in you either. You can make of your life anything you wish. Create your own life and then go out and live it.<br><br></div>
