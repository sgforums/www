I was admitted to Melbourne Uni, and Monash Uni with scholarship. However, in the end, i studied there for 1 semester , after which i studied in NUS with scholarship as well. I am not a singaporean by the way.<br><br>Do note that Times ranking fluctuates. Please take note that last year NUS was rank higher than Melbourne Uni, and to me, I think National Uni. of Aus is the most prestige Uni in Australia. But this time, even Australia National Uni was rank lower than Melbourne Uni. Only for this particular year, Melbourne Uni is rank higher than NUS &amp; National Uni of Australia.<br><br>I had experience Aus Education system and S'pore, i got to say this, if you think it is easy to obtain first class in NUS, go give a TRY. I got alot of friends who obtained first class from Melbourne Uni, but during Aus Pre U, their result aint that great. For your info, i obtained a TER of 99.85 / 99.99 for my South Australia Matriculation ( Year 11- 12 , Pre U in Aus).<br><br>Conclusion, i believe those who went through A-levels w/wo S-papers is much tougher.<br><br>Cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nothing merry abt boxing day for me, having to book in later.<br><br>Firstly, while I can, I'll like to point out a few things with regards to my comments. I sense that there are a lot of ppl who are clearly in dispution of the Times rankings-which isn't the first time we have heard this and they are not all that wrong. In my view, the times rankings are just a piece of assessment done by an 'independent' org, as such we question upon what basis and what factors were used in that piece of statistic. If some of you were to refer to my previous post, it was the same basis that I was asking Angelo09 for as to his sweeping statement that Aussie Unis are inferior to the local ones. Again, he is fully entitled to his opinion, as all of you are.<br><br>I must also concede pherhaps I was a little, I can't think of a word so I'll just use 'reckless', in quoting Times. I do admit I share the point of view of most of the forumites here that indeed the Times rankings do not clearly reflect the true positions of universities worldwide. I believe there are certain factors that could have factored in to make the rankings more balance that have not been considered. In a nutshell, even though NUS is at 21 or 22, and Melbourne is at 18 or 19, that does not make Melbourne a better versity to NUS. In fact, I do have nothing but firm admiration for individuals who have managed to garner honours from NUS as I have heard how rigrous and demanding it is.<br><br>So what was I trying to say then?<br><br>Actually, what I was trying to bring to Angelo's attention and now to the rest of you here is that I believe that there are merits in both studying locally or in a university in Australia. I shan't go on ranting as most of you would by now know the 'merits' I would raise.<br><br>Truth is, I believe that choosing a university and the course of study for ones further education is an important decision. A decision that shouldn't be taken lightly. However, at the end of the day, can someone who graduates with a degree from University of South Pacific be more successful than a graduate from Havard or Oxford?  Then again, how do u define success? I guess that's a debate for another day.</div>
