              <p>A few months ago, I did some extracurricular work. So I join this committee where we organise something la. This girl, A and a few other people including me was in this committee. I didn't talk to this girl A that much nor did i coordinate with her but we did sit on a round table and discuss some things about it.</p>
              <p>So one day as I was walking home after school, i decided to call my friend through my Iphone. Me and my friend had an argument over some disagreemeent. But while I was walking I saw this girl A, walking towards me, she was late for classes. So while I was on the phone, I automaticallly wave "Hi" to her. But she never responded, she just gave me that strange look and walk away.</p>
              <p>I don't know lah. But suddenly I feel my confidence dented. I want to ask you all, if you met a girl a few times, would you wave hi at her when she walk past you? If you are a girl, what would you think about the guy who waved at her? If you don't know him that well (like doing some committee work) - would you wave back or just ignore him. Or would you think this guy is up to something no good?</p>
              <p>Don't flame me, just give me your most honest feedback especially the females.</p>
              <p>Thankyou.</p>

              <p>this means she is completely strange to you..</p>
              <p>u need to open up yourself and talk more to her when u got the chance ... but before anything happens.....always approach to be her friend without thinking too much into the future...</p>
              <p>gals r like this....they dun like to come straight to your point....no shortcuts...step by step approach to know her...she must first know you and your personality...</p>
              <p>she may already have a bf...so even if this is true...respect that </p>

              Jokingly: maybe she didn't hear probably and thought you said something dirty? Or that you scold vulgar word? You know 'hi' sounds like...?
              
              seriously: what you're having is called infatuation. You can't get here out of your mind. Everything you do, it's her in your mind. Your dream of holding hands with her, walking along the bitch, I mean, beach, and into the. Sunset with wedding bells ringing away in the background.
              But when you come back to reality, it's not wedding bells you hear, but that uncle downstairs selling ice cream.
              This feeling of infatuation will pass.
              
              Dating tip #162: not every girl will respond when you say hi. So no need to feel hurt or discouraged. Out of 10 strangers or acquaintances you said hi, maybe 2 or 3 will respond.
