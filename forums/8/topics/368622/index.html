              <p>Hello to all, I noticed that one of the forummers here, Yiha093, is sharing his story here with everyone, hence I will also be doing the same thing.</p>
              <p>Truthfully speaking, I have a friend of mine whom I have been writing this story for, but I feel that it will be good if more people get to read it.</p>
              <p>I am not a professional writer, so do expect some mistakes here and there, though I hope the reading experience will be enjoyable.</p>
              <p>I will post up the first 9 chapters which I have written for the past 9 weeks here, do expect a new chapter here every week or two.</p>
              <p>Regards,</p>
              <p>D.V.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>“Run! There is no
              freaking time to go back and look for that stupid brother of yours!” Adam
              screamed, as he tried to keep his mind focus as much as possible, with <em>the thing </em>closing down on them from
              behind.<em> </em></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>              </span><span>          </span>Madeline was clearly out of breath,
              but if the two were to stop even for the slightest moment… there would
              definitely not be much left of them within a good minute or two. With that in
              mind, Madeline pushed on ahead, even though her calves were screaming for her
              to just give up. The only thing she could think of is for all these to be just
              another nightmare.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>“Look, we are at the gates!
              It is just a little bit more, don’t die on me now!” Adam screamed a second
              time, as he grabbed hold of Madeline’s right hand, or whatever that is left of
              it, and rushed towards the gates.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>Out of the shadows on
              the ground, <em>something </em>started to take
              on a more solid form in front of them, rising up from the midst of darkness. It
              let out a terrible moan, as gigantic claws started to come out of it.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>“It is the end… I
              should have known better… There is no way that we could have escaped this
              nightmare to begin with…” whimpered Madeline, as tears started flowing down her
              eyes. She could only pray for the safety of Ben, whom she had hidden in the
              local hospital storeroom.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>If only she hadn’t
              agreed to come with the others on this trip, Adam and Ben wouldn’t have to
              suffer with her. It was all her own fault, and she knew it well enough. She
              looked at the gates just ahead; it looked just the same as it was three days
              ago when the entourage passed through it. The gargoyle carvings, with serpents
              wrapped around them; seemed as if they were laughing at her plight right now.
              For all she knew, they could really be laughing at her right now. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                       </span>Adam hugged her and gave
              her a final passionate kiss, as <em>the thing</em> opened itself up – literally – and swallowed both of them into the darkness
              within it.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                       </span>“And now… there is
              none.” the mysterious little one giggled, as it descended back into the
              darkness covering the entire town…</span></strong></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 16pt;" lang="EN-SG">Chapter I</span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“Bla..bla..bla..bla…
                      that is about all I have to say. Any questions?’’ Mr Ted grumbled. It was as if
                      talking was a hard chore for him. And not to mention the group of numbskulls
                      who he had to look after.<span>    </span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“He is full of shit as
                      usual, isn’t he?” lamented Ginger. She wasn’t particularly fond of Mr Ted, the
                      thought of going for a holiday with him tagging along really sucked big time.
                      But there weren’t a lot of choices, as he was the only one familiar with this
                      area. That and the fact that he was her appointed caretaker.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“Cheer up, ello
                      friend! I am coming along too!” With his usual smiling face, Cact came out of
                      the bus toilet. He seemed to be the only one who never had any worries or
                      problems. Ginger often wondered what kept her friend going. To him, it was as
                      if everything could be laughed away.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>The rest of those
                      onboard, which included her chef, her maids, and most importantly, two of her other
                      friends whom she invited along, seemed to be bored out. The bus had been going
                      non-stop for 3 hours, and they were still not even close to their destination. When
                      she asked her parents to let her go on a holiday, she didn’t expect to be sent
                      packing to the middle of nowhere. This looked more like a headache than a trip
                      which she was supposed to enjoy herself along with her friends. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>On the other hand, no
                      one would be able to disturb them, save for the annoying Mr Ted. The entire
                      town was bought down by her parents a few years ago after all. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                </span><span>         </span>‘Well, I was more of expecting a trip
                      to Hawaii or
                      something, but I guess that this would have to do.’ Ginger thought to herself.
                      Who knows, she might find something of interest in the old town. This town used
                      to be a witch-execution ground after all. Those pitiful ones who had been
                      wrongly accused as witches would meet their end here. Condemned to a death
                      which they did not want, maybe their spirits could still be lingering around. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>While Ginger was
                      daydreaming, Cact went to the empty seat beside Remy and sat down right beside
                      him. Remy was busy watching his gay pornography on his laptop again. When he
                      wasn’t doing this, he would be ogling at the guys on his magazines; hence Mr
                      Ted would much prefer him to be somewhere far away from him. Cact was the only
                      guy he wasn’t interested in, for he was the only guy who he could call a
                      friend. <span>  </span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span> </span><span> </span><span>                        </span>“Say, care for a game
                      of House of the Dead?” asked Cact. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>“Sure, but wait for
                      me to be done in the toilet first.” replied Remy.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>“I am not going to
                      complain, but this is the fifth time in 3 hours, you know?” laughed Cact.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>Remy grinned as he
                      went to the toilet to do his own thing. There wasn’t much for him to do after
                      all on this trip, so he had to find some form of ‘entertainment’. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                           </span>While the chefs,
                      maids and other workers had their job to do after reaching town, the group of
                      friends were busy planning out what little adventures they will have there. They
                      could visit every single building, or they could just simply play hide-and-seek
                      using them as hiding spots. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                           </span>‘Screech…BANG!!!’
                      The whole car rocked, as if it had crashed into something.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span> </span><span>                          </span>“Melvin, what are you
                      doing? What have you done this time round?” shouted a clearly agitated Mr Ted.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                           </span>“I am terribly
                      sorry, Mr Ted. It seems that the car has crashed into the remains of a
                      landslide from the mountain. It has been foggy for quite a while, so I have
                      been unable to make out what was ahead.” Replied Melvin, chauffeur of the Sim
                      Family. It wasn’t like him to be so careless. He had been working for the
                      family for the past 10 years, and never once had his driving skills let the
                      family down.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                           </span>“Now, all of you
                      wait in the bus, especially you, young lady. I will go out and check the
                      situation along with Melvin before I make a decision.” grumbled Mr Ted.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                      </span><span>     </span>As he got off the bus with Melvin, the
                      group of friends discuss about all the possibilities of what will happen next. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                           </span>“Maybe we will get
                      to rest in an old castle!” said Ginger, who could barely hold back her
                      excitement.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>   </span><span>                        </span>“You mean exploring an
                      old castle, ello friend.” laughed Cact.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                           </span>“I hope I will find
                      lots of naked and hot guys in there!” exclaimed Remy, as the rest of those
                      onboard shake their heads.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                    </span><span>       </span>With all the excitement onboard, no one
                      noticed the little girl who climbed onboard the bus. She walked slowly towards
                      the group, with an eerie smile on her face. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                           </span>“It seems that you
                      travellers have run into a little problem here, will you like to rest at my
                      hometown? It is not very far away from here.” the little girl whispered, as she
                      easily sneaked up next to the group.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                           </span>The whole group
                      jumped up – literally – and stared at the little girl at surprise after calming
                      themselves down.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                           </span>“Oh,
              there is no need for all of you to stare at me. My name is Yix, and I
              from the nearby village of Smurt.” said Yix, as she giggled at the
              amusing reaction of the group.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                  </span><span>         </span>“I am NOT staring. It is just that it
                      is not everyday when a kid sneak up on you and scare the shit out of you.”
                      retorted Ginger, clearly unhappy about the appearance of the little girl.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                           </span>“Is what you just
                      said true? In that case, I am afraid we will have to trouble you to bring us to
                      your village.” said Mr Ted, as he made his way back up the bus with Melvin.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                           </span>“It seems that the
                      tyres of the bus are somehow all out, and we will have no choice but to look
                      for somewhere nearby to take a rest. It is our good fortune that this young
                      lady shown up here to offer us aid.” continued Mr Ted. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                           </span>The rest of those
                      onboard nodded their heads, and they started packing up their essentials and
                      stuffs before getting off the bus. Mr Ted asked that Melvin stayed behind to
                      look after the bus though. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                           </span>After everybody was
                      done, Yix lead the group off the bus and towards her village. Ginger was busy
                      figuring out what form of entertainment she would find in a village in the
                      middle of nowhere, whereas Remy was hoping that he would find some hunks there. </span></strong></p>

                  your people build a village here when there seems to be a town over there?”
                  Exclaimed Mel, as the group reached the village’s entrance. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>True enough, there was
                  a town nearby within walking distance from the village, though it was blocked
                  out partially by the wild-growing trees in the area. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“I am glad you like my
                  village. But as for the town…I strongly suggest that all of you keep away from
                  it. It is a place where the elders prohibit anyone from going near. I don’t
                  know much about it though, except for the rumours…” replied Yix, as a thin
                  smile formed on her face. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“Rumours? What kind of
                  rumours? Can you tell us more about it?” asked a noticeably overexcited Ginger.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“It is said that all
                  those who entered the town…never got out of it. Anyway it is just a rumour, so
                  you need not think too much about it. The elders will be furious though if
                  anyone goes near the town so please respect our customs and stay away from it.
                  Look, my people are here to welcome all of you.” said Yix, as villagers start
                  to gather around the group. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“Welcome to our humble
                  village, visitors. It has been quite a while since we have received anyone, so
                  we hope that you will find your stay here hospitable by your standards.”
                  bellowed the gigantic man, who stood in front of the villagers.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“That is my father, Anng.
                  He is the current leader of the village. Despite his fearsome appearance, he is
                  a good person though.” said Yix, as she giggled softly. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>The group followed
                  Anng to his hut, though one can see that most of it was made of bricks rather
                  than straws. Inside the hut, it looked more like a run-down apartment than a
                  village hut. The group was surprised, though none of them as much as Mel.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“For a moment I
                  thought I am really going to sleep on stone floors and have straw blankets, but
                  wow! This looks pretty much like my room back home” exclaimed Mel, clearly
                  amazed by the standard of living here.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“You will be more
                  amaze at what we have here, despite a lack of frequent communication with the
                  outside world.” replied Yix softly, as she led the group to some sofas to sit
                  on.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>The group were really
                  surprised by what they were seeing, as they put down their stuffs and sat down
                  on the sofa. Yix went to what seemed to be the kitchen, whereas Anng sat down
                  with the group and talked to them.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“Visitors, so what
                  bring all of you to our small village? You do not seem to be here for a tour of
                  the region.” asked Anng, his eyes falling sharply on Mr Ted.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>Mr Ted was clearly
                  unnerved by his glare, and shifted about uncomfortably. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span><span> </span>“You see…Our bus has broken down, and your
                  daughter has been certainly most kind to bring us to your village. We hope that
                  we will be able to source some help here, while I attempt to contact someone to
                  pick us up.” replied Mr Ted, clearly hoping for this conversation to end soon.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>Just as his last word
                  ended, Anng roared out in laughter. This caused nearly everyone, besides Cac,
                  to flinch. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“I don’t get it, what
                  is so funny, big guy?” asked Ginger, clearly annoyed by the huge man.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“Ah….it seems that
                  this is the first time all of you come to this region, isn’t it? Just to let
                  all of you know something interesting, the surrounding areas are full of
                  magnetic rocks which render communication with the outside world via your
                  portable devices impossible. The only way out of here…is to wait.” replied
                  Anng.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“And how long will
                  that be before someone passes by this region? It will not be too long right?”
                  said Ginger.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                   </span><span>      </span>“It could be one day, one week, one
                  month….or even one year” said Yix, as she carried some drinks with her on a old
                  wooden tray, presumably for the group.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“WHAT?!” shouted out
                  the whole group, with Cac being the exception again. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“This is nothing to
                  joke about, Mr Anng. Is your daughter serious?” gasped Mr Ted.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“She is as serious as
                  your situation now is, all you can do now is to wait.” replied a solemn Anng</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                   </span><span>      </span>“Okay, this is nothing to panic about.
                  All of you workers besides Amanda are to go back to the bus and wait for help
                  with Melvin. Amanda will bring all of you information whenever I deem
                  necessarily. Mr Anng, I hope you will be kind enough to spare some beds for my
                  Missy and her friends, I will be fine sleeping on the floor with Amanda.”
                  requested Mr Ted.<span>  </span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                      </span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span>“Do not worry, for my village will not
                  ill-treat any visitors who set foot on our land. It will be horrible of us to
                  allow any of you to sleep on the floor! Yix, bring these visitors to our spare
                  huts. Ask our men to provide them with any help which they may need.” exclaimed
                  Anng, as he stood back up again.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“I will be taking my
                  leave, if should there be anything that any of you need, do not hesitate to ask
                  the villagers.” said Anng, as he walked off to the back of the hut.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“Young lady, I will
                  like to thank you and your father for the help the two of you have rendered us.
                  I will be sure to report this to the old master and suggest for him to repay
                  this kind deed someday.” Mr Ted told Yix, as everyone left picked up their
                  stuffs and waited for Yix to lead the way.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“It is nothing. It is
                  the custom of our village to help those travellers in need, thus you need not
                  worry about repaying us someday.” replied Yix, as the group followed her to
                  their temporary ‘housings’. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>After reaching the
                  huts, the group was split into two, with Mr Ted, Cac, and Remy in one, whereas
                  the other one consisting of Mel, Ginger, Amanda. Mr Ted clearly wasn’t fond of
                  being sleeping in a same hut with Remy, but he knew that it would be rude of him
                  to ask the friend of his charge to sleep in another hut of his own.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>“We do not have
                  electric water heaters here or electric fans, but the water can be warmed by
                  using coals, and the weather here is never hot. Dinner will be served soon, so
                  please wait here in your huts.” said Yix, as she left the groups to do their
                  own things.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>The darkness still
                  loomed overhead, making it impossible to tell between afternoon and night, as
                  the group unpacked their stuffs. This seemed just like the vacation which they
                  had wanted, but would everything turn out to be alright after all?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span><em>The eyes continued their prying, and the long wait would soon be over.
                  The only question now, was who would be the first, and who would be the last…</em></span></strong></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                      </span>“That was absolutely
              delicious! I could easily have ten more servings!” said Remy, as he emptied the

              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                      </span>“Why am I not surprised
              at all? Ello friend loves food as much as he loves man!” laughed Cac as usual.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                      </span>The duo walked their way
              back to the men’s huts, where Mr Ted was resting in. Upon seeing the two, he stood
              up and walked out, clearly unwilling to be anywhere near Remy. After thinking
              for a while, he decided to go pay his young missy a visit and see what she was
              up to. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                      </span>“Amanda, help us to warm
              up our bath. Mel and I will be taking a short walk.” said Ginger, as she
              excitedly dragged Mel in hand to pay the ruined town a visit.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                      </span>Although it was against
              the customs of the village for anyone to visit the ruins, but then again, who
              cares? The most important now for Ginger was to find whatever secret there was
              hidden within the mysterious town. She was pretty sure that as long as they
              could sneak out of the village, no one would be able to catch them.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                      </span>Slowly and carefully
              placing the coals in the flame, Amanda watched as bubbles started to appear in
              the water. The water was about to be ready for use, now all that was left was
              for her young missy to return with her friend.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                      </span>“My young lady, are you
              in there?” asked Mr Ted from outside the hut.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                      </span>“Mr Ted, the young missy
              has gone out for a walk with her friend.” replied Amanda.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                      </span>“Amanda, I believe I have
              told you to keep an eye on the young lady! You know what she is always up to!”

              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                      </span>The young lady was never
              one to sit down and be quiet, and would rather much prefer to cause havoc
              around the place. This was not their private property, where everything damaged
              could be just fixed up. They were just merely guests in a rural village, and Mr
              Ted knew that well enough. In this situation, there was no doubt where his
              young charge was heading towards with her friend.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                      </span>“When I first saw you, I

              things are better left unknown…” Yix replied, with a sad look on her face.</span></strong></p>

              screams, Mr Ted rushed over towards the village’s entrance, only to see Melvin
              collapsing onto the floor. Melvin was a bloody mess, and there were injuries
              and marks all over his body. The most noticeable thing though, was his missing
              right arm.</span></strong></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>At this moment, Aang
              led a group of villagers toward the crowd forming around the duo. In the hands
              of these villagers were what seemed to be grass, herbs and some unrecognisable
              things.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“It seems that your

              aggressive. It seems that he will survive his wounds with a hand less… but I
              cannot guarantee the lives of your men and women.” said a solemn Aang,

              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>Mr Ted clearly wasn’t
              very happy at the turn of affairs, but he dare not risked the anger of the

              quickly walked away from the now fully gathered crowd.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“Ted! What happened?”

              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“And where have YOU
              been, YOUNG LADY? Do you have any idea the SITUATION we are in and how
              dangerous IT IS?” snapped a clearly upset Mr Ted.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“WHATEVER I DO IS NONE
              OF YOUR BUSINESS! JUST GET LOST!” shouted Ginger as she marched off with Mel in
              tow.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>Mr Ted was angry at
              the immaturity of his young missy, but he kept his mouth shut and went back to
              the hut allocated for the men to warn the other two friends of his young
              charge. He had looked after Ginger for nineteen years, since the day she came
              out of her mother’s womb, but he could never fully understand what was going
              through her mind. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“Are the two of you
              around?” asked Mr Ted, as he searched around the men’s hut. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“Well yes I am, but I
              am afraid my friend had gone off to look for some men. What is the matter, Mr
              Ted?” asked Cac, as he came out of the bath.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“A terrible incident
              has occurred! Melvin, the driver, has been attacked by some wild creatures in
              this area, and it is highly likely that the rest of the servants are dead. I
              need you to gather the others and be prepared to leave this place tomorrow in
              the morning!” replied Mr Ted.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“Leave…to where?”
              retorted Cac.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>Mr Ted then realised
              that there was nowhere else for the group to go to. Connections to the outside
              world were non-existent, and they could only pray and wait for some travellers
              to pass by this area. While panicking, he had forgotten this simple fact.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“I ……don’t know.”
              fumbled Mr Ted again.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“Then we will wait. No
              matter what happens, that is the only thing we can do now.” replied Cac, once
              again showing the wisdom and coolness hidden beneath his cheery face.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span><em>It was a great feast, be it heart, lungs or liver. But it wasn’t enough
              for them. They wanted more flesh, more blood. As soon as the young ones left

              Ginger?” asked Mel as she followed Ginger, who seemed to be blindly walking in

              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                       </span>“I have no idea, and I
              don’t really give a damn. I just want to go somewhere else where I don’t need
              to see that bloody face of Mr Ted. He is the biggest asshole I have ever seen
              in my entire life!” shouted Ginger, clearly upset by the argument she had with
              Mr Ted just earlier on.</span></strong></p>

              Cac watched over them from a distance. He was worried about the two of them
              before, but it seemed that they would be fine as long as they do not wander out
              of the village. What was more worrying for him now would have to be Remy, who
              was nowhere in sight. This trip was getting from bad to worse, and the last
              thing he would need is for any of his friends to be attacked or killed by those
              creatures which had gotten Melvin and the servants.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                       </span>Meanwhile, Remy was
              hiding next to the bath in one of the huts, hoping to get to see one of the hot
              men bathing. He could hear quite a commotion outside, and he was pretty sure
              that he heard Ginger screaming just now, but he couldn’t care less. The most important
              thing was to let himself enjoy amidst the middle of nowhere.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                       </span>“Was that the Tiamat’s
              doing?” asked a young boy who, walked into the hut with an older woman.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                       </span>“Yes, my son. No matter
              what you do, never ever leave the village, or you will end up like that man
              outside on the ground.” replied his mother.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                       </span><em>What were these two talking about? </em>Wondered Remy, as he shifted
              uncomfortably in his hiding spot. Maybe it would be better if he went outside
              to see, though he would have to wait till these two left.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                       </span>“Mother, someone is in
              the house! Look at this footprints leading to the bathroom.” exclaimed the
              young boy.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                       </span>“You are right! Whoever
              is in there, you better come out now!” shouted the woman.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                       </span>Remy immediately began
              to panic. He had totally forgotten about the possibility that his mud-stained
              shoes would leave footprints behind. He started to look around for another way
              to escape out of the hut without being caught.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                       </span>As the woman started to
              approach his hiding spot, a blood-chilling scream was heard from the outside.
              Startled by the scream, the woman rushed to her son and carried him away from
              the entrance of the hut. <em>Something </em>had
              entered the village.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                       </span>“What the hell…” mumbled
              Cac, as he looked at the wolf/bear thing which just entered the village by
              jumping over the fence at the outskirts.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                       </span>Quick as a lightning, Aang
              pounced on the thing and started to wrestle it to the ground. His men came
              rushing over with spears, blades and …a gun?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                       </span>“Well, I guess even a
              village like this needs a gun.” said Cac, as he looked around to make sure
              there wasn’t anymore funny-looking beasts waiting to ambush anyone.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                       </span>The village men easily
              speared the beast to death, though Aang suffered some minor scratches and
              bruises.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                       </span>“Are you alright,
              chief?” asked one of the concerned villagers.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                       </span>“BWAHAHAHAHAHA, this is
              nothing! I want all the able-bodied men to keep a tighter lookout to make sure
              that no more of these demons enter the village, UNDERSTAND?” bellowed Aang, as
              he got back onto his feet.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>       </span><span>                </span>Cac decided that now would be a
              good time to inform the others of the latest happenings, and also to plan a way
              to get out of here alive and in one piece.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                       </span>“Sir, I cannot find my
              missy anywhere…do you have any idea where she has gone off to?” asked Amanda,
              as she approached Cac.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                       </span>“She just went off in
              that direction. Is that anything which you need to tell her? I can help you to
              tell her instead.” replied Cac.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                       </span>“Oh, it is nothing to
              worry about, sir. It is just that her bathing water is getting cold again, and
              she is still nowhere in sight. Thank you kind sir, but I will tell her myself.”
              said Amanda, as she went off after Ginger.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                       </span>On the other hand, Remy managed
              to squeeze his way out of the window while the mother and her child were
              worrying about whatever was outside. He tried to sneak his way back to the
              men’s hut, but bumped into Ginger and Mel instead.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                       </span>“You are up to no good
              again, aren’t you?” said Mel, who decided to take a break from being towed by
              Ginger around the village.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                       </span>“Not really. I was just
              man-hunting. Say, what is with the commotion out here just now?” asked Remy.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                       </span>“You didn’t know?
              Melvin, the driver, was attacked by wild beasts, and the rest of Ginger’s
              servants are probably dead by now.” replied Mel.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                       </span>Seeing that Mel didn’t
              want to be towed around anymore by her, Ginger decided to go off on her own.
              Unknowingly to her, Yix had been watching her movements and had been following
              her all around the village. Worried that Ginger would try something crazy, Yix
              decided to keep an eye on the girl. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                       </span>As Mel and Remy found
              some huge rocks to sit down on as they chatted away, Ginger went off again,
              this time back to the women’s hut. She decided that she would take a break
              first before planning her next step after failing to find her way out of the
              village and earning an earful. Seeing that she was heading towards the hut,
              Amanda, who had only just caught up to her, decided to head back to the hut
              first and warm up the water again.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>“Don’t worry about her,
              she is always like this.” said Cac, who walked up to Yix.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>      </span><span>                  </span>“How can I not be worried?
              What she is planning to do is dangerous, and even after seeing what happened to
              her man, she doesn’t seem to be deterred at all.” sighed Yix.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>“That is the way she
              is, brash and loud. Don’t worry about it though; I will look after her myself.
              Your father mentioned that the thing which came into the village is a demon; I
              am very interested about that. I have never seen such a creature in my life
              before.” exclaimed Cac.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                      </span><span>  </span>“Those creatures…they come from the forbidden
              town which we are not allowed to approach. It is said that they have been
              living there for thousands of years, but we will never know. But this is the
              first time in quite a number of years that one of them has actually attempted
              to attack the village. Please keep this a secret from your friend, there is no
              telling what she may do after she know this.” replied Yix.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>“I understand. A demon,
              huh…I think I will need to think over about this for awhile. And thanks for
              keeping an eye on Ginger.” said Cac. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>“It is my pleasure.”
              said Yix, as she went off back to her hut.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span><em>It seemed that it would still be quite a problem attacking the village
              with the big man around. The ones lurking in the darkness had no choice but to
              wait for fools to come out of the village on their own accord. As they chewed
              down the last bone, they snarled and continued their patient watch over the

              that incident happened again. There was no doubt that the group wanted to leave

              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                       </span>Taking out a feather
              from the pocket of her trousers, she started to tickle Ginger’s sole with it.
              Ginger immediately jumped out of the bed, landing with a loud thud on the
              floor.<span>  </span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 16pt;" lang="EN-SG"><span>                 </span></span><span lang="EN-SG">“OKAY, OKAY! YOU WIN!” groaned Ginger, as she

              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                     </span><span>  </span>The duo went out of the bedroom, and made
              their way to the kitchen. As the hut was not very large, food had to be
              consumed in the kitchen itself. Amanda had already prepared breakfast, which
              was eggs and bacon again for a fourth day straight, a new record for Ginger.
              The village did not have any crops of their own; hence meat was a main source
              of food here. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                       </span>“You know, I can use
              some honey and pancakes now…” sighed Ginger.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                       </span>“Be realistic, there is
              no way we are going to get those stuffs out here. That is unless you want to go
              get some raw honey from the beehives.” replied Mel.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                       </span>The duo sat down at the
              table and had their breakfast, while Amanda stood at the side, awaiting further
              orders from Ginger. Mel felt embarrassed about it, given their current
              conditions, but Ginger didn’t seem to mind it one single bit. Some things just
              never changed, and Mel let out a sigh before putting another piece of bacon in
              her mouth. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                       </span>Meanwhile, at the men’s
              hut, only Mr Ted was there. Cac and Remy was nowhere in sight. Pacing up and
              down, Mr Ted was trying to think out a solution for their current dilemma. They
              could try leaving the village, but there was nowhere for them to go, at least
              not within a month’s walk. And there was also the fact that there were unknown
              creatures wandering out there. There seemed to be only one option left now……</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>“Where are we going,
              Cac?” asked Remy, who was following Cac through the forests.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>“We are going to see if
              we can find any clues back at the bus. If ello friend is worried about being
              attack by one of those creatures, then it will be better for you to remain at
              the village.” replied Cac, as he kept a lookout for any signs of movement
              within the thick bushes.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span> </span><span>                       </span>Remy realised his friend
              was being serious here, and thus kept his mouth closed for the rest of the
              walk. Upon reaching the bus, they saw that it was as badly damaged as Melvin had
              said it was. Cac was not here to inspect the condition of the bus though. He
              was here to find something which could prove his worst fears true, that somehow
              the creature which attacked the village a few days ago was once one of Ginger’s
              servants. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>      </span><span>                   </span>Back then, Cac had realised
              that the ‘demon’ was wearing a bracelet similar to what one of the chefs was
              wearing. After the villagers had burnt its corpse and just before they dumped
              the remains somewhere outside of the village, Cac had managed to convince one
              of them to give him the bracelet. He had kept all these to himself, and had
              managed to sneak out only after a few days, due to the tighter security in the
              village now. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>Right now, He had no
              idea what he was looking for, but he realised that if his theory was true, then
              anyone of them could become one of those creatures sooner or later. What he
              needed to know now was what caused the transformation from man to demon. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>“And what may the two
              of you be doing here?” asked Yix, as she stood up from the side of the bus.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>“I can ask the same
              of you.” replied Cac.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>“I am here to see if
              I can find anything related to that demon from a few days ago that attacked my
              village. That demon is not one of those which roam around this area…and I
              believe it was wearing a bracelet of sorts…” said Yix. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>“Then let us work
              together. Three brains are always better than one.” exclaimed Cac.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span> </span><span>                         </span>Yix nodded her head
              and continued looking around the bus, whereas Cac led Remy to the roadside to
              look somewhere slightly further away. The trio were working hard on their
              search, and they did not realise that there was something out there looking at
              them. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                           </span>From the bushes
              nearby, a creature jumped out of it, and went straight for Remy and Cac. It
              looked like an oversized lion, with fangs too big to even fit in its mouth. But
              before it could even go near the duo, Cac took out a gun and shot it a few
              times in the head. The creature went down without even as much as a whimper, as
              Cac kept the gun back in his pocket.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>“I am glad that I
              borrowed this from your village, Yix. I think we better head back before more
              of these creatures start showing up.” said Cac, as he and Remy walked towards
              Yix.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>“Let’s go then.”
              replied Yix, as she joined the two and they walked back towards the village.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman";' lang="EN-SG"><span>                   </span><span>       </span><em>It
              would seem a good chance to strike now…but the one wielding the gun seemed to
              be more dangerous than he appeared to be. It would be foolish to attack with
              him in the way, and since another human had left the village, that would be a
              better target. Silently, the dark ones crept back into the darkness and changed
              their target… </em></span></strong></p>

              village. The path back wasn’t hard to find, but getting into the village was
              another story altogether. The guards were on high alert, and it took the group
              more than an hour of waiting before they managed to sneak back in.</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>“What do you plan to do

              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>Yix had went back to
              her hut to prevent any unneeded suspicion, but she had promised to meet up with
              Cac and talked to him later. For Cac, the most important thing now was to get
              some rest. He had been up the whole night planning for the trip today, but it
              ended up being a fruitless one.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>“So where have you
              been?” asked Mr Ted, as Cac went back inside the hut.</span></strong></p>

              concern. Just look after the young missy” replied Cac, as he went to his bed
              and lie down. Remy had decided to go get some food on his own.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>“So be it…but I expect

              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>It was already a
              headache without Mr Ted saying that. Now, it just added on to the pressure on
              Cac. Being a good friend and also an undercover bodyguard at the same time
              proved to be a very tough job. Nevertheless, Cac was truly worried about
              Ginger, and did hope that he would find a way out of this accursed place soon.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>Meanwhile, Ginger was
              bored to death, and had been spending the whole morning playing monopoly with
              Mel and Amanda. Amanda was forced to sell all her properties at a single dollar
              to Ginger though, thus making the game very boring and predictable.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“Aaarrggghhhhhhhh!!!!
              Isn’t there something else we can do? This is so boring!” exclaimed Ginger.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“Well, it won’t be
              that boring if you will just stop bullying Amanda…” replied Mel.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>Ginger made a grumpy
              face and ignored Mel. To her, winning is important, and the method she used to
              win didn’t matter at all. After all, Amanda was her servant. Amanda, on the
              other hand, didn’t care about winning or losing at all. Keeping her job was her
              main priority; it would not be worth it to lose it over a silly game.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>  </span><span>                       </span>Someone was waving at
              her from outside the window, Amanda realised. She looked carefully and realised
              that it was Mr Ted. For him to call for her, it couldn’t possibly be anything
              good. Ginger was too ‘busy’ grumbling to notice him, whereas Mel was trying to
              talk to her. Amanda stood up and proceeded to leave the hut.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span><span> </span>“Is there anything you need me for, Mr Ted?”

              missy doing?” asked Mr Ted, as he took down his spectacles to wipe them.</span></strong></p>

              Amanda. I want you to ask around and find out more about the empty town

              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“Isn’t it Cac’s job to
              do these things?” Amanda retorted. She clearly wasn’t happy at having to do

              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“Do not question me.

              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>Amanda was upset, but
              it looked like there was nothing else she could do beside to follow the orders
              given to her. Walking back to the hut and peeping through the window, she saw
              that Ginger was still sulking. Seeing that there was nothing else for her to do
              now, she went off to the other huts to ask the villagers for more information.</span></strong></p>

              use to be people living in that abandoned town nearby, and they are cursed to
              become like this because of their own cruelty. It is said that the people
              killed a young girl who is born with incredible powers out of their fear of
              her, and she curse that they will remain in these horrifying forms for the rest
              of eternity.” replied Cronk, one of the younger healers in the village.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“Well, I will have thought
              that what you had just said is bullshit, if not for the fact that I had lost an
              arm to those freak shows.” exclaimed Melvin, as he tried to get up.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“Your body is still
              very weak, so it will be best that you lie down and continue resting for the

              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>Cronk took some herbs
              and put them near Melvin’s face, and soon he passed out from the heavy smell. Next,

              into a room nearby to make more medicine from the herbs for usage. </span></strong></p>

              the game with only Mel as her opponent and she had been losing non-stop since

              spared from her anger if she stayed in there any longer. Biting her nails, she

              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>“Wake up Cac!”
              shouted Mr Ted, as he rushed into the hut.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>  </span><span>                        </span>“I can hear you loud
              and clear, there is no need to shout. Is something the matter?” asked Cac, who
              jumped up straight away.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>“YES, otherwise why
              will I have call upon you? The young Missy has gone missing! I cannot find her
              anywhere in the village!” shouted an anxious Mr Ted.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>This can’t be any
              good, thought Cac. Ginger had always been rash, and there was no telling what
              she was up to this time round. But it seemed that there was only one likely
              place where she could be.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>“I am going out to
              look for her. You just wait at her hut and see if she returns.” said Cac.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>Grabbing the two
              pistols and some ammos which he borrowed from the villagers, Cac went out of
              the men’s hut and head straight to Aang’s hut. He needed Yix as a guide to the
              old town nearby. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>“Heading somewhere?”
              asked Mel.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>“Yes. But it does not
              concern you, and you will be safer in the village.” replied Cac. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>“I know what you are
              going to do. And I know what Ginger probably did. I am going with you and I am
              not taking no as an answer.” said Mel, as she stared fiercely at Cac.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span><span> </span>“There are plentiful of those Tiamat creatures
              out there. You will only be a burden.” Cac retorted her.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>Mel swiftly took out
              a pistol and pointed it at Cac, before giving him a slap on the face.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>“Don’t insult me,
              Cac. Ginger is not only your friend, she is also my friend. I can hold my own
              ground.” Mel snarled angrily.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>“So be it. Then let’s
              get going.” sighed Cac, as he walked on ahead with Mel tagging along.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                    </span><span>      </span>It looked like things were only going to
              get worse from here on, but Cac knew he would have to keep his calm and moved
              on. Upon reaching Aang’s hut, he saw Yix standing outside waiting for him.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>“So you have come.
              Let’s go in and I will tell you more about the Tiamats and that town nearby. My
              father is currently at a village meeting; it seems that a whole group of our
              patrol guards have gone missing.” exclaimed Yix.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>“I am sorry but there
              is no time for that. One of our friends, Ginger, has went out of the village. I
              need to sneak out of the village once again to look for her.” said Cac.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>“Then I guess you will
              want me to go together with you…” said Yix.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span><span>  </span>“Yes indeed. I need your knowledge of this
              area and those creatures. I know it is selfish of me, but this is an important
              friend of mine we are talking about here.” replied Cac.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                             </span>“You do not need
              to worry about that, I often sneak out of the village myself. What is important
              now is to find that friend of yours.” said Yix softly, as she went into the hut
              to gather some items.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                             </span>“Thank you…”
              whispered Mel.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                             </span>After Yix packed up
              some of her stuffs in a pouch, she followed the duo out of the hut and then led
              them to a hidden exit out of the village. The trio went through the small hole
              after the patrolling guards outside went off, and then headed towards the
              mysterious town.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>    </span><span>                         </span>“Now will be a good
              time to tell us more about that town, Yix.” said Cac. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                             </span>“There is an old
              legend from my village. The town was once a prosperous and beautiful place, but
              the people living there were as cruel as they were rich. The mayor’s daughter
              gave birth to a child who had a special power, and thus the people were very
              scared of this child. The mayor was a powerful and dangerous man, so no one
              dared to touch his granddaughter. But as soon as he died, the villagers buried
              his daughter and her child alive. Before her death, the little girl cursed that
              all these people be transformed into creatures as ugly as their hearts were,
              thus the Tiamats were born.” said Yix, as she kept a lookout for any Tiamats
              nearby.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                             </span>“Are there any
              things which we will have to lookout for regarding these Tiamats?” asked Mel.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                             </span>“Well, the small
              Tiamats can be the size of a dog, but the big ones are even bigger than the bus
              the two of you came on. Some of the Tiamats are also able to spit poison, so it
              will be wise not to go too close to them. But most importantly…look out for
              anything which is able to move in the town, there are a lot of unexplained
              things in the town.” replied Yix, as the trio got nearer and nearer towards the
              town. <span>  </span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                             </span>“What do you mean
              by that?” asked a baffled Mel.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                             </span>“You will know
              soon enough. Just run away if you see any shadows or objects moving.” replied
              Yix, who stopped down all of a sudden.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>    </span><span>                         </span>“Keep quiet.”
              whispered Cac, as he covered Mel’s mouth and pulled her down. <span> </span><span>  </span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                             </span>A Tiamat the size
              of an elephant walked out of the trees on the right side in front of them,
              though it didn’t seem to have noticed them. The beast let out a roar, before it
              continued walking into the trees on the left side.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                             </span>Mel certainly
              wasn’t expecting these creatures to be so huge. She opened her mouth but no
              sound came out.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                             </span>“I told you
              already, this isn’t something which you should be doing. It is not too late to
              head back to the village now, you know.” exclaimed Cac, as he pulled Mel back
              up.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                    </span><span>         </span>“I will be lying if I say that I am
              not shocked. But there is no way I am abandoning Ginger with these creatures
              crawling about.” replied Mel firmly, as she brushed Cac’s hand off. <span> </span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                             </span>“It is your
              choice. Let’s keep moving, we do not have all the time in the world.” said Cac,
              as Yix continued to lead the way to the town.<span>  </span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                             </span>“Yix, you sound
              like you had gone to the town before.” asked Cac.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                             </span>“Unfortunately…yes.
              Like your friend, I couldn’t resist the temptation and came here with a group
              of friends in the past. I was the only one who made it back to the village
              though. My father was very angry back then and he gave me a harsh beating.” whimpered
              Yix.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                   </span><span>          </span>“Sorry, I shouldn’t have asked.” said
              Cac softly.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                             </span>“No, it is
              alright. I just pray for our safety this time round.” replied Yix, as they
              reached the tall weed field surrounding the town itself.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>      </span><span>                  </span><span>     </span>“It will be too dangerous if we continue
              walking like this. We will have to crawl through the weeds.” Cac stated, as he
              got on all fours and started to climb through the weed field.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                             </span>The other two
              followed suit, as the trio slowly and steadily made their way to the walls
              around the town…</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                             </span><em>Some fools had gotten near the town. The
              Tiamats could sense that they were somewhere around, but could not tell where
              they were exactly. They licked their claws as the one who was destined to be
              the sacrifice was being tied up by the reapers. The ceremony would start as
              soon as their Mistress returned from dealing with the village. How they wished
              that they could join in the feast, but for now, they would deal with the

              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>“Where the hell am I?”
              shouted Ginger angrily, as she regained her consciousness. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>The last thing which
              she could remember was being knocked out by someone or something in the
              village. She was fuming over her constant losses to Mel, and Mel went out of
              the hut to leave her to her own sulking. All of a sudden, she felt something
              really solid slammed hard against her head, and that was when she lost consciousness.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>Things didn’t look good
              now though, with a bunch of freaky looking things staring at her, and…</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span><em>Wait. I am hanging in mid-air? </em>Thought Ginger, as she tried to

              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em><span lang="EN-SG"><span> </span><span>                      </span></span></em><span lang="EN-SG"><span> </span>“Why the **** am I hanging in
              mid-air like a decoration or something, and what the **** are you shit faces?”
              screamed Ginger, as she struggled to break free from the ropes that was
              restraining her movements.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>The creatures merely
              kept their silence, and their creepy square eyes continued to stare at her. The
              silence was eerie, and despite the fact that they were obviously alive, none of
              them budged even a single muscle. This just only made it worse for Ginger, for
              she had no idea what these freaky things were up to and was hoping for at least
              some response.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>A vine burst forth from
              the ground and entwined itself around Ginger’s head, effectively keeping her
              mouth shut. Ginger tried to scream for help, but she could not even move the
              lips of her mouth. After a short while, she fell into unconsciousness again due
              to asphyxia. Only then did the vines released their grip around her face and
              went back into the soil.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>“I am sorry my dear,
              but it is not time yet. You need not worry though, the time will be upon us

              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>“But for now, we will
              have to due with your pesky little friends. To think that they could have so
              easily avoided the ghouls lurking around the town…they are really a troublesome
              lot indeed.” the being continued, as it slithered into the darkness covering
              the town.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>“That wasn’t funny at
              all! What the hell are those things?” asked Mel, as the trio hid in one of the
              room of an old hotel.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>It wasn’t hard for the
              group to sneak into the town, but what they saw in it really shocked them. The
              rusty metal chairs were ‘walking’ about, and so were the streetlights; along
              with many other objects. There was even a life-sized bronze statue which was
              missing a fragment of its head prowling about, as if it was on the lookout for
              something.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>Cac led the other two
              and they managed to make their way into the old hotel without being spotted by
              any of the parading objects. There, they wondered how they were going to search
              around the town for Ginger with the freak show going on outside.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>“Those objects are possessed
              by spirits of those who were killed in this town by the Tiamats. They are said
              to be controlled by something and are acting against their own free will,
              though the people of my village have no idea what is controlling them.”
              answered Yix, who was just as surprised as the other two were.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>“I am pretty sure that
              there was only an extremely small amount of them when I last stepped foot in
              this town. It seems that whatever is controlling them is already expecting
              someone to enter the town…” exclaimed Yix, with a worried look on her face.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>“I guess that means our
              puppet-master has his, or her, hands on Ginger already. He or she is expecting
              us to show up, and sent the jokers outside so that they can deal with us. I
              just hope that Ginger is safe for now.” said Cac, who was busy looking out of
              all the windows one-by-one in order to find a safe route which the trio could
              take.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>“It is amazing, and
              also scary, how you can figure out so much in so little time.” whispered Yix,
              clearly taken aback by Cac’s analytical skills. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>“I will take that as a
              compliment. But for now, we will have to wait for the lot outside to move
              somewhere else before we can make our way further into the town. Meanwhile, you
              can tell us more about all the things which roam about in this town. I don’t
              think I will want too many surprises popping up later.” exclaimed Cac, as he
              sat down on the wooden floor with the two girls.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>As the other two
              listened to what Yix had to said, all three failed to realise something had
              made its way into the hotel, until they started hearing the sound of the wooden
              floorboard creaking. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>“What was…” before Mel
              could finish her question; Cac covered her mouth and signalled for them to
              start following him. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>“I know you are in
              here, sweeties, come on out! Don’t keep me waiting!” the being said, as a wide
              grin formed on her face. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>It slithered up the
              stairs the way a snake would, and its eyes darted about, looking for any signs
              of movement. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>               </span><span>         </span>“This is bad. It is a Lamia, an evil creature that is an advance
              Tiamat which has very sharp senses. There is nowhere for us to run now.”
              whispered Yix, as she peeked through a tiny hole in the floorboard.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>“Take Mel with you,
              Yix. I will deal with it.” replied Cac softly, as he made his way down the
              stairs.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>“Be careful.” said Mel,
              as she took the stairs to the upper floors with Yix.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span>Cac took out his
              pistols, and as soon as he reached the level below, he walked towards the room
              which the Lamia
              was in. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“Surprise!” yelled out
              the Lamia with
              her unnaturally wide grin, as she slashed at Cac from the behind.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>Cac, on the other
              hand, didn’t seem surprised at all, as he leaped forward and started running
              with the Lamia
              hot on his heels. He knew that it would be dangerous to face that creature head
              on, given that a slash from its claws would probably rip him apart. The speed
              of it was also incredible, even though it had a tail in place of two legs. But
              he had a plan in mind.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>The Lamia wasn’t about to let her prey got away
              so easily. She started spitting gobs of liquid from her mouth at Cac, who
              barely managed to dodge them while keeping his speed constant. As soon as the
              liquid touched the walls and the floor, they began to melt away into nothing. Cac
              realised that the Lamia
              was spitting acid at him. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“It is pointless
              running, sweetie. Just give it up!” laughed the Lamia, as she increased her speed in a bid to
              close up the distance between and Cac and herself.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>        </span><span>                 </span>Cac suddenly stopped down and
              turned around. Despite this, the Lamia
              continued towards Cac, baring her wide fangs previously hidden in her mouth. Her
              eyes were full of glee, as she lurched forward.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>All of a sudden, the
              floor below her gave way and she fell through it. Stretching out, she managed
              to grab hold of the damaged wooden planks with one of her claws, and dug her
              sharp nails into it. With her tail dangling in mid-air, she tried to pull
              herself back up.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>    </span><span>                      </span>“Goodbye monster.” said
              Cac, as he unloaded a few bullets into the Lamia’s head.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>The Lamia fell down, and continued its descent
              through a few floorboards before hitting with a loud thud on the ground floor.
              Just to be sure, Cac fired a few more shots, but there was no response from the
              creature. Sure of his kill, Cac went back up the stairs to look for the other
              two.<span>     </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span><em>They could sense it. One of the reapers had fallen. Heading towards
              where the gunshots were heard, all they found was the body of the reaper. The

              were to not deal with those intruders quickly, they risked facing the anger of

              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“Where are we heading
              to?” asked Mel, as the trio made their way across the rooftops.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“The center of the town,
              we will get a view of the entire town from there.” replied Cac, with his guns
              in hands while keeping a lookout for the Tiamats and other creatures.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>The group were careful
              not to make too much noise, as there were plentiful of possessed objects moving
              about down below. It was a good thing that those things couldn’t fly; otherwise
              they would have already been spotted. The adjoined rooftops were a big help
              too, as the trio couldn’t possibly travel out in the open on the ground.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>    </span><span>                      </span>Cac halted the group and
              brought them into one of the buildings via the rooftop door. After everyone has
              entered, he immediately locked the door and signalled for the other two to keep
              quiet. Some footsteps were heard, as something walked around on the other side
              of the door. After a while, the sound became more distanced, as if whatever was
              on the outside was walking further and further away.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>“What was that?”
              whispered Mel, who was clearly spooked by the footsteps.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>“I don’t know, but I
              guess it will be safer for us to keep off the roofs for now.” replied Cac
              softly, as he led the two girls into the lower levels of the building.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>The building turned
              out to be a hospital of some sort, though there were no beds in all of the
              rooms the trio had looked into. In fact, no medical apparatus of any kind was
              in sight. The only tell-tale sign was the bronze plate on the wall with the
              word ‘Hospital’ on it.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>               </span><span>           </span>“A hospital without any equipment,
              this is really weird.” commented Mel, as she took a closer look at a skeleton
              stand in one of the doctors’ room.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>“I wouldn’t be
              surprised to find the beds and cabinets outside on the street dancing with the
              benches and lampposts. What I am worried about is the lack of dust on these
              items here.” said Cac, whose finger remained clean despite swiping it over one
              of the tables.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>“Why is that
              worrying?” asked Yix, who was sitting on a wooden chair by the wall.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>“If there is no dust,
              that means someone or something has been here recently. We will have to be
              alert and watch out for any movements around us.” replied Cac, as he sat down
              on one of the chairs too along with Mel.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>The footsteps were
              heard again, and this time round, it got louder and louder instead of the other
              way round. Cac immediately grabbed the two girls and the trio made a run for
              it. However, it seemed that whomever or whatever that was causing the sound was
              gaining on them quickly.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>Soon, the group was
              cornered, and there was nowhere left for them to run. Cac led the two girls
              into one of the room by the side and locked it up. He started shifting the
              shelves and whatever that he could find to block the door.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>“There is no point in
              doing that, you know?” said the ‘thing’ as it phased through the wall, as if
              the wall didn’t exist in the first place.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>       </span><span>                   </span>It was literally a black
              shadow, with no features on it. At this moment, the door busted open, sending
              all the shelves and furniture behind it flying aside. A humanoid creature
              walked in, though it was definitely in no way a human. It had three of what
              appeared to be mouths, and its eyes were on its chest instead of the face.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>“So these are the
              human who dare to intrude our town…WAIT…isn’t she…” gasped the humanoid figure,
              looking in Yix’s direction.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>             </span><span>             </span>Yix, who was clearly confused by
              the humanoid’s reactions, ran towards Cac and hid behind him.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>“It seems that our mistress
              hasn’t realise that she is already here, let us just devour the other two and
              bring her along with us.” said the shadow, as it lunged towards Cac. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>All of a sudden, a
              blinding light shone through the whole room, and when it was gone, so were the
              trio. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>“CURSE THAT BOY!!! I
              WILL HAVE HIS SOUL ONE DAY!!!” roared the humanoid creature, as it punched
              through the wall by the side out of anger.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>“That is not our main
              concern now, you fool! Our Mistress’ ‘shell’ has already entered the town, and
              that saves us the trouble of looking for her from the village. We must head to
              the village and report this to our Mistress immediately!” shouted the shadow,
              as it disappeared into the wall once more. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>The humanoid creature
              jumped out through the opened window and started heading towards the village... </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>“Now…where is the
              girl?” asked the gigantic Tiamat, holding up Aang in his hand. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>The whole village
              looked as though it had been pulverized, and most of the villagers were being
              eaten up by the Tiamats. The lucky few who were still alive were rounded up and
              held by the tentacles of one of the Tiamats.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                           </span>“As if I will tell
              you…” said Aang, who was choking on his own blood. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                    </span><span>       </span>“You still don’t get it, do you? The
              only reason why your pathetic village could remain safe until now is because of
              that girl. It is impossible for Tiamats to raise a human child, and thus we the
              reapers allowed your village to look after her till the time is right. Now the
              time has come for our mistress to be reborn, we have the sacrifice needed, and
              all we are missing is our mistress’ new body!” roared the humongous reaper as
              it crashed Aang slowly in its hand.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                           </span>“So you are saying
              that my villagers have been used all along…?” questioned Aang, who could barely
              move his limbs now.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                           </span>“There is no need to
              question him anymore, Gigaton. Shadox has just arrived from the town with news
              of the girl being sighted over there. Just finish him and the rest of the
              villagers off. We need to get going; our mistress and Shadox have already
              headed back with the other reapers.” one of the other reapers said. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                           </span>“If that is the
              case…” grinned Gigaton, as he opened his wide mouth and devoured Aang head
              first. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                           </span>The villagers were
              shocked and frightened, as they listened to the sound of the bones of their
              great leader being crunched. There was nothing but death awaiting all of them,
              as the Tiamats started to approach them from all sides.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                           </span>Meanwhile, Melvin
              was running as fast his legs could carry him along with Cronk, Amanda, Remy, Mr
              Ted and a few of the villagers. When the village was attacked, Aang asked the
              group to escape while the village men held their front against the Tiamats. The
              village women and children also followed them, but most of them had been hunted
              down by the inhuman Tiamats. There was nothing the group could do now except to
              run as far as they could…</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                            </span><em>It seemed that a few of the people from the
              village had escaped, but that wasn’t even important in the slightest bit as
              compared to the revival of their mistress. The reapers and the rest of the
              Tiamats headed towards the town, with their Mistress in the lead. Darkness
              would cover the whole land once more soon enough...and for now, the Tiamats
              would do whatever it took to find the new ‘shell’ of their mistress…</em></span></strong></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;">This week's chapter. Enjoy.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 16pt;" lang="EN-SG">Chapter X </span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"> </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span><em>“Who are you?” Cac tried asking the little boy, but no sound came out
                  of his mouth.</em></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>Absolute darkness
                  covered the place, yet somehow he was able to see Yix and Mel who were both
                  unconscious on the ground - whatever it was that he was standing on. He tried
                  walking towards the boy, but no matter how hard he tried, the distance between
                  the two never seemed to change at all.</span></em></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                          </span>The little boy
                  pointed his finger in a single direction, and disappeared in a flash of light
                  along with the darkness enveloping Cac. Cac was mystified by what just
                  happened, but he was glad that he didn’t need to face the two Tiamats while
                  having to protect the two girls. But something just felt not quite right…</span></em></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                   </span></span></em><span lang="EN-SG"><span>      </span>“WAKE UP, CAC!” shouted Mel as she
                  pounded hard on his body.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“Stop it that hurts!”
                  groaned Cac, as he tried to sit up.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“Stop yelling, Mel.
                  You may alert the Tiamats or other creatures that are nearby.” said Yix, as she
                  helped Cac up.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“Alright….alright…”
                  sighed Mel, as she sat down on the ground.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>Cac looked around him,
                  and realised that they were in some sort of underground sewer. That explained a
                  lot about the stench he had noticed since regaining consciousness. But that
                  wasn’t important now.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“How long have I been
                  out? What happened?” asked Cac.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“Well, we just woke up
                  only, don’t ask us…” replied Mel, as she started biting her fingernails.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>The trio paused in
                  silence for a while, before Cac started talking again. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“Let’s go. We can’t
                  just wait here forever.” said Cac, as he stood up on his feet.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>Looking in the
                  direction which was pointed out to him in his dream, he saw a dark tunnel which
                  appeared to be a very long one. Signalling for the two others to follow him, he
                  walked on ahead.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                        </span><span> </span>“Are you sure we should walk in there? It
                  seems a bit dark; too dark for comfort…” Mel spoke softly, as she stopped
                  chewing her fingernails and stood up.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“Trust him. He knows
                  what he is doing.” Yix said with a smile on her face. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>Seeing Yix’s faith in
                  Cac, Mel’s heart was set at ease. She nodded her head, and the two followed
                  Cac’s lead into the tunnel. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                         </span>“So what do we do
                  now?” said Mr Ted, as he paced up and down. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                </span><span>         </span>The group looked up at him for a short
                  while before lowering their heads down again. The village had been destroyed by
                  Tiamats which were so strong that it was unbelievable, not to mention the fact
                  that they could talk. The remaining villagers – mainly women and children –
                  wept for the loss of their loved ones, and took little comfort in the fact that
                  they managed to survive.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                           </span>“Can’t you all just
                  shut up and stop crying?” shouted Mr Ted angrily in his frustration.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>        </span><span>                   </span>Cronk stepped forward and
                  punched him in the face before pushing him onto the ground.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                           </span>“YOU SHOULD BE THE
                  ONE SHUTTING UP! YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH PAIN WE ARE IN! JUST SHUT UP AND GET
                  LOST!” screamed Cronk at Mr Ted, as Melvin tried to hold him back with his one
                  hand.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                           </span>“Calm down…it is not
                  worth losing your temper over someone like him.” said Melvin, as he gave a
                  dirty look to Mr Ted. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                           </span>“IF YOU WANT ME
                  GONE, SO BE IT!” roared Mr Ted, as he stomped into the bushes nearby.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                           </span>Cronk got a good
                  idea to go after him and teach him a lesson, but Melvin and a few of the other
                  villagers held him back. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                           </span>“I shouldn’t be saying
                  this, but fighting now is not going to bring anyone back…We should look for
                  Cac, he is the only one who can help us out in this kind of situation.”
                  commented Amanda.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                           </span>“And what can we do
                  after we find him? Fly out of here? There is no way out of here and no one can
                  save us now…” sobbed a distraught Remy. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                            </span>“That is not the
                  point. With him around, the odds of us surviving are higher!” replied Amanda,
                  as she looked at the villagers around her.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>       </span><span>                     </span>“I have faith in him. I am
                  going to the town near the village to look for him! Who is coming with me?”
                  asked Amanda, as she stood up on the rock which she was sitting on.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                            </span>There was a moment
                  of silence, as the eyes of the villagers widened in fear. Her suggestion seemed
                  like a crazy idea to them, and there was no way that they were going to follow
                  her. The villagers who were sitting close to her immediately got up and moved
                  away from her.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                     </span><span>       </span>“If this is the case…I will go alone on
                  my own.” sighed Amanda, who had more or less predicted this outcome. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                            </span>Stepping down from
                  the rock, she walked back in the direction which the group came from, as she
                  headed towards the old town. From her past experiences with Cac, she knew that
                  he would be the one who could get them out of here, no matter how ridiculous
                  her belief might seemed to be.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                             </span>“I am going with
                  you.” declared Melvin, as he walked towards Amanda.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                             </span>“If that is the
                  case, count me in too. There is still a chance that Yix is still alive, and I
                  will have to tell her about her father…” said Cronk, as he picked up one of the
                  spears which he had brought along.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>    </span><span>                         </span>The three walked on,
                  and soon enough, they were out of the villagers’ sight. Remy knew that Cac was
                  the person whom they could trust most in such a situation, but he did not want
                  to go back and face those freaks which tore his new gay boyfriend apart like a
                  sheet of paper. Wiping away his tears, he sat down quietly in a corner.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                             </span>“Are you sure this
                  is the right direction?” questioned Amanda, as she found herself and the group
                  to be surrounded by huge trees on all sides.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                             </span>“You need not
                  worry about us getting lost. I have been out patrolling with patrol groups from
                  the village for many years. I know the place well enough.” answered Cronk
                  confidently.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                             </span>“Glad to hear
                  that.” mumbled Melvin, as the trio moved on. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span lang="EN-SG"><span>                             </span><em>The trio continued towards the old town,
                  unaware of the reaper moving in the opposite direction of them. Though it was
                  highly unlikely, the dark ones had to ensure that words of existence of the
                  town and its inhabitants would not spread out to the outside world. Thus, it
                  was necessary to deal with the remaining villagers and their guests…</em></span></strong></p>
