            <div class='col-md body'><strong><br>Can you tell me why he curse me then? Did I ever say he will go hell or whatever? NO I NEVER say that. In this post I NEVER accuse anyone. I , Rapture, have NEVER accused anyone's when discussing religious topics since the beginning of my first post in Sgforums.<br></strong><br><br>hmmm, maybe he dont like the way you post about god, or maybe he is pissed off your arrogrance, and maybe... It is difficult to said. But if you understand karma, then there is nothing to be cursed at. Maybe true, you never accused anyone, but that doesn't mean ppl cannot cursed you. If only you understand karma, then you won't ask this type of question.<br><br><strong><br>I didnt ask you to tell thaT guy to respect me, what I ask is why did you say I have little respect for others when I am not scolding anybody but that guy was using crude remarks on me which obviously have no respect for people.<br>WHY me and NOT him?<br></strong><br><br>1st, i said give a little respect to me and other people here, and not you have little respect for others. The 2 sentences mean 2 different things.<br><br>2nd, I think he is upset in seeing what you post and like me just voice out his view. There is nothing wrong in it. I would pay respects to my parents, to my elders, to great people like jesus. As I have said, respects is given by people, people will see your being, your character and give you the relevant respects. I think you should know in your heart why people don't respects you.<br><br>3rd, why not him. because it is his right to said anything, just like you like to post all this christian stuffs, other people like to post sex, some like to post pictures, some like to tok rubbish, i like to comment on certain things, maybe he like to scold you. If you like, you can scold him back, but you couldn't as that is a sin.<br><br><strong><br>if you advice me NOT to post topics on God,<br>Why then, are you yourself posting buddhism topics ??<br></strong><br><br>i did not stop you from posting, did I? I said only a little respects... as for my posting, people didn't scold me  so i think i am still alright for now.<br><br><strong><br>I am sorry but to tell you this :  I will not stop posting topics on God.<br>But as far as I am concerned, I will NOT accuse other's religion, nor curse others, nor disrespect other's freedom.<br></strong><br><br>no need to be sorry, none of my concern, your karma is yours and not mine.<br><br><strong><br>If you think you are suffering reading my posts, you can choose NOT to read my post, nobody is forcing you, thanks.<br></strong><br><br>huh, since when i am suffering, i am not sure if i am the one who is suffering. don't worry, i like to read your post, it make me feel that i am walking on correct path. i actually enjoy your postings. don't you see that most of my postings are related to religious stuffs...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Qoo...<br><br>------------------<br>He who knows others is wise;<br>He who know himself is enlightened.</div>
