GOOD LUCK... </div></blockquote>Just for your info The Bible has not only predicted this event. There are numerous prophecies in the bible. Many have already come true.<br>How do you explain those prophecy which is NOT a trend?  - example :  reunion of Israel in 1948, a country which has been completely destroyed for more than 2000 years, yet this prophecy has already come true.<br><br>One bible prophecy to come true in the future is that the countries which are near  Israel will mass attack Israel, then the countries North will help Israel but will later doublecross the Jews. When Israel shouting for help from the West countries (e.g. Europe), the West will help, yet in the end the West invade the Middle East and Israel, but in the end challenged by the Eastern (e.g. China) 200 million armies which marched in for the last battle.<br><br>The above is NOT a trend but will come true in the future. I know you still will not believe.<br><br>You see when I quote you a bible prophecy which has already come true, you say it is added to the bible by human.<br><br>When I quote you a bible prophecy which has on the way to come true, you say it is a trend.<br><br>When I quote you a bible prophecy which is NOT a trend and will come true IN THE FUTURE, you say it will not happen.  And when the time is ripe and going to happen you say it has becomed a trend.<br><br>so... you yourself die die also dont believe. Dont blame anyone else or the prophecy.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rapture (edited 14 March 2002).]</div>

I also thanks god that you are a christian, a devoted one too. I also must thank god that you always bring news that is so much important to us, breaking the news so fast. I also must thanks jesus that he had made you a very important person, should I say a key personal in his ministry. I thank god for everything you are trying to do...<br><br>But please leave me alone, i have already said that i am not interested in your bible or what your god wants to do. I don't care if I am going to hell, i don't care if the bible is true, i don't care if all the banks is merging, i don't care anything about your prophecy....<br><br>Please give a little respect to me and the people in this forums.<br><br>I dont care if i am on the ship of fools and sterling towards hell, in fact i dont even care if the merging of banks will affect me, i think more of the little ones in africa, in china, sri lanka, in india.

I think more about how the animals and insects are getting extinct. I think more about love and care for people than trying to act like if i am god and know the great plan of god.<br><br>If hell is where i am going, please let me go. I rather stay in hell than seeing you and hearing you in heaven. life in heaven will be such a torture for me if you are there. if one day i should meet god and god ask me why i did not choose to believe him, i will tell him: " god, i am sorry, but rapture is there, he is so annoying and disturbing. if, god, without him, i would have believe you long ago. it is because people like that make me sway away from you. God, if you want to punish me, please go ahead, i rather suffered eternally than to face rapture and his kind of gang for a lifetime."<br><br>I thanks god that you are a christian and i am not, so that if i died, i go to my hell and you to your heaven. i thanks god that he let me know buddhism and let me seen people like you in christianity.<br><br>------------------<br>He who knows others is wise;<br>He who know himself is enlightened.</div>

There are numerous prophecies in the bible. Many have already come true.<br>How do you explain those prophecy which is NOT a trend?  - example :  reunion of Israel in 1948, a country which has been completely destroyed for more than 2000 years, yet this prophecy has already come true.<br><br>One bible prophecy to come true in the future is that the countries which are near  Israel will mass attack Israel, then the countries North will help Israel but will later doublecross the Jews. When Israel shouting for help from the West countries (e.g. Europe), the West will help, yet in the end the West invade the Middle East and Israel, but in the end challenged by the Eastern (e.g. China) 200 million armies which marched in for the last battle.<br><br>The above is NOT a trend but will come true in the future. I know you still will not believe.<br><br>You see when I quote you a bible prophecy which has already come true, you say it is added to the bible by human.<br><br>When I quote you a bible prophecy which has on the way to come true, you say it is a trend.<br><br>When I quote you a bible prophecy which is NOT a trend and will come true IN THE FUTURE, you say it will not happen.
