They don't speak to many people about the gospel, but if a person asks then they will speak, but still they have managed to convert a lot of my friends to christians, and others people whom they came into contact. Think about yourself, did you bring more harm to your faith, did you make more people hate christians. And another thing is people here dont really hate christianity, but christians like you.
