What is it that you don't understand or you understand.

Not you, but because some have cursed others, some had been arrogant, some have said non believers will go to hell( it is insulting).<br><br>I'm sure you know what I am talking about. So we are being stereotyped lor.<br><br>Look at it this way, assuming we are not belivers and someone keeps harping to us that we will go to hell unless we follow their way, that our gods whom we revere are mere idols, will u be pissed off? I will.<br><br>So how can we spread the faith of love by condemning and running down on others? That is why we are called hypocrites and are being scrutinised that whenever we do something wrong, we will be attacked. Remember, we are humans after all and we do err. So those who had insisted in their fiery brand of peaching actually landed us in this position. Just like Osama's style of preaching put many moderate Muslims being eyed with suspicion. Damaged is done by the over zealous, especially those quoting chapter and verses. In the first place, people already discredit it, as if quote chapther and verses will help or is it just ego showing off that they know the bible? Ocasional reference to the bible is educational. Long quotations and done in in a high and mighty way detests. Merely showing off.<br><br>You are not guilty of such, but those who had and there will always be. We can try only to show that not all are like this.<br><br>Those that did that has actually damaged our faith and therefore answerable to God.<br><br>Rapture, I understand you. A discussion is never won by arguments. Even if win, it will leave a bad taste and everyone wud have lost.<br><br>My examples are not about you and you have seen it here before. These are the people that discredit our faith more than the detractors. Let's not fall into that trap.<br><br>Pooooooot!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  :p remember?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> DuH<br><br>------------------<br>yeah yeah yeah, boogie woogie spit it out at <a href="http://www.my77thstreet.com" rel="nofollow">www.my77thstreet.com</a></div>

No... I'm telling you they're NOT... They're AGAINST you.... Don't push your blames to YOUR GOD... And WORSE STILL, don't push your blames to DEVIL....<br>If you like to know, you HAD cursed MANY and shown GREAT DISRESPECT to their religion... And YES, you have been given THE SAME TREATMENT... It DOESN'T matter who did it FIRST... The FACT is BOTH had done it...<br>It's just that I thought you might be a CHANGED man... That's why I bother to reply... And if that CHANGE is GOOD for that particular someone... People would call it an IMPROVEMENT... Nobody ask you to discard your LORD... You CAN be a CHANGED man and still follow your BELIEF...<br>You can also CHOOSE to believe me OR NOT to believe me.... You're RIGHT, I'm NOT a GOD.... I've not decided if I would really be interested in saving anyone yet...? So it won't really bother me much now even if you CHOOSE not to believe what I'm saying... ~Shrug...~<br><br><strong><br>There are who people post about Buddha and some post about Allah, yet nobody stops them.<br>but when I post about God, people curse me and call me a stubborn man. Can you please tell me why?</strong><br><br>You can post Buddha, you can post about Allah.... You CAN even post about your LORD and CHRISTIANITY... ANYBODY can TRY to stop you... And IF they don't, they simply don't... Take me for example, I have MY OWN BELIEFs.... And I DON'T even BOTHER if the others believe in what I've got to say... It's MINE.... I won't even be interested in stopping your POST because it's your cup of tea...? If you think you've found your treasure just keep it... Share it with the people who would APPRECIATEs it... No point for a bird to share its bird seeds with a dog? A cat to share cat's food with a human...?<br><br>Some people CURSE and SWEAR, some people FIGHT... Some people KILL and TORTURE others.... WHO are you?<br><br>I didn't curse you nor your religion, but I SURE think you're a STUBBORN man... STUBBORN not directly because of what you'd post but MORE of how you respond to the others... I'd seen MANY like you before... And for I can do is just to leave some piece of advices... You can choose to take it or leave it... Just like your LORD would say... I wish to help you, but it's UP TO YOU to accept me...? As for WHY I call you a STUBBORN man?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Because in my eyes you're INDEED a VERY STUBBORN man...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by Rapture (edited 15 March 2002).][/B]</blockquote></div>
