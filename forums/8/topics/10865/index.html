            <div class='col-md body'>hmmmm..... it works upon the socially accepted roles (or should I say 'stereotypes') of men and women. But, disturbingly, the passage is reflective of married/single males and females in society.<br>~~~<br><br>Male-- Presented always as breadwinner, stubborn, cold and rigid.<br><br>female-- Presented as consumer, materialistic, emotionally complex (and otherwise unfathomable), fickle.<br><br>Marriage-- Blessed union between male and female to form basic family unit is depicted to be the cause of complications and social change.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's sad to see that the male and female are seperated and presented in a different way.<br><br>But then again, if both sexes are of consumer, both are materialistic, both are stubborn and cold, i think there will be more relationship problems popping up.<br><br>Marriage. Perhaps lesbians n gays will cause less complications n social changes in some ways?
