            <div class='col-md body'>Blur! i think ur argument is somewhat superfluos taking into conjunction of the parallel paradigm shift of decency as against indecency therefore rendering the basis of phsychological common sense redundant at a time when dimension of decency as against decency are stacked against each other the odds of which are so ridiculously imbalance that the probable ignition of one or the other will merge the two concepts into a single entity admist a possible detonation of pyrotechnics projectiles, don't u think so?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> heheheeeee<br><br>------------------<br>DARE U STEP INTO MY PARLOUR!!
