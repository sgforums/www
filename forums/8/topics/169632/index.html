            <div class='col-md body'>The art of gifting - is a very fine art. You learn with age. Or should I say you realize after some time.<br><br>When a friend of mine Liza from the Bright Lights Big City (KL) came back to her kampung for the kenduri (wedding feast/celebrations), a curious me wanted to know the kind of gifts exchanged hands in the kampung these days (it is not a traditional custom in these parts for weddings). I asked L if I could be present during the gift-opening ceremony. She reluctantly agreed. Perhaps, because she owed me RM50. It was a big affair. Her grandma, who cannot walk was also wheeled in from the next room.<br><br>While LÂ’s mother wanted the biggest gift to be opened first, L said she wanted to go from the smallest to the biggest. The issue was finally settled. She picked up the smallest gift...it had come from a common friend of ours. The guy had gifted four tea cups with saucers. Â“Bastard!,Â” I heard somebody saying. DonÂ’t know which side it came from.<br><br>The next gift was a night lamp. By the time we finish, we would be left staring at 18 night lamps. Wonder why people think after marriage most couples end up sleeping.<br><br>After the lamps, it was a casserole. Next, a flask. Next, wall clock. Next, a picture frame. And then, the gifts started repeating itself. Someone had even taken the trouble of gifting a Sidney Sheldon. Perhaps, he/she had finished reading it.<br><br>Then there was another common friend called P who gifted L a towel. It looked familiar. Had I gifted it once to P...I was not sure. I looked for that small mark in the corner compliments from my favourite cat Jetti (how she got the name is another story)...which was the reason why I had parted with it in the first place...and yes, it was there. So, that cheapo had forwarded my gift.<br><br>I have already marked the ones that are not good Â‘giftersÂ’ and donÂ’t invite them to my functions. BTW, did I tell you...I have not been getting much invites lately, I wonder why??<br><br><img src="http://www.forumsigs.com/users/asiandivergal827/wassup.jpg"><br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">With lots of love and hugs, from Jetti</span></strong><br><br>* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *<br><img src="http://www.forumsigs.com/users/asiandivergal827/2.jpg"></div>
