            <div class='col-md body'>How many people have experienced this common rejection<br>line,"Why can't we just remain friends"? It's so often repeated<br>that it is starting to sound like an insult (which it is actually).<br>You were close friends, you shared both your lives, you decide<br>to take on the next step but the moment you got too close,<br>the other party backs away. And then suddenly, your friendship<br>takes a nose dive. You've lost a friend, more importantly, you've<br>lost a part of yourself. Because you knew, yes, especially when<br>you knew, the other party secretly enjoyed the attention, the hint<br>of sexual tension, the kind that is seductive and attractive.<br><br>Why is it so? This is a question I often asked myself and I think the<br>reason behind the friendship because the romantic spark was always<br>part of the friendship. It's like a 2 way process. As soon as the interested<br>party tries to raise the hint of romance, it's very hard to remain friends<br>(but not impossible). The person who was infatuated most likely had<br>an expectation that things might develop further and even if the other<br>party wasn't interested, he or she loved all the attention, the energy,<br>the thrill but the moment an interest is raised, suddenly, the magic is<br>gone, there are no more expectations, no interest even in retaining the<br>friendship.<br><br>Why? Both the parties are still the same as what they were before the<br>romance issue was raised. So then, the pursuer suddenly realises that<br>he or she is completely mystified. After all, the pursuer is still the same<br>person and there has been no change.The pursuer then questions himself<br>or herself what has gone wrong, and then here's where their self-blame and<br>self-guilt starts and everything from then on, starts going downhill.<br><br>It is ironic and strange that the person who raised the issue of romance is at<br>fault and is always the one being blamed (usually for being too hopeful of<br>themselves). Simply put, the one who dumps the other usually has the upper<br>hand because he or she has the "power control" - the determining factor whether<br>a relationship succeeds or fails. The dumper then starts to get annoyed at the<br>pursuer because he or she is angry at having been forced to come to a<br>decision and then preferred to stay away.<br><br>In total fairness, the one being dumped didn't make things easier. If the<br>dumper offers to resume the friendship, the pursuer might think they are<br>getting another chance. So most of the time, many people don't reinitiate the<br>friendship once that matter has been raised. Some dumpers even resort to<br>being cruel to get the attention off their backs. They feel that it is easy so that<br>the other party can get more angry and hurt so that thoughts of the dumper can<br>be gotten out of their minds quicker. Unfortunately, such situations tend to<br>take on twisted meanings because love spurned can quickly generate into hate<br>or something much worse.<br><br>Now, it is still possible for the 2 of them to remain genuine friends if it doesn't<br>work out. It takes a level of maturity between both of them to sort out because<br>friendship and romance are 2 different issues. So the next time your close friend<br>suddenly reveals that they have an attraction for you, honestly, look at the person<br>for who he or she is, decide properly, think carefully on what you want to say<br>before you say it because what you say will depend on how your close friend<br>treats you in the future.<br><br>If you knew you secretly liked the attention, I would advise to giving that person<br>a chance otherwise, you know you will not be totally honest with yourself.However, if you<br>choose not to reciprocate, explain the situation and make things clear. Feelings<br>are involved here, if you are cruel to them, then one day, you just might<br>find yourself in a similar situation. In the end, just be careful. To the pursuer,<br>you have to understand that there are people you can be friends with but never<br>as a lover.<br><br>Friendship and love are 2 different feelings. If you feel like giving the question a<br>chance, be prepared to handle rejection. If you think you cannot handle it, I<br>would advise that you don't do it at all and let the friendship remains at best a<br>friendship. If not, perhaps it would be wise to withdraw from the friendship<br>altogether if you're not mentally prepared for it.<br><br>Because the more you prolong the idea, the worse it is going to get and then<br>suddenly, you wake up one day to find that the idea has so preoccupied your mind<br>that to handle rejection or to ask drives you crazy. It's not going to do you any<br>good.<br><br>Getting rejected always hurts, regardless if it's the man or the woman being refused. To say<br>that a man handles rejection better than a woman is purely nonsense, just as to<br>say a woman can easily find another man if she was rejected is false. Face it, all of<br>us cannot handle rejection well, I don't think men and women are really much<br>different in this respect.<br><br>So how do ya guys think??...<br><br>------------------<br><strong>"I'm Just a Diver, searching for something lost in the sea of love......"</strong><br><img src="http://www.geocities.com/SouthBeach/Bluffs/3321/shakelmo.gif"><br><br>[This message has been edited by Bluediver (edited 30 August 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rejection is part and parcel of everyone's search for the ideal mate.<br><br>Why do close friends almost never make it ? Well, in the first place, being close friends means that you already know some dark secrets about the other person. Some of <strong>WHICH</strong> that person doesn't want her potential suitor to find out.<br><br>I can't say much about a girl's point of view, but from a guy's ? I honestly don't think that I would want a close friend as a girlfriend either, truth be told.<br><br>In the first place, she might not be my type of gal. Secondly, I might not be receptive or reciprocative to her advances in the first place. Third, I <strong>might</strong> even be disgusted by it.<br><br>Things would probably remain awkward between the 2 friends. Since the person dumped would still have lingering hopes that the dumpee would change his/her mind. The dumpee, knowing that, would probably remain friends superficially, but in reality, try to avoid contact with that person for as much as decently possible.<br><br>Some would be able to overcome the fact, and laugh it off. But nonetheless, the memory of that event would remain, and things just don't remain as they were.<br><br>Life is a difficult road with myriad twists and turns. Walking along a path may lead to hell, or heaven. It is only for the traveller to pick up his gear, and move along the road, or to stagnant, and die there, never knowing what lies at the end of the road.</div>

But to think of it , at the point of being told "sorry ,can we just remain as friends?" How do ya feel...of cos everyone feel kinda lost. Sometimes it makes one lost in the way of life , it's a matter of time to pick oneself up and move on. Do not just feel that one failure means all.<br>To me , i'm learning to accept rejections and make rejections(although it really hurts...). To make a decison is more important than keeping one in suspense.

            <div class='col-md body'>Rejection is so common and it's really part and parcel of courtship and of course, growing up. Without rejection, how will one learn to cherish the next one that follows? However, rejection may crush someone's pride and bruise the ego badly but well, life goes on! There are always better ones yeah? *LUFFZ*<br><br>Nevertheless, one will usually feel sore after a rejection and takes some time to get his/her life back together but I hope that there are no ill feelings or grudges!
