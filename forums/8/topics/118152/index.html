There is no mention of co-insurance or deductible. It seem to be a Fixed Amount Daily thing, but it did not mention about 'providing for loss of income), so I presume it is to help pay the hospital ward charges.<br><br>And if there is Medishield and Medisave to pay for the ward charges, I don't know whether still can claim the $100/day from each of the 3 policies or not (totalling $300). It does seem odd to me that I could even make a profit out of the hospital stay.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Best is you check with your insurance agent. Given that you mention about the $100/day, it is likely it is those type which gives you a fixed amount per day regardless of actual bill. If this is the case, then the answer is likely yes. Yu can claim it as many times as you want. But since hospital expenses are usually way higher than that, don't expect to earn any profit out of it.<br><br>The reimbursement type of insurance usually should cover a lot more than $100/day and it should have a breakdown of what and how much the limit of each type of claim is.<br><br>Note that I am no insurance agent so I am just answering to the best of my knowledge.</div>
