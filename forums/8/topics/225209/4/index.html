            <div class='col-md body'>I can almost imagine what the next mlm clone will come in to say. Things like mlm is not all bad, how people should not just look at how much money they are making, and it's all about choosing the right company. It seems like every pro mlmers or mlm clones say the same thing!<br><br>It's all a bunch of bull that we dont need. It's not even practical at all the things they say above. It's more about trying to be politically correct and not providing a geniune insight or solution to a problem. The best is stay away from mlm, stay away from something you have very little idea or knowledge about, unless you dont mind paying 'school fees' to learn what it is all about. Some people dont like to learn from the lessons of others, but rather experience it themselves, so by all means go ahead!</div>

If you meet a friend for movie, then after a movie your friend suggests going to dinner, you wun say your friend bluff you to dinner right? So now we meet for dinner, then I suggest we go to my company to take a look since its just round the corner, is this bluffing?"<br><br>Think alot of MLM companies uses this method to recruit. Longfar, enyouth, certain agencies in nuskin, amway, coslab, dw, asayo, etc.<br><br>And they wun tell you more at then end of everything if you have any questions. They'll just ask you to sign/comeback/pay money/etc.<br><br>If you are ok with this way/company culture/teachings/ of doing business, then please go ahead.<br><br></div></blockquote>Tamade!!

            <div class='col-md body'>Alot of people are victims of this scam. I was at AstralMag in 1999 i guess.. cause this gal intro me there.. lucky i clever to siam.. then few months back.. another good friend ask me for dinner and go to Enyouth at near boat quay there. I go up.. now got more product but still selling magnetic mattresses.. wah liao.. sian 1/2 liao. Go up listen to them.. give my friend face ma.. then i told her i was from Astralmag last time.. then she know she cannot con me already. I act like i'm interested then never contact her till now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Doing sales promoter is not like this.. approaching family and friends.. normally should approach companies to sell products.. wait family and friends siam u then u got no more friends.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>This is to let everybody know about the lousiness of MLM. Dont get con. Get a proper job. If u cant sell anything u will also end up pennilless.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
