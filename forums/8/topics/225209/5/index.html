Obviously, they said its only a survey lar. But a few days later, they will call the number you put in the survey form. Then they will start talking all the crap lar saying they got a job opening.

            <div class='col-md body'>According to my friend:<br><br>Several top people in Enyouth, SDM (senior distribution managers), did not get their position through the right/normal way. Meaning they did not get their position through working hard, getting in the sales, recruiting in the people.<br><br>They got to SDM position because the company at that point of time was facing crisis. So the boss had to secretly promote some managers loyal to him to be SDM so as to show the rest even thought company in crisis, the people are still doing well.<br><br>There are also occurance of rearranging the group, suddenly, this manager jump 2 levels up.<br><br>Car Achievers (CA)<br>When a manager or SDM hits a certain quota, they become CA. Meaning company will pay for his/her mecz, bmw, etc 's downpayment. That's all! Although they have a car fund that is to be divided amoung all the CA every month, it had rarely been in the 4 digits.<br><br>So if the particular CA's group is not doing well, the month's comission for the CA is very little. And with the little car fund, the CA is going to suffer.<br><br>There are at least 12 SDMs whom had sold off the car and had left the company, as they are unable to keep up with the expensive lifestyle.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>haha guys.. Venture Era is a MLM company.. i was 1 of them.. well.. for 2 days..<br><br>1st and formost, they do have a product that won international award. That is their duno wad water system (it is somewhat like DIAMOND water.). i forgot le cos its like 2 years ago. Anyway, 3 drops of IODINE can kill a human. This lady drank 3 drops of iodine mixed with the water in front of us.. so well, it does have some neutralizing effect.<br><br>It is also true that 2 years of SUPER DUPER hard work can make u a winner.. they have this thing called the C.A which stands for Car Achiever. It goes by a point system whereby every product u or your downline sell, you get points. So when u manage to hit a number of points within a period of time, you get your very own customized merc or BM free. And the last time i went, there were only 6 C.As.. the next C.A to be is up upline's upline. he is a final year SP student then.. shld be in army now(so yep, u can be rich pretty young).. but imagine the amount of money they leeched.<br><br>Here is the catch<br><br>How many zillion people died under this MLM already? because the initial earnings is FREAKING low.. in fact, negative. U must be extreamly lucky to succeed. 1stly, you gotta target your family and friends.. next you target your family and friends' family and friends.. then you hit on the strangers around you.. lets see.. it simply means making the entire world hate you. Sound like insurance angent huh..<br><br>As to how they CHEAT money.. well, they dun cheat.. but use a more.. scheming method. Take this incident for example. I have a friend who joined this company earlier then me. He convinced me to follow him so i went.. during the 2nd day i saw thru their system and quitted the job.. well, he stayed. for 2 months he was unable to sell a single product, which means he got 0 income for 2 months. He is already living on bread and butter yet his direct upline warned him that if he is unproductive, his profile would be removed from the company. Being afraid of losing this "wonderful" opportunity, he end up buying 1 stupid machine himself which cost him all his savings plus some loans.<br><br>The next month, he joined the army.</div>
