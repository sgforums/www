            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ChrisYX:</div><div class="quote_body">No, it's not a taboo to dump your ex gf. It's only the way you go about relating the incident that send most of the forumers on edge.<br><br>To you, it may seems to be just a case of relating your story. However the parts of your story about not helping your ex gf carry her stuff from the trunk, cheekily refusing to give a short lift back home, and the emphasis on letting her smell your exhaust fumes as you drove off really seems childish and immature. As a gentleman, simple gestures like giving her a hand or sending her home will not hurt you in any way.<br><br>Here's my experience: I broke off with my ex gf with a declaration that we are not compatible, when she was least expecting it. I really felt at that time we can't go on together. Guess what? I got a slap from her when we were alone. I just took it like a man, coz I know my declaration hurts her a lot. When I think back on this incident, I learnt that I should have been more gentle about telling her the truth, instead of just telling her straight to the face.<br><br>The thing is, I learnt something from it and become a better person because of it. I don't see that from you. What's more, after seven years, you still can look back upon this incident with glee and mischief. It reflects on your maturity as a person.<br><br>She may have done something terrible to you first, that's why you are treating her so. But your vengeful and spiteful behaviour towards her when dumping her doesn't make you any better than her.</div></blockquote>it aint glee nor mischief, to those naysayers who think that was immature, how would you like to have ur partner who slept around whenever she went clubbing? I think letting her smell some fumes was letting her off easy. My pals suggested imprinting tyre marks on her face *idea!*  after the immense pyschological truma she put me through. I think a decent payback is justifiable! y izit girls can have revenge on guys but not the other way around? is that so wrong? anyway thanks for sharing, Im glad at least some people can see above the mere facet of a situation and not jump to conclusions <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

They claim they have 2 houses, 3 cars blah blah blah.  But none is under their name.  It's always under either the father or the mother.<br><br>Not the first time I encounter this.<br><br>The 2nd most recent case is this guy (not from this forum) claiming to other girls that he got a landed property, a condo, two mercs and offices all over the place namely, Suzhou, JB, Penang, Singapore, Shanghai.  (Of course the most recent case is this thread lah)<br><br>But then hor.... all those mentioned above belong to the father or mother, if not his relatives.  The condo he claimed that his father bought for him.  So I even challenged him to move in, if it really belongs to him.  Year after year, the condo was still vacant and the truth is the parents bought it for investment only (cuz it is freehold).<br><br>So when he tries to con girls, and the girls come and ask me, I will tell them the truth.  What to do?  They ask me mah.  So I have to tell the truth lor.<br><br>But then here, if L@gSoN still insists that he bought his own merc lah, <img src="http://www.beatlelinks.net/ubb/smilies/thumbsdown.gif"> he owns the company lah, ok lor, we will all pretend to believe him lor.  Pretend a bit and make a person happy is a good deed. <img src="http://www.beatlelinks.net/ubb/smilies/laugh7.gif"></div>
