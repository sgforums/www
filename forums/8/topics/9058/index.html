            <div class='col-md body'>Had a scary dream the nite b4. It reminded me of the dream dat i had when i was young. The one which told me dat my grandmother will be gone soon &amp; a recent one before my uncle's death. Never fail to make me shiver.<br><br>This dream was strange too. It was divided into 3 segments non-stop.<br><br>The 1st scene:-<br>I was calling a guy frd, who was on the computer, not to be late. The next moment, i was at a wedding. Seemed like i was the bride, only without a groom, and was receiving guests by myself. Suddenly, an aunty ran to me; she told me there's this 2 guys who weren't there yet. I was flustered and told ppl to go online &amp; checked whether this 2 guys are online as well.<br><br>The 2nd scene:-<br>I am living alone wif my 'mother'. In my dream, i kept wondering where's my 'father'. But then, my 'mother' is my dream is not my actual mother. One nite, it was getting late, and my 'mum's not back yet. I was worried and went to look 4 her. I somehow ended up at a backstage, when i saw my 'mother' sitting on a chair. I asked her why didn't she go home &amp; sitting down here. She spoke to me in English. I was shocked! Coz in my dream, she doesn't know English at all! She then immediately picked up tis mannequin's head from the floor and cradled it in her arms. In my dream, i knew it was a mannequin's head but i oso saw that it was the head of a young caucasian woman, with her neck severed still wif blood flowing. I juz stood there, w/o knowing wat to do or say. Wanted to faint, wanted to ran, but wondering how to save my 'mum'.<br><br>The 3rd scene:-<br>I was then at this place and i duno whether it's a desert or an empty land. I saw a convent nun sending off a group of lamas.<br><br>I suddenly woke up. Till now, i'm still cannot keep my mind off my dream. There's muz be sumting going on.<br><br>------------------<br><strong>I thought that you'd be loving me.<br>I thought you were the one who'd stay forever.<br>But now forever's come and gone<br>And I'm still here alone.</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One questions about Scene 1... Why are you flustered just because the two guys are not around ?<br><br>Possibility is the fear of being left on the altar ? Or perhaps, a sudden feeling of being alone, without perhaps, your closest 'friends' ? Did something drastic happen in your relationship to attribute to this ?<br><br>Scene 2:<br>The Father and Mother figure are perhaps, representations of the two people of both genders that consist of a major feature of your life. The lack of the male perhaps, signifies that missing component ?<br><br>Can't really decipher what little of the rest of the dream, but perhaps this.....<br>That person that you thought you knew, you did not. This was perhaps illustrated from the fact that she had some pretty "interesting" behaviours/mannerisms that you did not know about. Dispite the fact that you have encountered this situation, you still try to "save" that person from her own, say, "misery". Or misery that you perceive it to be.<br><br>Scene 3:<br>I have no idea.
