            <div class='col-md body'>Giving up your seat to someone who need it more, is very much your own choice. Meaning, if I give up my seat to someone whom I deem in need of it more than I, I wouldn't gripe about why others around me do not give a damn.<br><br>Because I know this world is made up of all kinds of people (idiots included).<br><br>Giving up a seat does not require any kind of assessment as to who has more rights, less rights, or are supposed to. This act of giving others your seat is very much culture based, and tells on the way your parents brought you up. Our culture here is the "Me First, and Mine Only" culture, which we are desperately trying to make amends to.<br><br>For this "Me First, and Mine Only" mentality to change, it is going to take quite some time judging by the way things are generally going. Motorists still cut into lanes and road-hog, people still take every opportunity to cut que, and handphones are still ringing and being answered in cinemas.<br><br>Mind you all, it isn't just giving up seats in MRT trains that's a problem. It's the mindset of our people in general!<br><br>So, go ahead and make that difference in your daily life; give up that seat, let someone go first when driving, respect other people's right of way, don't hog the road, cut or switch lanes considerately, and TURN OFF YOUR DAMN HANDPHONE/S when you enter a cinema!<br><br></div>
