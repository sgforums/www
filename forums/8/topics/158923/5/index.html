Students start school at 7  plus, and it is expected that they are tired.<br><br>At this time, students are having their exams. Is it so hard to just want to sit on the bus? There are so many people on the bus, adults, who are healthy and can take a little standing up. Why is it that everytime there is such shit, it is the students who get flak for it?<br><br>The pregnant woman, if she really wanted a seat, she can jolly well ask for it. Being pregnant dont entitle you to special privilege, pls. I am sure if she ask nicely, the student would have given it to her. But to aim the student just because he/she is MORE LIKELY to give up his/her seat because he/she is a student, that is wrong, because that would be bullying. She never ask for the seat, EXPECTED that she was given one.<br><br>So, who's at fault?</div>
