            <div class='col-md body'>Giving up seat to pregnant women, I wonder where it started.<br>China? India? Malaysia?<br>I know its not Bangla Desh.<br>Why are we Asians quarrelling over this.<br><br>Those who see anothers' need and give their seats, well good then.<br>Those who need a seat badly, should ask. No harm in asking. Don't want to ask, then stand. It is not good to quitely seeth and then write a letter to the newspapers to complain.<br><br>I have seen all sorts of people not giving their seat to a very obviously pregnant woman. Men, boys women, girls, big sized men, old men, beautiful women, lau amahs. Even one in a nun's habit. You name it, they've done it.<br>Even I myself, well she was about 10 feet away and I ignored her. If she had ask me, I would certainly not refuse.<br><br>I have also given up my seat to pregnant women, and old people. I have also seen many others do such a thing.<br><br>We are in a small place.<br>Being crowded in makes us edgy.<br><br>Those countries that we often quote as having good etiquette are often spacious, and its people less harried. But in crowded cities they are just as uncivil as us.<br><br>Some won't give up their seat, some will.<br>Has been so, and will always be so.<br></div>
