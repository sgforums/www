            <div class='col-md body'>BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein has been executed, a witness said.<br><br>"Saddam's body is in front me," said an official in the prime minister's office when CNN telephoned. "It's over."<br><br>In the background, Shiite chanting could be heard. When asked about the chanting, the official said "These are employees of the prime minister's office and government chanting in celebration."<br><br>The witness reported that celebrations broke out after Hussein was dead, and that there was "dancing around the body."<br><br>Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki did not attend the execution, according to an adviser to the prime minister who was interviewed on state television.<br><br>The execution was videotaped and photographed, state television reported, and those images will be distributed to the media.<br><br>Al-Arabiya television network reported that Barzan Hassan, Hussein's half-brother, and Awad Bandar, former chief justice of the Revolutionary Court, were hanged after Hussein. All three were convicted of killings in the Iraqi town of Dujail nearly 25 years ago.<br><br>Earlier, Munir Haddad, a judge on the appeals court that upheld the former dictator's death sentence, and an adviser to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki each confirmed the paperwork needed for Hussein's execution had been prepared late Friday.<br><br>At the same time, a U.S. district judge refused a request to stay the execution.<br><br>Attorney Nicholas Gilman said in an application for a restraining order, filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Washington, that a stay would allow Hussein "to be informed of his rights and take whatever action he can and may wish to pursue."<br><br>Haddad had called Gilman's filing "rubbish," and said, "It will not delay carrying out the sentence," which he called "final."<br><br>Haddad wouldn't disclose the location of the execution and said it wouldn't be broadcast live on TV because of human rights issues.<br><br>Throughout the day, there were conflicting reports about who had custody of Hussein. Giovanni di Stefano, one of Hussein's defense attorneys, told CNN the U.S. military officially informed him that the former Iraqi dictator had been transferred to Iraqi but that the move in U.S. court could have meant that Hussein was back in U.S. custody.<br><br>There had been speculation that Hussein would be executed before Eid Al-Adha -- a holiday period that means Feast of the Sacrifice, celebrated by Muslims around the world at the climax of the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. The law does not permit executions to be carried out during religious holidays.<br><br>Eid began Saturday for Sunnis and Sunday for Shiites and lasts for four days. Hussein is a Sunni Muslim.<br><br>Anyway its all around de internet &amp; news!<br><br>jUST happened</div>
