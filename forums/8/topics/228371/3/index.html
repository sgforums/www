Its president since 1979, his influence on the lives of the people of Iraq, the wider Middle East and indeed, the global stage, has been unrivalled.<br><br><img src="http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/06/in_pictures_saddam_hussein0s_iraq/img/2.jpg"><br>Saddam Hussein grew up in the north of Iraq where he joined the Baath Party and took part in an unsuccessful coup which eventually resulted in his being imprisoned in 1963. He and fellow plotters escaped from prison (above) in 1966.<br><br><img src="http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/06/in_pictures_saddam_hussein0s_iraq/img/3.jpg"><br>After escaping jail, he was key in bringing the Baath Party to power and by 1975 Saddam Hussein was vice-president of Iraq. Four years later he became president and within days had executed many of his rivals. HeÂ’s seen here celebrating his birthday in 1979.<br><br><img src="http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/06/in_pictures_saddam_hussein0s_iraq/img/4.jpg"><br>After the 1979 Iranian Islamic revolution, Iran-Iraq ties declined, and war began. Despite UN attempts to resolve the war, it continued for eight years. Saddam Hussein is seen here in a propaganda picture of the time, manning an RPG.<br><br><img src="http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/06/in_pictures_saddam_hussein0s_iraq/img/5.jpg"><br>During the Iran-Iraq War Saddam Hussein enjoyed US backing from the government of Ronald Reagan. Here Saddam Hussein greets the then US envoy, Donald Rumsfeld.<br><br><img src="http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/06/in_pictures_saddam_hussein0s_iraq/img/6.jpg"><br>Saddam Hussein's influence on daily life in Iraq could be found on every street corner as vast numbers of murals were painted and statues erected in his honour.<br><br><img src="http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/06/in_pictures_saddam_hussein0s_iraq/img/7.jpg"><br>A number of threats to his life meant he was always accompanied by a mass of bodyguards including Irshad Yassine (above).<br><br><img src="http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/06/in_pictures_saddam_hussein0s_iraq/img/8.jpg"><br>Away from home Saddam Hussein travelled extensively, meeting leaders such as Leonid Brezhnev, Indira Gandhi, Yasser Arafat and Cuban President Fidel Castro (above).<br><br><img src="http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/06/in_pictures_saddam_hussein0s_iraq/img/9.jpg"><br>Nearer to home he enjoyed close ties with some other Middle Eastern countries such as Jordan.

Saddam Hussein is seen here with British boy Stuart Lockwood, one of a number of westerners paraded on television as human shields prior to the US air assault on Baghdad.<br><br><img src="http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/06/in_pictures_saddam_hussein0s_iraq/img/11.jpg"><br>A US-led invasion of Kuwait forced Iraq behind its borders and stripped Saddam Hussein of much of the influence he had previously enjoyed. His retreating army set fire to the Kuwaiti oilfields, resulting in a huge ecological disaster.<br><br><img src="http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/06/in_pictures_saddam_hussein0s_iraq/img/12.jpg"><br>Throughout the 1990s he remained in power - but under the eyes of the UN inspectors who suspected him of developing weapons of mass destruction.<br><br><img src="http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/06/in_pictures_saddam_hussein0s_iraq/img/13.jpg"><br>In 2003, after 10 years of sanctions and stop-start weapons inspections by the UN, the US decided to remove Saddam Hussein's regime from power. On the first night of military action, he narrowly escaped a targeted air strike designed to kill him.<br><br><img src="http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/06/in_pictures_saddam_hussein0s_iraq/img/14.jpg"><br>Saddam Hussein disappeared after American forces entered Baghdad and was not seen by the world until 14 December 2003, when dramatic pictures of the aftermath of his capture were broadcast.<br><br><img src="http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/06/in_pictures_saddam_hussein0s_iraq/img/15.jpg"><br>Post-Saddam Iraq has spiralled into increasing sectarian violence with western forces on the verge of pulling out.

            <div class='col-md body'>he did what he did knowing the full consequences of his action. He was a military man and knew if he wanted to create civil war in his country or proceed to attack other countries ( esp those with US interest), he would possibly have to pay the price. He woke up everyday, I'm sure, knowing full well the results of his actions.<br>He did what he thinks to him was a solution to his problems.. he tried to safegaurd his @ss from being fried by frying others.<br>In the end, his enemies were too influential and wanted him out.<br>So farewell, to the leader of the Iraqi army and nation.<br>it may not have been a fair trial, but it was something he knew would have happened anyway... if he was caught and tried by the US led forces.<br></div>
