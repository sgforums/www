            <div class='col-md body'>How would you pple handle a relationship whereby the guy is financially at a lower level than the girl? And the bad part is that the girl's family has some misgivings about the girl being attached to a guy that is not of equal footing such as not owning a car or living in a private condominium. How affected do you all think the guy will be and how should he handle it? What do you all think is the "appropriate" action for the girl in such a situation? In the long run, do you all think this relationship will be affected adversely because the girl is used to a more comfortable living environment and the guy may/may not be able to provide for?<br><br>Just some points to ponder over in our modern society....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, wat makes u think that the guy will ot rise to the status where he could afford a car and a condo???<br><br>2ndly, which will u prefer, a rich bf who treat u badly and think that $$ and solve all the problems or a caring, loving bf who is not so well-off??<br><br>If the guy really love the gal, he will work hard and give the best for the gal. He will use it as a motivation for himself.<br><br>I dun get wat u meant be appropriate action. Does it mean, should the gal dump this poor guy and find someone who can "afford" her ways of living???<br><br>Jerrick</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm addin my 2 cents worth from a guy's point of view.<br>I have to say in this kinda situation, it very much depends on individuals and the couple involved in this dilemmma.<br>Sure i agree wif Jerrick's point abt not being able to guarantee that the guy will not rise in status, but does everyone thinks the same?<br><br>The age of the couple involved affects the outcome of this issue greatly.<br>Young couples - "Yao ai qing bu yao mian bao"<br>(Direct translation:Want luv dun wan bread)<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> They're young, looking for fun, not in the society working yet, so this doesn't affect them one bit.<br>Mature couples - maybe from 21 onwards? Things are different already, does this guy have a career? Good prospects? Ambitious? Able to support the relationship financially?<br>Fail any of this criterias and I can guarantee u won't get too many girls from 22 onwards.<br><br>Very importantly is not what her parents think, but what she thinks of you. Does she trust you? You should constantly show her that you're tryin to upgrade urself even when ur status isn't the same as hers. There is no 'appropriate action' on her part, only the guy's.<br><br>Whether it will affect the relationship adversely depends on the girl's character.<br>More than often, sadly, it does.<br><br>Naturally, the guy will feel some kinda stress in many ways. Other people's views.<br>How people look at them n stuffs.<br>I have a friend who lives in normal HDB flat like many comin from a normal family and he's got a gf who lives in a private house.<br>He rides a scrambler and have some difficulties upkeepin it.<br>She, on the other hand, drives a Rovers Convertible.<br>U shld imagine how it feels when the girl's drivin ye ard in HER car.<br><br>It's a realistic world out there nowadays.<br>We can't have everything we dream of. A guy can only show how capable he is to be successful and not ponder over issues of whether or not in this kinda situation, the girl and her family will accept him.<br><br>------------------<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>To see a world in a grain of sand<br>And a heaven in a wild flower,<br>Hold infinity in the palm of your hand<br>And eternity in an hour.<br>-William Blake<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jerrick: in answer to yr first qn, that is precisely the point I trying to get at. There is no guarantee that the guy can achieve that status. The problem is that the parents mind his PRESENT status! Given his education and ambitions, he does stand a chance after a number of years of hard work. But the thing is the present pressure he is facing....<br>2nd : Of course most pple,if not all, prefer a caring partner over a rich but spoilt one. That is in the case of extermes. I'm refering to a more general case and thinking more in terms of long term. If from young, you live in an enviroment that is more sheltered than average and well off, are you able to adapt to a lesser life after marriage? NOTE : The girl is NOT a spoilt brat but just a matter of adaptability. Of cos the guy will work hard to get a good living, I mean who doesn't? But  How would you as take the current pressure to perform? By "appropriate action" I mean how can the girl help to ease the pressure on the guy?<br><br>Takai: I agree with what you said especially the part on external pressure. No doubt a r/ship is between 2 pple but we cannot deny the influence of "outsiders". As for the couple, I'm more refering to a mature one. Everything between the couple matches as in education level and prospects. The only difference is in the financial level as a result of the family background.<br>Quite true that the guy can only do his best and not worry about the family's opinion and all, but sadly, how many can do it in our society? The situation is just like your friend's. Isn't that depressing especially for the guy? He may work hard for a better life but there is no absolute guarantee. So if he cannot achieve that level, will that affect his marriage to his present g/f?(Assuming of cos that all else between them is well)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To me, this is a decision the girl(or guy) shd make. Is your family more important than your BF/GF. If yes, then your family's view is definitely more important.<br><br>If your BF/GF is more important, then you've got to make a choice(if its really that serious lah!). BF or family?<br><br>I'm not saying family is not important, but different people hv different level of "closeness" to their family, and maybe that will be the deciding factor.<br><br>Just share something with you guys... before I got my current GF, I did told my parents before that if they didn't like the girl I choose, just too bad, cos thats my girl, not theirs...<br><br>Some may feel that I'm being rude, but I strongly believe that the choice of a partner shd be entirely in our hands, and if we choose wrongly, we blame no one but ourselves. Fair?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming? Like asif I care.....</div>
