            <div class='col-md body'>Well Merkava, I am sad too that things have degenerated to this extend. I am also relatively new here, been here for almost 3 months.<br>Initially, I did have fun in this forum. You post anything you like, do anything you like. There were intellectual topics, where people posted views on certain phenomenons, controversial topics, especially those pertaining to religion, or just boliao topics, just to inject that humour. Well, things were going all so well, but everyone knew where the line is to be drawn.<br>Right now, that line has been crossed, and the reason??? I don't know. For fun??? Well, it could have been some innocent fun initially, and maybe the person didnt know that the line has been crossed, but upon notification, what should the proper reaction be??? Two threads were posted concurrently, two different pictures, but why issit that for the first picture, the guy could withdraw the picture and apologise for the damage done, while the second one just grew even more haughty??? That is quite sad to observe. What is the point of being so antagonistic in nature??? Right now, all Tet asks for is for the website specially up to spite her to be closed, and for Lex, well, right now I'm sure she knows that the damage has already been done and there is nothing she can do about it, so she is just letting life go on. I am sure you know how it feels when through neglect, someone actually manage to steal something from u, and all u want is for that someone to return the stuff to u. I am sure that is not too much to ask for. I admit, I might be a little busybody here. Afterall, I don't even know Lex, but being in the forum for this while, I feel a little for the people here. I am not an argumentative sort, I don't go around provoking people unnecessary. But when I see something that is not right, I will naturally react to it. If you had seen the post, you could definitely anticipate the response it is going to draw. Fun, yes, to some, but at the expense of others. That is what a lot of us do at times, I myself cannot deny that at times, I am guilty of that. But when you see that in the process of your fun, you are hurting someone, and my gosh, a lady, will you feel good about it??? True, there will definitely be people who are eager to argue for the sake of arguing, who are present just to add oil to fire. That cannot be avoided. Such people exist.<br>Well, Lex and Tet are still the funloving people I perceive them to be. And for such squabbles, I will definitely try to avoid them as far as possible. I mean, no point right, my interference only got someone to name their nice site after me.<br>There is now only one thing that Tet wants right now, even though her argument provoked by someone else might suggest otherwise. But in truth, she is really upset by this whole issue, she also wants everything to end. Who doesn't??? Will we feel good when we see shades of the arms of law slowly making its way into the forum??? No one will like that. So I sincerely hope, and appeal to Zeta or whoever, just help stop all these nonsense. I am sure you don't intend for any malice. Just close down the site and not turn anything ugly yah??? It is just not worth it. There is already 2 gals really upset about this issue, and it is their wish to stop all these too. So please, it is a very simple thing to do.<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I give my word to Merkava not to post here anymore....sorry one last one. I guerantee...I am not flaming any<br><br>I believe Zeta post that topic to see how the forum react and I believe she has got what she wants..that's why today she no longer post any. The problem is the post attarcted so many reply and out of a sudden someone treaten to "Sue" somebody else..and that's when this fiasco on legal issue gets out of hand. Further more..some linux expert here with IT background (not lawyer though)step forward to block the posting and give his "sound like expert" legal advice. With that it attracted even more curious forumates who missed yesterday post and wanting very much to see the pic..along with some provocation...thus another link to pics is revealed.<br><br>Let's heed Merkava advice...stop this and let the matter rest. And let's forget about the case or no case issue..<br><br>Tet, Rev and all of lex's concerned buayas  and liz and all those who support my view.... let's post no longer on this issue ok ?<br><br>And finally, regarding the pics ..
