            <div class='col-md body'>I think Naive and me are quite alike in thinking...too practical and rational..not a risk-taker cos we dun wanna get hurt...well....we tend to be very over protective of ourselves...Is it good...??wel..it might be and it might not...Love is blind...leading to one mistake to an another...is it wrong to follow blindly?U see , it depends if a person can take hurt or not...some ppl have very high pain threshold..while others differ...Hurt is an emotional scar that lives forever even one day u die.....it is a terminal disease, haunting u right to the end...so as protective as we are...we would rather not be hurt.....then try to fight for a happiness that does not determine eternity to the future</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well... My view for this topic is that ...<br><br>Ermm.... theres no relationships that are PREFECT lor. No doubt... in the process of being together ... theres bound to have some sadness, happiness &amp; etc...<br><br>So... My point is that...<br><br>U will never know the outcome unless u really tried. If U never try... all U got is that Negative thinking in ur mind that this thing isnt gonna succeed at all. What the point right ???<br><br>&amp; like I said... since relationship can never be a prefect one... why not giving it a try ??? Cos u never know what the outcome might be.<br><br>Last words though.... Be true to urself. Know what U want &amp; do what u should do.<br><br>Ermm... me kinda talking nonsense here... but its just my point of view.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, would like to give u my unbiased answers. Question like this would probably have few answers &amp; lots of explanations along with it. So, i would like to answer what u asked for.<br><br>I or anybody(as an outsider) view the gal(gal in general &amp; no particular one), from this/my point of view:<br>Thinking: logical.(there's still a chance)<br>Action: illogical.(not worth the chance,hurt too great)<br><br>Now, put yourself as the gal. U are that gal inside that relationship now:<br>Thinking: logical.(there's still a chance)<br>Action: logical.(hoping for the best)<br><br>On buying lottery:<br>Thinking: logical.(got chance to strike)<br>Action: logical.(u might be lucky but dun strike also no hurt,only $$ fly off)<br><br>Well, i would like to say that since the word "logical/logic" might have slightly different meaning to different pple. So i'm basing on the meaning of "A particular system or method of reasoning &amp; to a lesser extent on "science of reasoning and/or sound-unsound reasoning."<br><br>I think it's not so appropriate to compare btw relationship &amp; lottery in this case. One using more on feelings, the other more on monetary gains.<br>The gains, joy or sadness, hurt etc is different....so &amp; so..<br><br>Just a thought....anyway, i think there's no right or wrong answers.....hehe.....<br><br>[This message has been edited by ALLe (edited 26 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, first let me try to interpret what asure and naive are talking about first, so if i interprret wrongly hope you two can correct me...<br>1. first what i see, naive's point of view is that as long as the chance of hurting is high, it is illogical to take the action of expressing yourself to the guy (or the gal in the other situation) so can i say that naive is based on the mathematical fact that if success&gt; 50%, it is logical and if success&lt; 50% it is illogical to take action.<br>but what if success=50%?<br>2. for asure's case, the point is that even though there's is any chance (no matter how small) other than zero, logically a person can take action on expressing his/her feeling for the other person.<br>3. i shall not consider what happens after the action taken (as in to express or not to express).<br>4. honestly speaking, both of them are correct in their own sense. logic is a series of thoughts in a process or sequence. it is correct in the light of the reasons put forth.<br>5. asure and naive's case are a example of being respectly the risk-taker and the conservative. buying toto entails a small chance, not zero, of winning. i think it is something like 1/8145060. but it doesn't mean that a person WILL NOT win. it just means that a person may not win. a person like naive would think that since it is a great chance of not winning, she will not buy, but for asure, she will buy coz to her, it has a chance.<br>6. so for the relationship, both are like buying or not the chance of getting the relationship to materialise. it is logical in their sense, since they have their respective reasons for arriving to their answer.<br>7. but putting things aside, i think that if a person does not try, he will not win, if he does, he may... that's my logic. so actually it has to depend on your logic...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i guess it is safer to think logically, in that if there's seriously no chance for the relationship to work out, then why bothered? cut your losses and get out, or even better, dont start at all. like that, you can be spared all the heartache and pain, that wont amount to anything in the end.<br><br>that's how i used to think. so i gave up a relationship. with a guy i really really liked. maybe even the first guy i ever loved.<br><br>melodramatic huh? but it's true. now thking abt it (a person's hindsight is usually very clear?), how often do you find a person you really like? how often do you feel that spark towards a certain person? and what are your chances of finding a person who actually feels the same way back?? chances like these, are very rare... especially if they came above without any help frm any of you (neither chased the other one)... the way i think now, is that if you have that chance, if you're blessed that once... grab it. even if there's less than 50% chance.. there's still that chance rite? when you're given this opportunity, seize it. if you do, you can at least say you tried... afterall, you only live once. if you're going to keep passing up every opportunity tt goes by waiting for that PERFECT one... how do you know that perfect one will come? or it could be staring you in the eye.. but you nv see it. for all you know, if you try hard enough, if you work on it.. it just might work.<br><br>sigh. my thoughts are very warbled now. ... moving in and out. hope it makes sense to someone out there...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Love cannot be defined as logical or illogical.<br><br>I suppose if you wanted to, sometimes you make decisions to do things even though the rational side of you tells you that it's not going to work. But the emotional side of you says it's alright to go try, and it may succeed, and you go ahead and do it.<br><br>It happens in many situations. Sometimes you win, sometimes you don't. Without any risk taken, there wouldn't be any gain, or loss. But in this case, in event of a loss, the loss would be the relationship but the gain would be experience for another relationship.<br><br>We sometimes would just question ourselves, what would've happen if we did things that way. Well, don't wonder! Put your good foot in and do the bad thing and experience it for yourself! Human are strange beings. Know there's danger but still venture in. It's in us, to adventure, to take risks.<br><br>So, logical or illogical, it just happens that we somehow take the illogical route, because it seems the most logical.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>What you know you can't explain, but you feel it.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>With calculated risk, she chooses to TRY to make the relationship work out, no matter how slim the chances are. The chances may be slim and the gal will be hurt, but there is a POSSIBILITY the relationship can work out. My key argument is "POSSIBILITY". If chances are impossible, then i classify action as illogical.</strong><br><br>i feel that love's not abt rationale thinking coz u love wif ur heart, not wif your head. it's not mathematical, where u can prove or equate losses or gains. therefore, even if u know that chances are slim, i would still follow my heart, coz a r/s is based on feelings not on numericals<br><br><strong>further substantiating my point:<br>Eg 1. Buying lottery: There is one in a million chances u will ever win. You will have to spend or even waste $ buying the lottery tickets. However, it is not illogical to try.. because there is a chance u CAN win and become rich overnight, although there is a higher chance u never get rich that way.</strong><br><br>People buy lottery in hope to win(although they know that chances are slim). However, sometimes its the 'hopes' that give them perks in their everyday life. They do not equate the possibilty of wat they might get against wat they might not get. be it 1 out of a million chances or 1 out of a billion chances to win, there will still be irrationale pple who would place their bet. its juz a matter of more or lesser.<br><br><strong>Well... even if the relationship works out, there will ALWAYS be hurt. We cant expect love to be smooth-sailing.</strong><br><br>i agree that there will always be hurt coz love is never smooth-sailing. However, it is due to the fact that all men make mistakes. You juz have to try and try and at the end of the day, so long as there's some1 u truly wish to live with for the rest of your life, everything's worthwhile.<br><br>'When something happens 2 u, good or bad, consider what it means. There's purpose to life's events, 2 teach u how 2 laugh more or not 2 cry 2 hard.'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Can i make the situation posted by Asure more complicated with wat i am going tru now? pls bear with my long story and hopefully u guys can help me....<br><br>My gf of 6mths and i used to be together happily. seldom quarrel and almost everyday we will meet each other. The only problem tat we have is, she likes to go night spot, but i dont. so initially we quarrel only bcos of this..<br><br>den as i get to realise tat its her hobby to dance and she has time and again assured to me tat she wont be hooked by baits of any guys who approach her, i also never interfer with her going nite spots, but i never go with her.<br><br>den one day, she called me at night to tell me tat she wanted to break off bcoz she has fallen in love with tis guy (Mr A). Later i found out tat she knew the guy frm one of those clubbing session. its too late, and i reli regretted not going with her...<br><br>The reason she like Mr A is, he enjoys clubbing and dance well (dancing is also my gf fav hobby). so she feels tat she can communicate such things with him more comfortably. but she don feel good toking such things to me... also another thing is, Mr A is very very handsome.<br><br>to make things worse, tat Mr A resembles a frenz of hers, lets call Mr B. Mr B used to chase my gf but my gf never choose Mr B bcoz she don feel secure with Mr B. The reason is, though Mr B chase my gf (tat time i still dono my gf yet), he is also waiting for his sweetheart's reply. So logically speaking, my gf tnks tat she should not go with Mr B bcoz she will feel hurt in future if Mr B goes with his sweetheart.<br><br>Now she wanted a break bcoz she says she don want to be unfair to me. she don want to be with me and yet love another guy. she don like the feeling tat when she is with me, she tnks of tat guy and when she meets tat guy, she tnks of me. so lately she has been with her gf day in day out... choosing not to meet any one of us...<br><br>But its been almost one mth since she neglected me, saying tat she never encountered such situation b4. so she needs time to tnk it tru. she don want to be like last time, not choosing Mr B though she like Mr B alot.<br><br><strong>Now its the exact duplicate of last time. She likes Mr A, but dono whether she should go with him and leave me. But at the same time, she knows tat if she is with Mr A, the r/s wont last long. But she don want to regret not choosing Mr A like she regretted not chosing Mr B the other time.</strong><br><br>So in a way, this story is similar to Asure's version. My gf knows tat she wont last with tat Mr A, but yet she stll want to consider him. Not tat i want to boast myself, when i compare myself with Mr A, i tnk in terms of a lasting r/s, my gf should choose me, not Mr A.<br><br>But again, my gf is so young (17 yrs old), tat guy in poly and i am 24. Many ppl will say tat she is still at the exploring stage, so its useless for me to hold on to tis r/s... but i know my gf well loh, she is not those type who is not serious in a r/s one... but i cant explain why such things happen loh. Well, i guess many of u know tat feelings are hard to control, when its here, you cant escape.<br><br>I don blame her, but i still trying to do sweet things for her hoping to touch her.. but its been almost 1mth and she still never give me any ans yet. When i ask, she will avoid the question, saying she still considering, ask me not to force her.<br><br>At the same time, i tried to call her, she don want to tok to me, always says will call me later, but she never did. I msg her, she never reply. I visit her home few times, she never tok to me. Sometimes i managed to ask her out in advance, she agreed but last min call to cancel and postpone. When its the date where she postponed our date to, she never contact me. I called and she says don want to meet. All these made me feel very disappointed. My heart ache, my heart sinks. its very hurtful esp when we are doing fine, yet such things happened..<br><br>Now i only hope tat she can come back soon. I wanted to give up bcoz things look very pessimistic, but i juz cant bear to. When i tnk tat she is still considering, it makes me hold back... i cried almost everynight, but she is not aware of it. I haf nightmares of her leaving me.<br><br>she sometimes even switch off her hp after i msg her continuously, not bcoz i am a stalker, but bcoz i am telling her how i feel. When i call and she press NO, i will call again. den after few times, she also off her hp....<br><br>Gals out there (including Asure and Naivagal), pls tell me wat does she want loh... tell me wat can i do also.<br><br>I haf tried to buy flowers and sent to her home and many things liao loh, but don wanna say here, otherwise ppl will lol at me for being so childish or "chi qin"... now i need fresh ideas to touch a gal's heart.. any advise frm you all?<br><br>Thanks in advance. Sorry for the long post..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yoohoo: If you love something, set it free... If it comes back, it's yours, If it doesn't, it never was yours....<br>guess if u truly love the person, its not abt having her by ur side or deciding wat is best for her. Its more abt letting her choose wat she feels would be happy(eventho it might not be the logical path).<br><br>'When something happens 2 u, good or bad, consider what it means. There's purpose to life's events, 2 teach u how 2 laugh more or not 2 cry 2 hard.'<br></div>
