            <div class='col-md body'>Realise lately that (ok... Actually, since quite some time ago...) seems like alot of people are rather reluctant to make way for others nowadays...?<br><br>2 people walking in opposite direction... The natural response I would expect (if both parties see each other) is both make way... Then, sometimes somebody just continue walking into your path though I see your presence.. Like kinda 'bochap' attitude? Some see you and though seeing you approach, pretend that you're invisible?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Some see already pretend see the other side and never see you... (when OBVIOUSLY there's nothing to see at a corner where there's no one and nothing...)<br><br>And why some people can walk in direction while their head and vision totally at the OTHER direction... And nope, it's not just a moment or talk of head... They just kept walking... Like something's wrong with their head like that... (Can't turn straight...)<br><br>Some people talk to each other... Turn, SEE and realise that someone walking towards their direction... Then back their heads back for the conversation like the person isn't there at all...<br><br>I understand that it has been EMPHASIZED over and over again... DON'T block up the route of the escalator cause someone might be in a HURRY.... It happened to me before.... No matter. I just asked the person "Excuse me." She turned around and looked at me, turned her head back front... I said again... "Excuse me, can you please make way for me? I'm in a hurry..." She REACTED. How GRATEFUL? She swifted her buttock 5 cm from its original position... GREAT... Just enough for an ANT to CRAWL in....</div>

Actually, since quite some time ago...) seems like alot of people are rather reluctant to make way for others nowadays...?<br><br>2 people walking in opposite direction... The natural response I would expect (if both parties see each other) is both make way... Then, sometimes somebody just continue walking into your path though I see your presence.. Like kinda 'bochap' attitude? Some see you and though seeing you approach, pretend that you're invisible?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Some see already pretend see the other side and never see you... (when OBVIOUSLY there's nothing to see at a corner where there's no one and nothing...)<br><br>And why some people can walk in direction while their head and vision totally at the OTHER direction... And nope, it's not just a moment or talk of head... They just kept walking... Like something's wrong with their head like that... (Can't turn straight...)<br><br>Some people talk to each other... Turn, SEE and realise that someone walking towards their direction... Then back their heads back for the conversation like the person isn't there at all...<br><br>I understand that it has been EMPHASIZED over and over again... DON'T block up the route of the escalator cause someone might be in a HURRY.... It happened to me before.... No matter. I just asked the person "Excuse me." She turned around and looked at me, turned her head back front... I said again... "Excuse me, can you please make way for me? I'm in a hurry..." She REACTED. How GRATEFUL? She swifted her buttock 5 cm from its original position... GREAT... Just enough for an ANT to CRAWL in....</div></blockquote>u know the other time this happens to me n gf rushing down the escalator, 2 fat aunties were chatting, i said politely liao excuse me, they still dun want to budge, i say twice still dun care,<br><br>i then say loudly to gf, "larling, i feel like throwing up leh !" *cought loudly and disgustingly" 2 aunties faster siam one side for me to walk, after that gf started laughin ...</div>
