            <div class='col-md body'>I have a relationship with my bf of many years. All along, I thought our relationship is the most perfect one, that he is the one for me.<br><br>I love him a lot...always believe that he is the right one for me, that no any other guys can replace him.<br><br>I thought our love is a 'jan dan ai'........as long as our hearts are closely knit with love, care &amp; understanding is all that is enough...<br><br>I thought I know him very well........but...........<br><br>Then............eventually, I found out that he flirted behind my back with another girl...he said there is no strings attached to it, that it was all merely for fun.........that he does not like her, she is not his type...<br><br>I forgave him but deep down in my heart, I am crying.......I start to ask myself...do I still trust him? The thing is, I do not know the answer myself........I feel very insecure at heart......I do not know what may happen in future again.......I somehow have lost confidence in this relationship...feel that it is slowly killing it.......<br><br>sometimes, I will wonder what he has been doing (since he lives in the hostel &amp; I only meet him during the weekends)......feel so unsafe.<br><br>I feel like treating him as nice as before..........but I am fearful, I am scared to get hurt again........I do not dare to......I have now reserves for myself........I want to protect myself........<br><br>He sensed that I am starting to treat him very cold...and he kept reassuring me that he still loves me a lot...that I am very important to him...<br><br>Now that things are so unstable for both of us, at times, I really feel like telling him how I feel..want to sort things out...but it seems as though now the only thing that I can do is to keep quiet about it because he is going to have his exams soon...and he said a slightest thing will make him very stressed...<br><br>whenever he is stressed, he wil seldom message me........most of the time, left me wondering what has happened.....<br>nowadays, because he is very stressed over his school work, feels that he is starting to ignore me again..........as his gf, I feel that no matter how stressed he is, or how unstable and unsmooth things are, I hope I will always be the first one he thought of and confide in......but how come it's the other way round??<br><br>I am really very upset...........I start to think what have I done wrongly??   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Why have things turn out this way??<br><br>nowadays, I have been living in misery.........I do not know exactly what I should do.....<br><br>pls advice...........    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>

HOW LONG will u suffer for.<br><br>life is like that sometimes.. it's not about how happy u'll be.. it's about making it less painful.  that's the pessimistic view i know.. but it <strong>IS</strong> one very real way to look at things....</div>
