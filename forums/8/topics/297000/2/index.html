            <div class='col-md body'>Now now gentlemen.<br><br>As the Neo Men Right's Movement , we are just seeking that our rights be acknowledged. I repeat myself , we are not against feminism. In today's societies , they look too much into the rights of women. Thanks to hardline right wing feminists . Its only fair that we have our rights heard . To have a mutual understanding. To tackle issues that affects bothsides , instead of a one sided view.<br><br>Many women will see this as the rise of chauvinism  , but that is because they misinterprete the cause of the movement.. Women are welcome to give their ideas to tackle these issues. Their constructive thoughts are always welcome.<br><br>Weaklings and losers b|tch and cry.. and do nothing. We take pro-active measures to takle these issues and have a greater understanding. Men do have rights too.<br><br>Our dear Kitty see's it as weaklings... . If she were to imply that weaklings because the men just give in, well.. yes. I agree. But if deemed a weakling to join the cause , then i am afraid that she is very wrong. Wealkings dont make a stand and fight for their rights. Weaklings submit , roll-over and play dead.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is a very serious matter. What has been said so far is just the tip of the iceberg. It is time we Men think long and hard how society is progressing and where will we be standing in 50 years time. Now I am sure some of you guys are thinking why do we even bother, we should bother because this is our very fundamental right as a human being. If we don't fight for it no one is going to do it for us.<br><br>Now I will give you an example of gender discrimination in today's society. RAPE. I am sure all of you know how heinous this crime is and all perpetrators should be caned, whipped, and sent to jail for a very long time. I totally agree. Those SOBs deserve a bullet in their head. However have we thought about the opposite.<br><br>False accusation of rape. Imagine a male is accused by another female that he raped her. What will be the first idea that comes to your mind. Odds are that most people would think he is pretty much guilty since most perpetrators of rape are men. Unfortunately that isn't the only thing going to happen to the poor guy if he is really innocent. His friends and family is going to start shunning him even before he is proven guilty. He might lose his job and even his family. Even after he is proven innocent he might no longer has anyone. He will pretty much be alone in this world. His life will no longer be the same. And do you know what is the best part, if he is convicted he is going to spend a long time in jail. But if the female is found to have lied her sentence is much much lighter. Let me ask you, is this fair ? An accusation of rape is not a lightly thing. Why is that is accused would be facing a harsher sentence than the accuser. The accuser should face an equally harsh sentence as such a false accusation can ruin the lives and career of the accused. Try googling false rape and find out about the lives of Men that have been destroyed.<br><br>What we need here is a public awareness of such gender discrimination. We need to make the public aware of such injustice in the system. And the only ones who can do that is ourselves. It is time we stand up and protect our rights and stamp out discrimination.<br><br>Women should help us Men in this issue. As I am sure you would also like to protect your sons and make sure he is given a fair opportunity in all aspect of their lives. Imagine if your son was falsely accused by another woman and he has to spend 15 years in jail. How would you feel ? His life is pretty much ruined forever. I don't think anyone would be happy. This is not a Man's issue or problem but everyone's.<br><br>I have other examples but for now I will leave you all to ponder.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not that i really support you guys. But i just want to ask everyone a question. Why do the woman around the world always ask for equality when there is still a  woman charter? I don't see any equality. Equality only exist on when it is to the women advantage. Seriously, Girls nowadays are so different. If it is like those during my mum's time I'm ok Government can protect them with all they want. Becos they are weak and have almost no financial power. But at least they contribute to the home by doing hsework, take care of children and take care of the husband. Things have changed. Women friends around me Just don't wanna do anything. If that is the case, Why do i have to spend money on you and you can't do anything? Do you think earning money and spend on oneself means you are utterly capable? Seriously woman who don't cook, (Don't do hsework is ok with me We can always do together.) don't take care of children, only work, I don't see what the purpose. And eventually If they complain that they don't want sex, (Sometimes is the guy fault though for not being caring) Then I guess the woman is almost the same function as a guy. Seriously Woman these days demand too much, But have you all wonder You abilities to do things are getting lesser and lesser. Please look at yourself at the mirror. Think about it. For guys do, Though guys are sometime really jerky but for those good guys around. Don't like those sneaky and evil woman who can't do anything to dominate us. If you demand a lot better show us what you can do. If the a woman function is to earn money and spend onself and wanna lead have a rich man to get married.
