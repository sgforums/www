            <div class='col-md body'>scam by phone.<br>jus realised aft claimed prize.<br>but bought nth.<br><br>Took from another forum:<br>Dear Frens:<br><br>Just to share my experience of being CONNED, and for your benefit?<br><br>1) You are approached by a teenager along Orchard Road and are asked to do a survey. You'd be approached especially if you look like foreigners. In the survey, if you indicate that you and your partner are above 25, have combined salary of $5000, and own credit card/s, you'd be entitled to a scratch-and-win lucky draw.<br><br>2) For the lucky draw, the top prize is a free 7N accomodation, and other prizes are dining/shopping vouchers from $10-$60 thereabouts. The teenager would jump in joy saying how lucky you are, as he'd be able to get commission of up to $150 if you go and collect your prize.<br><br>3) He brings you to his manager, who congratulates you, then asks that you go to a travel exhibition-fair-talk-thingy down Orchard Rd (Faber House near OG, or anywhere else). If you stay for at least 60-80mins, you'd get your gifts and the teenager would get his commission.<br><br>&gt;4) So off you go, out of pity for the boy and curiosity to check out<br>&gt;the<br>fair, esp when you know you'd have travel plans in the coming years, and<br>of course, to get your prizes. You're escorted to the office and wait at the recep.<br><br>5) You'd be asked to show ur ICs to verify ur ages, ur details would be taken down. Interestingly, there's a lucky draw. There'd be a few sets of 4 digits at the counter, and if your credit card's last 4 digits match, you'd<br>win shopping vouchers. This is when you'd take out all your credit cards,<br>and they can take the chance to verify that you do have credit cards.<br><br>6) Then, another attractive consultant would take over from the teenager and bring you into another room. Before you step in, you'd be asked to switch off your hps, not even to silent modes. You enter quite a big room with many small round tables and chairs. You sit at one with your consultant, who sits you through a survey to see ur travel preferences and spending power so they'd take note and offer you a package you'd find affordable and attractive.<br><br>7) They'd show you some cut-out pictures and floor plans of suites you'd be getting if you purchase their membership package. There won't be concrete black &amp; white info on the profile of their company. There'd be a manager who'd drop by every now and then specially when the consultant has difficulty convincing you. As the consultant and manager talk, they'd write the info down on paper, explaining to you the supposed savings if you sign up their travel packages.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Their packages are at least $10k. They also offer trial membership at $3k or so, with a Phuket trip or other freebies. They would sell the system to you and talk for hours. When you feel that the deal is good and you sign, a bell will ring and everyone there would clap and welcome you into the club. You are then asked to pay. They'd even offer great discounts and 0% interest free instalments. You even get a free welcome gift like a dvd player.<br><br>9) (a) You leave thinking you got a good deal, then try to book your holidays. Only to realise that you can't get your holidays booked even if you're 6-8months early. Or your accomodation is only 3 star, not 4/5 star.<br>You want to cancel your membership as you don't really have a chance to use it and do not have that much leave to clear, but they do not allow as you're bound by the contract. They threaten to sue you if you breach the contract. You're trapped and go on paying the membership, as well as yearly maintenance fees of a few hundred sing dollars at least. Though they promise to be able to buy the package over from you and sell it, they'd be unable to as there're too many conned people who wanna sell, but no one who wanna buy.<br><br>(b) You leave having doubts, and surf the net for more information. And realise you're conned by a timeshare company. Luckily, if you terminate within 3 working days, as stipulated by Singapore laws, you will be refunded. Get ready to be firm as they try to talk you out of cancellation.<br>Or they try to drag past the 3 days.<br><br>I have been conned to this stage and after surfing the net for more information, realised that I've fallen for a scam by timeshare companies.<br><br>I'm lucky that I find out about this within 3 days of signing, so I can get a full refund. I'd be going down tomorrow and expect a showdown.<br>Heard that they'd sit you through hours, trying to find excuses like the person in-charge is not around, or offer other packages, to make you stay in the programme. Mi &amp; fiance will remain firm tomorrow and create a big hoo-ha if necessary.<br><br>I am really very upset to go through this. But I'm concerned that we, Singaporeans, be united and warn one another against this. Let's put an end to this and protect our fellowmen and tourists. I intend to go up to those taking surveys on Orchard road, to warn them on the spot. Touting is illegal in Singapore anyway! We need to boost our tourism too! How can we allow these people with ill-intentions spoil our clean and lawful image?<br>Tourists who are conned can get a refund from Singapore Tourism Board(STB) though.<br><br>I hope that more people would be forewarned against these scams. This message is prepared to bring more awareness to as many people as poss.<br>With such an awareness, you would not be curious to find out more about their travel talks, neither would you and your loved ones go through losing thousands and tens of thousands paying for nothing but heartache and constant disturbing calls. (They'd keep calling to ask you to upgrade your package, etc.)<br><br>Have attached related websites for those who'd like to find out more, and are looking for avenues for the possibility to get a refund or take legal action. Please refer if you have a few minutes.<br>i) http://www.geocities.com/hcspore03/<br>ii) http://www.voy.com/161450/<br>iii) http://www.petitiononline.com/hcspore3/<br><br>May we enjoy affordable holidays within our own means, without headaches and heartaches.<br>DO NOT be conned anymore.<br>Let's boycott these surveyors and cold-callers and some who got your numbers through asking their current members.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What 6100 said was very true.<br><br>My friend was approached by one of those teenagers doing survey and went up to the office.  The one at Faber House, if I'm not wrong or unless they changed company name, is called Asian Travel Club.  There have been a few topics on time share companies.  Trying doing a search on Asian Travel Club on the left of your screen.<br><br>Also my friend, like what 6100 said, was told to turn off the phone, not even on silent mode.  I guess they don't want you to be disrupted by phone calls, so that they can concentrate on brainwashing you.  I won't say they are out to cheat.  But they are so desperate for sales that they sell to people who don't even need it, by making them think that they need it or making it sound like a good deal.  They even resort to dirty tricks like calling you up to say that you won a lucky draw.  But actually they got your number from somebody else.  They won't have your home address (lucky draw tickets will have this information) and claim that the computer randomly pick the lucky winners and only churn out the telephone number of the winners.<br><br>They called me upteen times last year and this year.  Once I said no, dun want the price.  The girl shouted at me.<br><br>In summary:<br>1.  Be careful of time share company.<br>One of them is located at Faber House (next to UOB and OG).  The other is located at Delphi Orchard.  (there may be more.  So be careful).<br>2.  Be careful of youngster doing survey around that area.<br>3.  Beware of "lucky draw" phone calls.  (lucky draw winners are normally notified by post, don't they?)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all my 1st post here, hope what i am going to write is useful,<br><br>To 6100,<br><br>when you go back to cancel your membership you have to be firm to them and have to endure their sarcastic remarks and poor attitude. There are known cases which police were called because of fights between the customer and sales person.<br><br>To all,<br><br>do not trust time sharing company, their trick is to get you to sign up using their so called "free gifts" example, a trip to some holiday resort island or something else, even if you don't sign-up they still "gives" you that trip package for "free", thats what they tells you, just that you have to sit through the whole presentation of their so called "holiday package".<br><br>Lets talk about the free gift, the holiday resort island, those who signed up for their 10k+++ plan will be able to go for it free of charge "Because they have already got you to commited to their "scam for life", why is it for life i tell you later.<br><br>Those that don't accept their "holiday package" will also get the free trip but whenever you try to call or fax to book the date for the free trip you will get a reply like there's no slots for the next few months. That is because the so-called "Travel Agency" is also under the time sharing company.<br><br>ok now lets say you signed up for the plan, do your own calculation do you think you have a good deal for 10k+++ for their "holiday package". After the initial 10k+++ you still "have to" pay a monthly maintenance of maybe 75 bucks you may think its a small amount but imagine theres already 1000+ people before you who are already paying it,  thats why its a scam for life.<br><br>To all the Guys, most of the female sales person there are very pretty i have seems some of them before i have to hand it to them as they are very good at the Art of Convincing people to sign, so don't be charmed by them and commit to a silly mistake as to signing the contract.<br><br>Sad to say there's still people who sign-up for this deals as they think they have a very good package those [regulars, doctors, engineers and families] &lt;-- Mostly Guys bewares, they like to pick on them as they think its easier. What i said above is true, how do i know it? Not because i have being scammed by those people. Just that i use to have a girlfriend that work there.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Hope what i have type above helps!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>True. I was approached once and won a 7 days stay voucher and $20 dollar voucher by stratching some boxes. I was then ask to attend the talk at faber house so as to claim the gift. The guy that ask me say he would be given $150 as bonus as i strike the gold star and win the acommodation and the comission will only be paid to him if i attend the talk and stay for 1 hr.<br>Judging from he expression and his friends expression, i dun think he know what is behind all this. He may not received $150 but i think the $ should be good.<br>During the talk, the ppl was crappy. They keep on insisted that you will save money and assume that all of us will have time and want to travel 7 days each year for the next 20 years. They calculation is way off as they always compare to best hotels pricing at peak periods and dun bother abt the package pricing. dun forget, you still have to pay for your air tickets iof you get their deal.<br>I am not saying that they are not good. but if you based only on their calculation to make decision, then you most probably will regret. Think twice do your own calculation. In the end, i was ask to leave earlier which i am more than happy as they know i dun intend to buy, and they also nv give me my shopping voucher. Judging from the other posts, i think the hotel voucher might be useless 2.<br><br>Dun blame the helpers, they might nt know what the whole thing is abt. If they know, i say shoot them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>
