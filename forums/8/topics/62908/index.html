            <div class='col-md body'>Not the first time it happened to me.<br><br>Previously i had never allowed myself to fall in love with a non-christian, reasons being many, and most ppl should know wat they are.<br>Yet recently i've fallen in love with a really special girl . I don't care if she's a Taoist. I don't care if she'll never ever convert. It doesn't matter anymore. Alll that matters to me is love. And indeed we love each other very deeply.<br>Yet she has asked to leave, because of religion. I've never imposed my religion on her, but she knows how deeply ingrained i am in my religion. She feels that it would not work out in the long run. How could she give up without trying? She doesn't want to hurt both of us later on... so she rather hurt us now??<br><br>Sadness don't even begin to describe how i feel...!</div>

For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness? What harmony is there between Christ and Belial ? What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? 16What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: "I will live with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people."<br>"Therefore come out from them<br>and be separate, says the Lord.<br>Touch no unclean thing,<br>and I will receive you."<br>"I will be a Father to you,<br>and you will be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty."<br><br>since u are so professional.. mind explain to this poor dumb n00bish boy, what this mean? *raise one eyebrow*</div>

At least to me it is. I love her so much that i had considered that, but it would only be lying to both her and myself. Afterall it is all just a label. Whether i call myself a Chrisitian or not, it comes down to what's really in my heart. There are many who call themselves Christians, but are they really?<br>Anyway, i've talked to her today. She's simply against the label Christian. She loves me, but juz can't accept the label. Duh! I told her, whether i am a Christian or a Buddhist or a Muslim, i'm still Justus who loves you with all his heart. What difference does it make? I don't force my religion on others. Whether you eventually believe or not is up to you. I won't even preach. You'll see with your own eyes my religion in me. I dun do anything that even identifies me as a Christian. I don't close my eyes when i give thanks for my food even! The only thing is that i go church on Sundays and perhaps some other days!<br>She admits that when we're together she doesn't have any problems at all. Its when she's alone at home, she starts thinking and you know... Duh! Its all because of something that hasn't and will not happen!<br>Justus Loves Rainn and thats it!

Prove to her you are willing to forsake your religion for her. If you don't, that means deep within your heart, your Lord still take precedence over her. Come to the crunch will you forsake your lady for the name of your religion if you are to choose?</div>

For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness? What harmony is there between Christ and Belial ? What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? 16What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: "I will live with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people."<br>"Therefore come out from them<br>and be separate, says the Lord.<br>Touch no unclean thing,<br>and I will receive you."<br>"I will be a Father to you,<br>and you will be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty."<br><br>since u are so professional.. mind explain to this poor dumb n00bish boy, what this mean? *raise one eyebrow*</div></blockquote>i hv no comments...everyone has different ability of understanding n decrypting msg though i dun agree wif the abv stmt but i believe all religion teaches us to respect live in harmony.<br><br>anyway, jus curious to noe....does parents / children who is a non christian disown their kinship after converting to christain<br></div>
