            <div class='col-md body'>Tis is interesting...<br><br>I think u better give up the girl or u change your religion. They r many example of success stories, but they too exists many stories of family problems and broken families due to religion too. U may feel lots of love for tat girl now, however will tat feeling be as strong 10 or 20 years down the road ? R u able to tolerate her as well as now ? She can go to church with u, can u go to temple with her ? She may want the children to put a talisman for safety, will u change it to a cross ? She want a chinese altar at your new house, will u allow her to build one ? When she go out with your church friends, and they start to talk in religious making her uncomfortable, will u defend her and condemn your friends or just keep quiet making her more uncomfortable ?<br><br>This is problem with human. They tend to view things in their own perspective. Everyone feel tat the others r wrong while he is the right one. U will see totally no point in building an altar in house. They cost more and make the house more ugly. It is quite embarrassing when your church friends visit your house too. She may see u spending sunday and much time in church completely a waste of time too. She may view it as u rather waste time than accompany her. These r potential problems in future<br><br>A good example is why do u think your own religion is the "correct" path ? Maybe the whole bible is all fake while the taoist give a correct explanation of life and after life. Maybe the Buddhist is correct in reincarnation and Catholic is wrong in hell. Maybe in the end science is he ultimate truth in describing everything. Wat makes u so certain u r treading the correct path ? All religion believer believe they r the one treading the correct one, but different religion tell things so vastly different. Certainly only one is correct. Why do u think u r so lucky to be in the correct religion ?<br><br>Everyone is blind only to the things they believe in.</div>

I don't care if she's a Taoist. I don't care if she'll never ever convert. It doesn't matter anymore. Alll that matters to me is love. And indeed we love each other very deeply.<br>Yet she has asked to leave, because of religion. I've never imposed my religion on her, but she knows how deeply ingrained i am in my religion. She feels that it would not work out in the long run. How could she give up without trying? She doesn't want to hurt both of us later on... so she rather hurt us now??<br><br>Sadness don't even begin to describe how i feel...!</div></blockquote>Really, the issues isn't about this man; everyone heard of successful stories and the suffering bit as well. Actually its more about....<br><br>*Applies to both*<br><br><strong>So sure after you expand all your effort and energy in creating a win-win solution that could last for long term, that this relationship will last to enjoy what you have planted?</strong> People rather give up at first because if things doesn't work in the end (regardless of whatever option you both made), at least, you don't have to go through really mental/emotional/spiritually challenging issues and difficult scenarios to handle.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Think... If after you took so much hardship to render this problem to no problem and this relationship ends because of other factors - its like a real waste of effort ya?<br><br>P.S: I try not to talk about religion when it comes to love - its a separate thingy (although it brings indirect issues.) The bottomline is - <strong>are you willing to risk your effort without regrets if things were to go wrong</strong>? Nobody says its going to be easy - my question is: are you willing? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
