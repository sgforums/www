So what does it take to capture the romantic attention of this next generation star? According to Jaycee, he doesnÂ’t ask for much in a girlfriend, just as long as the girl doesnÂ’t scare him out of his wits with bad vocals.<br><br>Â‘If the girl is in the entertainment business, she needs to be able to sing and have her own style. But if sheÂ’s out of the circle, IÂ’d prefer she not sing at all.Â’<br><br>He reasoned: Â‘IÂ’ve seen girls who look hot but they cannot sing, and itÂ’s terrifying to see how hard theyÂ’re trying to hit that note and getting the tempo all wrong.<br><br>OK, not exactly what DaDump had envisioned the heir to AsiaÂ’s biggest action star would say but to each his own. Anything else he would look out for? Well, besides that, Jaycee also doesnÂ’t want an airhead round his arm.<br><br>Â‘(I donÂ’t ask for much) as long as theyÂ’re not dumb and ask stupid questions.<br><br>Â‘I like an intelligent girlfriend or wife, but I donÂ’t want someone who would use her intelligence to manipulate me, but rather to protect me, just like my mum,Â’ he added.<br><br>Since Jaycee, 25, stepped foot into show business in 2004 (he has acted in several movies like The Twins Effect II and has released a Mandarin album), he has been plagued by rumors about who heÂ’s reportedly dating.<br><br>Malaysian singers Penny Tai and Fish Leong were not spared. And lately, Hong Kong singer-actress Fiona Sit too. But the parties involved have all denied the gossip.<br><br>HeÂ’s been photographed hanging out with several different women and accused by the Hong Kong media of being a flirt like his father.<br><br>Â‘Then I guess everyoneÂ’s like my dad. You go out to have drinks with friends, thatÂ’s what all the Hongkongers do, so itÂ’s kind of stupid to say Â‘HeÂ’s like his dadÂ’, you know,Â’ he said in his lazy American drawl.<br><br>He recently wrapped up filming on a new Benny Chan-movie, Invisible Target, and is supposed to continue work on his next album, which he says will be out by the end of next year.<br><br>But Jaycee admits he can be quite a klutz when it comes to love.<br><br>Â‘I can be pretty sweet but sometimes, I can be careless with a lot of things. And I canÂ’t remember datesÂ…Â’<br><br>When it comes to affairs of the heart, itÂ’s not Jackie whom he seeks advice from, but his mother, former Taiwanese actress Lin Feng-chiao (left).<br><br>Â‘My mum tells me that good girls donÂ’t chase after guys. I believe in that.<br><br>Â‘ItÂ’s kind of weird knowing that your girlfriend has pursued many men before. It just doesnÂ’t work for me,Â’ he said.<br><br>Jaycee, who has been through four past relationships, is also a gentle, new-age guy who is averse to hurting girls.<br><br>He said: Â‘Some (girls) may not suit you, so donÂ’t force it. But I wonÂ’t initiate the break up.<br><br>Â‘I will start to back off really slowly, they wouldnÂ’t even notice. And one day theyÂ’d stop calling me and IÂ’ll stop calling.<br><br>Â‘I donÂ’t want to hurt anyone.Â’<br><br>But when it comes to his mother, Jaycee will not show mercy to those who hurt her.<br><br>Â‘If the media harms or disturbs my mum or my grandfather, that will get me really upset. IÂ’d kill people for my mum or grandpa, especially my mum,Â’ he declared.<br><br>What about his father?<br><br>Â‘For my dad, I donÂ’t care, go ahead. HeÂ’s a man, he can protect himself.<br><br>Â‘Even the reporters are scared of him,Â’ he joked.<br><br><a href="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/show/story/0,4136,126178,00.html" rel="nofollow">Media Source</a><br><br><strong>WOW!
