            <div class='col-md body'><strong>An Alternative To Criticism</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Preach the word! Be ready in season and out of season. Convince, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching.</span><br><br>~ 2 Timothy 4:2<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Shortly after graduation, Joe and Lana married. One of their first marital discoveries was their very different understanding of Â“being on time.Â” Not wanting to end the honeymoon stage too early, Lana found herself mildly complaining about JoeÂ’s being late. But Joe never took the hint and soon her complaining turned to outright criticism.<br><br>On the surface, there may not seem to be much difference between exposing a problem and criticizing it, but in a relationship, the choice of words can bring very different responses. Criticism attacks someoneÂ’s personality and character. When Lana criticized Joe, she would say, Â“YouÂ’re only thinking about yourself!Â”<br><br>Putting an issue on the table for discussion in a positive manner is the first step toward finding a resolution. A person who asks gently, Â“Does it embarrass you when we are late?Â” is opening a dialog for finding a solution to the problem. Criticism only wounds the spirit, puts the other person on the defensive and usually ends up in an argument that doesnÂ’t solve anything.<br><br>Watch what you say! Criticism can cause a wound that takes years to heal, but a kind and gracious attitude in problem-solving can save you years of tears!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>But I know of somebody who is habitually late. Once I asked him, "Don't you feel paiseh when you're always late?" His reply, "Yah, but I'm thick-skinned enough, so it's ok." How then should we criticise somebody like that so that he knows that we're actually trying to help him solve a problem?</div>
