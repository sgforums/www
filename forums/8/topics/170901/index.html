            <div class='col-md body'>Yea... after reading the post, i tink many people will feel as if the 'friend' is entirely at wrong. Well to a certain extend, it may be.. But have you ever thought of the reason why he block u and not informed u about any changes of hp no. and stuffs, there must be a reason. A friend is always better than a enemy, everyone does someting for a reason. Try to think abt when he block u and think about wat caused him to block u..</div>
