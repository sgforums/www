But have you ever thought of the reason why he block u and not informed u about any changes of hp no. and stuffs, there must be a reason. A friend is always better than a enemy, everyone does someting for a reason. Try to think abt when he block u and think about wat caused him to block u..</strong></blockquote>Very true.. I mean, if you're the kind who has always been complaining about minor stuff that caused him to be pissed with you.. I wouldn't be surprised at why he blocked you?
