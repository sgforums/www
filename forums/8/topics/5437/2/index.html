            <div class='col-md body'>Mr. Firewine (I assume you are a man therefore blatantly ignoring the title of this thread, but I am also a man that can not resist the urge to reply to you crap post)<br><br>"Although I don't find it boring, I really find it a total waste of time."<br>There are things that are a total waste of time that you donÂ´t find boring, please tell us what they are?<br><br>"What's so interesting abut a bunch of jocks kicking around a ball all night and then afterwards go out and beat people up on the street...."<br>If you are blind to your own predjudices I feel truly sorry for you. This statement not only indicates the absense of intelligence but also a narrow mind. I feel sorry for you and those who are forced to spend any prolonged time with you.<br><br>"Is it because it makes guys feel manly and united? I guess u can tell I have something against jocks...Why not play games, or watch movies, or go out with friends, go on a date." Do you really think that ppl interested in sports have no other interests? Another example of your narrowmindedness and ignorance.<br><br>"If it was such a fantastic sport, why aren't as many women interested?" In the US there are more women footballers registred than men footballers. That aside your argument is flawed. What if more men than women are interested in football. Does that make the sport less valid? Are you trying to be some sort of reversed sexist here?<br><br>"Because to me, I find that it's just a bunch of guys playing out some primal urge to beat another person, and a bunch of equally instictive guys viewing it who subscribe to this instinctive male behavior." Yes, of course we all envy you for being such an advanced being, passing your judgement on all of us. If that is all you can see in the game of football I am seroiusly worried about your perceptive ability and mental health. Trying to see ghosts where there arenÂ´t any is pretty serious if you ask me.<br><br>"Or else why is it so often that these same football players go out and beat people to a pulp on the street." I hope you have some empirical backing for your statement here, because I have never experienced football players as violent. If you have any proof lets see it. Otherwise you are just a loudmouth and a storyteller.<br><br>"My dad, who is British, told me that the footballers and the players themselves are just a bunch of organized street thugs. he told me about how often these players would gather and gang up and beat people up and break people's properties because noone is willing to stop them." Obviously you shouldnÂ´t listen to your dad to much, because he is talking a lot of crap that has no basis in reality. Once again produce some evidence that proves what you are saying is true, or are you merely wasting our time with predjudiced nonsense your daddy told you.<br><br>"I would have to say that i wouldn't want to be a fan of anything that provokes this kind of "support" where they destroy property and maim,and injure other people...." And what has this to do with the game of football. You seem obsessed with the idea that footballers are violent prone individuals, and that is not my experience. Seems like you come from a position where you have made your mind up without checking the facts.<br><br>"So anyone wanna tell me? This is the one thing I just can't figure out about guys." By the level of understanding you have shown in your post IÂ´ll assume that there is a lot of things you donÂ´t understand about anything.<br><br>"If it's a matter of manliness why not enjoy "American Footbal?" Anybody play that before?" Once again, you show that you donÂ´t understand anything, it is not about manliness, the game itself has a beauty ppl like you will probably never understand.<br><br>"Hey believe me, if u talk manly this is the game as welll as Hockey,...and rugby(but this one is just about a bunch of guys beating each other to a pulp...no real skill or thought necessary.)" Well no need to comment this, your stupidity and narrow mindedness says it all.<br><br>"But USA Football is all about skill, planning, and strategy...almost all purely strategy and brute force....It's like the ultimate use of the human essense..." Oh, surprise surprise, here brute force and all those hormonal urges. To qoute yourself "just a bunch of guys playing out some primal urge to beat another person". You serously claim that this applies to football and not to american football.<br><br>"Brainds, and brute force...Hey these guys aren't small....Each of them weigh in at 300 or 400 pounds maybe some at 500 pounds. That's fucking heavy....No amount of padding can protect you from that kind of force ramming into you. I don't like it much either...but just a thought... why not American football...." So football isnÂ´t brutal enough for you. Sorry I forgot, you donÂ´t like any of these masculine activities.<br><br>"Normal football is just about endurance and kicking a ball....is there any plan or strategy to the game besides keep the ball from their star player?" Of course it is about kicking a ball, just like playing a Mozart symphony is about hitting a note and Steinbeck writing a novel is about putting a word after another.<br><br>Firewine, by your posts I would say you are a juvenile fellow who thing very highly of youself and your (and your daddys too) views. But by stereotyping and making assumptions that have no basis in reality you have accomplished something you probably havenÂ´t set out to do, making yourself look like an ass.<br><br>I hope you will recover from your narrow mindedness and illusions of greatness.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>* sigh*....I guess u guys fail to realise that there are a lot of football hooligans...and every time there is a major match, all u have to do is watch the news...u read don't u?  Ever see the Tele?  Every time with no fail, and allways people get injured or seriously hurt and property destroyed...<br><br>REmemeber France just recently, football fans destroyed the whole business street there...all the shops and property totally destroyed...<br><br>And as for ur British fans, I'm sure they would like to come here and show me how real football fans behave right?  By trying to thrash me to pieces right?  and because u are fans, ui probably have a hard time believing that footballers can be violent as hell...<br><br>U guys call it passion for the sport, I call it an excuse to do shit...:-(<br><br>Why aren't Singaporeans rioting every time there's a majhor match?  U don't even have to ask me that...Singaporeans are so subdued and non inclined to rioting it's not funny...u wouldn't even riot if the government took away ur house...it's a fact what...It can't be denied...<br><br>Lemme see, where else...South America rioting just recently also...guess u "never" heard of that also.<br><br>I guess it would be too much to think that ur football heroes go out and create havoc on the streets (obviously not all)...<br><br>And as for my dad...He's a sporting type..used to play all this...What he told me he stated as a fact, not as a bias...So he knows what it's about...<br><br>Me being narrow minded?  How about u come out of ur sheltered environment and see things as they are...<br><br>My point was not that i hated football, it was that I'd rather not be part of it even though it may be a small group that do cause serious trouble for other people...<br><br>This stands for everything else also...If I find an organization doing something I don't like, Definately I won't wantt to be a part of it....Altho it's not league regualtions for fans to riot, they do...and that's a fact.<br><br>I'm not trashing all u fans out there in Singapore or anywahere else as i know not everyone is like this(but enough are OK!!!)...<br><br>Sheesh, call down ur British friends...yah right...I'm sure my property would get thrashed also...sarcasm intended...<br><br>If there's nothing else that I am totally revulsed by on this planet, it's fanaticism of any kind.<br><br>U know what's wrong with it. Protect ur object of fantacism at any cost necessary right?<br><br>So yes, I aim this post at fanatics....I knew I was going to get blasted for this...:-)<br><br>And no, I have no idea what the hell an offside is...I don't even know how to dribble a basjketball for christs sake...<br><br>I don't like sports...The only sport I ever engaed in was baseball(very shortlived), and martial arts....And my preference being Martial arts...Don't ask me why...I just like it...and it's not to beat people up.<br><br>So there u have it, call it narrow-mindedness or shallowness on my part, but I'm not the sporting type...so altho I'm not intending to insult ur game, I'm sure u all see it as such.  Can't really blame u there...so punish me...I'll be back to read the heated posts here later tonight.<br><br>Burn baby burn!!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Football is not about 22 grown men running up and down a big patch of green grass chasing after a black and white ball with a humongous crowd cheering them on. And isn't all ball games about grown men(or women) chasing after a ball? Sheesh!<br><br>But firewire's misunderstanding of football is understandable lah. Don't flame him juz becoz he doesn't understand it. Coz I was like him 6 years ago. Till of course, a certain game called CM changed all that. Lame as it sounds but yes, a PC game got me hooked to football. I'm not a fanatic who stays up till 4-5am to catch a match but I would scour the web the whole day to check out the latest news.<br><br>CM anyone?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Why?

            <div class='col-md body'>Woah guys!! I think things are getting a little out of hand here!<br><br>Firewire is entitled to put his view across of why he doesn't like football, but he is wrong about the hooligan aspect of the game.<br><br>Zappy, WuTang - understandable why you back our game and defend us, because foreigners really have no real understanding of the passion of football and its supporters here in England (and indeed Turkey, Italy, et al).<br><br>I think you all need to step back a second and think before you rant!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Firewire - football holligans are not guys like me and my son who watch football matches and then have a fight afterwards. Those people count for around 1% of the football spectators.<br><br>The other 1% are a well-organised crowd of organised crime and is recognised by the European Union as an elite alongside the Mafia (shocking but true!).<br><br>Ok, fans like me might get into the occasional fight, but the aggression that takes place in foreign lands is now run by criminals and violent factions.<br><br>Fire - you gotta understand that us Europeans have lived with soccer for the last hundred years and its part of our tradition - just as AF is with you. Violence has been drastically reduced around our soccer grounds since the 1980s, and looks set to stay that way with football becomming a major family activity on a Saturday afternoon!<br><br>That's all.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well basically few girls actually are interested in  football and if they are don't know much into it (Deeply anyway) Most girls (Well younger like 14/15) if I ask them 'who do you support?' most will reply with Man Utd. This really pisses me off because as a Man Utd supporter myself, all I have to do is ask them a simple question like when did they win the European Cup for the first time and who was the manager at the time? They reply 'errrrrmmmmmmm I dunno!'I mean the girls that are interested in football and do know about it are fine, I sometimes chat to them about the game and reflect on teams etc. But well I just hate girls who ''support Man Utd'' cos of Beckham or their sucess.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firewire mate, there's just something about Footie that makes it the most popular sport in the world! Every year, millions of people pour their hopes and dreams into their team or country, wishing for success, but a lot of the time all you get is heartache!<br><br>Most men and a good few women have a deep passion about football that runs deep down into their heart! Personally I'm a Liverpool fan and have suffered many a heartache in not quite achieving greatness durin the time I've supported them, I'm 15! For me having so much depression and heartache and maybe the excitement of going on a cup run and maybe winning it or doing really well in the league gets me more than going out with my girlfriend! She doesn't really like footie although she does like Michael Owen and David Beckham scum!<br><br>I have an undying love for football and have vowed to move to merseyside and rent a flat and also to buy a season ticket! Ever since I was little, all I've ever wanted to do was play footie professionally and everyone thought I would make it, but unfortunately I had to move to Australia for 3 years as part of my dad's job! While there my skills just stationalised and I got no better and ended up putting on weight! I have been back in Ireland 3 years now, and have lost all the weight but am in a B "B" side in A1 league and although my confidence is oozing I don't think I'll make it professionally, so now am looking to make a career in sports journalism!<br><br>As I've said before, everyone who likes football pours a certain amount of passion into it! It is an art and is a form of gambling as you gamble your hopes and dreams for a bit of elation! I have leaned to appreciate success more as I support an underachieving club! I know that hooliganism is a major part of football, but that's only a tiny amount of people compared the world-over! And it is a shame as it gives people like you the wrong impression! I reckon I could change your mind about football! I think you should support a team like Chelsea, a team striving for success but maybe just lacking that experience in that section! To sum it up I find that football is like a religion that people follow very deeply, if you lose, you'll be in a depressed and angry mood, if you win, you'll be in an excellent mood and if you fail, you may release some tears but all the depression will one day lead to huge elation and all that waiting will be worth as you'll feel on top of the world!</div>
