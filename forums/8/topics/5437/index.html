            <div class='col-md body'>No, frankly, i don't know and don't care for football. I have tried to understand the deep love for the game, and i even attempted watching it with my dad, but he got sooo irritated with me cos' he had to explain every single offside/inside/whatever the crap else there is, he told me to go to either go to sleep or read up on soccer then come watch a match with him. Is it football or soccer?? when you say football i think american football.<br><br>Yeah so i'm one of the girls who know zilch abt the game, and i don't pretned to know either. When my guys friends start talking abt football/soccer (WHICH is it??) i basically fall asleep. BUT, i do watch &amp; play  basketball (occasionally) and tennis (yaay!)! However i find that everytime i go down to the local CC to play bball, all the little ah bengs there go "wah girl can play ah?" and when i actually do show some skill ( ok i admit i'm not a regular mikey jordan) they go "wah girl can play ah?" and they spew some more vulgarities here and there before leaving me alone.<br><br>ok, maybe running after a little green ball is as useless as chasing after a black and white one, but again, its a matter of prefernece, and i like tennis tonnes more than football/soccer. OK admitted, now on to other things in life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I just don't understand....Why are so many guys here so interested in football?  Although I don't find it boring, I really find it a total waste of time.  What's so interesting abut a bunch of jocks kicking around a ball all night and then afterwards go out and beat people up on the street....<br><br>Is it because it makes guys feel manly and united?  I guess u can tell I have something against jocks...Why not play games, or watch movies, or go out with friends, go on a date.<br><br>...but Football??????<br><br>Ok, comon guys, Blast me...I'm in for it now...:-)<br><br>But can anyone please tell me what the interest is.  Every guy I know likes football...Why????  Seeing how many guys like football here, i'm almost inclined to think that it's just yet another example of everyones following everyone else...like no wonder people say singaporeans got no leadership among it's citizens....Is it a case of not wanting to be the one who is uncool for not liking football?<br><br>If it was such a fantastic sport, why aren't as many women interested?  Because to me, I find that it's just a bunch of guys playing out some primal urge to beat another person, and a bunch of equally instictive guys viewing it who subscribe to this instinctive male behavior.<br><br>Or else why is it so often that these same football players go out and beat people to a pulp on the street.<br><br>My dad, who is British, told me that the footballers and the players themselves are just a bunch of organized street thugs.  he told me about how often these players would gather and gang up and beat people up and break people's properties because noone is willing to stop them.<br><br>And as u can see by all the fans and the mess they cause, I would have to say that i wouldn't want to be a fan of anything that provokes this kind of "support" where they destroy property and maim,and injure other people....<br><br>So anyone wanna tell me?  This is the one thing I just can't figure out about guys.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>of course there is....<br>it takes plannning to win a match you know, it is not just kicking a ball and chasing after it.<br>most of the tatical work is done by the manager and his staff.<br>if football is all abt kicking a ball, keeping the ball away from their star player(that is tatics btw),why do managers get sacked?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>firewire, you don't like football, so are you sure you're a guy?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>"But can anyone please tell me what the interest is. Every guy I know likes football...Why???? Seeing how many guys like football here, i'm almost inclined to think<br>that it's just yet another example of everyones following everyone else...like no wonder people say singaporeans got no leadership among it's citizens....Is it a case of not wanting to be the one who is uncool for not liking football?"<br><br>Ever wondered whether it could be because we really like the sport and the players?!<br><br>Who says there is a case of being 'uncool' for not liking football? I have to admit that I myself have friends who don't really like football, but I and my other footballing friends DON'T OSTRACIZE them or anything!!! I can find football very boring sometimes but I still like it most of the time.<br><br>"If it was such a fantastic sport, why aren't as many women interested?"<br><br>Could it be that until now, Football was never really considered a women's sport? It was considered too physical in that aspect, but more and more women are taking up football now.<br><br>Do you know how many women teams took part in the Women's World Cup and do you know how many people WATCHED it!??!<br><br>"Because to me, I find that it's just a bunch of guys playing out some primal urge to beat another person, and a bunch of equally instictive guys viewing it who subscribe to this instinctive male behavior.<br><br>Or else why is it so often that these same football players go out and beat people to a pulp on the street."<br><br>What kind of bullshit is this?! You saying that all FOOTBALLERS and FANS are hooligans going on to the streets after every match and whacking people up??? If that were the case, then even in Singapore, there would be riots every Saturday night!!!<br><br>"My dad, who is British, told me that the footballers and the players themselves are just a bunch of organized street thugs. he told me about how often these players would<br>gather and gang up and beat people up and break people's properties because noone is<br>willing to stop them."<br><br>I don't know about this British stuff, but I sure hope that some of my British friends can<br>come over here and tell you off.<br><br>"And as u can see by all the fans and the mess they cause, I would have to say that i<br>wouldn't want to be a fan of anything that provokes this kind of "support" where they<br>destroy property and maim,and injure other people...."<br><br>Yeah sure, if you prove it to me that footballers are all hardcore organized street vandalising people bashing mafia leaders who organize their fans into doing the same, then I will also stop watching football!<br><br>"If it's a matter of manliness why not enjoy "American Footbal?" Anybody play that before?"<br><br>I've seen it, and it can bore the pants off me, you can not compare that to football!<br><br>"But USA Football is all about skill, planning, and strategy...almost all purely strategy and brute force....It's like the ultimate use of the human essense..."<br><br>Purely strategy, you mind telling me what strategy they have besides trying to get up front by at least 10 yards, trying to give that touchdown pass or trying to use a kicker to score?<br><br>"Brainds, and brute force...Hey these guys aren't small....Each of them weigh in at 300<br>or 400 pounds maybe some at 500 pounds. That's ****ing heavy....No amount of padding can protect you from that kind of force ramming into you."<br><br>You're just talking about brute force now, where are the brains involved? Where is the BLOODY SKILL involved in AMERICAN PISH POSH FOOTBALL?!?!<br><br>"Normal football is just about endurance and kicking a ball....is there any plan or<br>strategy to the game besides keep the ball from their star player?"<br><br>Having good endurance is a key in football, able to last the full 90mins or more is already a big achievement, especially for outfield players. No strategy involved in football...SHEESH, I bet you don't even know what an OFFSIDE is right?!?!<br><br>Some teams may have star players but football is a TEAM SPORT, it involves TEAM WORK. Every single player is important and doesn't rely on a single player to win the game.<br><br>The goalkeeper can sometimes be the matchsaver for the team.<br>The defence is there to do the dirty work off the team by cutting out the opposition's balls and then working out the attack from the defence, the midfield both helps out in defence and attack and of course the attack is there to finish off both their hard work.<br><br>If you think that football is only about to "keep the ball from their star player" then you really don't know a thing about football!<br><br>Oh yeah, if that's the way you think, then I suggest you go out and buy the game Championship Manager 3, and if you can come back and show me that you've won the European Cup and FA cup and the Premier League by starting with a conference team without cheating, then I will probably start to think that there isn't any strategy in football!<br><br></div>
