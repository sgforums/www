            <div class='col-md body'>Think about the simese( or how do u spell that?) twins who operated in singapore and only 1 survived. are they borned equal? do they have the chance to do even simple things we enjoy like sports? and when one has to die if they wanted to continue the separation, do they have a choice? compare them to normal human. hmmm but the only thing which is equal comparing them to us is that THEY LIVE THEIR LIFE TO THE FULLEST.</div>
