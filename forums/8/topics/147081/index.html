            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>I suspect that many of you are confusing the terms 'equal' and 'identical'.<br><br>Obviously two objects need not be identical to each other; but as long as whatever differences there are between them are not differences of value, then the two objects can be said to be of the same value as each other; and therefore to be of equal value.<br><br>Christianity affirms the same thing about human beings: person A and person B can be as different as you like from each other (and in fact person A can even possess more 'gifts' than person B, however you may care to define the term 'gifts') but so long as A and B aren't differentiated from one another by any difference in which a difference of value should be implicated, it would still be the case that A and B are each of one and the same value.<br><br>The argument can be put like this:<br><br>1) If my value as a human being derives from the value assigned to me by God (and if human beings are distinguishable from one another by means of the gifts which each possesses but which each could have not possessed and yet have still remained the same person), then it has to follow that:<br><br>2) Whatever differences there are between myself and some other person ( where the differences in question turn on our possession of one or more of the aforesaid 'gifts'), simply do not involve a difference in value.<br><br>Therefore on the Christian view, A and B can be different from each other (and A can even have gifts that B lacks or have more gifts than B) and yet be each assigned the same value by God.<br><br>The point to be grasped here is that what differentiates A and B most fundamentally is not the possession by either of any given set of gifts (since on the view we are considering the set of gifts in question could just as easily have been assigned to someone else without impairing the indivduality of each) but rather their respective individualities; and that this would mean in turn that A and B can both be equally loved by God and be validly deemed to be each as ultimately important as the other.<br><br>You don't define the value of a human being in an ultimate sense in terms of whatever 'gifts' he may possess (though obviously the 'gifts' that he possesses would be relevant to defining his ultilitarian value in relation to some particular function or other); that is why human equality (as defined by Christianity) is no way undermined by the consideration that human beings are different or are even differently gifted.<br><br>The example of North Korea is misleading; for in the first place human beings are not equally adept at performing a particular function (which may be essential to the overall functioning or flourishing of a state) and given that some functions are more important than others for the flourishing or functioning of a state, it may be a mistake to put in place a system that makes it impossible for those with the gifts requisite to the efficient execution of the more important functions (relative to the end of the perpetuation of a state), to achieve a greater temporal reward than those who lack these gifts.<br><br>Thus a state which does not put in place such a system, need not be held to have discountenanced Christian equality in the sense that I have defined it above; conversely, any state that does put in place such a system need not be held to countenance Christian equality (as North Korea, in fact, does not).<br><br>The equality obtaining between men, as conceived by Christianity, exists on a higher (so to speak) plane; to see what it means, look at the Crucifix.<br><br>In the Crucifix (and in the Passion which it represents), you see how unfathomably important each human being is; and you see also the ultimate ground of our fundamental equality with each other.<br><br>His Sacred Blood makes for your value as much as it makes for mine; and it also makes for the fact that we are all ultimately each equal to each other.<br><br>This is the heart of Christianity; that, at least, is what the Catholic Faith teaches.<br><br>Ben (fully 'Christian' and fully 'Catholic')<br><br></div>
