              <p>define friend. If we are talking about best and true friend, we should not let them feel obligated to sign something, that is business, lack of trust, it either you lend or you dun lend, as simple as that, if a friend wish to borrow my car and i am worry about her skill of driving, i will just tell her, my family need to use it.</p>

              <p>However, when you come to stranger, in term of money transaction and exchange of goods, it is business, and in singapore, you need to be register as a business entity. If nothing happen, that is good, but if something happen, God bless you, that is singapore style.</p>

              <p>Hmm.. Good comparison.. Then why can't we do the same for VCD and DVD rentals? Or there is no licensing that needs to be applied for when having these rental shops?</p>

              <p>Hardware indeed but they do have some software in form of embedded systems in their consoles.. So they can make a scene about rental shops violating their intellectual property rights... But yeah, car rental shops, do they pay licensing fees to the car makers? lolz.. Cant be right?</p>

              <p>which part of the EULA did it forbid renting of laptop?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it only state installation of it on ONE machine.... not restriciting it to only one user.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so if u rent out the Window XP for installation on multiple machine on a time share base, it might b illegal, but not the renting of laptop.</p>

              <p>To TS, renting of game are rather common else where.... so why should renting of machine b illegal?</p>
