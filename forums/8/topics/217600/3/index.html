            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;"><br>This seems to be the entry-level salary range of non-managerial staff (basic) .. they're based on feedback from friends, family and my own experience so it may not be entirely accurate :<br><br>O levels : $800-$1.3k<br>A levels/Dip : $1.2k-1.8k<br>Degree : $1.5k-2.6k<br><br>- Call centre jobs tend to pay more (basic).  Jobs that require overnight shift / 3rd language abilities tend to pay 20% more (basic).<br><br>- Average salary range is subjective to industry / company<br><br>- Job advancement/pay increment is HIGHLY dependent on your paper qualifications, even if you've exhibited a personal capacity / performance that is on par with, or even surpasses, degree holders.  So much for meritocracy!!<br><br>- Managers (not incl supervisors) tend to earn 2-10 times more than their underlings depending on their position.  There appears to be quite an imbalance of salary here.. Our salaries today aren't much better from 10 years ago.  Therefore it would be stretching the truth to say that Singaporeans today are wealthier.<br><br>So yeah, like some forumers have said, the "average salary" says almost nothing.  If we could get a real breakdown of the figures on the respective positions / industries, we'd get a much clearer picture.. because "Average" is very subjective...   </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>an average salary of supposingly $5k may not be truly reflective. let's say just one person himself draws a higher salary of multi-fold difference from the rest, he is able to bring up the average by a huge (deceiving) margin just by himself, whereas the majority is in reality drawing at a much lower rate.<br><br>when i studied econs, i learnt abt this progressive income tax (earn more tax more) which is designed to narrow the income gap. without it, you can imagine how much it could be worse.</div>

Incurred big debts to bank. I think its all look good on the surface, but you scatched the surface, everything falls apart.<br><br>It is just a matter of living within your means and spending prudently. A 7 seater MPV is cheaper and better than a mercedes or BMW. Living in a Condo is better than living in a semi-detached.<br><br>Unless you really can well afford it then go for the very best, like you are earning million in a month.</div>

Really stunning reality indeed. At one point of time, I was one of the only few whose address begins with 'Blk blah blah blah'. LOL<br><br>My total household income is about 2k. I live in a middle class surburban neighbourhood and my father does not own a car, but for decades we managed to be self-sufficient through tight budgets and savings. Yet I do not feel any stigma whatsoever, in fact I feel privileged to be studying among the best and elites. I have got acquainted with filthy rich kids (parents are owners/directors of firms, MPs, ministers, lawyers, doctors, professionals) who are also really wonderful people at heart. My circle of friends range from all socio-economic backgrounds (those who live in spartan two room flat conditions to those whose parents have properties overseas) I think I am fortunate to such an experience haha<br><br></div>
