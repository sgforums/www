Its more a case of we can't tax you too much because you already do not have much, than anything else. Hence, in singapore, we have quite a generous tax-free bracket. After all, the highest tax is really not that high.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my salary's is only $1700+. Worked for about 4+ yrs. I take comfort in being happy where I'm working... but want to survive on this amount I don't know...<br>I'm still staying with my parents who are providing for everything at home. It's a comfortable salary for me. For now.<br><br>But I agree. I think the extreme salaries of people like ministers, lawyers, doctors do skew the average.<br><br>then again, there's the lower waged workers who can skew it too - but I seriously think that the high figures the people "up there" earn far far far far cover up for the lower wages.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I tink a good way to save is to 'save' before you see the 'physical' amount.
