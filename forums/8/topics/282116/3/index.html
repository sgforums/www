Marriage is a 2 party effort not one sided affair.<br><br>Is the same rule as friendship, will you be friends with someone who keep asking for favours but refuse to help out when you are in need?<br><br>Answer to TS question is very simple. How long can a one sided pampering last? 1 year to 9 years?<br><br>Lets do a case study to help people understand.<br><br>Guy A marries Gal B, he pampers and takes care of his wife very well. Gal B naturally wants more by the days go by.<br>Examples "HDB too small, I want bigger one "<br>"Gal B friend's big new car, Gal B wants a bigger one"<br>so on...<br><br>If Guy A is rich is ok for him to keep up with Gal B demands but what if Guy A is just a normal average singaporean living in a realistic world?<br><br>In order to pamper his wife even more, guy A have to work longer hours and spent less time with Gal B. Gal B conplains and ask why, but forgotten the hardship guy A had to put in to meet his wife growing demands.<br><br>Gal B thought since guy A can make it so she ask for more.<br>See the cycle?<br><br>What did poor guy A get in return ? nothing but more demands and wants coming in.<br><br>"don't most guys promise to be nice, to accomodate the girl all his life? i mean, as a gentleman, shouldn't the nice gestures continue even into the later years?"<br><br>I do not believe such crap as I have seen so many guys get into debts becos they want to pamper their wifes well. Gals always used this type of excuses to get what they want and give nothing in return.<br><br>I want to challenge the title<br>" for married guys, how long did u pamper your wife? "<br><br>With this words.<br><br>" for married woman, have your demands and wants ever grow smaller and understanding for the man whom work so hard to provide for you grow bigger?"<br></div></blockquote>in your case, u biasely think that guys give all and receive nothing in return.<br><br>i once read a story. yes, as a gentleman, a guy is required to take initiative. i don't believe that in all cases, the guy simply gives and gives and gets nothing in return. quoting an article "to guys- get her flowers occasionally, remember her birthdays and surprise her on special occasions, and always remember the two magic words- "thank you" and "i'm sorry". doing little things like these wil reap you great returns. if you treat your wife well, she in turn, will bear you adorable children, manage the household and make sure u come home to the warmth of a family. maybe when u are working through the night, she waits up in the living room for u and gives u an endearing hug when u return. she heats up a bowl of soup she prepared specially for u. when u are tired, she will give u a massage. when u are down and out and your friends have walked out on u, she will stay by you. when u are poor, she shares her savings with u. when u are rich, she is proud to be the woman behind a successful man. to most women, a successful marriage is the most fulfilling life. a women can give her all for her marriage. whereas for guys, he might place career first, then maybe his children, or friends, or even football and fast cars, and babes." of course there are many cases where the women expects too much. its just a matter of perception.</div>

Most guys keep it in their stride, because they love their gf/wife. but as for the other way round, shouldn't the gf/wife be a little more understanding the financial and mental strain when guys fails to do so rather than displaying temper or mood swings?<br><br>Agreed that she will not leave you when your friends do, she will share her savings when you'r poor. But this is quite impractical when both happens in the same couple.<br><br>this is the 21st century, not all women do housework, wait for husband come home, take care kids. Most women are working, and i prefer it that way, because it keeps them away from thinking too much.<br><br></div>
