            <div class='col-md body'>Soon, my relationship with this guy is going 2 yrs... he is my first stead and i m his 6th. b4 we are together, he was considered a playboy somehow. all my friends did not support me to be with him, there goes the same for his friends, everybody think that we will not last long, cos we are completely frm 2 different world. well, true enough, we broke off after 4mths. i admit at that time, it was partly my fault. it was my first time into a relationship and if we are to compare, of cos, he is more' experience' than me in loving a person. becos i spent my time preparing for my Os and spent most of the time with my friends than with him, he felt that he is being neglated. he began to lost love in me, and found someone he likes while we are on cold war. he nv told me at all, n it was my friend who told mi...i cannot accept it, and ask for a break. but i found myself ended up in tear everyday, missing him. i didnt want to give up. in the end we patch back after a month and became closer. before we patch back, we tok things out and during that one month, i learn alot. learn frm a friend to understand ppl and not to be selfish. realise that a relationship involve compromising and of cos communication. thus, when we patch back, it was a happy moment for mi. i tot, finally i know love and also he think that i m the one for him. but things didnt work out well after 8-10 months of together. perhaps becos we see each other too often, can say is everyday, then we have nothing to tok to and started getting sianz of one another. n at this time, the girl that he like that time, sms n told him that she like him. haa haa.... wat do u expect mi to do? my 10 months of happiness seems to shattered to the ground. frm then on, i m a changed person, not the same anymore. i get jealous easily and lose trust n confidence in my relationship. however, he ensure mi that he will nv fall for the girl again, cos is not his type, then wo cai settle down. but who know, another girl appears again. this girl is suppose to be woo by my guy friends n they happen to go out together as a group n the girl perfers my bf more.~!~! wat a *^%*... she know he is attached but still gou yin ta. n my bf... he is tempted, he likes her...n chat with her.... n i was all along kept in the dark until one day i happen to see his chat log. i can nv forget how it feels to know the one u love calling someone else dear, again, i initiated a break.though i still likes him cos i can nv allowed myself to be cheated. but then, the very next morning, he come to my house n handed mi a hand made card and ask for a apology. he said ' xian zai bu shi ni bu ke yi mei you wo, shi wo bu ke yi mei you ni' becos of this, we are back again. but i have lose confident in him n trust and of cos the security. my possession is stronger so much stronger that i get jealous even when girls juz call him. becos of this, i think he feel stress. but ever since the girl thingy, we will peacefully together for another 6 months lor~! to me, we are juz like a married couple, i enjoy myself when i m with him, we are close to each other, however, few months ago, another, okie, again appears and the scence seems to repeat itself again. this time... i didnt bothered to find out is it he like the girl or the girl like him...i dun care anymore, i didnt wish to knoe, all he said was 'we cant xiang chu'....!!!!! we nv quarrel, to mi we are so close, yet he say we cant xiang chu... i hate him...for doing this to me again n again...i find myslelf so foolish...i love him so much...more than he love mi, but he betray my trust again n again... this time, we really break off. the chances of patching is slim. i cried whenever i think of him cos i juz love him so much that i cant seems to live without him. we have gone through so much n everywhere i go, watever i do, seems to remind mi to him. but i still control. he know very well that i cant forget him, but he nv ask mi back. after abt 2 weeks, which i considered long...he told mi ' he found his love' the girl is mi. i am in a dilemma...i hate to go through all this again, but i really love him alot. i make it clear that i didnt wan to be a replacement, since u find us cant xiang chu, y chhose mi back again... he make a statement ' that is not true, not wat he meant' he really loves me. we juz celebrated one month after getting back... i know he really loves mi this time, cos his actions and the way he treat mi is so much better than last time that i feel so loved now. but but but... i am worried, i scare, i fear of another girl appear or rather this last girl appear... today i did something stupid... i told him my insecurity in the relationship... i said i cant help but feel it this way... i know is wrong... cos if a guy heard this, most prob the relationship will ends... wat should i do to really believe that he changed and this time he is true?

Secondly, its ok though you post it here - just paragraph your post next time, kinda hard to read the whole chunk.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Dear MeAnInGLeSs,<br><br>Believe it or not, there are several people out there leading the same kind of relationship as you. If you read through every single topic in Aunt Agony - you would have noticed that a couple of them exist in Sgforum itself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>He is your first love: obviously the cosmic lesson to learn is alot and since it lasted for 2 years - unless in rare and extreme case - this would probably be a karmic relationship. Why karmic? Because its virtually impossible (though not entirely) to find the correct soul partner in your first relationship - most likely to be the 2nd to 4th (some takes more).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Your relationship is intense and conflicting and I always believe in this: break for the first time without a period of absence in between (anywhere 2 years and above) and patched - breaking will likely to occur again.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Why? This is a vicious psychological cycle of accumulative problems. Couples have this tendancy to initiate break and return back together after a period of cool down - this is the WORST way in handling a relationship. Initiating break and patching back doesn't solve the original problem itself - it carrys on until the next time you break and patch again - it adds on. This relationship lack depth - no proper effective communication, trust, honesty, love intergity, etc.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> When the accumulated problems adds up into an unbearable state - all hell break loose; exhaust all mental &amp; emotional strength, lots of resentment and negative thoughts flows in.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Analogy</span></strong> (Adapted from CloUdiSm Remix III)<br><br>If leading a relationship is like walking up a flight of infinite stairs; breaking and patching in a relationship is like walking up hundreds of steps before running back down to square one (original starting location) - keep doing it over and over again: everyone get tired and have no energy to walk anymore (relationship dies)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The another issue is your bf - liking a girl soon after another: he has poor definition of love and what he wants - which indirectly, causes the downfall of this relationship. He is a flirt - no doubt, but still he wants this relationship. He avoids issues and is unstable - his attention drops to other girls because of his ever-changing mood towards his own relationship. He cannot grasp fully onto what is good to keep it going - you mentioned that at first kanna neglect break, later spend too much time break - what the hell? There must be a balance, a compromise, an effort spend and worked. He did anything positive? No - he looked for that kind of emptiness in other girl. He couldn't find - he returns.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>This is a sickening cycle - my advice is that don't return back to him, yet. Firstly, think about WHAT do you really want. If love and the feeling dependancy is all you seek - look no where else and continue with your life, because eventually you will find it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Treating one another better ISN'T love me more - this is a kind of mis-conception and preception break &amp; patch couple always encounter.<br><br>This kind of treating good is the Bu chang (compensate) for the breaking and patching ordeal that took place prior. STILL, it doesn't solve previous problem because both of you chose to leave it behind the storeroom - ITS STILL THERE, nobody attempts to do something about it, or not even trying hard enough.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>So how now brown cow?<br><br>You both need a period of time to cool down - my suggested time is actually 3 months and above. During this time, reflect and ponder personally when do you really want, look for and seek in this relationship. He flirts still right - when can he learn to be faithful and loyal to his partner? He lies - when can he learn to put trust and honesty in this relationship? Break you for lame reasons - When can he truely be MATURED and stop this vicious cycle and attempt to love like what this relationship could blossom into its full potential? The list goes on.<br><br>P.S: Are you a scorpio?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If it were me, i'd endure the pain and leave him, start anew.<br>Chinese saying, Short pain better than long pain... esp if the pain keeps repeating itself...<br><br>Eventually its up to you lor, no one can force you. By coming here and seeking advice, you've already made a decision have you not? You just want someone to point you in that direction...<br><br>I know many would say the same, but believe me, you're still young. Move on... Both you and your bf need to grow up and experience more in life. Both of you will change as your surroundings change. You'll change schools, start work, have different frenz, different social circles... Who knows wat tomolo holds? Would he be the one to leave you or you the one to leave him?<br><br>However, i give you this advice: If you decide to break, make it a CLEAN break. No more solo dates, hanky panky nor patching up. Else it defeats the purpose of the break no? Guys have the tendacy to miss the intimate moments you have together and as such may want a temp patch juz so he can savour it again. DON'T give it to him... You'll end up hurting both of you.<br><br>Thus said, Your future/happiness is in Your hands...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm.. okie, like to tell you something you probably won't agree with..<br><br>i feel that your "i love him too much to leave him" isn't true.. this is your first relationship.. how you noe whether this is true love or not? how you noe the feelings for him not infatuation, obsession or like? how much you cry doesn't justify how much you love <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  so you must get things clear.. to me, you're rather foolish, a little sweet talk and you're back with him, he's probably treating you like a spare tyre, can play play with other girls but yet come back to you in case anythin happens.. c'mon girl, time to wake up and look at the situation from another angle <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>he's your first, so tendency for you to think that he's THE ONE is high.. cos you're still inexperienced. ask your friends, talk to your friends, if better tok to his friends, cos talkin to him is mostly useless.. i relationship cannot continue, if there's no trust, and i don't think you can really trust him again, you prob. spends endless sleepless nights thinkin and brooding.. ask yourself this: "what for?"<br><br>he said you're the one he loves.. so he's kinda like trying every taste of assorted chocolates in a box and then out of them choose one he likes <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>girl, me cannot really tell you wat to do, cos ultimately decision is yours, but you really have to think clearly.. his words cannot be trusted, his feelings are also uncertain.. he made you so sad already, why do u wanna let him continue?</div>

Secondly, you are very processive.<br><br>Maybe u should ask youself why he has so many gf ? Wat can this show? (Not trying to say he is a flirt.... ) It shows he can't manage a relation well.
