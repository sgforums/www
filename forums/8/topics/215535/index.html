They claim i have many girlfriends...And yet i have not even dated once b4...I dont know what is a relationship like...I've never been into one...neither have i been flirting around...I dont know the rules and regulations of courtship...</div></blockquote>some ppl like to claim that you're the best la, you're the pro la but in actual truth, they are more pro than you are. They just cover it up to boost the other person's ego. You better not bother about that kind of judgement 'cause you're the only one who knows yrself well.<br><br>and the girl, if u know she's using u, then don't bother also. it's a crush only, you'll get over her soon.<br></div>
