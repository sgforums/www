            <div class='col-md body'><strong>NEW education options could well put more stress on Singapore's children, as they struggle to qualify for the new integrated programmes that let them bypass the O levels.<br></strong><strong><br>Parents may see qualifying for such programmes as 'a demonstration of their children's supreme intelligence'</strong>, said Mr Chan Soo Sen, Minister of State for Education and Community Development and Sports.<br><br>The children would have to make the grade in Secondary 1 or 3.<br><br>'So instead of it being a happy scenario of more variety in the education system, we are creating an unhappy environment of competition where <strong>the through-train and speciality schools are seen to be ranked tops and Express and Normal streams are now seen to be the lower heap</strong>,' he said yesterday at the Forum on the Best Interests of Children.<br><br>It was attended by 250 child experts, who agreed that <strong>the anxieties of Singapore children were not being heard, though their physical needs were well met. </strong><br><br>What really struck a chord yesterday was Mr Chan's description of three children here: A mentally-fatigued boy in Primary 3 at a top school who attends nine different enrichment classes, a Secondary 1 girl who regretted opting for the Normal stream to concentrate on sports because she was seen as a failure, and a 15-year-old girl who wrote in a poem, 'I'm afraid of what I'm expected to do'.<br><br>The forum was organised by the Ministry of Community Development and Sports (MCDS) and non-profit organisation Save the Children Singapore.<br><br>Guest speaker Stephen Woodhouse, who has worked with children for more than 30 years, said that to deal with the problem, adults had to recognise that children who did not do well academically could do well in other areas. 'Perhaps this can be in the form of case studies, or role models, of people who did not do well in school but are doing well in their lives.'<br><br><strong>Adults, he said, must listen to children, 'not just the bright and articulate children but also those who don't have a great deal of self-confidence or who do not do well in school'.<br></strong><br>They could start by reading My Voice, a book of essays by 77 youths. Ten thousand copies will be published next month by Young Entrepreneur Mastery, a non-profit group that conducts training schemes.<br><br>MCDS director of social welfare Ang Bee Lian said the ministry would think of ways to get the message across that children should be heard. This may not be through structured programmes as 'the adult tendency to organise could cramp the young person's voice'.<br><br>Instead, it could be as simple as 'a parent listening to his child as he is taking the child to school'.<br><br>-ST<br><br>[/quote]<br><br>its sad...<br><br>although we keep saying that children nowadays are so much luckier than we were, they are also very much more stressed and stretched.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br></div>
