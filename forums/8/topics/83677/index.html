Anyway, believe me, if you don't know ask.<br><br>Don't expect people to help. They've been through so much trouble, they shouldn't be bothering to keep an eye on you. You know, some ingrates will insult you after helping them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

I read. Most people help willingly when asked, and most tired or frustrated people don't help at all. And most people who offer help are showoffs.<br><br>You try reading those 'diaries'. You'll realise human don't usually offer to help because it'll take too long for them to decide that the person really need help.<br><br>Most people who offer help instantly are show-offs. Willing helpers are those who take time to observe... it's a natural call.</div>
