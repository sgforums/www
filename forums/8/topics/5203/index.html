            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>1) Effective communication<br>This is the most important. In order to stay together, a couple must be able to communicate with each other freely and easily. There is no barrier and either party must always be ready to lend a listening ear or to dish out some advices when needed. Many a time, though the guy can do nothing to help the situation the girl is in, it's always great to have a listening ear from the girl's point of view. Most(NOT all) are usually impatient and may not be there for their gf. Either that, or they will just dismiss their gf's worries lightly when the girls need a listening ear. To the guys, they may deem the matter to be trivial but by telling the guys' these matter, the girls actually want to seek advices or need a listening ear. It does not help that you guys dismiss them off, because, you may never hear your gf speak as freely to you anymore.<br>There will be a barrier because you have dismissed what she said to be "TRIVIAL" and she will be careful not to talk to you abt certain matter. Is that what you guys want? If not, it's time to start listening to your girls instead of you guys blabbering on and on all the while or dismissing them away!<br><br>2) Breathing space<br>The fact that she has chosen you as her bf means that her heart is already with you. Yes, spend time together but never be too possessive. Give her some breathing space. You don't want her to suffocate in your embrace, do you? Please don't get mad when she has to go for movies with her friends this weekend and so she cannot go out with you. And please don't be pissed off because she wants to accompany her mum to go shopping and has no time for you tomorrow. She has a life of her own.<br>Yes, she tries her best to include you into her life but it's always best to give each other some personal space. You can go out with you friends and family while she goes out with hers. However, that does not mean that you can neglect her! It's better to strike a balance.<br><br>3)Trust<br>YOu must always have faith in her. Just because you have seen or met other girls who are big-time bitches doesn't mean that she is one. She needs you to trust her and NOT to suspect her for anythign she does. She needs your reassurance and trust as much as you need hers. Don't cast doubts on her love for you. Yes, you may be insecure, but it's really tiring for her to assure you at all times. TRUST her. She is YOUR girl man! If you are going to be so dubious of her, how can the relationship carry on? Think about it.<br><br>------------------<br>=================================<br>Do Pixies like a rainy day?<br>A-piping through the dell?<br>The Pixies must enjoy the rain;<br>Thats when they weave their spell.<br>Rain drops, rain drops<br>Play a Pixie-tune<br>=================================</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I recalled when i wanted a guy, I wanted him to be humourous,cute,lively,outgoing,playful,talkative,caring,funny,taller than me(specificially above 1.64m), with wonderful grin and bold.He needs not to be so muscular but I would not prefer skinny ones.<br><br>Then I finally met this guy.Wah! I could not believe this guy met all my requirements!<br><br>However, I discovered some other flaws in him and myself too.Perhaps we are not meant for each other. Then I made some changes in my list of requirements. I want him to give me security and commitment. He is too outgoing and too charming that I felt quite insecure in his company.(At that time he was courting me but he was not yet my bf)</div>
