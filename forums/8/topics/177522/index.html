No brainers about this one.<br><br>No, dividends need not be an annual affair, some give out twice a year.

It is probably the single most consistent red flag to excessive optimism and over-investment. It also serves, regularly, as a marker of business problems and opportunities. By relating price and earnings per share for a company, one can analyze the market's valuation of a company's shares relative to the wealth the company is actually creating. A PE ratio is calculated as:<br><br><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/math/2/9/4/294f0bb6bd137f703b522cf89bebc2c6.png"><br><br>The price per share (numerator) is the market price of a single share of the stock. The Earnings per share (denominator) is the Net income of the company for the most recent 12 month period, divided by number of shares outstanding.<br>The PE of a stock describes the price of a share relative to the earnings of the underlying asset. The lower the PE, the less you have to pay for the stock, relative to what you can expect to earn from it. The higher the PE the more over-valued the stock is.<br><br>For example, if stock A is trading at $24 and the Earnings per share for the most recent 12 month period is $3, then the PE ratio is 24/3=8. Stock A said to have a PE of 8 (or a multiple of 8 ). Put another way, you are paying $8 for every one dollar of earnings.<br><br>The main reason to calculate PEs is for investors to compare the value of stocks, one stock with another. If one stock has a PE twice that of another stock, it is probably a less attractive investment. But comparisons between industries, between countries, and between time periods are dangerous. To have faith in a comparison of PE ratios, you should be comparing comparable stocks.<br><br>Normally, stocks with high earning growth are traded at higher PE values. Say, Stock A may earn $6 per share the next year. Then the future PE ratio is $24/6 = 4. i.e. you are paying $4 for every one dollar of earnings which is more attractive.<br><br><strong>EARNINGS PER SHARE</strong><br>Earnings per share (EPS) are the earnings returned on the initial investment amount.<br><br>The FASB requires companies' income statements to report EPS for each of the major categories of the income statement: continuing operations, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, and net income.<br><br>The EPS formula does not include preferred dividends for categories outside of continuing operations and net income as shown here. This formula also shows the most basic formula for earnings per share.<br><br><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/math/4/d/1/4d1d3e32bd5f2d99ae724dd0153d2f58.png"><br><br>The EPS formula is shown here for Net Income and Continuing Operations (substitute income from continuing operations for net income).<br><br><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/math/6/1/8/618513a49ab5b7d1e675f1ec705aecad.png"><br><br>Earnings per share for continuing operations and net income are more complicated in that any preferred dividends are removed from net income before calculating EPS. Remember that preferred stock rights have precedence over common stock. If preferred dividends total $100,000 <span style="font-style: italic;">(this part i dunno, suddenly got number come out one)</span>, then that is money not available to distribute to each share of common stock.<br><br>The value used for company earnings can either be the last twelve months' Net income (referred to as trailing-twelve-months, or ttm), or analysts' predictions for the next twelve months' net income (referred to as forward).<br>The number of shares used for the calculation can either be basic (only shares that are currently outstanding) or diluted (includes all shares that could potentially enter the market).<br><br>Companies often use a weighted average of shares outstanding over the reporting term. EPS can be calculated for the previous year ("trailing EPS" ), for the current year ("current EPS" ), or for the coming year ("forward EPS" ). Note that last year's EPS would be actual, while current year and forward year EPS would be estimates.</div>
