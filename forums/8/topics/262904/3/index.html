I respect Singapore and the way it is govern, its pragmatic which means we don't have to like it but it guarantee our sustainability.<br><br>Sillypore? I don't think its a good word and it would caused you to be viewed as uncouth. Be fair, Singapore do have their good as well as bad.<br><br>You said we get rubbish? Yeah, a good garbage management would be the word. Silly things? Explain yourself.<br><br>Bash up their own bus driver? I believed its just only few people, why not talk about hong kong bus driver celebrity? C'mon have a wider view of things, spectacle shops are everwhere.<br><br>Being small have its own advantage, thats how Singapore is able to harness it in order to have what it have today. Larger countries have problems of their own too, just that these needed to be discovered by experiencing it.<br><br>Ask those who are proud of Singapore, they can give you endless reasons why, ask those who dislike Singapore, they can give you reasons too.<br><br>Comparing LDCs and DCs, you have to count yourself lucky to be living in Singapore, so why complain? Go to Cambodia or any other LDCs, there are many people who are fiercely proud of their country despite what has happened, not that they are ignorant but rather they believed in them. A good example would be Thailand, many people still call themselves Thai despite of what have happened.<br><br>Put it simple, if you don't like Singapore, don't criticize it, understand it throughly before you make any unecessary comments, it do make you look stupid. If you insist, well, leave it.<br><br>Just my 2 cents.</div>
