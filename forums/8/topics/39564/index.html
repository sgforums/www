It has allowed the Freemason to be a registered Society in Singapore. If they are sinister in their works and principles, they would have been banned from Singapore, but they have existed here for more then 90 years (?).<br><br>For your information, try this site:<br>http://www.freemasons.co.nz/about_us/about_us.htm<br>- About Freemasons<br><br>If you think that the objective of USA in invading Iraq is part of their grand strategy to achieve the ultimate goal of a Â“New World OrderÂ”, then you might as well look beyond their scheme of things on this globe, and also include their space investment as an attempt to dominate the entire Universe.<br><br>This line of thinking is similar to the paranoid thinking common among the Muslim man-on-the-street in Arab World (and also generally in the entire Muslim World).<br><br>Surprisingly, the Governments and Peoples of Afghanistan and Kuwait have not protested the USA actions in Iraq. The Afghanis memories of US help in liberating them from the terrors of the Talebans are still fresh in their mind. Sadly, some younger Kuwaitis are swayed by the Arabic fervor to participate in protesting against the US actions in Iraq as they have forgotten what USA had done for them, since their liberation had occurred 12 years ago.<br><br>Judging by your efforts in posting so many different news angles from so many different sources Â– from news agencies of the West, East and West Europe, Middle East, Russia, and Asia; you have not committed any of your own views openly in any way.<br><br>Instead, you had made oblique hints of your position, which I was only able to discern only after careful re-visits of your past posts, after you declare your position openly in your posting below.<br><br>I am still uncertain how you come to this conclusion that Bush Senior and Bush Junior, (and all the other Republican and Democrat Presidents), all have conspired to a common goal to change the politics, economics and social structure of all the communities in this Globe to conform to a US thinking of a NEW WORLD ORDER.<br><br>Have you forgotten that each President can only serve TWO terms in Office, serving the second term only if successfully elected back to Office, and with each term only lasting five years?<br><br>Even if there is a grand scheme of things, I will be surprised that 110 independent countries on this globe will behave like Â“mindless sheepÂ”, all following one single shepherd.</strong> </blockquote></div>
