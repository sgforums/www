            <div class='col-md body'>even a shock site like rotten has an article... irreverent but brutally true.. and closer to anything that people have written about this whole sad situation:<br><br>============================<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="large">Blood Diamonds</span></span></strong><br><br>The term "Blood Diamonds" is a politically-charged tool meant to cause revulsion and thoughtfulness in anyone who happens to own them. This would be a tactic similar to calling Fur Coats "Slaughter Jackets". However, the term sounds really cool so let's go with it.<br><br>Diamonds are very valuable. Artificially so, as anyone who has studied the history of the DeBeers company can tell you, but still incredibly valuable. If you have them, you can make a lot of money selling them, and that's money that can go to plenty of good uses, like luxury homes, kick-ass meals by the finest chefs, and paying for your army to recklessly slaughter thousands of your people.<br><br>It's the last use that's a bit of a sticky wicket, as you might imagine. And in countries like Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, where fighting is basically all they do and they've gotten really good at it to the detriment of stability, peace and good will, the ability to bring in money from any source (since their economies are a shambles) is seized upon at any cost. And so there you have it; armies forcing people at below slave wages to extract diamonds from the earth, and these diamonds then being sold through a bunch of different shady middlemen to end up on Madame Gordogato's beautiful bracelet. Like pretty much everything else that depends on some pain down the line (like, say, Chicken Nuggets or Petroleum), the end customer is unaware what happened three months and five countries ago.<br><br>Obviously, it is in the best interest of DeBeers and other diamond merchants to keep this unpleasant aspect of things away from the dinner table, and so begins an endless soap opera of accusations, defenses, stonewalling, exposes and all the other fun that happens in a situation like this. Meanwhile, those diamonds are getting sold, people are getting fucked over, and people continue to think putting a nice big rock on a ring means you'll love them forever.<br><br>Recently, groups that suck at marketing changed the term to "Conflict Diamonds", which is probably more accurate but about a fifth as evocative. Some people don't know to leave well enough alone.<br><br>(from, of all places, <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/crime/blood-diamonds/" rel="nofollow">rotten.com</a>)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Ayla,<br><br>It's Not tt Lee Hwa &amp; Soo Kee sell a better grade of diamond.  Most of these shops will haf a range of SI qlty (which is kinda like the norm) to VVS1 qlty (2nd to flawless).  U hafta differentiate between VVS1 &amp; VVS2 diamonds.  IIRC, VVS1 diamonds have slight inclusions @ the base of the diamond, invis to the naked eye.  VVS2 diamonds haf slight inclusions @ the surface of the diamond, invis to the naked eye.<br><br>They're oso graded based on the colour.  Usu, in small pieces like tiny ear studs, the yellow tinge of a non-superior diamond wun be obvious.  However, for bigger pieces (dangly earrings studded wif diamonds, for e.g.), it's q. obvious if the diamonds give off a yellow tinge.<br><br>The yellow tinge of the diamond is oso Not tt discernable in Yellow Gold, but is more obvious when u buy White Gold or Plat.<br><br>On the whole, I dun restrict myself to the shops u mentioned below.  There're a whole lotta others, like those "gim dian" wif chinese chinese type of 22K or 24K YG tt sell q. nice WG &amp; diamond pieces, albeit in limited qtys : )<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ayla:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi, just want to check with all of you who are interested or had some knowledge in diamonds.<br><br>Which boutique would you go when you want to buy diamonds?<br><br>1) Sookee<br>2) Lee Hwa<br>3) Goldheart<br>4) SK<br>5) Taka<br>6) Chip Lee<br><br>Is it true that Lee Hwa and Sookee sells a better grade of diamond? </div></blockquote></div>

Lee Hwa has its 57 cut Destinee Perfect diamond(u get to see 8 arrows and hearts using a scope) but Soo Kee's Brilliant rose(u get to see a rose thru the scope) has 66 cuts which is more shiny and precious( hence more expensive).<br><br>In terms of prestige, nothing beats a Tiffany diamond, the older generation tends to prefer Larry's jewellary.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just some info if u feel like buying diamonds,<br><br>if getting a small diamond (below 25 pointer/0.25 carats), clarity (minimum vvs2) is more important than colour.<br><br>If getting a bigger diamond, try to get one of at least F colour( D being the highest grade) as if u get a diamond closer to the Z spectrum, u will see a yellowish tint reflected from the diamond. Some grannies prefer this as they go better with gold. Younger generations like their diamonds with white gold or platinium.<br><br>A perfect piece will be a D colour with Clarity of IF(internally flawless) at least a 57 perfect cut diamond. But its going to be very expensive.<br><br>So many ppl will just buy a bigger diamond from a cheaper brand as not many people can tell an expensive one from an inferior one.  Alternatively get a man-made diamond that is only abt 1/10 of the price.</div>

Some shops offer full value trade-ins allowing you to upgrade your diamond at a later time, but basically once you've spent the cash, you can wave it goodbye unless you can sell it to individuals who are willing to pay.</div>

Should i still try out at Lee Hwa or take up the SK offer? In case i want to trade-in in future, will the value of the diamond drop because it's from SK?</div></blockquote>Here's a quick and dirty guide:<br><br>The four *main* characteristics of diamonds<br>1. Cut - Supposedly the most important factor, determines if the diamond will be able to reflect light properly when it comes from the top or if it'll just pass through the bottom. The two popular ones are the round/solitaire and rectangular/princess cut.<br><br>2. Clarity - How many impurities (both visible and non visible ones) are in the diamond. Ranges (from best to worst) are FI(Flawless), IF, VVS1/VVS2(Very very slight), VS1/VS2(Very slight), SI1/SI2(Slightly), I1/I2/I3(Visible).<br><br>Basically anything above SI are difficult to spot even under a microscope<br><br>3. Colour - Ranges from<br>D-F(Colourless)<br>G-H(Near Colourless, visible when compared to better coloured ones)<br>I-J(Near Colourless, visible via the naked eye)<br>Above K - Visibly yellow<br><br>4. Carat - Weight of the diamond, - the factor that has the greatest impact on price, usually exponentially  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>There're actually more factors but its better if you look it up yourself.
