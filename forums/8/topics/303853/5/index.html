In fairness, creationism and evolution should be given equal time.<br><br>The link:<br><a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/10/1018_041018_science_religion.html" rel="nofollow">Evolution and Religion Can Coexist, Scientists Say</a> </div></blockquote>The article basically says that religion and science can co-exist as long as religion accepts scientific evidence. Astrophysics can enlarge your view of God. That's basically saying that let astrophysics shape your view of god, not the other way round.<br><br>The article also says that pretty much everyone accepts that evolution occurs. But some choose to believe that god designed evolution to work the way it does. However, they accept the evidence for evolution.<br><br>Creationism is not given equal time in science education simply because it's not science!<br><br>Evolution is a scientific theory.<br><br>Creationism does not make any testable predictions and is not falsifiable.<br><br>Should we teach in church how science contradicts the bible? Or present the arguments for the non-existence of God in church?<br><br>But let's for the sake of argument, say that Creationism should be given equal time. Which version of creation? Should we teach about Apsu and Tiamat? Or perhaps Ame-no-Minaka-Nushi-no-Mikoto, Takami-Musubi-no-Mikoto, and Kammi-Musubi-no-Mikoto? Or perhaps we should teach about Ymir? Who get's equal time?<br><br>Even if we just stick to modern western Creationism, there's Young Earth Creationism and Old Earth Creationism.<br><br>And even within Old Earth Creationism there's around 5:<br><br>1. Theistic Evolution - this is the position officially endorsed by the Catholic Church (though recently the Pope and some other high Chuch officials made statements contradicting that position). Theistic evolution accepts modern science and scientific evidence except that they say "goddidit". This position is compatible with science except, as mentioned before, the claim that "goddidit" is not a scientific one.<br><br>2. Evolutionary Creationism - Very similar to theistic evolution. The difference is that they believe that at some point during our evolution, god mankind a spiritual awakening. The first creature to receive this spiritual awakening would be Adam.<br><br>3. Progressive Creationism - (This is where we start to diverge from scientific evidence.) This is the view supported by the website Answers in Creation. They believe that god intervened to create different "kinds" of animals over millions of years. So dinosaurs did live millions of years in the past, but god performed a special creation for humans and certain modern animals. So there's no biological link between man and earlier life forms.<br><br>4. Day Age Creationism - This is the Jehovah's Witness' view. There were 6 actual days of creation. However, they did not occur together. So day one was the creation of the universe. Day 2 was billions of years after that, so on so forth.<br><br>5. Gap Creationism - God created the heaven's and the Earth of the first day, billions of years ago. Then there was a long gap where pretty much nothing happened. Then billions of years later, god created even everything else.<br><br>Young Earth Creationism<br><br>1. Omphalism - This view accepts all scientific evidence, except that they believe all the scientific evidence is false. The universe looks like it's billions of years old, but it isn't really. God just made it look that way. Geologic evidence is also designed by god to make us thing the world is billions of years old.<br><br>2. Modern Young Earth Creationism - This group basically holds the bible as the literal truth and make up their own science to support their beliefs. This view is completely iincompatible with science.</div>

How do you expect people to accept cars when car designers are so wishy washy that they keep changing engine designs.<br><br>How can we make transistors out of silicon now? Those wishy-washy scientists should have stuck to vacuum tubes.<br>B<br>Science changes because science follows the evidence. Theories adapt and change with new evidence. Science isn't dogmatic. That's the power of science. Science recognizes reality for what it is.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Creationist scientists learned and practiced science in exactly the same way that evolutionist scientists do. Agree?</strong></blockquote><br><br>Depends on what you mean by creation scientists. Which version? If it's theistic evolutionists or omphalists, yes they practice science the same way.<br><br>But Young Earth Creationists? A very few of them have real science degrees. Very few. But they don't practice science the same way. They have let dogma overrule science.<br><br>Furthermore, you will find that very few have biology related degrees. Most are physicists, engineers, mathematicians and doctors. You can almost count on one hand the number of biologists, astronomers, and geologists.<br><br>It's very simple. Go look at the publication record of Michael Behe and Guillermo Gonzalez. Check their recent publication records in reputable peer-reviewed science journals. Look at "Dr" Kent Hovind - his "PhD" comes from an unaccredited diploma mill.<br><br><blockquote><strong>When I think about this, some thoughts come to my mind.

Would you trust an evolutionary biologist to calculate the fuel burn rate of a spacecraft and how much angular momentum it would gain?<br><br>Would an astronomer know about the vast amounts of evidence, from different areas of biology that support evolutionary theory? Would a mathematician understand the numerous fields of biology, eg. the study of ERVs, that would not exist if not for evolutionary theory?<br><br>Creationism is not a science! It makes no testable predictions. Creationism says "God made us the way we are". Why do we have an appendix? God put it there. Why do whales have vestigial limbs? Well, God put it there. Why do we men have nipples? Well, coz god decided men should be able to have their nipples sucked as well. Er... okay. Put another way, creationism has not a single piece of evidence, not a single consistent theory that supports creation by a supernatural being. They only have what they believe is evidence that contradicts evolution.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Some day, when scientific observation or experiments turn up more solid evidence and the theory evolution falls apart, creation theory still stands.<br></strong></blockquote>Creation theory does not stand. In fact, there's no creation theory. There's only opposition to evolutionary theory.<br><br>Once again, which creation theory? And at this point, if you think there's no solid evidence for evolution, nothing will convince you. What evidence is there that could convince you? Any evidence that could be presented to you, you would just say, "it's not enough."<br><br>During the Dover trial, Michael Behe was shown over 50 peer-reviewed articles that detailed the evolution of the bacterial flagellum. He said it was not enough evidence.<br><br>Behe, under cross examination, also conceded that "there are no peer reviewed articles by anyone advocating for intelligent design supported by pertinent experiments or calculations which provide detailed rigorous accounts of how intelligent design of any biological system occurred"<br><br>More quotes form the Dover trial:<br><br>"ID proponents primarily argue for design through negative arguments against evolution, as illustrated by Professor BeheÂ’s argument that Â“irreducibly complexÂ” systems cannot be produced through Darwinian, or any natural, mechanisms. However, Â… arguments against evolution are not arguments for design. Expert testimony revealed that just because scientists cannot explain today how biological systems evolved does not mean that they cannot, and will not, be able to explain them tomorrow. As Dr. Padian aptly noted, Â“absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.Â”Â… Irreducible complexity is a negative argument against evolution, not proof of design, a point conceded by defense expert Professor Minnich."<br><br>Behe's 3 favorite examples of irreducible complexity.<br><br>"Professor Behe has applied the concept of irreducible complexity to only a few select systems: (1) the bacterial flagellum; (2) the blood-clotting cascade; and (3) the immune system. Contrary to Professor BeheÂ’s assertions with respect to these few biochemical systems among the myriad existing in nature, however, Dr. Miller presented evidence, based upon peer-reviewed studies, that they are not in fact irreducibly complex."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>If scientists find a skull and with the help of an artistÂ’s impression say Â“this is your ancestorÂ”, youÂ’ll buy the story? How naÃ¯ve can one get? </blockquote>Talking about naive, I find tat it is more funny people believe in a book just because they say it is true.<br><br>About your point on "artist impression", frankly speaking I don't know wat is the things u r trying to say. If u look at the skulls of the fossils found on early men, u cannot tell tat there is a difference ? U can't tell tat their jawbones r more protruding while the part holding the brain r getting smaller as we go back in time. I thought even kids can tell the difference<br><br><blockquote>DonÂ’t make a monkey or rather an ape out of man. The missing link is still missing. Keep on digging and exploring the space. The money is going to stop coming if they donÂ’t come up with solid evidence. </blockquote>The missing link is found. They found many fossils from the past till now. Did u even see the video phaze had posted before  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> The evolutionist can found u 100 billion fossils showing gradual progression and u still will not be satisfied<br><br><blockquote>Meanwhile living fossils are discovered and that must have Â‘intriguedÂ’ the scientists but so far thereÂ’s no media coverage of the study of the Laotian rodents or the Chinese Hynobiidaes. Both species are discovered in 2006. If the results of the study donÂ’t fit into the theory, you can expect that you wonÂ’t hear anymore about these new discoveries. </blockquote>Wat do u mean by no media coverage  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Actually, wat is the big hoo haa about tis 2 species ? They never prove evolution to be wrong but it fact proves tat the evolutionist come out wth very accurate assessment from fossils.<br><br><blockquote>Scientists now suggest that modern people are descended from chimp-human hybrids. So, that makes man a bastard.</blockquote>Did u even read your article yourself  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Inside there is no line saying tat evolution is wrong. There is also no line saying tat we r descended from chimp-human hybrid. They say our ancestors, which is 1.2 million years ago, which is still not fully human, have descendents with chimpanzees but they died out and extinct in time. If u had seen the video from phaze on evolution before, it already told tat species which r very close to each other can interbreed, and tat is predicted in evolution theory. In fact the article emphasis evolution and use it to explain the phenomenon.</div>

However this chaos began to coalesce into a cosmic egg for eighteen thousand years. Within it, the perfectly opposed principles of yin and yang became balanced and Pangu emerged (or woke up) from the egg. Pangu is usually depicted as a primitive, hairy giant with horns on his head (like the Greek Pan) and clad in furs. Pangu set about the task of creating the world: he separated Yin from Yang with a swing of his giant axe, creating the Earth (murky Yin) and the Sky (clear Yang). To keep them separated, Pangu stood between them and pushed up the Sky. This task took eighteen thousand years, with each day the sky grew ten feet higher, the Earth ten feet wider, and Pangu ten feet taller. In some versions of the story, Pangu is aided in this task by the four most prominent beasts, namely the Turtle, the Qilin, the Phoenix, and the Dragon.<br>After the eighteen thousand years had elapsed, Pangu was laid to rest. His breath became the wind; his voice the thunder; left eye the sun and right eye the moon; his body became the mountains and extremes of the world; his blood formed rivers; his muscles the fertile lands; his facial hair the stars and milky way; his fur the bushes and forests; his bones the valuable minerals; his bone marrows sacred diamonds; his sweat fell as rain; and the fleas on his fur carried by the wind became human beings all over the world. The distance from Earth and Sky at the end of the 18,000 years would have been 65,700,000 feet, or over 12,443 miles<br><br>Tao tao dao veri confusing  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
