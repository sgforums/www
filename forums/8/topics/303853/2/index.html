            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SBS3625D:</div><div class="quote_body">Evolution itself is not proven, its a theory.</div></blockquote>You misunderstand what is a scientific theory.<br><br>The late Stephen J. Gould explains:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Evolution is a theory. It is also a fact. And facts and theories are different things, not rungs in a hierarchy of increasing certainty. Facts are the worldÂ’s data. Theories are structures of ideas that explain and interpret facts. Facts do not go away when scientists debate rival theories to explain them. EinsteinÂ’s theory of gravitation replaced NewtonÂ’s, but apples did not suspend themselves in mid-air, pending the outcome. And humans evolved from ape-like ancestors whether they did so by DarwinÂ’s proposed mechanism or by some other yet to be discovered.</span><br><br>Douglas J. Futuyma is the author of the introductory textbook on evolution,  Evolutionary Biology and has this to say:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A few words need to be said about the "theory of evolution," which most people take to mean the proposition that organisms have evolved from common ancestors. In everyday speech, "theory" often means a hypothesis or even a mere speculation. But in science, "theory" means "a statement of what are held to be the general laws, principles, or causes of something known or observed." as the Oxford English Dictionary defines it. The theory of evolution is a body of interconnected statements about natural selection and the other processes that are thought to cause evolution, just as the atomic theory of chemistry and the Newtonian theory of mechanics are bodies of statements that describe causes of chemical and physical phenomena. In contrast, the statement that organisms have descended with modifications from common ancestors--the historical reality of evolution--is not a theory. It is a fact, as fully as the fact of the earth's revolution about the sun. Like the heliocentric solar system, evolution began as a hypothesis, and achieved "facthood" as the evidence in its favor became so strong that no knowledgeable and unbiased person could deny its reality. No biologist today would think of submitting a paper entitled "New evidence for evolution;" it simply has not been an issue for a century.</span><br><br></div>

But what they do is make a distinction between "microevolution" and "macroevolution"<br><br>Creationists have defined something called a "kind'. A "kind" is something like a species.

It help them spread their seeds to other areas and increase their survivability and tat is why it is tasty and easy for animals to eat.

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not here to prove that God is the creator but is evolution scientific? It's a theory or philosophy at best.<br><br>Let the experts decide.<br><br>From Stephen Hawking<br>"The universe and the Laws of Physics seem to have been specifically designed for us. If any one of about 40 physical qualities had more than slightly different values, life as we know it could not exist: Either atoms would not be stable, or they wouldn't combine into molecules, or the stars wouldn't form heavier elements, or the universe would collapse before life could develop, and so on..."<br><br>From Albert Einstein<br>"Everyone who is seriously interested in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that a spirit is manifest in the laws of the universe a spirit vastly superior to man, and one in the face of which our modest powers must feel humble."<br><br>From Werner von Braun, father of space science<br>"The vast mysteries of the universe should only confirm our belief in the certainty of its Creator. I find it as difficult to understand a scientist who does not acknowledge the presence of a superior rationality behind the existence of the universe as it is to comprehend a theologian who would deny the advances of science."<br><br>Charles Darwin wrote the following in "Origin of Species"<br>'To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree.'<br><br>Dr. Randy L. Wysong, instructor of human anatomy and physiology, "The Creation-Evolution Controversy"<br>"Evolution can be thought of as sort of a magical religion. Magic is simply an effect without a cause, or at least a competent cause. 'Chance,' 'time,' and 'nature,' are the small gods enshrined at evolutionary temples. Yet these gods cannot explain the origin of life. These gods are impotent. Thus, evolution is left without competent cause and is, therefore, only a magical explanation for the existence of life..."<br><br>From Physicist Paul Davies, "God and the New Physics"<br>"It is hard to resist the impression that the present structure of the universe, apparently so sensitive to minor alterations in numbers, has been rather carefully thought out...The seemingly miraculous concurrence of these numerical values must remain the most compelling evidence for cosmic design."<br><br>From Dean H. Kenyon, professor of biology at San Francisco State University<br>"It is my conviction that if any professional biologist will take adequate time to examine carefully the assumptions upon which the macro-evolution doctrine rests, and the observational and laboratory evidence that bears on the problem of origins, he/she will conclude that there are substantial reasons for doubting the truth of this doctrine. Moreover, I believe that a scientifically sound creationist view of origins is not only possible, but it is to be preferred over the evolutionary one."<br><br>From Nobel laureate Arno Penzias, "Cosmos, Bios, and Theos"<br>"Astronomy leads us to a unique event, a universe which was created out of nothing, one with the very delicate balance needed to provide exactly the conditions required to permit life, and one which has an underlying (one might say "supernatural") plan."<br><br>From Nancy Pearcey, "Creation Mythology"<br>"Darwinism has become our culture's official creation myth, protected by a priesthood as dogmatic as any religious curia."<br><br>From Astronomer George Greenstein, "The Symbiotic Universe"<br>"As we survey all the evidence, the thought insistently arises that some supernatural agency--or, rather, Agency--must be involved. Is it possible that suddenly, without intending to, we have stumbled upon scientific proof of the existence of a Supreme Being? Was it God who stepped in and so providentially crafted the cosmos for our benefit?"<br><br>From Dr. David Berlinski Ph.D. in mathematics, Princeton University<br>"Darwin's theory of evolution is the last of the great nineteenth-century mystery religions. And as we speak it is now following Freudians and Marxism into the Nether regions, and I'm quite sure that Freud, Marx and Darwin are commiserating one with the other in the dark dungeon where discarded gods gather."<br><br>From Dr. W.R. Thompson, world renowned Entomologist<br>"The success of Darwinism was accomplished by a decline in scientific integrity."<br><br>From Dr. Wolfgang Smith, physicist and mathematician<br>"A growing number of respectable scientists are defecting from the evolutionist camp.....moreover, for the most part these "experts" have abandoned Darwinism, not on the basis of religious faith or biblical persuasions, but on strictly scientific grounds, and in some instances, regretfully."<br><br>From Dr. Derek V. Ager, Department of Geology, Imperial College, London<br>"It must be significant that nearly all the evolutionary stories I learned as a student....have now been debunked."<br><br>From Dr. Colin Patterson, evolutionist and senior Paleontologist at the British Museum of Natural History<br>"The explanation value of the evolutionary hypothesis of common origin is nil! Evolution not only conveys no knowledge, it seems to convey anti-knowledge. How could I work on evolution ten years and learn nothing from it? Most of you in this room will have to admit that in the last ten years we have seen the basis of evolution go from fact to faith! It does seem that the level of knowledge about evolution is remarkably shallow. We know it ought not be taught in high school, and that's all we know about it."<br><br>From Dr. Alfred Rehwinkel<br>"Meanwhile, their [evolutionists] unproven theories will continue to be accepted by the learned and the illiterate alike as absolute truth, and will be defended with a frantic intolerance that has a parallel only in the bigotry of the darkest Middle Ages. If one does not accept evolution as an infallible dogma, implicitly and without question, one is regarded as an unenlightened ignoramus or is merely ignored as an obscurantist or a naive, uncritical fundamentalist."<br><br>From Dr. Robert A. Milikan, physicist and Nobel Prize winner, speech before the American Chemical Society<br>"The pathetic thing about it is that many scientists are trying to prove the doctrine of evolution, which no science can do."<br><br>continue next post....<br><br></div>

The theory is also protected by its cultural importance. It is the officially sanctioned creation story to modern society, and publicly funded educational authorities spare no effort to persuade people to believe it."<br><br>From Hubert P. Yockey Ph. D., Physics, University of California, Berkeley.<br>"One must conclude that, contrary to the established and current wisdom, a scenario describing the genesis of life on earth by chance and natural causes which can be accepted on the basis of fact and not faith has not been written."<br><br>From Dr. William Bateson, great geneticist of Cambridge<br>"When students of other sciences ask us what is now currently believed about the origin of species, we have no clear answer to give. Faith has given way to agnosticism. Meanwhile, though our faith in evolution stands unshaken we have no acceptable account of the origin of species."<br><br>From George Sim Johnson "Did Darwin Get it Right?" The Wall Street Journal, October 15, 1999<br>"Human DNA contains more organized information than the Encyclopedia Britannica. If the full text of the encyclopedia were to arrive in computer code from outer space, most people would regard this as proof of the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence. But when seen in nature, it is explained as the workings of random forces."<br><br>From Dr. Michael Denton, molecular biochemist<br>"In terms of their basic biochemical design....no living system can be thought of as being primitive or ancestral with respect to any other system, nor is there the slightest empirical hint of an evolutionary sequence among all the incredibly diverse cells on earth."<br><br>From Dr. Nils Heribert-Nilsson, Swedish botanist and geneticist, English Summary of Synthetische Artbildung<br>"A close inspection discovers an empirical impossibility to be inherent in the idea of evolution." "My attempts to demonstrate evolution by an experiment carried on for more than 40 years have completely failed.....It is not even possible to make a caricature of an evolution out of paleobiological facts...The idea of an evolution rests on pure belief."<br><br>From Dr. George Wald, evolutionist, Professor Emeritus of Biology at the University at Harvard, Nobel Prize winner in Biology.<br>"There are only two possibilities as to how life arose; one is spontaneous generation arising to evolution, the other is a supernatural creative act of God, there is no third possibility. Spontaneous generation that life arose from non-living matter was scientifically disproved 120 years ago by Louis Pasteur and others. That leaves us with only one possible conclusion, that life arose as a creative act of God. I will not accept that philosophically because I do not want to believe in God, therefore I choose to believe in that which I know is scientifically impossible, spontaneous generation arising to evolution." "Most modern biologists, having reviewed with satisfaction the downfall of the spontaneous generation hypothesis, yet unwilling to accept the alternative belief in special creation, are left with nothing."<br><br>Sir Fred Hoyle, British physicist and astronomer<br>"The likelihood of the formation of life from inanimate matter is one to a number with 40,000 nought's after it...It is big enough to bury Darwin and the whole theory of Evolution. There was no primeval soup, neither on this planet nor on any other, and if the beginnings of life were not random, they must therefore have been the product of purposeful intelligence." "The chance that higher life forms might have emerged through evolutionary processes is comparable with the chance that a tornado sweeping through a junk yard might assemble a Boeing 747 from the material therein."<br><br>From Professor Harold Morowitz<br>"The probability for the chance of formation of the smallest, simplest form of living organism known is 1 to 10-340,000,000. This number is 1 to 10 to the 340 millionth power! The size of this figure is truly staggering, since there is only supposed to be approximately 10-80 (10 to the 80th power) electrons in the whole universe!"<br><br>From Dr. Emile Borel, who discovered the laws of probability<br>"The occurrence of any event where the chances are beyond one in ten followed by 50 zeros is an event which we can state with certainty will never happen, no matter how much time is allotted and no matter how many conceivable opportunities could exist for the event to take place."<br><br></div>
