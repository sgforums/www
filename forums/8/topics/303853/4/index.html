            <div class='col-md body'>The notion that science and religion are irreconcilable centers in large part on the issue of evolution. Charles Darwin, in his 1859 book The Origin of Species, explained that the myriad species inhabiting Earth were a result of repeated evolutionary branching from common ancestors.<br><br>Many scientists supposedly believe that all life is accidental, a random crash of molecules that magically produced flowers, horses and humans - a scenario as unlikely as a tornado in a junkyard assembling a 747.<br><br>Because Darwin's Theory is a theory, it continues to be tested as new evidence is discovered. The theory is not a fact. With respect to any theory, students are encouraged to keep an open mind.<br><br>Even IF the theory of evolution eventually succeeds in proving the Â‘howÂ’ of evolution, itÂ’s only a half page proof. ThereÂ’s still the question of Â‘whyÂ’.<br><br>Some of history's greatest scientific minds, including Albert Einstein, were convinced there is intelligent life behind the universe. Too bad that as human beings, their lives on earth is short.<br><br>"Science without religion is lame; religion without science is blind." Â—Albert Einstein<br></div>

Is it suddenly there is a species tat become more and more human like then suddenly extinct then another species pop out tat look more like human then suddenly extinct again, and it happen a few hundreds to thousands of times ? There r many (few hundreds to thousands) fossils showing men to have evolved from ape like creatures.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by googoomuck:</div><div class="quote_body">Many scientists supposedly believe that all life is accidental, a random crash of molecules that magically produced flowers, horses and humans - a scenario as unlikely as a tornado in a junkyard assembling a 747.</div></blockquote>Strawman. The problem here is that your creationist mind holds on to the image of God taking atoms and molecules and fashioning it into flowers, horses, and humans. Because of that image of "creation", you also think that evolution works the same way except that it's random. You think that evolution pulled atoms and molecules out of the air to create flowers, horses and humans.<br><br>You need to let go of that image. Evolution is not random; it's quite the opposite in fact. And as another poster said before, evolution does not make any statement about how life began - that's abiogenesis. Abiogenesis is the study of how life began. One theory is that a random crash of molecules resulted in the first organic molecules that were able to pass on their characteristics.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Because Darwin's Theory is a theory, it continues to be tested as new evidence is discovered. The theory is not a fact. With respect to any theory, students are encouraged to keep an open mind.</strong></blockquote>Once again, this is a misunderstanding of what a scientific theory is as opposed to the popular usage of the word "theory". In popular usage, "theory" means "a guess" or "an opinion".<br><br>A scientific theory however is a "mathematical or logical explanation, or a testable model of the manner of interaction of a set of natural phenomena, capable of predicting future occurrences or observations of the same kind, and capable of being tested through experiment or otherwise falsified through empirical observation."<br><br>You are correct to say that with any theory, one should keep an open mind.  But your mind should still be open based on the evidence. Your mind should not be open to the point where your brains fall out.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Even IF the theory of evolution eventually succeeds in proving the Â‘howÂ’ of evolution, itÂ’s only a half page proof. ThereÂ’s still the question of Â‘whyÂ’.</strong></blockquote>Why does there have to be a why? Besides, science makes no comment about the "why" of evolution. As for the "how", the mechanism of evolution has already been well established. There is controversy over abiogenesis and we can only assign probabilities to how life began as we can't exactly go back and see the exact moment that life began.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Some of history's greatest scientific minds, including Albert Einstein, were convinced there is intelligent life behind the universe. Too bad that as human beings, their lives on earth is short.</strong></blockquote>For many scientists, their idea of god is different from the lay person. For other scientists, they believe in god but they compartmentalize it from their science.<br><br>It doesn't really matter what scientists believe as long as they don't allow it to interfere with their science. Having said that, Albert Einstein did not believe in an intelligent creator.<br><br><blockquote><strong>"Science without religion is lame; religion without science is blind." Â—Albert Einstein</strong></blockquote>This argument can go on forever. So I will say that even if Einstein did believe a an intelligent creator, it is nothing like the christian god. Furthermore, people are the product of their times. In the past, almost everyone was a religious person. As we learn more and increase in knowledge, we find more evidence that the god hypothesis is not only unnecessary, it is most certainly wrong.<br>[/b]</div>
