            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>IÂ’ve already quoted what the evolutionist said. They hatched another idea by rearranging the angle of the jaws and bone fragments, gave it another facelift and revised the age of the fossil.<br><br>And no one find their work funny at all? What kind of science is this? Suggestions only. ItÂ’s all guesswork!<br><br>Can an evolutionist prove his theory like a true scientist proves his theory by experiments with conclusive results beyond a reasonable doubt? </blockquote>To be frank, science is indeed initially using some guess work (hypothesis) BASED on evidence because no one knows. However when someone publish his work, it will be subject to a review by peers and they will comment and reject, or offer another model or some even continue on the works so tat it become more robust and more aligned to the truth. U can see tis kind of progression in the above example of the skull found. Someone make a <strong>hypothesis</strong> tat the skull found look human, he publish his finding, then it undergo scrutiny from peers before people come out with more refined explanation or findings from it. The conclusion is it is more ape-like than initially expected and it is not human<br><br>However for evolution, it is not based on tis one skull (which in the end did not contradict evolution) but many many many evidences found which subject itself to reviews by peers and reach some form of unmistakable conclusion (theory).<br><br>U did not go and prove creationism with any evidence or dispute all the evidences found from evolution, u just find some examples which <span style="font-style: italic;">u think </span>show evolution to be wrong and use tat to say tat "hey, i found one error in the evolution so the rest of the evolution r all wrong". <strong>It is like finding a gramatical error in a dictionary and saying english language is a hoax  </strong><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Lastly, u never find a single evidence tat prove evolution to be wrong  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><blockquote>So troublesome was the skull that famed paleo-anthropologist Richard Leakey, the leader of the team that discovered it, <span style="font-style: italic;">once told </span>reporters: "Either we toss out this skull or we toss out our theories of early man. It simply fits no models of human beginnings." </blockquote>There is a 3rd route, study the skull again and realise there is some error made in the modelling. If u want to play with "once told" statements, then the church <span style="font-style: italic;">once told</span> people infidels should be killed and <span style="font-style: italic;">once told </span>people can owned slaves and <span style="font-style: italic;">once told </span>women r lower than men. Wait a minute.. they still say the last point now...<br><br><blockquote>Scientists should continue to unlock the secrets of creation for the benefit of humanity</blockquote>U told people space science is mind boggling and human is too stupid. So wat r u trying to say from there ?<br><br><blockquote>I donÂ’t want to think of the logic of evolution theory as an art of being wrong with confidence.<br><br>So, IÂ’m for giving creationism and evolution equal time to reach a conclusion. </blockquote>U r not confident simply because it contradicts the bible  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> And wat is your argument for creationism ?

            <div class='col-md body'>We once used to think that dinosaurs were giant lizards.<br><br>Now, as we learn more, we realize that dinosaurs are more closely related to birds than to dinosaurs.<br><br>With that new insight, we now look at how we assembled dinosaur bones before. We assembled those bones based on different theories and assumptions. So now, we try to see if we can assemble the bones in a manner consistent with the new theory.<br><br>if we can't, it's a strike against the new theory. If we can, it doesn't mean the new theory is 100% true. But it just means that the bones don't rule out the possibility of the new theory being true. So the bones become inconclusive as evidence because it supports both theories.<br><br>If you have overwhelming support for a theory - tons of evidence from different fields, all pointing to the same conclusion, and you find one piece of evidence that contradicts it, is it more likely your entire theory is wrong? Or that you might be misinterpreting the evidence. So you try to find out if there's a way to interpret the evidence to fit the theory. If you find it's impossible, then it's a threat.<br><br>And the power of peer-review means that you have to explain what assumptions you made, and why it's reasonable to make those assumptions. Peer-review means that if you try to bullshit, your equally competent peers will catch you on it.<br><br>So let's say you find fragments of a skull and you are trying to reassemble it. Every skull fragment fits perfectly with other skull fragments. Not only that, the sheer lines also match perfectly. The bone structure at the end of each fragment also matches ajoining fragments. Clearly, there's only one way to assemble the skull. If you assemble it any other way, people will ask you why.<br><br>However, let's say you find fragments of skull. The fragments have been fossilized and worn away. Nothing really matches except you can tell by the general shape that it's probably from the same skull. So you try to assemble the skull based on your theories of what you are supposed to find. Then, another theory is raised. So then you try to see if you can reassemble it in a way that fits the other theory. The controversy then is which is the right way to assemble the skull, not whether the overall theory is wrong.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I also don't understand the question "Can an evolutionist prove his theory like a true scientist proves his theory by experiments with conclusive results beyond a reasonable doubt?"<br><br>What is a true scientist? How do you define a "true scientist"?<br><br>Conclusive results beyond a reasonable doubt? Let's see... there's:<br><br>Evidence from paleontology - this is evidence from the fossil record. However, the problem with the fossil record is that the conditions for fossilization to occur are relatively rare. It's actually a minor "miracle" that we find any fossils at all. Unless of course you believe God put them there to fool us.<br><br>Evidence from comparative anatomy. There are examples of homologous structures and adaptive evolutionlike in the Pentadactyl limb or insect mouthparts. There are analogous structures and convergent evolution. There are also vestigial structures like whale leg bones.<br><br>Evidence from geographical distribution. Again, this is how we see evidence from many fields of science converge. For example, we know that once a group of creatures is isolated from another group, it will start to go down a separate evolutionary path. We can look at the continental distribution of animals and find evidence for migration and isolation. We know that continental drift occurs and we can separately date when land masses separated and combined. Oceanic island distribution also supports evolutionary theory. Unless of course, you believe that "For God so loved Australia, that he gave them cute kangaroos and koala bears."<br><br>Evidence from comparative physiology and biochemistry. Universal biochemical organisation and molecular variance patterns again support evolutionary theory. For example, the out-of-africa theory makes certain predictions that match what has been discovered by studies. There evidence from antibiotic and pesticide resistance and evidence from studies of complex iteration. There's evidence from speciation like the study on the Hawthorn fly. There's so much evidence that it's tiring to actually list all of it. And we're only scratching the surface!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pretty much all of modern biology rests on evolutionary theory.<br><br>Doctors are an interesting thing. General practitioners, for example, are not scientists. It's possible to learn how to recognize symptoms and treatments without a deep understanding of the biology behind it. And some doctors even advocate quack treatments.<br><br>Doctors are like car mechanics. Car mechanics know how to fix cars, but they may not understand the physics of how the car engine works.<br><br>The theory of evolution pervades medicine. It explains for example, why we have the appendix (no it's not that God put it there for fun) or our tonsils. It explains why different groups of people have different genetic dispositions to various diseases.<br><br>Probably the most visible example of evolution in action in modern medicine is antibiotic resistance in bacteria. And if you think about it, it makes complete sense. Antibiotics kill bacteria. Mutation means some bacteria may develop antibiotic resistance. Those bacterial cells survive and multiply. After a long period of time, you are left only with antibiotic resistant bacteria.</div>

If u read the guide, u will find tat it literally twist the whole passage into something tat is totally different from literal interpretation of the bible. I think the reading guide becomes the real bible.<br><br>I think a problem with christians, especially ones belonging to the newer churches, r becoming more fanatic and going more into the old testaments. I find a large group of people speaking in tongues a complete surprise. They r all talking gibberish, (they all cannot understand others words, everyone have a different way of saying the same thing, they even say the same thing wrongly at different times, if u record a number of their own tongue speaking and play it back to them, they also don't know wat they r trying to say, it is really talking nonsense) and they really believed it to be true and it is god's gift.

But anyway, I think I've made my position clear.<br><br>Creationism is not a science. Scientists refer to Creation Science as Creationism because Creation "Science" is not a science.<br><br>People are free to teach Creationism where is it appropriate. However, it is most certainly not a science and should not be taught in science class.<br><br>The theory of evolution, however, is a science, and is appropriately taught in science class.<br><br>Not that I want to rehash old arguments, but the point you made about Creation "Scientists" having an added advantage of two sources is wrong. That's the problem. If Creation Scientists were doing real science, they would be welcome into the scientific community. However, what they do is not science and does not contribute to our body of scientific knowledge.<br><br>And if you want examples, it's very simple. Look at Michael Behe. He has a reasonable publication record before he started to get hung up on his bacterial flagellum theory. The problem is once you posit a magical creator, that's where science ends. How did the bacterial flagellum motor come about? God did it. End of story. So all he does now is deny the research and advances that show his theory to be false.<br><br>Look at Guillermo Gonzalez. He had a reasonable publication record until he got hung up on his idea of the Galactic Habitable Zone. Since God, by definition, can violate any law of nature, his theory has no predictive power.</div>
