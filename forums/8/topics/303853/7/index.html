And evolution, according to many scientific organisation, is science. And so far, there r no problem with evolution and it is pretty effective in explaining a lot of phenomenon. Why do evolution need more time when there is nothing wrong with it now  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Why don't we bring back all science theories and start digging tubers since according to u, they may also be inconclusive as well .<br><br><blockquote>Dinosaurs bones, Cro-Magnon man skeletons and human skull attach to monkey jaws are the work of the Devil to deceive those who are weak in faith. </blockquote>Ya right... everything u see and observe r the work of the devil. Maybe the bible is the work of the devil. It is to deceive people into not using their eyes and brains but blindly obey the wrong thing.

              <p>We need to be very clear on this point.<br><br>1) evolution is not a theory of life's origin. Evolution is a theory about how life developed.<br><br>But scientific theories of abiogenesis are still consistent with evolution. Even if extraterrestrials seeded life on earth, that still does not invalidate evolution. Extraterrestrials at most seeded organic chemicals, or perhaps the first prokaryotes or eukaryotes on the planet.<br><br>There is genuine controversy over different theories of abiogenesis. And all scientists in this field recognize that we simply do not know the answer to this. That's why the theories are basically listing out all the scientific possibilities. We need to know all the things that could have happened so we can test those theories.<br><br>But "god did it" is not a scientific theory.<br><br>Falsifiable hypothesis that the bible makes are wrong. For example, there's no evidence for a global, worldwide flood. There's no evidence that humans suddenly appeared 600 years ago. There's no evidence that there are waters of the sky held up by a firmament.</p>
