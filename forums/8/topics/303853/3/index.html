But certainly, some of those quotes exhibit the characteristics of typical creationists/religious dishonesty.<br><br>Creationists love to use quote mining because absent evidence, they need to use the argument from authority.<br><br>This is a more complete text of Darwin's quote:<br><br>"To suppose that the eye, with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree.

To know why a religious person rejects evolutionary theory, one must really examine every component of his beliefs.<br><br>Young Earth Creationists hold that the bible is perfect and holds the literal truth. They reject evolution for many many reasons - including that it takes too long (they believe the universe is 6000 years old). that there was a world wide flood, and they believe that the world was created in 7 literal days. Kent Hovind is an example of someone who holds this view.<br><br>That's probably the most extreme view. Then you have a whole spectrum of beliefs that follow.<br><br>Old Earth Creations except the evidence that the universe and the earth are billions of years old and they interpret one "day" as being a very long time. However, some of them believe that God really created and placed each plant and animal in the Garden of Eden, before creation man. And that evolution only occured after the Fall.<br><br>Some Creationists believe that God provided the spark that formed the universe. Just as a skillful pool player knows how to hit the cue ball so that the he pockets the correct balls, God could foresee how things would develop. These Creationists believe that the Fall of Man is just a metaphor or a myth.<br><br>Other creationists believe in God, but have completely no problem with science at all. They argue that because God gave us free will, he purposely limited himself. So even though God is still all-powerful, he has chosen to to limit himself until the end of time. So God just created the universe, in a way consistent with what we have discovered with science, and is watching how things play out. They strongly believe that through scientific inquiry, you can "know the mind of God." They believe it is possible because God created man in his own image with the power of reason that they might know God.<br><br>And as I said earlier, there are a million other variations on the theme.<br><br>So why is there a controversy? It's simple. People want evidence to support dogma.<br><br>Theories of abiogenesis and evolution change all the time. That's a good thing. That's science. As we learn more, we refine our theories and improve them. When we learn something is wrong, we change the theory and in the process, create a better one.<br><br>We still teach the theory of luminiferous ether in school, even though it's wrong. It's an excellent illustration of how science works. The ether was proposed as a possible explanation for the dualistic nature of light. The ether hypothesis allowed scientists to make testable hypothesis. Eventually, experiments became refined enough for scientists to determine that the ether was not a useful hypothesis. The ether could not be detected. Other explanations, better descriptions were devised. Science moved on.</div>

A theory is a logically self-consistent model or framework for describing the behavior of a related set of natural or social phenomena. It originates from or is supported by experimental evidence (see scientific method). In this sense, a theory is a systematic and formalized expression of all previous observations, and is predictive, logical, and testable. In principle, scientific theories are always tentative, and subject to corrections or inclusion in a yet wider theory. Commonly, a large number of more specific hypotheses may be logically bound together by just one or two theories. As a general rule for use of the term, theories tend to deal with much broader sets of universals than do hypotheses, which ordinarily deal with much more specific sets of phenomena or specific applications of a theory.<br><br>It is commonly misunderstood that there are known truths that are superior to theories. If this is actually the case, then the seemingly "known truth" is actually a theory itself. One theory may be superior to another in terms of its approximation of truth, but both statements are theories. Scientific tests of the quality of a theory include its conformity to known facts and its ability to generate hypotheses with outcomes that would predict further testable facts.<br><br>A misunderstanding of the word "fact" contributes to confusion in regard to the meaning of "theory." An appreciation of the actual meaning of "fact" and "knowledge" can help to clarify an understanding of the meaning of "theory."<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_as_theory_and_fact" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_as_theory_and_fact</a><br><br>Evolution is often said to be both theory and fact. This statement, or something similar, is frequently seen in biological literature. The point of this statement is to differentiate the concept of the "fact of evolution", <strong>namely the observed changes in populations of organisms over time</strong>, with the "theory of evolution", namely the current scientific explanation of how those changes came about<br><br>Fruit flies changing generation to generation is an observation of generational organism change.<br><br>Organisms changing generation to generation is called evolution<br><br>Evolution is a fact.</div>
