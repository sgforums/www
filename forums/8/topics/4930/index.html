            <div class='col-md body'><br>Thursday May 25, 2000, 12:26 AM London Time<br>Real Madrid 3-0 Valencia: Macca's the Real master<br>By Jeff Powell at Stade de France<br>Steve McManaman scored the goal of a lifetime here last night to stamp the hallmark of football's mother country on the golden European legend of Real Madrid.<br><br>The England prodigal returned to reinforce the nation's hopes and dreams for Euro 2000 next month, unleashing a shot which will reverberate across the length and breadth of this Continent.<br><br>The right-footed volley which scorched across this great stage gave the oft-times unlikely lad from Liverpool a place in history along with Real's immortal eighth winning of the supreme club championship into which they breathed life at its birth nearly half-a-century ago.<br><br>McManaman scored the second and unquestionably pivotal goal in what became a processional return to glory for Madrid. It was a strike which will illuminate this Englishman's entire career.<br><br>It also offered a timely reminder of the merit of England's challenge on a night when football, finally, was the winner - but almost exclusively Spanish football.<br><br>While Real and Valencia, with their preponderance of home-grown players, took over the City of Light to express their brilliance, the most vital interest for the rest of the European game was focused upon the odd imported star or two in each of these gifted teams.<br><br>As far as the English are concerned, there have been times when McManaman has seemed as odd as any footballer on the planet. But here, on the biggest stage Europe has to offer by way of a club rehearsal for next month's European Championship Finals, the former Liverpool enigma continued his encouraging development into an international to be reckoned with.<br><br>McManaman has been an infuriating under-achiever with England in the past but there can be no doubt now that England coach Kevin Keegan is right to recall him for the expedition to Belgium and Holland.<br><br>Real Madrid have been the making of McManaman, most encouragingly of all in the huge matches against Manchester United, Bayern Munich and now Valencia which have comprised a renaissance of the European legend of the club.<br><br>It was McManaman who encouraged Madrid out of their hesitancy of the first few moments with two surging forays to set their attack in motion. It was also his distracting run in the 17th minute which dislocated Valencia's defence and enabled Brazilian Roberto Carlos to supply the delicate cross from which Nicolas Anelka headed firmly towards the top corner, only for Santiago Canizares to claw the ball away.<br><br>There were exciting Spanish players to be seen all over the pitch and the rest of the Continent's footballing powers will take Spain lightly at their peril next month.<br><br>As for the bigger picture, the appearance of two teams from the same country, neither of whom currently holds their domestic league title, made a mockery as well as a misnomer of UEFA's Champions League Final.<br><br>What we really had here in the Stade de France was a Spanish fiesta masquerading as a carnival of the international game.<br><br>That both Real Madrid and Valencia played some wondrous football at breathtaking pace and with a refreshing willingness to risk all in attack, nobody will seek to deny for a moment. But by definition, UEFA has compromised the great competition which Real inaugurated almost single- handedly as the pristine, albeit elitist, European Cup.<br><br>As a match in its own right, Madrid versus Valencia surpassed last week's labourings of Arsenal against Galatasaray in the UEFA Cup Final in Copenhagen.<br><br>That may not be saying much but the gulf was significant and, in contrast, Chelsea's FA Cup Final win against Aston Villa on Saturday might have been played on another, prehistoric planet.<br><br>The levels of technique and the heights of imagination reached by these two teams ridiculed the populist argument back home that the Premiership is the best league in the world.<br><br>Neither of last night's finalists have won this season's Spanish Championship either and, indeed, Real approached the game motivated by the knowledge that their only hope of qualifying for the Champions League next season was to beat their national rivals.<br><br>Such is the economic importance of taking part in Europe's premier competition that the Real directors, despite the club's burgeoning debts, offered each of the team a bonus of no less than Â£250,000. For them, it was an offer worth making since the minimum estimate of Champions League revenue for each entrant is rising to Â£18million.<br><br>Little wonder either, perhaps, that McManaman, Anelka and their illustrious Spanish team-mates responded with such a sense of purpose.<br><br>Valencia had cast themselves as favourites but, come the event, their fresh ambition was at times over-whelmed by Real's experience of these occasions.<br><br>And it was Madrid who took the first step towards enhancing the legend in the 39th minute.<br><br>Full back Michel Salgado pressed for a weakness on the Valencia left and, though he lost possession at close quarters in the box, he regained both the ball and his feet to float the cross which Fernando Morientes headed squarely into the net.<br><br>The timing could not have been better for Real. Suitably uplifted, they began the second half by sending Anelka sprinting away on the right for an angled drive which Canizares palmed around the foot of his near post.<br><br>Then came the moment, in the 67th minute, for which we had waited. A long throw from Roberto Carlos sent Valencia's defence into confusion and their half-clearance, dropping just outside the penalty area, was pounced upon by McManaman with relish.<br><br>As Valencia poured forward in the vain hope of retrieving the two-goal deficit, they left their own half of the pitch completely unmanned and Raul set off alone and unhindered before rounding Canizares and steering home the third.<br><br>Raul may be the young Spanish god of the Bern-abeu but there was no doubting the identity of the real toast of Madrid last night.<br><br>Viva Senor McManaman.<br><br>Real Madrid (5-2-1-2): Casillas; Salgado (Helgado, 85min), Helguera, Karanka, Campo, Carlos; McManaman, Redondo; Raul; Morientes (Savio, 73), Anelka (Sanchis, 81).
