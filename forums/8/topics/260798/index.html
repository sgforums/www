I had grown up feeling disappointment with both myself and people. I had stopped opening my heart up for a long time, perhaps for.. 7 years..till i met a fren who i really treasure alot but recently, we break up as friends. I still have friends who are there for me. However, i can't bring myself to open up/warm up to new people and people who are nice to me.<br><br>I was bullied in primary one, then was kind of taken advantage of in secondary school as i haven't met the friends that could appreciate me as who i am,. When i am in jc, i had grew even more antisocial. I was kind of outcasted in jc and had developed a kind of " don't talk" with people anymore, whenever i am in a group.  Fortunately, i had met frens in society club that i can count on during my jc.<br><br>My mother has a very strict and unloving influence on me. I had learnt to be unaffectionate with myself and people and it does not lead happiness. I am not a  very friendly person. People say i look fierce.<br><br>I feel pain.. cos i have met new friends who are nice.. and i could really like to get to know them better but i always felt this distance with people. I, on the other hand is also tired to deal with " ren " /people but yet i want to get to know them.</span></div></blockquote>As a matter of fact, this is NOT ANTISOCIAL behaviour. Being alone and being antisocial is DIFFERENT.<br><br>Antisocial means rebeling against the norms of society. While liking to be alone means introverted character and that's how chinese originally are anyway.<br><br>It is sad that Singaporeans like to apply false labels and mix things up, and always tease others that they are 'antisocial' and I assure you what they say is UTTER RUBBISH. Bad english.<br><br>When a typical Singaporean comes up to you and say 'Why you so antisocial one, why you don't like to mix with people?' <strong>This type of Singaporean is the RUBBISH SINGAPOREAN WHO IS BRAINWASHED AND CANNOT ACCEPT WHO YOU REALLY ARE.</strong> These rubbish people use the word 'antisocial' to attack people's honest integrity, these attackers are the real losers.<br><br>Think through it, in Korean, Japanese and China's culture it is GOOD TO BE ALONE AND INTROVERTED. Because that is how yellow skinned people should be by nature! This has some influences from Confucianism and Taoism.<br><br>Speaking of antisocial, gangster and hooligan behaviour, coupled with causing harm to others is called antisocial behaviour, and a quiet person is definitely not antisocial, get this straight from now on, Singaporeans!</div>

Yes, I've noticed that there are really a lot of Singaporeans who cannot accept the slightly more "different" people; this is especially true for the teenagers (I'm one, so I'd know quite a bit.) If you don't talk much, you're "anti-social". If you answer the teacher's questions in class, you're a "mugger" and probably "anti-social". If you don't really like to hang out after class and reach home late, you're "anti-social". Stupid, isn't it? And these people are supposed to be the "future leaders (and peasants) of our society". Sheesh. You'd think Singaporeans would be smart.<br><br>And why is being an introvert not a good thing anymore? Introversion just means you draw energy from yourself, from being alone. I've heard my mom always lamenting about my being an introvert, and honestly, I'm sick and tired of all these myths about introverts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I admit that my command of English was never as good as you do. Thus, 'antisocial' to me, simply means being quiet and doesn't want to mingle with other people. I believe that most Singaporean has use this term as I did and freedom11 has the same perception of antisocial. Therefore, you cannot say that we are attacking the integrity of others and putting false labels on them. You can, however, chid us for our command of English. But thanks to you, I now understand this word which I had often use wrongly.<br><br>I think its foolish to think that it is good to be alone and become an introvert. In whatever we do, we just have to associate with people and it is definitely not our culture to be introvert. Back in the kampong days, everyone within the village just know one another and what they do for a living! And you should also realise that there is no way a person can avoid talking to another person. Therefore, whether you are by nature or force by nature to become an introvert, its better to try to talk to others than to hole up in that small world of yours.</div>
