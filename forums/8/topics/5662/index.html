Working in MNC is stable but after 10 years, you may lost all your motivations.  The worse is that you can slowly become a liability to the company.

            <div class='col-md body'>Is it really that bad to work in a MNC? I would like to know how you guys define having a job in a MNC. If you are talking about having a job in the staff function, like being a clerk or a secretary, of course the job will be boring and etc etc.<br><br>However, a job in the line function will certainly not be boring. If you are directly engaged in the designing and manufacturing processes of a company's product, like a product designer, you'll have pretty much the same responsibilities compared with the start-up. A job in the line function is not a liability, it is an asset.<br><br>The company will surely pay you well to keep you so that you will be able to make more money for them. Is that entirely unsatisfactory? And jobs in the line function travel only in one direction: up. Jobs in the staff funcion travel either horizontally or down in the heirachy.<br><br>There has been much encouragement lately about entrepreneurship by the government, extolling the benefits and rewards enjoyed by those who dare to 'start-up'. In a perfect world, everyone should be earning big bucks. However this is a less than perfect world to say the least.<br><br>In my opinion, I would prefably take a job in the line function of a MNC to learn the ropes. Maybe after 5 to 6 years or longer, and not necessarily in the same company, only then will I consider 'starting-up'.<br><br>I'll probably be lambasted for being cowardly, chicken, not willing to take risks and other unsavoury comments. However, just rememember this is merely the path I have chosen to walk. You guys can make your own decisions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Most start-up companies are cash strapped; thus, offering lower pay than the norms.  But if they are one of those high-tech companies that has the intention of going public, then it's worth the low pay if they offer you good stock options.  But there is always the risk that the company doesn't get anywhere and you could lose you job if they can't afford to feed you.  But if you want to be rich in hoping that your stock options could worth millions someday, you got to take the risk.<br><br>Personally, I would leave to join the start-up company if it has good stock options.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I would prefer to work a few years in a MNC, learning the business function well and move on from there. If you got the opportunity to work in a top MNC, would you still consider "downgrading" to a startup? Currently, from the way I see it, life in a MNC is damn tough.. working at least 10 hours min a day.. apply to some profession only. Still if you compare to a startup, I believe a startup would be worst off.<br><br>BTW, do you think you will strike it rich by working for others?? Never!! Most probably, you will not be able to see your 1 million bucks. So the only way is still a startup of your own.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>I think it is a good idea to start in a MNC for a few years first.  You get to learn about business and operations which can be useful if you want to start up on your own.<br><br>Nowsaday, a lot of people start their own businesses straight after Uni or Poly.  Just visit science park and you get what I meant.<br><br>Life in MNC get to be very routine after a while.  If the company is of a considerable size, there will be layers and layers of authorities.  You do the job well and the rewards may not come to you.  After a while, you lost you interest and just stay there because you don't want to lost the comfort.<br><br>Working in a start up can be tougher.  You may need to work for 12 hours or more a day and run a 6 days work week.  Some of these people are doing it without or very low salary.  In this case, how long can you last ?  May be the real rate of success can provide a better picture for all of us.<br><br>In a couple of years time, we would probably find out the real survival when the dust settled.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My answer is- it depends.<br><br>Firstly, I need to be convinced that the idea or service will be in demand. No point setting up a site to sell stuff to teenagers with no money right?<br><br>Secondly, I'll only join the team if they have a clear idea of what they want to do and how they want to do it. Too many start-ups have been aborted because the founders are really techno geeks, not businessmen. You really need to be a bit of both to make the company fly.<br><br>Thirdly, funding and contacts. I've known start-ups who crash because of bad money management. They don't have all the money they need and can't raise the money in time. Then all the delayed payments are due and they have to close shop. What a waste of effort!<br><br>Contacts are also impt. They help bring you to people who can fund you. And let's face it, you need a lot of support from the supply side to make sure you can earn by providing free services to the demand side. (Forget about earning from the demand side. Nobody is willing to pay; they'll just skip your site). And people from the supply side tend not to be young punks like you but established businessmen. If the start-up has no contacts and no plans on how to get contacts, I'll say forget it man.<br><br>Bottomline is, I need to be convinced that the start-up has a good chance of making it before I jump ship. Stock options may sweeten the deal but it'll never take away the inadeqaucies of the biz plan. And it'll never make up for the loss of my most energetic years.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey everyone....I am now an employee of starhub internet....let me just say that I have been to a lot of interviews lately, but starhub offers the best pay and benefits...and because it's such a new company in Singapore the chances for advancement are quite high....and yes, I have to work 10 hour days.....maybe more, but then again the other start ups I got interviewed for you have to work those same hours and maybe longer...plus I don't have to work on Saturday like these other smaller companies. I've got medical benefits, dental, etc....<br><br>If I had my PR I would just do my own startup right away as I feel I know what has to be done...but unfortunately(and at the same time fortunately...) I have to get a paying job first tot get my employment pass and PR after that...But it's good because I get to have the experience of working in the MNC and let me just say that i feel very excited about starting work...There is a certain mistique about working in an mnc as compared with working in a start-up...even if the start-up does well it still doesn't give you that same glow...although it does have it's own glow of satisfaction for personal accomplishment...<br><br>When I do start my own thing, people will take me more seriously when they discover that I used to be part of an MNC, and on top of that, I will get to meet a lot of powerful contacts thru the mnc....it's something that's indispensible and difficult to get any other way.<br><br>as for satisfaction, you get satisfaction if you are satisfied with what you are doing...unless you don't like the job, you should feel satisfied...if you can't find satisfaction then maybe something is wrong with you or with the job....either way you have to ask yourself why you aren't happy.<br><br>suffice to say that most people aren't ready to start their own thing up...the successfull ones usually have some idea of their direction and how they want to do it...It's easy to register you rcompany but difficult to know what you're doing.<br><br>Anyway, either way oyou look at it both way is good....but it depends on which road is going to benefit you more in both monetary terms and satisfaction level.</div>
