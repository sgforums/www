I think it was you who get into these mess.

FireIce locked up the old thread, of cos i have to put up a new one to state my views. U are suggesting that if someone slaps you, then you let him get away without a word, no? The only thing tat's wrong was that i used terms like 'xia lan' and 'communist stand', which i will not apologise for by the way.<br><br>Since the forum has evolved to a place whereby ppl get slugged and can't defend themselves, the whole point of having a forum is lost. Might as well let just a whole faction run the show and delete whatever comments they felt were against them.</div>
