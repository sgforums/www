            <div class='col-md body'>They should be allowed to start from as young as possible around the age of 16 albeit with guidance from the parents in the initial stages. Parents nowadays are getting more and mroe protective of their child and do not realise that this MAY be bringing about more harm than good when the child steps out into the society to work and face the harsh realities. By letting them learn independance does not mean to "heck care" whatever they do but rather allow them to learn through mistakes and falls if necessary while at the same time giving them advice and guidance so as not to let their self confidence deflate totally.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NS life is best because for most people it is involuntary! It equalises alot of things among people and it gives everyone a role to play, not to mention the importance of getting that Cert. of Service...which means more income given, if no cert, then employers will ask why??!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Should learn to take care of themself from secondary school. At the age of 12 they should know how to wake up, go to school themself, manage their own time and own school work. I saw some kids Sec 1 still need parents to wake them up and bring them to school, what a sad thing to see.</div>
