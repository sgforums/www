            <div class='col-md body'>This is my first time where I decide to start a thread. This question have been brought up in some threads and I am trying to find my own answers. I am looking forward to the answers of many others.<br><br>How many of you have ever gotten over your ex-bf/gf? Can you actually get over someone? Is it true that one could go into another r/s with the memory of someone whom you share with? Suppose if you are married, and your spouse pass away, will you marry again? The basis of these questions is : Can we actually let go, whether for ourselves or the other party?<br><br>I will attempt to put my own answers and you may choose to disagree. IMHO, I don't think that it is ever possible to get over someone whom you love deeply. Every now and then, even years later, something reminds you of the other person - a certain smell, a few notes of a song, a certain place or some words which trigger some memory - and suddenly you feel just as bad as the day the other person told you he/she never wanted to see you again. If you want to know the honest truth, you never completely get over someone you really cared about... Someone mentioned earlier in one post that love is when you take away everything and you find that you are still concerned over that person. And perhaps, it is this reason that some people could not let go.<br><br>In the case of when you lose your loved one to Death, I think getting over is much difficult. I am sure that I will get opposition to my stand and I can accomodate a difference in opinion here. Their opinion is echoed thru a quote in a comic series entitled Sandman, where Dream, the protagonist of the story told his son Orpheus (who could not get over the death of his wife, Eurydice), and he said,<br><br>"You are mortal: it is the mortal way. You attend the funeral, you bid the dead farewell. You grieve. Then you continue with your life. And at times the fact of her absence will hit you like a blow to the chest, and you will weep. But this will happen less and less as time goes on.<br>She is dead. You are alive. So live."<br><br>Perhaps, the only comfort one seek from emotional hurt is by the simple notion of Time. Time heals all wounds, yet I think it is not whether the healing is the question, as we can never wash away the scars.<br><br>Well, after listening to all my blabber, what do you think?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For me, I have been able to accept that a r/ship is over and not let past events, be they happy or not, affect my present r/ship. However I try to learn from any mistakes that I committed in the past eg. insensitivity and avoid repeating the same mistakes. It's not possible for me to forget everything I did with my ex unless I get brainwashed. Once in a while when doing things or went to a place with fond memories, I will be reminded of the what we did (me and me ex in the past). However I am able/try to minimise their influence on my present day actions and feelings that I'm experiencing with my g/f. Memories will stay as memories. Every relationship is unique in their own sense and for me, I dun compare because it is not fair to any party since there are too many differences(both visible and internal) between one relationship and another.<br><br>As for whether I'll accept another girl into my life if my partner is taken away by Death, the ans is NO in the near future. I cared so much for my partner and I do not think that I can easily let go. Life goes on of cos but it will be difficult to face the fact that we are seperated not becos of problems but becos one of us is dead. It will be quite some time before I may accept someone new. Then again I've never encounter such a situation so it may be one thing to say and another thing when it really happens.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by light (edited 15 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Prodigal<br>As for me, I dun think it is easy to forget the one I love..To me, I am still trying to find out what is love in my view...but as far as I can remember I hold very fond memories of my first love and I certainly know how u feel. Cos my first love feels the same way as u, and the worst thing is it seems that he still can't gt over me until now cos he hopes that we will go back though he has never said it...it is like we will have this telepatic effect...can u imagine...we can type the same thing in the internet while we are chatting..and when we type something, something strike and both of us will coherently think of the same event...<br><br>I remember just last year, it is our ;annivesary and we sort of seperated for half a year and I was in Canada and we talked in the internet. Then I realise that that date is our anniversary..and I have forgotten and he still remembers...and then we stopped typing...and then I cried..and he typed that tears was rolling on his cheeks too....tell u man..he is the kind who never cries except in front of me..he is the typical Leo...and we have this bond that it will stay in the innermost of out hearts...<br><br>So...I think though we have broke up but still there is a force that keep us together,,,he is also hoping that another girl can come to fill the space in his heart the way he has loved me but just imagine..if u have given everything u have...to a girl that u have loved so much..it is difficult to give it to another girl the same love u have given.<br><br>If my spouse whom I love so much is dead and I love him so much....I think it would be hard to accept another person but all and all I dun want to get another guy becos of lonliness or just as a substitute...all and all depends on how is the situation...cos sometimes the chemistry between two individuals can be immense...<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 15 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well it will depend on how both of u broke up in the first place. if it is by mutual understanding, i think i will feel that we're just not fated to be together. if she leaves me for another guy. definitely i will be very sad. pple always say time will heal the wound, but don't they know the scar will always will there.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Rinoa :<br><br>After reading your reply, I share the same sentiment. I can still remember my ex-gf's birthday and the anniversary, and all 3 times, I left Singapore, I could not help but to drop a tear for her, even though I am no longer part of her life. Though she may never know that, I suppose I have to mend my own wounds whether I want it or now. I met an angmoh friend yesterday, and told him to be ready for one of the dates, since there is once I walked to the college bar and told him that I want to get drunk. I asked him what he has to offer, and he told me that you find the right person.. Anyway, I think I will likely get drunk on that day...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Itz certainly impossible to forget a TRUE love, no matter wat's the reason for the separation. Itz wat u had given n gone thru', no matter joyous or heart wrenching moments, they all linger in ur mind... i tried to forget n actually lie to myself dat i had forgotten but itz a matter of time b4 u realise, she's still there... in ur mind. Dun ever think i can give so much love to another ger... itz realli sad i think, cos itz wat u have to live wif for rest of life... in fact i stop beliving in love anymore...<br><br>cheers~</div>
