I puked countless times and had very bad diarrhoea. I lost 1.5kg of water in a matter of hours and got very severely dehydrated. No way can it wait till morning.<br><br>I was luckier than the TS - at least the neighbourhood GP clinics near my home were still open. I was damn close to getting hospitalised - but the doc decided a wait and see approach.<br><br>He was luckily lenient with me - when he learnt that I was still a studying, he gave me a discount. I ended up paying $35 instead of $50++.<br><br>This sort of things really cannot wait till morning. The very fact that the TS vomitted blood suggests that it was really, really serious.</div>

I won't be surprised if the original charge had been $70, though.<br><br>I told the doc that I actually wanted to wait it out till morning and report sick at the UHWC at NUS, which waives consultation fees and gives discounts for medicines.

Better safe than sorry. And bearing in mind taking a cab - midnight charge comes into effect since u said 4 am. So you cannot just say added up it is all $110. At least you got seen.<br><br>Want a free system? I waited in an Australian Emergency department for 4-5 hrs forgotten by the doctor until  the redback spider's venom started spreading in my system from the bite and it became a medical emergency - not fun to get hooked up to a cardiac monitor. Now I think I might just use my insurance to cover that $2k ambulance ride to get seen first.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by gingerbreadman:</div><div class="quote_body">NTUC reallie that bad meh?</div></blockquote>They claim i mis-read the policy. I admit, that like most people, can't make head or tails what i sign on the doted line....... that's why i call them up to confirm. like i say..... the staff told me no problem, max claim can be up to $4200...... no one told me that NTUC can claim back a max of $1500 a yr from me. can't remeber what's the claim back called. my total claim is $3900+.... and I think that with a max claim of $4200, it should cover my whole claim. But NTUC say that my daliy claim is only $500. So 2days stay at Hospital is only $1000...... doctor fee is $500. Total claim only $1500. Therefore NTUC after using the $1500 claim back, they own me nothing.......<br><br>Lesson learn...... do your homework properly before signing the paper. If not, kena screw too late already.<br><br>But no choice. I need the Operation to improve my Health..... even if NTUC told me before the Ops that they wouldn't pay, i would still go ahead for the Ops. Just angry that the play me out last minute.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
