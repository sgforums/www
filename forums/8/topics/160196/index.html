            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, so we had school today. It wasn't a normal day of classes. We had this thing called Fall Fest that our Art Society puts on. I go to a private school full of rich snobbish pricks, and our school administration knows this, so they have an auction at every Fall Fest to benefit our Service Board.<br><br>It is the most disgusting thing ever.<br><br>Today, this one kid I really loathe decides to drop $435 dollars on a poster of the Friends cast signed by all of them. He didn't even want it, he just wanted to outbid this one rich girl to prove that he could.<br><br>And to top this shit off, he spent FOUR HUNDRED FUCKING DOLLARS ON 7 DOZEN COOKIES! How wrong is that? That money could've gone to save the lives of a few kids in third world Africa, but he drops it on FUCKING COOKIES! Can you imagine eating an five dollar fucking cookie!?<br><br>I'm sorry, I just had to get this off my chest...<br></div>
