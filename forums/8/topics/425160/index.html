A peasant takes home on average approximately $30,000 a year or $2,500 a month.</p>
              <p>As 20% of the peasant’s pay has to go into CPF, the peasant is left with $2,000 in cash. Assuming the peasant saves 10% of his cash for rainy days, he would be left with $1800.</p>
              <p>If the peasant spends every single cent of his $1,800 and is taxed at the rate of 7% in form of GST, he will have to pay $126 in GST every month. From here, we can conservatively gauge that it takes approximately 1000 peasants to feed one minister every month just from paying GST.</p>

He said he was going to Batam on Business for two days and needed to borrow $5000. The loan officer said the bank would need some security for the loan. <br><br>Mr. Choe then handed over the keys to his Mercedes that was parked on the street in front of the bank. Everything checked out and the loan officer accepted the car as collateral for the loan. <br><br>An employee then drove the Mercedes into the bank's carpark and parked it there. Two days later Mr. Choe returned and repaid the $5,000 and the interest which came to $13.07. <br><br>The loan officer said, "We do appreciate your business and this transaction has worked out very nicely. But we are a bit puzzled. While you were away, we checked and found that you are a very rich contractor.

She lined the babies up in front of her and exclaimed, "Heil Hitler!"<br><br>At hearing this, the German baby raised his arm in a salute, while the Jewish baby soiled his diapers.

Some held wooden crosses, prayer books and other holy objects to ward off evil.... <br><br>As the time approached, their hearts began beating anxiously, and with every beat of the clock, everyone held their breath........ .... Then Ah Soh, the part-time Friday cleaner, came into the room and unplugged the life support system so that she could use the vacuum cleaner.</em><br></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: medium; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Joo Chiat nightmare</strong></span><span style="font-size: small; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br>While Singaporean behaviour is generally not extreme, there is a little bit of the flaunting, looking-down-on-others trait in every one of us. By Seah Chiang Nee.<br>Nov 16, 2002 </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Out of Singapore's gloomiest times, hard-pressed citizens are finding an unexpected source of respite from a decade-long neighbourhood dispute in a quiet eastern suburb.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The real life drama between the Chan family and seven of its neighbours has turned the area into a tourist attraction since it made it on prime time TV a month ago.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Every evening, up to 100 people, some coming from Malaysia, have been visiting the place, hoping to catch a glimpse of the action. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For awhile it even predominated coffee shop conversations, pushing aside terrorist fears and economic woes. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">With 4 million people living in one of the world's densest-populated cities, neighbourhood disputes are not uncommon - but this is not the run-of-the-mill story.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Neither is it just about social friction of life in a fishbowl.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It raises the bigger question whether - in its haste to achieve prosperity - Singapore has neglected developing the people's social graces. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Although it is not representative of the average family here, the Joo Chiat conflict shows how far Singaporeans have to go to catch up on becoming a civil society.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The incredible story unfolded on Oct 12 over Channel U's programme "Inside Out" which features neighbourhood living. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Retiree Chan Cheng Koon, 67, lives at 130B Everitt Road with his wife Chua Gek Eng and daughter, Soo Yin, in her 40s.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For almost 10 years, seven of their neighbours have repeatedly complained of harassment by the Chans, who in turn blame them of having started it. All are occupants in a row of semi-detached houses.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The neighbours say the Chans mounted a spotlight which they turn on at night shining into their bedrooms (Chan says it for security). They would also video-filmed their neighbours and tailing them or their visitors, making them feel uncomfortable. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">One of the scenes aired on TV shows the daughter, a secondary school teacher with a doctorate in life sciences, standing next to her mother, shouting across to the neighbours: "You see, this is diamonds, you can buy or not? You got money to buy?"<br><br>Another comment was "...My time is very precious, an hour $200..." and "See my car, brand new" </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A neighbour was labelled as "low class" because she spoke only Mandarin, not English. Chan told the reporter "I don't know Hokkien, dialects and I don't speak Mandarin. I am English-educated you know?" </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The police have been called in several times and the warring parties have resorted to getting video evidence of each other.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">All efforts at mediation, including one by the Member of Parliament, have failed. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Last week, one of the neighbours, Madam Cheong Siew Ying, 38, supported by others took the case to the court. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">After an hour, the magistrate ordered both sides to cool off for a month before pursuing another settlement attempt. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Predictably, public sentiments, especially over the Internet, are overwhelmingly against the Chans, considering them to be arrogant and crude. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Others, however, say their neighbours, too, should take part of the blame for allowing the matter to go this far.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">What disturbed people most was the crude flaunting of wealth and earning capacity, showing off of jewellery and car and educational status - on national TV. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">While Singaporeans are generally far from such extreme behaviour, there are people who believe there is a little bit of the Chan trait in every one of us. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">With a society that measures success by wealth and educational status, it is not uncommon for richer Singaporeans to look down on others, especially the non-English educated, as "low class" or "poor achievers."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">One manifestation is the incidence of maid abuse. There were 157 cases in 1997.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Only after the enactment of tough new laws against guilty employers did the numbers drop falling to six for the first half of this year.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">But the behaviour of many Singaporeans towards their maids - numbering some 140,000 - still falls short of acceptability. They are made to work hours, without a day off and given only five or six hours of sleep a day. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Mr. Chew Kim Whatt, president of Singapore's biggest maid 45% of employers "don't know how to treat their domestic workers." </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">An academic, however, put it this way: For 30 years, Singapore's economy has developed rapidly but this was never matched by development of its people.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"Many earn good income, dress well but their minds are little different from their ancestors' - quite primitive" he added. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A month before the Joo Chiat drama became public, a 37-year-old Singaporean man was jailed for three months for kicking his Indonesian maid in the buttocks after she forgot to shut a window when it rained.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Criticism has fallen on the education system, which places global-winning emphasis on Science and Mathematics and little on character or social upbringing. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Others say working parents are to be blamed in this two-income society. Youths grow up without being taught social values.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">One web-site chatter says the Joo Chiat episode is a setback to the city's efforts to build a gracious society.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"We have just spent S$600 million on The Theatres on The Esplanade (the Durian) cultivating the arts to nurture the souls," he said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"If the society values graciousness, it is definitely not showing it by allowing such uncouth behaviour bordering on the surreal to go unpunished."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It will take another generation at least before Singaporeans can shake off their refugee past, when concern for others ranked well below self-survival.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Many of our ancestors had to fight others for a space on board a ship or to get food for their children.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span class="goog_qs-tidbit goog_qs-tidbit-0">This trait lives on today among many Singaporeans, a self-centered, couldn't-care-less for other people attitude. The changes come but only</span> gradually.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It surfaces in everyday routines. People (irrespective of education) jump queues, talk on a handphone in a cinema or restaurant, and grab anything that is free in disregard for others.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Others fiercely protect their turf if they consider it under threat. A well-behaving person, for example, may turn into a monster when he is driving and someone cuts into his lane. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">And after a life of hard knocks, many achievers are less tolerant towards others who are behind. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">All this lead to disputes even in the most unexpected places.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">They range from such the high-class Singapore Recreation Club (over elections) to two combative fruit sellers engaging in a self-defeating business war (selling 30 apples for $1).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As a result, mediation has become a business of the courts - and aspirant lawyers are trained in university to handle it. ends</span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>DO you agree?<br><br>I am a Singaporean myself.... and at times I just feel why are we all not doing such.... -_-" Singaporeans are just too self-centered in general. Do you agree?<br><br>e.g <br><strong>ESCALATOR</strong><br>standing to the left on Escalators while letting pple climb if they want.<br>it took us sooooooo long to do it almost right.<br><br><strong>MRT - giving up your seat</strong><br>Almost ALL expecting mother would agree wit this. From a colleague of mine... only when my wife became pregnant that I started to be more aware of my surroundings and letting go of my seat in public transport.... before that he was totally clueless.<br><br><strong>Getting the door</strong><br>You know when you are entering a door and someone is like 2~3 steps away we should actually just keep the door held open for the person on the back since once he /she reaches the door it will sort of sla on their face...<br>Personally, I was not doing this until I went overseas... -_-" shame on me.<br><br><strong>Day to Day discussion</strong><br>Epsecially, in forums.. I feel people do not seem to put themselves in ANOTHER angle (or simply cannot put themselves in other's shoes) to give opinions but usually like to sound out what they believe and THAT is THAT... <br><br>Seriously... we retarded or just simple too self-centered?</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><span class="postbody"><span style="font-size: x-small;">With all that is happening around the world and in all our neighbouring countries, Singapore has it good. Everyone is so narrow minded, self centered and self absorbed. They only think of themselves and themselves only. Everyday worrying about the silly prices of food, gst hike, gst credits, workfare bonus, debate about the minister's and president's pay and most of all the stupid election (which we all know what the outcome will be even before the election is held). <br><br>Why don't we look around ourselves and see the pain and suffering that is going on, the disasters that have happened. If you compare ourselves to them, we are but a small little dot in this big ocean. <br><br>If Singapore did get hit by the tsunami, we would be wiped off the map and no one would have given a dam about it.</span></span></p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>C. H. Yeo is 42 years old, has a bachelor’s degree majoring in design from Australia, and works as an interior designer and part-time lecturer.<br><br>It is a pretty decent resume for any prospective girlfriend, but when it came to dating Singaporean women, Yeo thought his plump, 1.5m frame put him at a distinct disadvantage.<br><br>“I’ve heard the girls look for handsome guys and will start looking at you 360 degrees. I don’t want to be in that situation.” So he joined a growing band of higher-educated Singaporean men who go knocking on the doors of foreign bride agencies.<br><br>Last December, he tied the knot with a 23-year-old Vietnamese woman, Lu Thi Tham, who used to run a kiosk in Vietnam selling sugar cane. She is now four months’ pregnant.<br><br>Like Yeo, The Sunday Times said that one in four Singapore men married foreign brides last year, a phenomenon that has hit a 10-year high<br><br>Last year, 6,520 male Singaporeans and permanent residents married foreign brides, the highest number in 10 years, according to the Department of Statistics. The number is up from 5,210 the previous year and 4,425 in 2003. Traditionally, the paper said, matchmaking agencies have catered to men with lower academic qualifications, but now they are seeing more and more diploma and degree holders.<br><br>One agency, Mr Cupid, said seven out of every 10 customers have a bachelor’s degree or higher. <br><br>Five years ago, most clients had up to Secondary 2 education, said director Martin Wong. Mr Cupid gets six to seven clients a month.<br><br>Of the seven men who spoke to The Sunday Times about their foreign marriages, four said they preferred foreign women because they would be more demure and accommodating.<br><br>What they want, they said, is a woman who will put the family and husband first, rather than demand cars, condominiums and credit cards.<br><br>See Chee Hong, 35, a chef with Secondary 2 education, said: “Few Singaporean women will want to live with my parents and two sisters in our four-room HDB flat.”<br><br>He married a Vietnamese farmer’s daughter in 2004. <br><br>They have two sons, aged 17 months and seven months. His wife is 22.<br><br>“My wife takes care of the kids and all the housework. Her requests are simple: Care for me, don’t bully me and don’t go out to look for other women.”<br><br>Another reason more Singapore men are marrying foreigners, the experts say, is simply that they have more opportunities to meet.<br><br>Besides the 30 or so foreign bride agencies that are operating here at any one time, Singaporeans are travelling overseas more often, more foreign women are coming to work here and the Internet enables singles to meet online wherever they live. Figures on which nationalities Singaporean men prefer were not available, but back in 1998, Malaysians topped the chart, followed by women from Indonesia and China.<br><br>The Sunday Times understands Malaysians still form the bulk of foreign brides, but Vietnamese and China brides are gaining ground.<br><br>On the other hand, far fewer Singapore women than men marry foreigners. The possibility of having to leave the country may be part of the reason far fewer Singapore women than men marry foreigners. <br><br>Even so, the number of female Singaporeans and permanent residents marrying foreign men has gone up slightly over the past 10 years. <br><br>Last year, 1,596 local women married foreign men, up from 1,134 in 1996</p></div>

              <p style="text-align: justify;">I realise most Singaporeans have this mentality : When troubles come, "SIAM", in other words meaning, "When troubles or inconveniece come, get out of the way, and not do anything to help.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Sometimes, when we are on the bus and we see an old woman boarding the bus, we pretend to be asleep. We sleep, and we do not care about her need and we give ourselves a whole load of excuses of not giving up the seat.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">I talked to a number of my friends who are Singaporeans about fighting for Singapore in the context of a war or conflicts with neighbouring countries. They told me they would run away, and not fight, because a fight <strong>is not worthy of their time, money and lives. It was more about themselves, than the nation.<br></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">I have seen an old man collapsed on the bus due to heat and exhaustion. All the passengers in the bus could do was to watch, or pretend not to see, and do nothing or just talk about it. I went up and help, and shouted for someone to help too. It was just a basic compassion moment, I thought.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The problem is, in any case of a need for public assistance, and if I do step up to help, I know there will be some people at the back of the bus or crowd, muttering, and criticising what I am doing.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">"Oh, why is that young lad so kaypo?"</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">"Oh what does he think he is trying to do...act kind and concerned?", some will mock.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">"Can't he just leave it to the bus driver??"</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">"Can't this guy just leave it to the people that are coming?"</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">"He's blocking the way of alighting passengers by helping the guy and creating a commotion!"</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="goog_qs-tidbit-0">These people are typical self-centred Singaporeans - Watch and do nothing when a need arises. And when its too inconvenient or deemed too</span> dangerous for them to help, they will pretend not to see, and prevent others from helping by discouraging and muttering under their breaths so as to hide their own selfishness. They will back down.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">At the end of the day, Singaporeans as a nation <strong>did</strong> grow up with the mentality of "Big Brother is watching, and he will take care of everything."</p>

              <div class="art-PostContent">
              <p>Dear Fellow Citizens,</p>
              <p>This coming Election will be the litmus test. We win or doom!</p>
              <p>Do will have what it takes to stand-up in against the PAP?</p>
              <p>Are we the Coward of our own misery?</p>
              <p>Put aside the carrot now being presented by PAP. Filter through their “rationale” for the real truth of their motive.</p>
              <p>Future of Singapore is in your hands!</p>
              <p>PAP does not seem to care! –they do not show much compassion and conscience anymore.</p>
              <p>PAP watches, controls, dictates and manipulates our minds, our souls and our lives. We seem to live in a Perfect “Truman Show”-PAP style!</p>
              <p>Every rationale PAP gives has cleverly guarded insidious motive-their self-interest of perpetuity.</p>
              <p>They have everything to live laps of luxuries for their generation and next generation.  Yet they do little to listen to the woes and anguish of citizen earnestly.</p>
              <p>PAP delivers so-called “enrichment” calibrated to maximum to their leverage to “buy” votes.</p>
              <p>They have tremendous wealth-all that they ever needed. They want now, more Power and Prestige! Absolute Power!</p>
              <p>What do most of us have! Our frustrations and angst on housing and foreign influx are not heeded earnestly.</p>
              <p>Our past, current generation has to suffer for next generation to have something call decent home. This seems more and more unachievable with escalating cost and insidious stranglehold of PAP over nearly every aspect of our lives.</p>
              <p>Is that what we want?</p>
              <p>Or ARE WE cowards to the extent we cow in fear of every threat of PAP, and sucks to every carrot which they bait us?</p>
              <p>I am afraid we are. We will also “prostitute” ourselves for money carrot dangling in front.</p>
              <p>It is in our blood-the fear, the cowardice, the greed?</p>
              <p>Singapore is NOT Singapore in the FUTURE. PAP is NOT PAP before! Singapore is PAP soon!</p>

              <p>We need to band together, stand-up in what we believe! Or we will never have our next generation of Singaporean we called the “true-bred”!</p>
              <p>Nation-hood is only a fiction it seems under PAP!</p>
              <p>Let vote and vote victoriously for once in our life to make a very powerful statement to PAP!</p>
              <p>Singaporeans, do what is right!</p>
              <p>Do we want OUR LIVES, or the LIVES PAP wants US to live!!!</p>
              <p>Please discuss this serious issue of current and future prosperity with your families and friends.</p>
              <p>Everyone do a little bit, together will be a unity of strength of the Nation we seek!</p>
