Well as wat most guys do, i wooed her. After a 6-7 months we are very close to each other and i sense tat she too is in love with me... Then comes a 3rd party...He wooed her too and often talked to her and stuff like tat. But i don't fight or quarrel with tat guy cos he's my friend (well, SO called friend) i jus tried to be more closer to the gal after i've known there is a 3rd pary involved.<br>After a few months...last yr x'mas Eve...<br>i asked her out...<br>She rejected me, and told me somethings i will never forget...<br>she said in chinese : There r alot of trees in the forest, don't give up the whole forest because of 1 tree...<br>After she said tis, i felt as if a knife had been pierced into my heart...<br>i spent the whole x'mas alone and sad...<br>i heard tat she had a boyfriend. (her BF is not my *so called friend* )<br>I took months of pain to forget her...<br>And then recently, she had broken up with her BF...She is sad of cause<br>Now she's calling me at night talking about her pain and such..i feel sorry for her, but i dont think i will love her again like last time...cos she had hurt me bad enough to cut off my nerves and therefore i have no feelings for any gals.. ( YEA tats true! and eer..i don't go for guys )<br>Now i have the chance to get her back...But..i don't like anyone now...<br>If it is 1 yr ago...maybe then i will try, but now there is no special gal in my life..<br>maybe tats the irony of my life...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry about your situation Prodigy...I will try to keep this post from becoming winded..hee hee:-) very difficult...<br><br>Anyway, I admire that you didn't go back to her as she would just be using you to comfort herself until she found someone else...then you would most likely be out of her life again...*sigh*  That's all I can say about that...I still don't understand...so did your 'friend' get attached to her and from then forth wasn't your friend anymore?  or was it really another guy?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well Prodigy, its sad really, reading yur story. Its true that life is full of ironies, but its full of tests and trials that you have to go through as well. Take each one as a learning experience, a lesson that u learn about this world. However, dun let it deter u from future relationships ok? Everyone is different, so not all gals are the same either. Its probably not the time for u to find yur mate yet.<br><br>Good Luck!<br><br>============<br>... now IÂ’m sad and alone. IÂ’m going to become bitter and distrustful of people because one person betrayed me. IÂ’m going to hate those who have found their treasure because I never found mine. And IÂ’m going to hold on to what little I have, because IÂ’m too insignificant to conquer the world.<br>(The Alchemist, Paulo Coelho)</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I guessed that I truly understand how u feel, Prodigy. In fact, I'm in the stage of burying my mermories about her. It's almost been half a year. I've been trying very hard...<br><br>I know that I must have loved her very much, each and every day I remind myself, forget, forget forget...forget about her, damn it!! I really hope that I'll get over with it..<br><br>You are right...the feeling is just like a knife that slided my heart into two. It's kind of painful. Before that, no one ever told me, I didn't know it was that painful until now. I guessed a part of me had also gone with her. No longer feel wholesome anymore.<br><br>I really don't know what if one day she would really come back to me. I don't have a clue what will I do next. But I think I may have the same reaction as you. For sure, I'll get over with it.<br><br></div>
