              <p>Hi gladis,</p>
              <p>Is the compensation stated within their policy? If it is, then as MasterMoogle has kindly pointed out, you can try making a claim against the club. However, if it is stated that you will put your items at the depositary at your own risk, it will be unlikely that your claim will go through.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>ACTUALLY company will have to pay ............there is no such thing as insurance company pay or sell.</p>
              <p>they shouldnt bother customers with insurance,business finance,drink orders,suppliers etc etc.</p>
              <p>company should only say yes and no to money lost!if they dont want to give then just report to police at police post.the police will take 10 mins wriye it and file it down on pen and paper.then what happens is if u want to sue to get money which is costly or just wave a fist at the company who "robbed" you.</p>
              <p>or go to CASE which is a goernment unit and see if they can help.they are better in solving problems like this.better than police.</p>

              <p>hi gladis, im sorry about your lost. im saying this because i was in the same situtation as you last year. i went to a night club with my dongsaeng. and we left our bag. After clubbing , we actually went to get my bag and realise that my ipod and 200 dollars was missing from my bag and my dongsaeng camera was also missing from his bag. so we went to report it to the club manager and told him about my losses. Same as your situation they told me that they will be responsible and will compensate us and told us they will get back to us as soon as possible. but after 2 weeks still no news from them, and we went down again to the club and asked about our losses and to our surprise they actually forgot about it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bunch of irressponsible workers, we were wrong but they had to help us too because of this i went to file a police report and told them about our losses and the police actually went down to the club to ask about the situation. the club manager then help us they check thru their cctv and told us that 2 weeks ago video they had already deleted it. sorry cant really describe the detail here too long already</p>
              <p>but end of story they did compensate us by giving us 300 dollars not a lot but at least it can recover some losses. i will try to help u as i have been in that situation.. really hard to tell you everything over here.</p>
              <p>i will try my very best to help u but no guarantee but i will try my very best because i feel that is injusticed done in yours and my situation. maybe because u are a foreigner which is why they tend to be ignorant towards you and dont really wanna help u. u can email me or add me in msn at richardclayderman_fan@hotmail.com. i will tell u on what i did and help u recover some losses.</p>

              <p>I urge everyone who is in this kinda situtation, do make a police report immediately. Do get the OM (Operations manager) or incharge to write down a copy of stuffs lost and both parties signed. Even if said will get back to you in a few days time, its always better to play safe (CCTV recording can be reused again and again &amp; they have ample time to reconsider compensating you if there there's loopholes in the time of event)</p>
              <p>Club scene is always afraid of bad press (Hint*). Do understand your rights, and stand firm.</p>
              <p>Hmm, LXXXX club...i only can think of one. Oriental theme. period....</p>
              <p>Gladis, i think this is a case of mistaken bag collection by others. From your write up, it's been more than one month, they can't be bother to update you? If no news still yet, go to CASE, eventually if they hears of it (reputation stake), things will be much faster.</p>
              <p>Agenda, one thing turns another. Think before you write/say (unless you have a pea brain).</p>
