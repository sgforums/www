I have lost a lot of weight before and have even been rather toned, but it is simply too difficult for my body to maintain that condition for long especially now that im working at a desk job. I am still working out but it is barely enough to keep my weight stable.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
