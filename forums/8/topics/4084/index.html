            <div class='col-md body'>Field Engineers used to be very tough and physically demanding for its bridging operations. However, as the SAF is moving towards mechanized bridging, life in a Field Engineer unit had improved tremendously. Not to mention the TSRs and GOMs to protect the soldiers, I think it is quite a good to be an engineer; not super tough and not super lobo also.<br><br>Those who have the chance to go to the old School of Combat Engineers in Jurong should look at the bridges displayed around the cookhouse. You will be amazaed that how the early engineers built those bridges without much machineries.
