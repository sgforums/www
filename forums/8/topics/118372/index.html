Now, for the first time, see an ancient Indian document of aeronautical science, the Vyanmaika Shastra(VS) that gives us technical and schematical information on propulsion, energy, weapons, flight tactics, pilots food and clothes and metallurgy. This is the the most groud-breaking document ever and has been studied by many scholars, engineers and scientists from Europe and India from the early 20th century and onwards. It is currently being studied on the highest level of the Indian government and scientifiic community, at the Aeronautical Development Agency(ADA) of the Indian Ministry of Defence. Indian scientists have been able to succesfully recreate the prescribed alloys according to the formulas in the VS.<br><br>Other technologies<br><br>BIO-ENGINEERING:<br><br>This is the most staggering find I have come upon. It appears that the ancient Indians also had the ability to clone humans(it's very ironic that contemporary India is taking the lead in stem-cell research) In the Mahabharata, the queen Ghandari, who had pregnancy problems and after 2 years bore a pinda(ball of flesh) which was then handed over to a sage. He divided this ball of flesh into 100 parts and treated them with a chemical process, then put each part into a sealed cooling container for 2 years, from which 100 male babies were created.<br><br>ENGINEERING<br><br>According to the Indian epics Mahabharata(10,000 - 3000 years ago) and Ramayana(1.2 million years ago) engineering was far more advanced than modern civilization. The Ramayana describes the construction of a bridge from India to Sri Lanka. While the Mahabharata describes the construction of an entire island city in record time and also described it sinking into the ocean after the death of Krishna. Both can be verified by modern archeology.<br><br><img src="http://www.rootsweb.com/~lkawgw/adamsb1.jpg"><br>The island city of Dwarika's construction is recorded in the Mahabharata - as is it's sinking into the sea. It was found only recently by pioneering team led by India's most reveered and respected archeologist Dr S.R. Rao and is heralded as the biggest archeological find after the discovery of Troy. It was a submerged and lost city on the west coast of India. Pottery found there has been carbon dated to more than 7000 years old. This proves the historicity of the Mahabharata.<br><br>Advanced Knowledge<br><br>In the Indian Puranas, thought to be more than 1200 years old. A speed of the sun is given based on the Rig Veda.<br><br>That speed is: 2,202 yojanas in half a nimesa.<br><br>These are given in ancient indian units. Here is a conversion:<br><br>A yojanas is 8000 Dhanus/bows and each bow is 6 feet<br><br>A nimesa is 16/73 of a second, as deduced from the following in the Purans:<br><br>15 nimesa = 1 Kastha<br>30 Kastha = 1 Kala<br>30 Kala = 1 Mahutra<br>30 Malhutra = 1 day and night<br><br>If we convert them to their equivalent modern units, where each yojanas is 9 miles and each nimesha is 16/73.3 seconds, substituting it into the speed of the sun by the Rig Veda gives the speed of the sun as 186,536 miles per second. The most accurate figure for the speed of light as of today is 186,282 miles per second.<br><br>This means the Rig Veda figure is 99% accurate to the modern figure. This kind of accuracy can only be achieved with laser technology and highly sophisticated measuring equipment. However, this just corroborates what we already know from the Vymanika Shastra, that they did indeed have laser technology.</strong></div>
