No historian has ever attempted to find links in this aspect. Only mendicants and Aryan believers, for whom Sri Rama is sacred, have reason to connect Adam's Bridge with the Ramayana. </strong><br><br>Let us talk Sri Lanka geologically. The island was once in pre-historic period linked to the sub-continent. The presence of a local species of elephant has linkage to the elephants of the sub-continent and not the sub-species of the African family. The island is adrift, moving in a north-easterly direction and in some distant millenium may be located in the middle of the Bay of Bengal.<br><br>The island was not inhabited for long and certainly no Ram or Sita ever visited it. The various names assigned, to the island: Serendip, Swaran Dweep, Ceylon are all recent. The word 'Lanka' has no local vernacular origin, nor in Sanskrit, Tamil or Hindi. Of all things, the word is only found in two aboriginal dialects of the Gond and Mandvi tribes. Our interest should rest on the Gondvi dialect as 'Lanka' means a piece of land surrounded by water! To any thing respectable, big or honourable we add the Sanskrit word 'Sri'. The Asokan army when it landed at the island carried the Ramayana legend along and its tribal soldiers went along with the lashkar language - 'Sri Lanka' was thus born.<br><br>The text of the Ramayana was not written before 283 BC. The 'ring' as an ornament was unknown in jewellery on the sub-continent. This ornament features in Valmiki's epic poem.<br><br>The story is a rehash of Dashrath Jataka, a Buddhist text, which first surfaces in Pali language. The moral of this Jataka was that a king cannot hold personal emotions above state interests. The setting of the story is the Iron Age of human civilisation, or for us when the migrating Aryans were consolidating their suzerainty in North India. This is past Harappan age as the horse was not known in North India, though new finds suggest the animal remains have been discovered in South India recently and may have come from Arabia, though this is only a conjecture.<br><br>The Ramanad District has remained a dry-parched part of Tamil Nadu because for centuries it falls on the rain shadow of both Eastern and Western Ghats. This is not a 4,000 years old story. The general vegetation is semi-desert with palm at the coast. Ramayana talks of Saal or Teakwood in forest conditions. This in reality is impossible in historical time. The mere carbon dating of old beaches have no relevance to the Ramayana as the epic is embedded to North India and definitely North of present day Hyderabad.<br><br>There is no historical evidence to suggest the Aryan culture going to South India in Ancient India because Aryans built on riversides and South Indian rivers were all rain-fed and had no dedicated water supply. Thus we have ancient ports in South, and no inland city civilisation until the Sargam era when control of water was evolved.<br><br><strong>As a geological end to the sub-continent, the Adam's Bridge is explainable; let its geography be not entangled unnecessarily with myths. </strong><br><br>Sri Lankans in fact do not like this at all!</div>

The story gained currency when it was picked up, unquestioningly, by the PTI.<br><br>NASA said the mysterious bridge was nothing more than a 30 km long, naturally-occuring chain of sandbanks called Adam's bridge. Hess said his agency had been taking pictures of these shoals for years. Its images had never resulted in any scientific discovery in the area.<br><br>The Internet story further claimed "archaeological studies reveal that the first signs of human inhabitants in Sri Lanka date back toÂ…about 1.75 million years ago" as does the age of the bridge. This, in turn, matched the age when the events of the Ramayana took place.<br><br>Historian B.D. Chattopadhyay of Jawaharlal Nehru University says the archaeological record says nothing of the sort. There is no evidence of a human presence in the subcontinent, he says, before roughly 250,000 to 300,000 years ago. It is generally believed man's hominid ancestors did not leave their African home until about two million years ago.<br><br>At least three ship channels have been dug through Adam's Bridge without any evidence of manmade construction. The sandbanks are not at a greater depth, never being more than 3 or 4 feet at high tide. Geologists believe the sandbank did at one time rise above sealevel.<br><br>Temple records suggest it was submerged by a violent storm as recently as 1480.<br><br>Communication experts say that false, suspect news finds much greater circulation than normal because of the internet. NASA's Hess said, "The images reproduced on the websites may well be ours, but their interpretation is certainly not ours."<br></div>
