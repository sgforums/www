Finally he decided the animal was old, and the well needed to be covered up anyway; it just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey.<br>He invited all his neighbors to come cover up and help him. They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well. At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone's amazement, he quitened down. A few shovels loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well,<br>and was astonished at what he saw. With every shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up. As the farmer's neighbow continued to shovel dirt on top of the<br>animal, he would shake it off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and trotted off!<br><br>Lesson:<br>Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick<br>to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up.<br>Each of our troubles is a stepping stone. we can get out of the<br>deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up!<br>Shake it off and take a step up!<br></div></blockquote>Agree, mistakes are for us to learn, the real mistake is not learning from them too...</div>

What if the farmers decide to make a mountain of dirt beside the well first, then together all at once throw down, how is the donkey going to survive that?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
