            <div class='col-md body'>I should add that RMIT is a good uni, as far as BBBA is concerned I'm not too sure. On campus learning is definitely a big booster in terms of CV, there is a stigma (and it's true) that distant learning isn't half as effective or efficient. I'll say for sure that HR @ Big4 don't take too kindly to any distant learning courses, I have a friend who's from UQ on site finance and he landed a job as a team leader in portfolio mngment (big $$$); another friend of mine who was very insistent that distance or not employers couldn't tell, did a LSE course back home and is still unemployed as we speak, has been for past few months now.

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanx for the detailed advices supafatty...<br><br>Agreed largely with what u said... I think there is a significant diff b/w attending on-campus (be it local or oversea uni) and getting a degree via distance learning<br><br>Whilst some of my peers seemed to firmly believe that most employees can't tell the diff, i guess pursuing a degree is not only abt getting the cert. The quality of education if u attend a gd campus--- networking with frens, learning from good teachers is more essential.<br><br>And of course, getting the cert is only the 1st step... what happens beyond that depends on many other factors</div>

RMIT is an Aussie uni.. not from UK<br>Just for ur info.. RMIT = Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology<br>And.. RMIT was never a polytechnic.. it started as a college..and it's one of the leading unis in Aussie..<br>You can check their website out...<br><br>Anywayz about the payscale thingy.. issit true or did you just based it on your assumption that RMIT was a converted uni?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, about the MOE thing, we can assume that just because MOE doesnt recognise RMIT means the whole civil service wont.<br><br>maybe your friend did a degree not related to the job scope, thats why<br><br>I have many friends. doing external degrees at the SIM-OUC open university, who are actually TEACHERS. MOE actually accredits the SIM-OUC degree. and will consider placing teachers on div 1 scale if he/she is capable.<br><br>definately i would agree that overseas degrees will lose out to the GOVT degrees when it comes to employment in the civil service aka GOVT sector. it will be a mockery if the govt doesnt employ thier own breed of graduates.<br><br>for people like me, the private sector is the way to go. im not dissing the govt sector, both sectors have its good and bad points. i mean, we got to look on the bright side of life. already cannot get a place in local uni, so might as well try something else. work sincerely and dedicately. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
