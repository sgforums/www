It isnt fair to apply 'expectation too high' on them coz the fact is they r degree holders, morever gals. Surely you wont expect a gal to choose a guy whose calibre is lower than hers' rite? And if they are to look for guys who are degree holders as well, being more outstanding in grades may scare the guys away. Sometimes, they also meet into guys who dun like confident women who reason well. Guys juz want someone simple...or a bimbo (im sorry to say so <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> ) So they r left with guys are really <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">outstanding</span> </span>than them but gosh....they've <span style="color: blue;">ALL BEEN TAKEN</span>! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
