In fact, her declines were the deciding factor for that current kingdom or sultanate to freefall from grace.<br><br>So in a way, history shows us that Singapore's decline does greatly impact on her neighbours and backers.<br><br>However, interesting thing is that the Chinese have been poking around here for the last 500 years.<br><br>2019?

Temasek is the old name for SG meaning Fishing Port or Village.<br><br>The story of Sang Nila Utama was that he saw a lion remember? Lion = Singa, thus the name is from him.
