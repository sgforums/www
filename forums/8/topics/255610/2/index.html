            <div class='col-md body'>Famous author Paul Theroux was a E.Lit lecturer at NUS in the 1970s. He was fired because he was too much of a dissenter and his contract was never renewed.<br><br>Upon leaving NUS(then University of Singapore), he continued to write and slowly became a famous writer. He happened to write Saint Jack while in Singapore and that movie was made, with the funding of Playboy founder Hugh Hefner, and the director, Peter Bogdanovich was inspired by Orson Welles, the man who directed Citzen Kane. Orson Welles was supposed to have directed Saint Jack, but he and Bogdanovich had a disagreement, and pressure from Peter's girlfriend, Cybill Shepherd, ensured Peter directed it eventually.<br><br>Peter Bogdanovich's Director of Photography for Saint Jack was Robby Mueller, who later had an apprentice, Martina Radwan, who became the Director of Photography for Singapore Dreaming.<br><br>Saint Jack was banned for showing Singapore in a bad light then, of it's representations of gambling, prostitutions and Singapore as a R&amp;R stop for American sailors coming home from Vietnam. It opened in New York to decent reviews.<br><br>Quentin Tarantino bought the rights of distribution a few years back, and he was quoted as saying that he was inspired by this film when he was a young and fresh director.<br><br>The film crew for Saint Jack stayed at the Goodwood Park Hotel, where a young teenage boy used to follow them around the place during shoots, being that it was his family's hotel.<br><br>That boy's name is Eric Khoo.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I remember as a little boy there was no such place called Marine Parade or a Goh Chok Tong but a beach at Fort Road just outside the Duke Hotel.Also some places you could swim and pick up star fishes along the beaches like at pasir panjang when seafood 88 wasnt built or Labrador when it was not opened to public  you have to climb down the hill.Then there is a place called Jalan Mata Ikan.....maybe situated in Tampines.In those days you could scoop up sea horses and marine creatures with your plastic bags</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is a very common misconception that the big guns in Singapore didn't fire at the Japs during WWII because they couldnt turn. The truth is, they could change direction. In fact they did lob a few shells at the Japs. The main issue was that those guns were built in anticipation of firing at armoured warships, the shells supplied were mostly armour piercing shells. To give an effective defense of Singapore, you needed high explosive shells to fire at infantry concentrations. Of course, these HE shells were of limited quantity.</div>
