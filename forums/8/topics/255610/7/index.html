In 1897, the court ruled that no one could rightfully claim to be the successor of the Sultan and that the estate belonged to the Crown. (The estate became state land when Singapore gained independence.)<br><br>In 1904, the Sultan Hussein Ordinance was enacted to provide the descendants of Sultan Hussein with income derived from the Kampong Glam estate. The amount was capped at S$250,000 in 1991, revised by the government in 1999. Under the new scheme, the beneficiaries could opt either for a share of S$350,000 a year for 30 years or for a lump sum payment.<br></div>

The Temenggong was given Telok Blangah. As to why they shift:<br><br><a href="http://www.telokblangah.sg/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=29" rel="nofollow">http://www.telokblangah.sg/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=29</a><br><br><blockquote>It is said that shortly after Sir Stamford Raffles founded Singapore in 1819, he discovered the presence of two warring factions in the island. One was held by the Sultan while the others looked up to the Tengku Temenggong. As a result, there were frequent outbreaks of violence between the two groups - with the aggressors being the followers of the Temenggong.<br><br>As a result, Raffles considered it too dangerous for the Settlement to have the Temenggong living in it. Consequently, Raffles asked the Temenggong to move to a further place with his followeres and promised to provide the expenses for shifting, including some compensation.</blockquote>What many students do not know is how the Temenggong was related to the brothers (Hussein and Abdul Rahman). It gets more confusing because both the Temenggong and younger brother were called .. Abdul Rahman!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Apparently the Temenggong was a cousin of Abdul Rahman! I found this on EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica (<a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-52640/Singapore#509681.hook" rel="nofollow">http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-52640/Singapore#509681.hook</a>):<br><br><blockquote>The temenggong, however, was a subordinate of his cousin Abdul Rahman, sultan of Riau-Johor, who was under Dutch surveillance. </blockquote>So the temenggong was also a cousin of the older Hussein?<br><br>Cousin or not, the temenggong was the one who wielded real power in Singapore. And Johor as well. Most students are ignorant of the latter point:<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johor" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johor</a><br><br><blockquote>In 1819, the Johor-Riau Empire was broken into the mainland Johor, controlled by the Temenggong, and the Sultanate of Riau-Lingga, controlled by the Bugis. This is when the history of modern Johor began. In 1855, under the terms of a treaty between the British in Singapore and Sultan Ali of Johor, the control over the State was formally ceded to Dato' Temenggong Daing Ibrahim, with the exception of the Kesang area (Muar), which was finally handed over in 1877. Temenggong Ibrahim opened up Bandar Tanjung Puteri (later to become Johor's present-day capital) in south Johor as a major town.<br><br>Temenggong Ibrahim was succeeded by his son, Dato' Temenggong Abu Bakar, who later took the title Seri Maharaja Johor. In 1866, he was formally crowned the Sultan of Johor. Sultan Abu Bakar of Johor (1864 - 1895) was the one who gave Johor its own constitution and developed its efficient administration system and constructed the Istana Besar, the official residence of the Sultan. Due to these achievements, Sultan Abu Bakar is known by the title "Father of Modern Johor". </blockquote>As we can see, there was an official power transfer to the descendants of Temenggong Abdul Rahman. Today, the Johor Sultan traces his lineage to the Temenggong.<br><br>PS: The Royal Mausoleum at Telok Blangah belongs to Malaysia while the Istana Kampong Glam belongs to Singapore.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
