The malay language is a mixture of many languages including chinese (hokkien), hindi and sanskirt.<br><br>Guru is actually a hindi word, but you know why malay bomohs are usually referred to as Tok Guru something something? Its bcos of their link to the indian cultures last time.<br><br>In fact, some researcher even made the theory that only 4 malay words in the malay language are purely malay, Besi = Iron, padi -  rice, nasi - rice, api - fire.<br><br>This is all i can remember. Google it and maybe you can know more.</div></blockquote>Yea remember the story of the indian gladiator who see who can throw the stone furthest? its a folk lore but shows the presence of indians long before Raffles... then again its Raffles that founded MORDERN Singapore.<br><br>In fact more than indians... Zheng He came here too... Chinese Indian and even arabs are a frequences in this region... And not to mention, the dutch who ruled Malayan and Indonesian long before the Brits. They are here to plant opium and tea. Monopolising tea trade.<br><br>But it was Malacca than Singapore who was then the powerful port.</div>
