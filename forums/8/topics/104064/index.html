            <div class='col-md body'>It's about two weeks now since Huang Na made her final journey. Here's something to read.....for those who want to know a little bit more about her.<br><br>And if you want to....you can go to http://sg.netor.com and send her some well wishes.<br><br>_____________________________________________________________<br><br>An acticle had put it recently: "Neglected in life, Sought by thousands in death."<br><br>Sadly, Madam Huang never knew what she had left behind when she took the flight to China in September, leaving her daughter here, alone.<br><br>After the body was found, strangers have since told Madam Huang and her husband how their little girl had touched their hearts - her adorable face, infectious smile and spirited personality which showed in her photographs.<br><br>Huang Na's tragic has, once again, proved to us that there are really monsters living among us.<br><br>A world seen through the eyes of a little girl - one that is pure and simple. She would never had the chance to know the real world.<br><br>She's gone forever. But she has left behind many stories and footprints....<br><br>..... the day when she wanted to celebrate her birthday, she took a bus to Clementi central and bought herself a birthday cake. And later she treated her friends to her cake. And many times she would cook dinner by herself for her neighbours.<br><br>..... and how Madam Huang, when she stopped at West Coast Market during Huang Na final farewell journey, lifted her head for one last look at a playground where her daughter used to love playing on the swings.<br><br>..... and the girl would also pester her mother to give a dollar or two to the beggars she saw on the streets.<br><br>..... when an auntie told us how little Huang Na would come to her shop everyday after school to look for her, but was courteous and never asked for any sweets from her shop.<br><br>..... and the Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre's auction hall had become her favourite playground - her little world. It is a dangerous place in which to play. But, for about six months, she was happiest there.<br><br>..... and one teacher from her Jin Tai Primary School said he had to wear sunglasses to school to hide his tears. He told a reporter she would never fail to greet him and say hello.<br><br>Perhaps the new paper had put it appropriately:<br><br>"In life, little Huang Na brought joy to everyone around her.<br><br>And she'll continue to bring a smile to others, even in death."<br><br>(Her parents have decided to give all the toys and goodies she had received to children from poor families.)<br><br>Have a nice journey, you brave little one.<br></div>
