            <div class='col-md body'>The motivation to serve within the SAF has always been a problem. IÂ’ve noticed that our NSF soldiers commonly project an ignorant, arrogant and apathetic attitude which is contagiousÂ… I guess thatÂ’s probably their way of showing their resentment towards serving their country against their will under appalling conditions. I can only hope more is being done to instill motivation by addressing the many issues and concerns these young men have towards the long duration of national service &amp; its rationality during this era for a start.<br><br>As our country strives to progress &amp; meet the challenges of rapid globalisation, the SAF cannot afford to remain oblivious to these problemsÂ… which is consuming the very life of its most important resourceÂ… the people who serve within it.<br><br>NS from my opinion is a costly waste of time.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The best idea.... since you're going to be stuck in there for the next two years, might as well make the most out of it.<br><br>Just as everyone else here has been saying: don't complain so much. It's not just you. All other guys have to go through NS as well. If you're an A Level student, I know how it feels to see your female counterparts going on with their lives while you're stuck in where-the-heck-am-I with mud on your face and flies buzzing around you.<br><br>It stinks when you've heard of female friends getting engaged and graduating from overseas universities (with honours) when you've just ORD-ed and is about to enter uni. It really stinks, but there's nothing you can do about it, so might as well just suck it up and make the most out of it.<br><br>The first few days will be really tough psychologically..... Far away from your family and friends, and the only people you know are those people you have been arbitrarily lumped together with you in your bunk. I distinctly remember hearing a couple of my bunkmates crying themselves to sleep the first night. I didn't cry myself to sleep..... but all those thoughts of home and my loved ones gave me insomnia for a few days.<br><br>Be strong, be firm, and have a really open mind.... and trust me, you'll be just fine.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
