The reasons for different denominations goes beyond those that you have mentioned.  Interperation, practices, culture, geography are also contirbutors for different denominations.  What you might see on TV or in your history textbooks is not always accurate and have left out many things.<br><br>Why can't the Pope suffer from a diease?  He's not super human, he's a mere mortal like the rest of us.  The man is not the first pope in the world.  Many other popes have lived and died.  The only perfect person to even walk on this planet was Jesus and he suffered and died on the cross.  For a purpose, of course.</div>

Kang preached nearly everyweek (i have been there a few weeks before) that it is ok to be rich. God wants christians to be rich. So by being rich themselves, the pastors are fulfilling God's will. And thus nothing wrong!</div></blockquote>Being rich is not a sin.  There's nothing wrong.  I think people take God's desire to bless us a little too far sometimes.  He wants the best for us and not necessarily in wealth and material things.  God says He will provide for us what we <strong>need</strong> but not always what we desire.  The riches that He provides may or may not include money, or a big car and house.  Going out of your way to be rich is not fulfilling God's will and thinking that the only way God blesses you is to a 7 figure salary is wrong.  There are people out there who make much less and consider themselves just as blessed (by God) if not more than a 'rich' person.</div>

You have to look at the whole context.  If you take it word for word, that means a rich man will never enter heaven which is not true.<br><br>If you read the verses before that you'll understand it better.  A rich man's son came to Jesus and ask how he can become his disciple.  Jesus told him to give away all his money and inheritance to the poor and needy.  Then he used that verse.<br><br>Here's my interpretation:  What Jesus is basically saying is that you can't truly be a true disciple or follower of God if you have things that you hold more dearly, imprtant then God.  It isn't neccessarily money, it could be anything, your career, job, even your spouse, family and child.  Another verse says there can be only one master, money or God.  You can't be a servant to both.<br>The story ends with the richman's son walking away sad because he knew he couldn't give up all that he had to follow Jesus.<br><br>Better understanding of that verse?  So yes, a rich man can enter heaven, just as long as his love of God is stronger than his love of money or any of his possessions and even himself.  Not something that can measured, is it?</div>

See what's actually told to the congergation.  I am pretty much against any church that <span style="font-style: italic;">forces</span> its members to give, any amount.  Jesus said that you must give back to God and he <span style="text-decoration: underline;">suggested</span> 10% of ur income.  But the only thing that matters is how much you give with your heart?  It goes back to my post above about holding on too dearly to your possessions.  God does not care how much you give as long you're giving with 100% of your heart.<br><br>That being said, churches still need money to operate and it's only logical that church goers come out with that money.  For pastors and church workers, it's not about a 5 day week and how much they're making.  Their job is potentially a 24/7 and 365 day job because what they do is not about making profits or money instead, they're impacting and getting involved with people's lives.  The pastor at my home church, his job (among other things) is to go around visiting people who are in a bit of a jam or what have you and to pray for them and spread God's word.  What he is not involved with is checking the 'bottomline' of the churches finances.  That is usually the job of the committee (made up of church goers) who looks after that part of the church.<br><br>Side tracking---<br>Interestingly, I saw a couple of  Buddhist monks buying electronics at Sim Lim square (?).

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>I have mentioned it above. Kang preached nearly everyweek (i have been there a few weeks before) that it is ok to be rich. God wants christians to be rich. So by being rich themselves, the pastors are fulfilling God's will. And thus nothing wrong!</blockquote>Where the hell does the bible says tat god want christian to be rich ? I am pretty sure not all christians r rich, and some of them r actually struggling to pay their bills or surviving. I thought jesus promote people to give away their wealth to the poorer people, not keep them to show them they r rich ? If christianity promise wealth to their believers, wat is the difference between u and the people praying for 4 digit to buy for 4D ?<br><br><blockquote>I believe the title used for a Roman catholic priest is Father, not pastor.<br>Anyways, I'd give the pastor the benefit of the doubt. If they are really misusing the name of God to gather wealth for selfish reasons then God himself will deal with them. Accusing someone of something without any proof just as bad. </blockquote>If u give the pastor the benefit of the doubt, then cases like the recent catholic father who embezzled a few million dollars will never surface. I thought the evidence has already surfaced ? They buy a million dollars condo and a few cars with a 5K sofa. Aren't these already evidences tat point to the fact tat they r richer to the point of being too luxurious ?<br><br>God will deal with them ? Wat if there r no god ?<br><br><blockquote>I am a Christian and I can tell you stright up that Christians are not perfect people. We have as much flaws as the next guy afterall we are human beings. We have the same problems and make the same mistakes as any of you out there. I think all Christians acknowledge that. </blockquote>SO u mean it is perfectly normal to cheat some money from the church then ?<br><br><blockquote><br>Nobody knows..<br><br>If you don't know then why are you judging somebody? And you can't pretend to be holy. No one chooses to be holy or not to be holy.</blockquote>It is probably meant to be sarcastic. U can't pretend to be holy ?? I can see christian who is "holy", muslim who is "holy" and hindu to be "holy". But surely they all can't be holy together since only one religion can be true. "Acting holy" is very simple<br><br><blockquote>For ur info, their families are well-to-do people.<br>All money donated wil go into their church. </blockquote>If they r well to do, they should donate more of their money. The money go to the church can go to the staff.<br><br><blockquote>You can't take one verse and take it as it is. You have to look at the whole context. If you take it word for word, that means a rich man will never enter heaven which is not true.<br><br>If you read the verses before that you'll understand it better. A rich man's son came to Jesus and ask how he can become his disciple. Jesus told him to give away all his money and inheritance to the poor and needy. Then he used that verse.<br><br>Here's my interpretation: What Jesus is basically saying is that you can't truly be a true disciple or follower of God if you have things that you hold more dearly, imprtant then God. It isn't neccessarily money, it could be anything, your career, job, even your spouse, family and child. Another verse says there can be only one master, money or God. You can't be a servant to both.<br>The story ends with the richman's son walking away sad because he knew he couldn't give up all that he had to follow Jesus.<br><br>Better understanding of that verse? So yes, a rich man can enter heaven, just as long as his love of God is stronger than his love of money or any of his possessions and even himself. Not something that can measured, is it? </blockquote><strong>16Now a man came up to Jesus and asked, Â“Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?Â”<br>17Â“Why do you ask me about what is good?Â” Jesus replied. Â“There is only One who is good. If you want to enter life, obey the commandments.Â”<br><br>18Â“Which ones?Â” the man inquired.<br><br>Jesus replied, Â“ Â‘Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, 19honor your father and mother,Â’[d] and Â‘love your neighbor as yourself.Â’[e]Â”<br><br>20Â“All these I have kept,Â” the young man said. Â“What do I still lack?Â”<br><br>21Jesus answered, Â“If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.Â”<br><br>22When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth.<br><br>23Then Jesus said to his disciples, Â“I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. 24Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.Â” </strong><br><br>Did he say tat a person who view money more heavily than god cannot go to heaven ? U r right, <span style="font-style: italic;">it is your own explanation</span> but to me, it appears to contradict original intention of the bible. Wat god want is for its believers to contribute their wealth to the poor and needy, aka treating these people as their neighbour and love them as much as they love "god". It appears to be pre-requisite for people to give away their wealth when they desire to become leaders in biblical organisation. Tat is why it is recommended by some cathlic to keep a vow of poverty. Keeping wealth is not a good sign of sharing and caring for the people, particularly the leader of such an organisation. Tat is why they face a great difficulty in going to heaven<br><br><blockquote>Well, you must go to a church and hang there for a few months. See what's actually told to the congergation. I am pretty much against any church that forces its members to give, any amount. Jesus said that you must give back to God and he suggested 10% of ur income. But the only thing that matters is how much you give with your heart? It goes back to my post above about holding on too dearly to your possessions. God does not care how much you give as long you're giving with 100% of your heart. </blockquote>Where is the phrase tat suggest giving 10% of your income to the church from jesus's mouth ? If they don't care how much u give to the church, then don't ask for money every single week<br><br><blockquote>That being said, churches still need money to operate and it's only logical that church goers come out with that money.

He do a lot of tasks bla bla bla, but then he should do it selflessly and not expect to get a pay raise for these acts.<br><br><blockquote>Side tracking---<br>Interestingly, I saw a couple of Buddhist monks buying electronics at Sim Lim square (?). I thought they were not allowed to own anything expect for the clothes on their back. Not flamming anyone but thought it was weird.</blockquote>Thier number one rule is not to follow wat the scripture strictly says but to follow wat u think is right. I thought monks for the past few thousands years lived in temple and chiming bells praying to statues, and tat isn't the clothes on their back isn't it ? U think I thought who confirm ?</div>
