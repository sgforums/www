            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys, could you rate my short draft of a novel's im gonna write<br><br>I know it isnt good, just edited it<br><br>I need to get ppl opinion of it..<br><br>The Beginning Of the End? (Chapter 1)<br><br>Taking a last look at his family, he felt a sense of regret.Private Bill Curtiss had never experienced this worry before.He felt a pang of utter fear and hopelessness.He was serving in the Air Force in Baghdad as a pilot.As the last call for Flight 453 ended, he tore his gaze away from his lovely wife,Marsha and his wonderful daughter Kristinne.<br><br>He proceeded to the gate and soon disappeared around the corridor.As the Boeing 747 taxied down the runway, Marsha and Kristinne whispered an almost inaudible prayer for Bill.<br><br>In the aircraft,where the jet engines shuddered and groaned as the pilot cruised down to the taxiway of the Texas airport.With a feriocious roar,the throttle on full revolution, the aircraft roared towards the runway.Like a graceful eagle, the aircraft lifted into the air and soon disappeared from view.<br><br>High above the skies,Private Bill started on his steaming hot lunch and glanced over to other servicemen who were taking part in the war against MEC.<br><br>It was well into midnight when the plane touched down in Oman,Pakistan.With a shudder, the plane groaned as the brakes were applied harshly.As the aircraft taxied to a stop, 4 , almost invisible people were waiting impatiently<br><br>The person in the middle of the four, lined up in a linear position held a loudspeaker and barked menancingly"All Pilots to the bunk please!".He motioned towards a small ,yet cosy building.<br><br>Pilot Examination.(Chapter 2)<br><br>Sunrise.<br><br>The Commander was designating servicemen towards their respective platoons.Private Bill was immediatly cleared to join Alpha platoon and rushed into the crowd of Alphas without further ado.<br><br>Later that day, the sun was high up and looking gallently towards the yellow earth.<br><br>The Commander hastened the Alphas into attention.Bill Curtiss was assigned to a F-15 Eagle, which was quick and agile when it came to a dogfight.Equipped with laser digital warning system and AGM missiles,it was a deadly machine.He teamed up with Flight Instructor Ross Wingley and shook hands.Without a word,they both climbed into the cockpit and so began the first day in Pakistan.<br><br>At the end of a long and eventful day of bomber training, Bill hastened into his bunk.He shook hands and acknowledged his neighbour Private Jim Weiss, who was assigned to a F-14 Tomcat.<br><br>Lurching off into an eventful sleep,he tossed and turned,with loud cackling, planes being shot down being replayed over in his dream.<br><br>Regeneration. (Chapter 3)<br><br>As months flew by without incident,Bill was now a corporal.He knew how to operate the aircraft and soon , became an experienced pilot.<br><br>He was lurching off into sleep... Loud Cackling filled his dreams yet again......<br><br>An Air Raid siren sounded impassively.A night raid was materializing and the radar had picked off 15 airplanes swooshing overhead .Patriot missiles were deployed and pilots were hastened towards their planes.<br><br>Bill jumped into the cockpit and switched on the engine.His Co-Pilot, Ross Wingely mounted into the plane, switched on the AGM missile system.With a loud roar, the Eagle screamed down the runway and took off into the night<br><br>"Alpha-34,Confirm position and status."A voice materailsed over the intercom .<br><br>"Yeah, i hear you buddy".."Loud and clear".Position 56 Km away from Base Gerring"!.Turning to Ross, he gave a thumbs-up and started for the clouds.<br><br>Suddenly, it seemed that the night sky was exploding with MEC airplanes.The Eagle sidebanked, dodged a MEC plane.He decided to engage a MiG-29 which was concentrating on attacking the airfield.Bill flicked the missile fail safe system from neutral to Active.Locking his target, he pressed on the trigger.A loud swooshing sound followed by a stream of red light issued from the lethal, fired AGM now bent on engaging its target .Bill and Ross waited with bated breath<br><br>It hit home with a loud explosion.Cheering, Bill started for the skies, rejoining his comrades in battle.<br><br>When the threat was finally removed, Bill landed and reported to Ground Control and the Commander that he had shot down 4 planes .Without a moment, he dashed straight into his bunk and fell asleep almost as soon as his head touched the pillow.<br><br>Will edit and put in more, just completed it.<br><br>Thanks</div>
