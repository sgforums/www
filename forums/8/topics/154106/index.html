Now, he is suing a Member of Parliament, alleging defamation.<br><br>Mr Andrew Kuan may have failed in his bid for the presidency, but he won't be out of the limelight anytime soon.<br><br>The events surrounding his attempt to get a Certificate of Eligibility in the recent presidential election have spawned two lawsuits.<br><br>The first one was filed by criminal lawyer Chia Boon Teck who claimed that Mr Kuan had defamed him in remarks made to the press soon after the latter announced his bid for the presidency. (See report below.)<br><br>Now, Mr Kuan has filed a defamation lawsuit in the High Court.<br><br>He is suing Member of Parliament for Ang Mo Kio GRC Inderjit Singh for allegedly defaming him in a statement made about his employment record.<br><br>The MP was the president and managing director of United Test &amp; Assembly Centre Singapore (Utac) - a semiconductor company, and Mr Kuan was a consultant.<br><br>STATEMENTS<br><br>Mr Inderjit Singh's remarks were made a day after JTC Corporation and Hyflux went to the press about Mr Kuan's employment record with them.<br><br>Mr Kuan, who is not represented, filed the Writ of Summons and Statement of Claim in court on 13 Sep.<br><br>Three days' later, Mr Inderjit Singh, through his lawyers, Senior Counsel Davinder Singh and Mr Adrian Tan from Drew and Napier, made known his intention to defend the lawsuit.<br><br>According to the statement of claim filed by Mr Kuan, he was hired as a consultant/adviser to Utac, reporting to Mr Inderjit Singh, under a part-time contract.<br><br>In the statement, he took objection to remarks made by the latter, which were published in a newspaper. Mr Inderjit Singh had made some comments relating to Mr Kuan's work performance and employment record.<br><br>As the comments are now the subject of a lawsuit, they cannot be reproduced in this report.<br><br>Mr Kuan alleged that Mr Inderjit Singh's remarks were meant to be understood in this way: that he, Mr Kuan, was not competent and was, therefore, summarily fired from his position.<br><br>He alleged that the 'sting' of the defamation lay in the fact that the statements were made at the time when he had applied for the Certificate of Eligibility.<br><br>He alleged the statements made by Mr Inderjit Singh, who occupies a position of trust and responsibility in the Government, would have been taken seriously by a right-thinking member of public.<br><br>As such, Mr Kuan claimed, they would have 'influenced the public to be unduly and unjustifiably prejudiced against' him.<br><br>NO COMMENT<br><br>He seeks aggravated damages from Mr Inderjit Singh, as well as compensation to cover all his expenses in pursuing this lawsuit.<br><br>From court records, it appears that Mr Kuan had filed the papers in person, which means he is not represented by a lawyer.<br><br>When contacted, Mr Inderjit Singh, who was overseas at that time, said he had no comment on this case.<br><br>Lawyer's suit against Kuan<br><br>LAWYER Chia Boon Teck's case against Mr Andrew Kuan is linked to events at the condominium where they both live.<br><br>Mr Kuan was commenting on a report that he had been ousted as chairman of its management council. In doing so, he allegedly defamed Mr Chia.<br><br>Mr Chia and Mr Kuan live in The Tanamera, off New Upper Changi Road, and had served on the same condominium management council about five years ago.<br><br>In defending himself at a press briefing, Mr Kuan alleged that Mr Chia, a former vice-chairman of the council, had 'admitted to forging signatures'. He produced a police report of the alleged forgery, though the police had closed the case without prosecution.<br><br>About a week after the remarks were published, Mr Chia sued Mr Kuan for defamation. Mr Chia's statement claimed, among other things, that Mr Kuan had caused him 'anxiety, distress and embarrassment' and had 'damaged his character and reputation'.<br><br>Mr Chia wanted 'aggravated damages', an injunction to stop Mr Kuan from saying anything else defamatory of him, and legal costs. Mr Kuan has filed his defence to this suit, which is pending.<br><br></span>[/b]</blockquote></div>
