            <div class='col-md body'>found somewhere one..<br><br>Good day sir/mdm,<br><br>I will like to highlight a fact - no company will be a winner if customer is loser.<br><br>1- I have sent my mobile phone to your service centre for repair. Not only they didnÂ’t solve the problem, they created a new one for me. However they cannot rectify for me, as my warranty expire just days.<br><br>2- Upon receiving and detecting the defects, I have expressed my concern to your management in the service centre. I am certainly not a person who judge, but they did not treat me like a customer.<br><br>3- I am not aware of your quality control, nor am I interested in your condition of parts storage. But it does not make any logical sense that parts can be spoilt within days. This is what your service manager told me. Parts which are replaced in days earlier, and it got defects are no longer their problems.<br><br>4- My question, I not sure if that is your true service centre or is it a out-source supplier of yours. And did they change a Good parts for me, or simply swap a NG(no-good) parts on my mobile and claim to Samsung. It is pretty fishy here.<br><br>5- They insist on upgrading my firmware for me. As far as I am concern, firmware upgrade is only advisable when customer encounter software issue. Here I am down with hardware problem; they try to delay my servicing by offering an upgrade on firmware.<br><br>6- I had feedback through service centre and also samsungmobile.com but disappointed none get back to me. I hope you can treat your customer complaint seriously.<br><br>Hereby I've attach a email attachment of which i have sent to your contact through Samsungmobile.com.sg<br><br>Regards<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This one at least can make it..<br><br>Dear Cretins,<br><br>I have been an NTL customer since 9th July 2001, when I signed up for your 3-in-one deal for cable TV, cable modem, and telephone. During this three-month period I have encountered inadequacy of service which I had not previously considered possible, as well as ignorance and stupidity of monolithic proportions. Please allow me to provide specific details, so that you can either pursue your professional prerogative, and seek to rectify these difficulties - or more likely (I suspect) so that you can have some entertaining reading material as you while away the working day smoking B&amp;H and drinking vendor-coffee on the bog in your office:<br><br>My initial installation was cancelled without warning, resulting in my spending an entire Saturday sitting on my fat arse waiting for your technician to arrive. When he did not arrive, I spent a further 57 minutes listening to your infuriating hold music, and the even more annoying Scottish robot woman telling me to look at your helpful website....HOW?<br><br>I alleviated the boredom by playing with my testicles for a few minutes - an activity at which you are no-doubt both familiar and highly adept. The rescheduled installation then took place some two weeks later, although the technician did forget to bring a number of vital tools - such as a drill-bit, and his cerebrum. Two weeks later, my cable modem had still not arrived. After 15 telephone calls over 4 weeks my modem arrived... six weeks after I had requested it, and begun to pay for it.<br><br>I estimate your internet server's downtime is roughly 35%... hours between about 6pm -midnight, Mon-Fri, and most of the weekend. I am still waiting for my telephone connection. I have made 9 calls on my mobile to your no-help line, and have been unhelpfully transferred to a variety of disinterested individuals, who are it seems also highly skilled bollock jugglers.<br><br>I have been informed that a telephone line is available (and someone<br>will call me back); that no telephone line is available (and someone will call me back); that I will be transferred to someone who knows whether or not a telephone line is available (and then been cut off); that I will be transferred to someone (and then been redirected to an answer machine informing me that your office is closed); that I will be transferred to someone and then been redirected to the irritating Scottish robot woman...and several other variations on this theme.<br><br>Doubtless you are no longer reading this letter, as you have at least a thousand other dissatisfied customers to ignore, and also another one of those crucially important testicle-moments to attend to. Frankly I don't care, it's far more satisfying as a customer to voice my frustrations in print than to shout them at your unending hold music. Forgive me, therefore, if I continue.<br><br>I thought BT were sh*t, that they had attained the holy piss-pot of god-awful customer relations, that no-one, anywhere, ever, could be more disinterested, less helpful or more obstructive to delivering service to their customers. That's why I chose NTL, and because, well, there isn't anyone else is there? How surprised I therefore was, when I discovered to my considerable dissatisfaction and disappointment what a useless shower of bastards you truly are. You are sputum-filled pieces of distended rectum incompetents of the highest order.<br><br>British Telecom - w**kers though they are - shine like brilliant beacons of success, in the filthy puss-filled mire of your seemingly limitless inadequacy. Suffice to say that I have now given up on my futile and foolhardy quest to receive any kind of service from you. I suggest that you cease any potential future attempts to extort payment from me for the services which you have so pointedly and catastrophically failed to deliver - any such activity will be greeted initially with hilarity and disbelief quickly be replaced by derision, and even perhaps bemused rage. I enclose two small deposits, selected with great care from my cats litter tray, as an expression of my utter and complete contempt for both you and your pointless company. I sincerely hope that they have not become desiccated during transit - they were satisfyingly moist at the time of posting, and I would feel considerable disappointment if you did not experience both their rich aroma and delicate texture. Consider them the very embodiment of my feelings towards NTL, and its worthless employees.<br><br>Have a nice day - may it be the last in you miserable short life, you irritatingly incompetent and infuriatingly unhelpful bunch of twats.<br></div>

Not only they didnÂ’t solve the problem, they created a new one for me. However they cannot rectify for me, as my warranty expire just days.<br><br>2- Upon receiving and detecting the defects, I have expressed my concern to your management in the service centre. I am certainly not a person who judge, but they did not treat me like a customer.<br><br>3- I am not aware of your quality control, nor am I interested in your condition of parts storage. But it does not make any logical sense that parts can be spoilt within days. This is what your service manager told me. Parts which are replaced in days earlier, and it got defects are no longer their problems.<br><br>4- My question, I not sure if that is your true service centre or is it a out-source supplier of yours. And did they change a Good parts for me, or simply swap a NG(no-good) parts on my mobile and claim to Samsung. It is pretty fishy here.<br><br>5- They insist on upgrading my firmware for me. As far as I am concern, firmware upgrade is only advisable when customer encounter software issue. Here I am down with hardware problem; they try to delay my servicing by offering an upgrade on firmware.<br><br>6- I had feedback through service centre and also samsungmobile.com but disappointed none get back to me. I hope you can treat your customer complaint seriously.<br><br>Hereby I've attach a email attachment of which i have sent to your contact through Samsungmobile.com.sg<br><br>Regards<br></div></blockquote>GODAWFUL ENGLISH!!!!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wtf, did you write tht?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by alexkusu:</div><div class="quote_body">This one at least can make it..<br><br>Dear Cretins,<br><br>I have been an NTL customer since 9th July 2001, when I signed up for your 3-in-one deal for cable TV, cable modem, and telephone. During this three-month period I have encountered inadequacy of service which I had not previously considered possible, as well as ignorance and stupidity of monolithic proportions. Please allow me to provide specific details, so that you can either pursue your professional prerogative, and seek to rectify these difficulties - or more likely (I suspect) so that you can have some entertaining reading material as you while away the working day smoking B&amp;H and drinking vendor-coffee on the bog in your office:<br><br>My initial installation was cancelled without warning, resulting in my spending an entire Saturday sitting on my fat arse waiting for your technician to arrive. When he did not arrive, I spent a further 57 minutes listening to your infuriating hold music, and the even more annoying Scottish robot woman telling me to look at your helpful website....HOW?<br><br>I alleviated the boredom by playing with my testicles for a few minutes - an activity at which you are no-doubt both familiar and highly adept. The rescheduled installation then took place some two weeks later, although the technician did forget to bring a number of vital tools - such as a drill-bit, and his cerebrum. Two weeks later, my cable modem had still not arrived. After 15 telephone calls over 4 weeks my modem arrived... six weeks after I had requested it, and begun to pay for it.<br><br>I estimate your internet server's downtime is roughly 35%... hours between about 6pm -midnight, Mon-Fri, and most of the weekend. I am still waiting for my telephone connection. I have made 9 calls on my mobile to your no-help line, and have been unhelpfully transferred to a variety of disinterested individuals, who are it seems also highly skilled bollock jugglers.<br><br>I have been informed that a telephone line is available (and someone<br>will call me back); that no telephone line is available (and someone will call me back); that I will be transferred to someone who knows whether or not a telephone line is available (and then been cut off); that I will be transferred to someone (and then been redirected to an answer machine informing me that your office is closed); that I will be transferred to someone and then been redirected to the irritating Scottish robot woman...and several other variations on this theme.<br><br>Doubtless you are no longer reading this letter, as you have at least a thousand other dissatisfied customers to ignore, and also another one of those crucially important testicle-moments to attend to. Frankly I don't care, it's far more satisfying as a customer to voice my frustrations in print than to shout them at your unending hold music. Forgive me, therefore, if I continue.<br><br>I thought BT were sh*t, that they had attained the holy piss-pot of god-awful customer relations, that no-one, anywhere, ever, could be more disinterested, less helpful or more obstructive to delivering service to their customers. That's why I chose NTL, and because, well, there isn't anyone else is there? How surprised I therefore was, when I discovered to my considerable dissatisfaction and disappointment what a useless shower of bastards you truly are. You are sputum-filled pieces of distended rectum incompetents of the highest order.<br><br>British Telecom - w**kers though they are - shine like brilliant beacons of success, in the filthy puss-filled mire of your seemingly limitless inadequacy. Suffice to say that I have now given up on my futile and foolhardy quest to receive any kind of service from you. I suggest that you cease any potential future attempts to extort payment from me for the services which you have so pointedly and catastrophically failed to deliver - any such activity will be greeted initially with hilarity and disbelief quickly be replaced by derision, and even perhaps bemused rage. I enclose two small deposits, selected with great care from my cats litter tray, as an expression of my utter and complete contempt for both you and your pointless company. I sincerely hope that they have not become desiccated during transit - they were satisfyingly moist at the time of posting, and I would feel considerable disappointment if you did not experience both their rich aroma and delicate texture. Consider them the very embodiment of my feelings towards NTL, and its worthless employees.<br><br>Have a nice day - may it be the last in you miserable short life, you irritatingly incompetent and infuriatingly unhelpful bunch of twats.<br></div></blockquote></div>
