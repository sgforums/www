I don't agree on what he tells me. I just listen with my left ear and come out with my right ear!

After that where got face to meet them liao??<br><br>To me, it was supposed to be a great treasured precious moments together I have in life that will kept in my heart forever by not telling others about it. So, whats the point actually by spilling it out after what u have satisfied?? Just to show out some egos?? Really like to know more about that...<br><br>Well, any comments to bring out??<br><br>Err..this is my first post topic...so, if anyone of you found that any of my grammers and vocabulary mistakes, plz correct me hor! u know lah..I'm not a very well educated person!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Make new friends but keep the old...<br>These are sliver, those are gold!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Girls can and should think twice, but they are entitled to decide to go for it rather than wait.<br><br>Kissing and telling, on the other hand, is another thing. I'll agree that if one of the couple does not like to talk about it, and the other person still goes to spread, then its a form of betrayal. Otherwise, I read that females talk about lot more than you think they do. Much much more than guys.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 18 March 2000).]</div>
