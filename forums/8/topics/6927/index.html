            <div class='col-md body'>Well,<br><br>When I saw this, I couldn't resist posting it up.<br><br>Dear Lex,<br><br>How have you been? Life for me still sucks as usual, just dropping you a note for updates.<br><br>Not too long ago, I met this guy through XXX. He's just so irresistably handsome and so charming.<br><br>I can't help liking him... too bad he is attached to XXX and he's too young for me. Initially I treated him as any other guy until that day...<br><br>I went to his house that morning and helped him with his assignment. Then he started to heap compliments on me and he hugged me.<br><br>I couldn't resist him, I got seduced in the end.<br><br>I thought that it's okay... nobody knows about this, even though XXX knew that I went to his house.<br><br>After that, every time I see him I will end up in bed with him. For what I know is that XXX does not get intimate with him, so he is feeling deprived in a way.<br><br>Since I like him so much, I didn't think anything of it. I enjoyed every moment I had with him and I didn't tell a soul.<br><br>It came too soon and ended too fast. One day, I went to his place and after our regular frolicking session, he hinted to me that he loves XXX more with each passing day. He wanted to stop seeing me.<br><br>I didn't feel anything at first, but when he sent me to his doorstep, I felt so used. Does he treat me as a sex toy for his carnal desires?<br><br>If he really was thinking that way, why did he tell me that after having sex? I really feel like telling XXX about her "fabulous" boyfriend. I really can't believe that I had fallen into a trap like this?<br><br>Do you think I should tell XXX about this?<br><br>I have been thinking about it over and over again. Should I make a big fuss out of this or should I keep quiet and forget about the whole damn thing?<br><br>Sigh...<br><br>Thanks for lending me your ear, hope to hear from you soon enough before I do anything rash.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>(Name withheld)<br><br>------------------<br>YesÂ¿ NoÂ¿ MaybeÂ¿</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The guy was blatantly using her. If she knew that the guy was not getting any intimacy with his gf, she should have guessed that he was using her... aiyoh... poor thing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> Or she should have told someone about it bcos pple who are not inviolved are usually more clear headed. They would have sounded the alarm for her. GUYS LIKE THIS GIVE US A BAD NAME!!!    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> Hiyah, but the gal also knew that he had a gf mah... so she is not innocent either.<br><br>I think that she should not make a fuss but just tell the truth to XXX. expect a fuss from her though and be prepared to lose a fren(XXX). she should have seen it coming all along the moment she got seduced anyway.<br><br>the truth hurts but sometimes, you gotta be honest about what you have done. if she is not honest, the consequences will come back to her somehow.<br><br>gan3 zuo4, gan3 jiang3!!!<br><br>------------------<br>Let him that move the world, first move himself.<br><br>[This message has been edited by sleek (edited 11 April 2000).]</div>

Now that the damage is done, another decision- that requires maturity- must be made.<br><br>That being said, it's sometimes hard to judge who is  right, and who is wrong. Especially when not all the facts are there. And it's hard to get all the facts from an e-mail that is one-sided.<br><br>------------------<br>Cya,<br>Praetor<br></div>
