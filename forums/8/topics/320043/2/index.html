              <p>it's cheap talk if you, a person who isn't affected by a decision, can't see why those who are affected, are angry, and talk as if you're affected as wel and don't see a problem with it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i mean, if you are a student there, and have paid the fees, and you don't feel it's a problem, it's not wrong you know, it just means that you're easy going, or rich, so it doesn't really matter.</p>
              <p>but you didn't pay the fees.. you just.. say it isn't a big deal, because you're not directly involved. it's like... (i guess you're working now), one day your company decide to make it compulsary for you guys to pay a certain amount of fees for lunch, and they serve really lousy food, that you rather eat at a foodcourt, but you still have to pay for the food they indented for you.</p>
