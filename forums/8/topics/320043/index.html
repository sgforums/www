              <div>STOMPer <strong>Miss Anonymous</strong> says she wonders why the Singapore Management of Institutue (SIM) has
              stopped providing free refreshments even though its high fees and an
              increase in student enrolment suggest more income.<br> <br> She said SIM although SIM charges expensive school fees, they had always provided reasonably quality refreshments.<br> <br> According to her, the refreshments refer to food, such as tarts, bread,
              cakes that were previously offered by SIM, as well as tea and coffee
              during in between breaks offered to both students and lecturers of any
              lecture hall.<br> <br> She said, "It has been, for many years, this way, providing
              refreshments so that students need not have to rush to the canteen
              (which during lunch time, is fully packed) to get their food, for just
              15mins."<br> <br> However, she said the school announced last month that the provision of
              refreshments would be stopped as "more students are coming to the
              institution and (the school) are unable to cope with the increase of
              students and providing them refreshments".<br> <br> The STOMPer said:<br> <br> "In this case, students assumed that more students means more cash
              inflows and meeting the increasing cash outflows, SIM should continue
              to provide refreshments.<br> <br> "The FAQ that SIM gave was found in the student portal, but kept
              emphasizing the alternatives. alternatives were "providing reasonably
              priced food at the pushcarts.<br> <br> "No adjustments were made and SIM management emphasized that it was provided free and they cannot cope.<br> <br> "More students, more fees, more income.<br> <br> "Students do not see the reason why SIM should stop providing refreshments.<br> <br> "However, they felt more that SIM wanted to use the money that they saved on, for a new campus."<br> <br> STOMP is contacting SIM for comment.</div>

              <p>yeah it isn't free. in a way, we paid for it already as part of the fees. the fees have already been set to cover certain costs, whether it's electicity bills, or refreshment etc..</p>
              <p>we didn't just pay for the lessons, we paid for the facilities, and they were suppose to justify if the things they do not justify the fees.</p>
              <p>example, if halfway through the lesson, they decided to cut off power, to save electricity bills, they can say "electricity is not an entitlement wat, it's a privilege" you can go study in the open area where there is sunlight" just as some of you are saying (coincidently, they don't pay the school fees nor study there)</p>

              <p>yeah, but there should be justification also?</p>
              <p>one day govt says "no more pay rise for private and public
              sector"? same logic wat.</p>
              <p>i'm not sure if raises are part of the entitlement of a job. but
              if it isn't, can you still shrug and give say that it's petty to be
              upset about it?</p>

              <p>if I paid school fees and the refreshments were part of the package, I'll be annoyed.</p>

              <p>It's just like those while stocks last terms. Just nice when u queued for 2 hours and the freebies are distributed finish.. :P</p>

              <p>yeah it isn't free. in a way, we paid for it already as part of the fees. the fees have already been set to cover certain costs, whether it's electicity bills, or refreshment etc..</p>
              <p>we didn't just pay for the lessons, we paid for the facilities, and they were suppose to justify if the things they do not justify the fees.</p>
              <p>example, if halfway through the lesson, they decided to cut off power, to save electricity bills, they can say "electricity is not an entitlement wat, it's a privilege" you can go study in the open area where there is sunlight" just as some of you are saying (coincidently, they don't pay the school fees nor study there)</p>

              <p>but the point is, the cost of the refreshment is logically covered by our fees, so if they cut off the refreshment, where is the money going to?</p>
              <p>i used this as an analogy to argue the fact that, the issue cannot be simply shrugged off and ignored and swept under the carpet just because it isn't labelled black and white on paper, as argued by some posters.</p>
