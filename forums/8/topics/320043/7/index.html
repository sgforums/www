              <p>haha my point isn't really whether it is arguable, or black and white or stuff, it's more of, the issue is impt to the ppl who are most affected by it..</p>
              <p>let me put forth another example.. say ninja vans in saf.. saf condones such practices and turns a blind eye to it, and let ppl going for range or stuff get abit of privilege, den one day saf suddenly restricts or totally ban and even arrest ninja van owners, den nobody come sell makan makan.. ppl going for range will kbkb, but other ppl will be saying no big deal..</p>
              <p>to girls and ppl who don't know: ninja vans = vans which arrive during range to sell food like chicken rice, can drinks, wanton mee, tidbits to ppl going to range.. dun worry, it's perfectly NOT granted permission and the food hygiene standard is highly questionable lol..</p>

              <p>if you say so. i'm sure that between your current job now (no leave, no health benefits) and another job which pays the same, but with these benefits, you'll stick to the same job right? after all, it makes more sense because you're going to have to waste effort to apply for the job etc.. and it doesn't matter to you anyway.</p>

              <p>lol that's a great way to protect your backside while making a bold sweeping statement. ok, fine. MOST of the students then are good for nothing retards who only care about their welfare, because apparently that's the unwritten rule of life set by glasswall.</p>
              <p>after all, not surprising ah, any tom, dick and harry also can get in.. so obviously MOST are just taking it for granted.</p>
              <p>sure.. maybe there are one or two students out there taking this as a 2nd chance to study. the epitome of hardworking students. they should be applauded for rushing to class after work, forgoing dinner, until class ends at 10pm. sure, the break would be a great respite against the hunger pangs, but hey, that's not important right? we're here to study, not to satisfy our comfort.</p>

              <p>First of all, not all tom, dick n harry can make it in, even if they make in it, it is a funnel system. They  may take in alot of students at once but only those few that really work hard make it alive and graduate. If you are so "qualified" and "great" prove it that you can come to SIM and study and get great results.</p>
              <p>Regarding the refreshment issues. It makes no biggie a deal. Seriously only certain schools in SIM get these freebies. Do you know that some students get refreshments and some who study full time dun get refreshments, you don't see them making a big hoo ha about it.... Plus as a matter of fact there are students paying a hell load more of school fees and they dun get the refreshments. So just calm down. suggestion would be to write the the admin and you can come up with ideas or suggestions to improve this matter.</p>

              <p>Sure, things might go a bit faster if the whole world knows. But then again, now the whole
