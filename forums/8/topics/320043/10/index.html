              <p>lol, right, hypocrite, one moment calling for objectivity, and the next reduce himself to name calling and mud slinging. =)</p>
              <p>i simply pointed out that it's easy for you to shrug off something as insignificant, when you're not affected by it. and that insensitive attitude isn't appreciated.</p>
              <p>i'm cool with fudgester, he made his point, without being condecending (which is accepted, as his pov, i didn't have to agree with it though). you? you're just mud slinging in the guise of objectivity la.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>actually it's the part-time students that might be affected the most (like myself), especially if the class starts at 7pm. After work, rush to school, no time for dinner. So it's kinda unfortunate that they have to stop with the refreshment thingy. The alternatives that they made don't really make sense though. Like extending the food court operating hours to 8/830pm. If you realise, by 730pm both food court will be quite empty coz classes will already started by then &gt;_&lt;. And the mobile food cart is only available at SIM Hq (and Ngee Ann blk 51 i think), but sometimes I have classes at Ngee Ann Blk 82. So I don't find that helpful as well. Guess can only rely on vending machines.</p>
              <p>Anyway bo-pian la as long as they don't increase the course fee, I'm fine with it.</p>
              <p>PS: The refreshments (esp the coffee/tea) are getting worst anyway. So not much loss.. IMO.</p>

              <p>is it? I don't remember that though, coz every sem, my fee seems to be the same. Except for when GST rise to 7%, so that 7% plus the fee = i agree there is an increase. But i know this year they increased the fee for new intakes.</p>

              <p>aiyah .. too much lah guys</p>
              <p>if look at commercial contract law</p>
              <p>The contractual term and condition is stated and by right and fact the school does not state in its condition to provide food/refreshment or any kinds. It is only a form of compliment. Therefore, if so happened that the school does not give that compliment again, they have the right not to do so.</p>
              <p>Since a consideration has been given fully by giving you what is stated as the condition of the contract, which in this case is to give you the education as what it has been said by fact and written, signed and responsbly known by both parties.</p>
              <p>As such, if you want to ask for their reason not to give compliments, they may answer, but you never have a right to ask for that. Although you have a reason for saying that the school fee is higher and they get more students, hence higher profit margin is attained, but it is up to them to allocate their money, so as long as what your right and what they responsibility as the condition in your contract is fulfilled, any complaints can be just ignored.</p>
              <p>Whatever reasons that you may say - either you want to say that you are the main stake holders but it does not mean that they have to act fully to your stake. The stakeholder has a common understanding and as it is implied and written, then it goes that the stakeholder and the school common understanding is understood and fulfilled by the fact that what it has written.</p>
              <p>therefore any other things are considered as compliments -</p>
