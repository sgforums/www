              <p>The school is a business, not a charitable foundation. Seriously
                              who is the one making the logical flaws here??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The school is NOT accountable to the students! They are
                              accountable only to the management and the shareholders. Please get
                              that fact right. You are merely the customer, you pay for a degree,
                              the school provides you with one. Please go read your CASE-approved
                              student contract, if it says anything about provision of
                              refreshments, please tell me, then YES they are accountable because
                              that was part of your contract with them.</p>

              <p>the school IS accountable to the students, because the students invested money in them.</p>
              <p>that's what a stakeholder is. anyone who has an invested interest in something, may it be the student, the workers there, or the management team.</p>
              <p>if there is no need for accountability, the school could just happily close down tomorrow without informing anyone the reason for doing so, isn't it?</p>
              <p>just like the other uni, UNSW? they had to abandon their plans to start a few courses here due to the lack of students. and they had to explain their decision to those who have successfully enrolled.</p>
              <p>if the school isn't accountable at all to students, they could just leave without explaining anything. which of course, is wrong.</p>

              <p>It's really surprising that after so long, that you still do not realise that SIM in the business of providing a degree, pure and simple, nothing more and nothing less. Maybe if you realise that you will not be so bothered about the refreshments issue. The school's main objective is to make money, and not to ensure that you have a good degree so that you have a good future ahead. It's a business, just like any other business such as Singtel, if one day they increase their talktime charges or sms charges, are they accountable to you, the consumer?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You knew right from the start that SIM's only concern is to fulfill that contract, and that is the provison of Tution (Point 1.8 Payment of Course Fees in your contract) for the purpose of obtaining the Course (Point 1.1 Name of Course) from the Institution (Point 1.5 Organisation Awarding/Conferring Qualifications). Providing refreshments is not an integral part of your degree, there was never a proper inclusion of refreshments in any form of binding agreement.</p>

              <p>Ok, let me explain myself with regards to this post (as well as the previous post)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The cost of the refreshments? Honestly, how expensive can mass produced confectionary bought in bulk be? I know that item by item, when you compare to bakeries and such, might be expensive, but have you ever bought items in bulk, or wholesale, and compare the markup between items bought factory/wholesale to retail? Expensive is very subjective, what I think is expensive might not be to you. But I AM right in saying that the refreshments are inexpensive, because I'm comparing the price of the brownie (as an example) bought by SIM as refreshments as compared to a similar brownie bought at a bakery outside, confirm will be cheaper one right? Logically correct, right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And the point about schools closing down all of a sudden without any notice.. All I can say is... Never hear before ah? lol.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And once again you bring in UNSW. UNSW is a University. They have their reputation to protect. SIM is NOT a University per se in that sense as compared to UNSW. If tomorrow SIM GE were to close down, I can safely tell you, they have NOTHING to lose because the degree is issued (in this case, not UNSW, but UOL/RMIT etc).</p>

              <p>the timetable schedules as 3 mths per sem, but i calculate here and there, minus all the spaces, each sem takes about 1 mth of lessons or so. so that's why i said 2 mths.</p>
              <p>anyway, i don' find it slack la, i don't know how it is in other uni, and i've got nothing to compare against, except mdis, which i find slacker lol.</p>

              <p>About the statement you quoted, you do know you're trying to tell me to prove something that is not written on the contract, that it is not written on the contract? You know how much sense that makes?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But your last point I concede, just because you don't have the right to know does not take away your right to WANT to know. Actually I also want to know, wtf right before I join they take away the refreshments. Zz. But I guess in that case I wont be affected because I never had the privilege to enjoy the refreshments at all. =(</p>

              <p>again, it's something we will only know if sim really close down (and i hope they don't, not for another year at least)'</p>
              <p>then you have to be careful about how to phrase your words. "cheaper" is not the same as "inexpensive" as you suggest by saying, "Come on, how expensive you think those mass produced
                                      refreshments are, that it takes up such a big percentage of your
                                      fees?"</p>
              <p>just because it is cheaper, doesn't mean it is not expensive. it is just it. cheaper than a more expensive pricing.</p>
              <p>therefore, a logic flaw, when you say it shouldn't be significant enough for me to be bothered with.</p>

              <p>About the statement you quoted, you do know you're trying to
              tell me to prove something that is not written on the contract,
              that it is not written on the contract? You know how much sense
              that makes?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But your last point I concede, just because you don't have the
              right to know does not take away your right to WANT to know.
              Actually I also want to know, wtf right before I join they take
              away the refreshments. Zz. But I guess in that case I wont be
              affected because I never had the privilege to enjoy the
              refreshments at all. =(</p>
