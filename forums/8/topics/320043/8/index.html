              <p>First of all, not all tom, dick n harry can make it in, even if
              they make in it, it is a funnel system. They  may take in alot
              of students at once but only those few that really work hard make
              it alive and graduate. If you are so "qualified" and "great" prove
              it that you can come to SIM and study and get great results.</p>
              <p>Regarding the refreshment issues. It makes no biggie a deal.
              Seriously only certain schools in SIM get these freebies. Do you
              know that some students get refreshments and some who study full
              time dun get refreshments, you don't see them making a big hoo
              ha about it.... Plus as a matter of fact there are students paying
              a hell load more of school fees and they dun get the refreshments.
              So just calm down. suggestion would be to write the the admin
              and you can come up with ideas or suggestions to improve this
              matter.</p>

              <p>well i'm glad that i'm not one of those "tom dick and harrys" who can just easily get in then. felt so lousy about myself</p>
              <p>hmm i think the differing cost in fees also depends on the university which they are getting their degrees from? like maybe business school degrees more expensive, engineering degree cheaper, etc? and so far.. i think every class has got some kind of refreshment ba. kinda like a sop until the revamped rules. i mean they don't put one station at every classroom la, maybe like the entire floor got 2 tea station or smth.</p>

              <p>shrugs, i said it somewhere out there. more of getting opinions la. but i didn't expect flippant remarks though, which really got to me because, they said it.. like it's no big deal, and coincidently all of them aren't affected.</p>
              <p>i'm not sure if you get why i was angry though. it's like.. now malaysians are angry about the price hike, and i go out there and tell them off telling them it's only a few cents more, what's the big deal? and i'm saying that, knowing that it doesn't really matter because i'm not affected either way, because i don't drive a car.</p>
              <p>if they said "no, i don't think it's a big deal", it's fine you know? but they didn't have to belittle the emotions and viewpoints  of the students who are affected. especially, because they didn't walk in our shoes.</p>

              <p>Perhaps, but even so, placing the article here does not help at all. It just helps to spread a rather bad image of SIM students.</p>
              <p>As 'flippant' as you may perceive some of the remarks to be, you have to admit that there is a grain of truth to them. As was pointed out, refreshments are a privilege and not a right, and so, it should never be treated as the latter.</p>
              <p>Privileges cannot (and should not) be dished out so freely and without question. Just as is the case with the Malaysians - they're so used to buying subsidized fuel that they treat it as a right.... and when they realize that it's actually a privilege that can be retracted, they make a huge amount of noise when it actually is retracted.</p>
              <p>And of course, we all look upon them with bemusement, for we never really had the privilege of subsidized fuel.</p>
              <p>The same logic goes here. People in other unis never (or hardly ever) did get this sort of privilege. Yours truly included. So of course every else would look at this with bemusement when some SIM student openly makes noise about the retracting of refreshments as though some sacred rights are being curtailed.....</p>

              <p>Uh.... no.</p>
              <p>Unless there is a line in your statement of fees specifically saying 'Costs for refreshments' or something to that effect, it is entirely within the prerogative of SIM to decide whether or not they wish to use part of your fees to provide refreshments.</p>
              <p>In the first place, you don't even know whether the cost of refreshments come from your fees. It may well come from SIM's other income sources, such as grants, trust funds, and such.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, if you want SIM to be more transparent with how they spend their money, then there are better ways to doing that, and posting on online forums would only invite unnecessary ridicule.</p>

              <p>and that's why, it's not wise to give flippant remarks when we don't take into consideration why they are feeling that way, when we don't suffer along with them. talk is cheap.</p>

              <p>End of the day, why u wanna complain SIM fees high? Honestly speaking, SIM is also more or less a private school. You have the choice to enrol with them. The price they already stated very clearly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sure u can compare with NUS/NTU/SMU, but end of the day, hey, if those schools are much better, then why did you not enrol there in first place? Because your results suck thats why LPPL go to SIM right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Not like SIM is the only place in Singapore u can get UOL external degree (for example), so I think seriously the fees issue is no fight because you happily pay and they happily accept. If you were so concerned about the fees in the first place, then why in the first place never study harder get better results go into other Unis?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Honestly speaking refreshment issue, like what the others say is only a privilege not a right. You go to SIM to study, and not to gorge on the refreshments. Not like the refreshment will make you get better results or what. SIM timetable already very slack, still can complain? Ever compare the timetable to the other unis?</p>

              <p>No, honestly speaking there is no problem with you wanting to know where the money for the refreshments goes to, but reasonably speaking, is it that much of an amount to warrant all that intense attention? Isn't there really nothing else better to do than wanting the administration to give you full accountability of their accounting expenditure? The refreshments issue was never officially part of the fees, there was no proper documentation; it was a goodwill gesture by the school to provide some form of student welfare.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The bottom line is, if the refreshments mean that much to you, arguing until your face turns blue on sgforums will not accomplish anything, neither does posting on stomp.</p>

              <p>There can be many reasons why they choose to stop it. Money is merely one of them, but you wholeheartedly assumed that it was the financial factor that led to the school cancelling the refreshments. You're not the one working behind the scenes conducting day to day operations of the school, the cost of the refreshments was YOUR conjecture and YOUR assumption fully. The school has yet to give their account for the cancellation of the refreshments (and like I said, they are not obligated to account for the withdrawal of a privilege). So who's the one making the logic flaw now?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I sincerely admit the very first post about the comparison of the other unis was my mistake - kind of like a LOL post. So yah, sorry if that offended you or anyone.</p>

              <p>then there's a logic flaw there.</p>

              <p>also, do you think it's alright for them to be keeping money that they didn't spend, if they were suppose to spend it? think about the NKF issue.</p>
              <p>yes, exactly, i didn't specifically say that, that's why i said, it'd be nice if you stop assuming what i'm talking about and actually read? i mean, if you want to have a nice constructive argument, is reading what the other person type too much to ask for?</p>

              <p>The NKF issue?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The school is a business, not a charitable foundation. Seriously who is the one making the logical flaws here??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The school is NOT accountable to the students! They are accountable only to the management and the shareholders. Please get that fact right. You are merely the customer, you pay for a degree, the school provides you with one. Please go read your CASE-approved student contract, if it says anything about provision of refreshments, please tell me, then YES they are accountable because that was part of your contract with them.</p>

              <p>that's why.. i wanted some sort of accountability to it? they can't be slowly cutting corners here and there just to pocket the spare change and there is no one to account for it. or the students who paid the fees, aren't told why they were cutting corners, and where is the money going to etc.</p>
              <p>it's just like the old argument about church collecting funds, but nobody knows where the fund is going to etc.</p>

              <p>There can be many reasons why they choose to stop it. Money is
              merely one of them, but you wholeheartedly assumed that it was the
              financial factor that led to the school cancelling the
              refreshments. You're not the one working behind the scenes
              conducting day to day operations of the school, the cost of the
              refreshments was YOUR conjecture and YOUR assumption fully. The
              school has yet to give their account for the cancellation of the
              refreshments (and like I said, they are not obligated to account
              for the withdrawal of a privilege). So who's the one making the
              logic flaw now?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I sincerely admit the very first post about the comparison
              of the other unis was my mistake - kind of like a LOL post. So yah,
              sorry if that offended you or anyone.</p>

              <p>definitely offended me, with good reasons too.. =)</p>
              <p>hmm, well, we'll know once SIM becomes transparent about it isn't it? which is why i want accountability (repeated again) about it.</p>
              <p>but i don't see how wrong i can be, to assume (unlike your statement about me comparing costs between unis) that financial factors were the reasons for the cancellation of the refreshments.</p>
              <p>like i said before. someone said that there is no free lunches in singapore, the costs had to be covered by someone. if it's not by us, it's by sim (it's an independant school, i believe?). if they were the ones covering the costs, then of course, it would make sense for them to cut corners, because it is a privilege, and it's entirely up to them, and it's only good business practice to have some sort of transparency between the school and the students.</p>
              <p>and logically, sim wouldn't be the one covering the cost all these while (which smart businessman would allow a potential liability to eat into their profits? in fact a smart business man would make the students pay for the refreshments, and maybe earn a proft of maybe 2 cents off each students?)</p>
              <p>so if we are the ones who are paying for the refreshments, and then it was discontinued, it's only fair that at least we're told why it was discontinued, and at most, some sort of compensation (too much to ask for i guess)</p>
              <p>so how is this reasoning a logic flaw, unlike your statement about the refreshment being inexpensive (which you haven't acknowledged that it was flawed logic), and that i'm petty enough to want to know where my every cent i invested in sim is going to?</p>
              <p>also you forget (now i'm just using this as an example), that it's never the disappearing of large sums of money which escape people's notice. but the little disappearing of cents. just like most embezzlement cases.</p>
