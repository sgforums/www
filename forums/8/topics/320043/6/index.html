              <p>this is what i see la.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>that's why i said it's unfair that you critisize me for being petty and unobjective, when you don't see things from my pov? or even attempted to, for that matter. no one, has said how they would feel, if they were the students. they only spoke from the  bystander's point of view. if you feel that it's right that the school did what they did, fine. why demean and insult those who feel emotionally involved in this issue? you're not involved nor affected, so can understand why you see it's a small issue, but did you consider why the students are outraged?</p>

              <p>it's a double edged sword i guess. in a way it's good, because ppl voice out things which usually would be swept aside. everyone watches their acts in public knowing that there's a chance someone might complain about them and have their mugshot plastered all over.</p>
              <p>customer services improves as well, because which shop would want to have bad press about their service etc.</p>
              <p>but it's... bad also, because no one is natural, everyone is forced to be nice.</p>
              <p>also, ppl abuse this by critisizing ppl who sleep in the bus etc.. how they sleep also can get critisized.</p>

              <p>hmm.. an interesting thread..</p>
              <p>there's an ntu version too..</p>
              <p>just that it's not about food and refreshments, it's abt hostel
              accom..</p>
              <p>ntu is starting to implement the 3-per-room thing, instead of
              the old 2-per-room and in addition to that, hostel fees were
              raised..</p>
              <p>it has caused a BIG hooha in ntu..and ntu's reason was that
              there was insufficient rooms if it continued the 2-per-room, but it
              was quite bullshit and surveys were made and i think everybody
              kaobei the student union and in turn pressured the management to
              postpone it..</p>
              <p>anyway i guess the relation here is that students who are
              affected will tend to be more likely to want to find out what's
              happening, and have more information given to them, and when the
              sch diam diam, they will buay song.. same as anybody in any
              organisation la.. yah..</p>
              <p>i guess ppl may tend to view it as "aiyah no more free food oso
              want to kaobei.."</p>

              <p>to be honest, this issue and that issue is similar but hostels have been protected by black and white. and you pay for staying there etc..</p>
              <p>while the SIM refreshment issue is not stated anywhere in black and white, technically, NTU's hostel thingy is arguable. the SIM food is not.</p>
