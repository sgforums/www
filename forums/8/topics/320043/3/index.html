              <p>Hmmm...from what i gathered so far...i'd say that SIM is not
                      obligated to provide refreshments, whether or not it was free or
                      paid by the students (which there is no official proof) thats
                      besides the point. Actually if you're really feeling its unfair
                      treatment and its a matter to be questioned, shouldn't you be
                      approaching the school directly for a reason?</p>

              <p>yeah, wrote in their survey lor.</p>
              <p>i'm not so much upset about the decision, i just want a reason for it. some sort of accountability and transparency.</p>
              <p>if it's valid, may it be price hike or gst or smth, at least it's a reason, but we weren't told a reason why.</p>

              <p>i'm more upset about sweeping statements by people who aren't affected by the decision at all. thus thinking it is ridiculous that the students are upset over an unaccounted decision</p>

              <p>oh, sure, state your views, but just before you post sweeping remarks about how petty we are over this issue, walk a mile first?</p>
              <p>i mean, how can anyone agree that it's justified that sim takes away a priviledge without giving a reason why?</p>

              <p>so you agree that it's ok for them to make decisions without accounting to the stakeholders(we paid the fees, we have a stake)? no need to give reasons why certain decisions are made? no need for a certain degree of transparency?</p>
