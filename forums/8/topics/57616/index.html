If she is single... I will date her regardless of looks... bottomline is that we have to enjoy each other's presences and be comfortable with it.<br><br><strong>2) do you believe in fallin in love with each other without meet but just merely click with each other in the fone?? what will u do if u tell her u fall for her on the fone  but u regret after u met her?</strong><br><br>Frankly speaking no.
