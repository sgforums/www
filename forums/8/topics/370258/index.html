              <p>Dear TS,</p>
              <p>I would like to suggest both of you together do the following search .</p>
              <p>1) Map both of your family tree this is to confirm if there are any relation or how far/closely are you related to one another.</p>
              <p>2) list down both family illness and start matching illnesses. particularly pay attention to rare disease on both side of the family.</p>
              <p>3) Currently in Singapore i am not sure there are detail genetics test on individual genetics mapping especially to filter out recessive gene in SG. So you need to do more research.</p>
              <p>But here is an article for you to start understanding the concern. My point isn't a issue of  moral conduct but Health concern.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0.25in;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">From a genetics point of view, the reason to discourage inbreeding is to prevent undesirable genetics disorders. Genetic mutations occur in almost everybody, but the vast majority do not create any medical problems because the are recessive. Recall that most genes code for a protein of some sort, and that for most of our genes, we have two copies, one from each parent (an exception are the X-linked genes, for which males have only one copy). Thus, if a mutation occurs in one gene, there is a back-up copy. A person would only show the effects of missing the protein entirely if <strong>both</strong> gene copies carried the mutation. This is an example of a recessive trait.</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>     <span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In order for a child to inherit two copies of the mutant gene (in other words, be homozygous</span></span><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> for the mutation) and therefore have the disease, both parents must be carriers. The odds of two children of a carrier both being carriers are 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25. If these carriers marry, their chances of having an affected child are 0.25. Therefore, the chances of an incestuous union between two children of a sickle cell anemia carrier giving a child with sickle cell anemia are 0.25 x 0.25 = .0625, or 6.25%. </span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 12pt;       ' lang="EN">But remember, these are the odds only for one gene. Our hypothetical ancestor may carry any number of recessive genes that might be dangerous in the homozygous form</span></span></span></p>

              <p>Examples of married cousins........who are we to judge.</p>
              <p><span><strong>Jesse James</strong> married <span class="IL_SPAN">his first</span> cousin Zerelda “Zee” Mimms, who was named after Jesse’s own mother. They had two children and remained married until Jesse’s death in 1882 at the age of 34</span></p>
              <p><span>Although they had met as children, they became reacquainted after a dinner at the White House in 1902 held by Eleanor’s uncle and Franklin’s fifth cousin, President <strong>Teddy Roosevelt.</strong> FDR was 20 at the time and was attending Harvard. They were married on St. Patrick’s Day, 1905, and had six children.</span></p>
              <p><span>In 1707 <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Johann Sebastian Bach</strong></span> married his second cousin on his father’s side, Maria Barbara Bach. She died in 1720. Not much is known about their marriage, but he remarried less than two years after her death.</span></p>
              <p><span><strong>H.G. Wells</strong> first cousin Isabel Mary Wells, who he left after only three years. Wells was an English writer most famous today for the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">science fiction novels</span><span> he published between 1895 and 1901: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Time Machine</span>, The Island of Doctor Moreau, The Invisible Man, The War of the Worlds, When the Sleeper Wakes, and The First Men in the Moon.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><strong>Thomas Jefferson</strong> married his third cousin Martha Wayles Skelton Jefferson in 1772. They had six children together. Martha died on September 6, 1782 and Jefferson never remarried. (<strong>thomas jefferson had other flints</strong>) </span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span><strong>Albert</strong> <strong>Einstein </strong>married his second cousin Elsa in 1919, not too long after his divorce from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">his first</span> wife Mileva. Elsa died in 1936 due to various health problems, and though Albert never married again he had several girlfriends until his death in 1955.</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span><span>All natural selection jokes aside, the man who popularized <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the theory of evolution</span><span> married <span class="IL_SPAN">his first</span> cousin Emma Wedgwood. They had a total of ten children. <strong>Darwin</strong> died in 1882</span></span></span></span></span></p>

              <p>In 1957 famous rock and roll musician <strong>Jerry Lee Lewis</strong> married his cousin Myra, who was only 13 at the time. He lost an incredible amount of respect and credibility. The marriage almost ended his career and caused him to move from rock to a more country style. They had two children together, and ended up divorced in 1970.</p>
              <p><strong>Governor Rudy Giuliani</strong> married a woman who he thought to be his third cousin, Regina Peruggi, in 1968. It wasn’t until many years later that they realized that they were actually second cousins. Regina and Rudy divorced in 1982, and Rudy married his second wife Donna Hanover in 1984.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At the age of 20 poet <strong>Edgar Allen Poe</strong> moved in with his aunt, uncle, and cousin after his father left and his mother had died. It was there in Baltimore that he met his seven year old cousin Virginia, who he fell in love with and married when she was only thirteen. She died eighteen years later in 1847, and Poe died only two years after Virginia’s death.</p>

              <p><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">From a genetics point of view, the reason to discourage inbreeding is to prevent undesirable genetics disorders. Genetic mutations occur in almost everybody, but the vast majority do not create any medical problems because the are recessive. Recall that most genes code for a protein of some sort, and that for most of our genes, we have two copies, one from each parent (an exception are the X-linked genes, for which males have only one copy). Thus, if a mutation occurs in one gene, there is a back-up copy. A person would only show the effects of missing the protein entirely if <strong>both</strong> gene copies carried the mutation. This is an example of a recessive trait.</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>     <span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In order for a child to inherit two copies of the mutant gene (in other words, be homozygous</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> for the mutation) and therefore have the disease, both parents must be carriers. The odds of two children of a carrier both being carriers are 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25. If these carriers marry, their chances of having an affected child are 0.25. Therefore, the chances of an incestuous union between two children of a sickle cell anemia carrier giving a child with sickle cell anemia are 0.25 x 0.25 = .0625, or 6.25%.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span>But remember, these are the odds only for one gene. Our hypothetical ancestor may carry any number of recessive genes that might be dangerous in the homozygous form</span></span></span></p>
