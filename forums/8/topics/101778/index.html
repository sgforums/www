Doesn't matter as long as it does not affect other attributes. Race and dialect usually not an issue.

Its been accurate so far too including things like us getting married earlier than expected (not shot gun) plus some other issues but we are keeping an open mind about it.<br><br>The thing is sometimes our brain processes this piece of information and results in us acting the way we did. I dunno I'm still quite a disbeliever.<br><br>Anyway keep your chin up. Now I have to see what this guy's prediction of my hubby will come true. We were in Bangkok again and this guy (total stranger) just stopped him out of the blue and said that he will be very lucky this December and walked off. Totally weird. Didn't seem like a mad man.
