            <div class='col-md body'>just curious, does it matter or affect the way a friendship or relationship goes if let's say out of 5 dates, the gal does not even wear a dress on any of them? or maybe like just 10% of the time? she is either in jeans &amp; tee shirts/blouse or tailored pants and tee shirts/blouse most of the time, not fashionably trendy but neat enough, will guys date a gal like that or fall in love with a gal like that? the gal in question is short, slim and average in looks with average intelligence.<br><br>er, the gal in question is me and i wore a dress only once this year [i think not even once for 1999] and that was to a wedding because i wanted to give a good impression to someone, sadly he had a potential galfriend, found out only during the reception *sad for less than 2 hours, but still hopeful*, i know his parents mah, must find out from them soon if their son is attached, forgot to check during the reception. even for weddings, i usually wear pants and blouses, i find dresses so inconvenient because they have to go with high heels shoes. i seldom wear high heels shoes because they are uncomfortable and they hurt, nothing can beat my Hush Puppies suede loafers.<br><br>[This message has been edited by colette (edited 04 June 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi colette!<br><br>For you to post this topic, i guess you must be somewat a little concerned over wat someone is thinking by the way you dress? Think pants or jeans are perfectly fine when u're out on dates (afterall, isn't denim in fashion again?), but if you like the person, and want to leave a good impression, maybe can try to put in a little more effort lor. If he noes that you are dressing up for him, it'll make him notice u more rite? But it doesnt have to be dresses, you can be creative even with pants. it's better for u to be comfortable when you're out on the date than try to look different but feel awkward. Maybe you can start off wif your accessories. Carry a unique handbag or wear an interesting piece of jewellery. Or if you normally tie up your hair in a ponytail, let down your hair the next time you go out wif him. it should make him notice and not just think that you can't be bothered.<br><br>am i on the rite track? maybe u r not even trying to get this someone to notice u?? anyway, have fun..<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt;&gt;hi TinDonGal<br><br>itÂ’s not that iÂ’m uncomfortable in dresses or skirts and blouse, just that theyÂ’re so inconvenient, they require more work: needs ironing, i need more make-up to look better, i need to wear heeled shoes, my hair needs more attention, i need to wear perfume too, a dainty bag and my behaviour needs to be moderated as iÂ’m in a dress, you know the works. unlike jeans and tees: no ironing, okay maybe the tee shirt needs ironing, basic make up, flat comfy shoes, any canvas bag and i can be as rough as i want to without having to care that iÂ’m a gal.<br><br>oh yeah, my prospective partner has to learn to like me in jeans and tees as i practically live in them. i donÂ’t look that bad in jeans and pants, but me looking sexy? now thatÂ’s a stretch.<br><br>not really worried but iÂ’m a bit sick of my own dress sense too, in the last five years, i think iÂ’ve don a dress less than 20 times and yet i still buy dresses each year, except for last year when i realized that i donÂ’t wear them at all! not even once, i still have dresses unworn with their price tags in my closet, thatÂ’s how anti-dress iÂ’ve become, i guess iÂ’m trying to psyche myself back into wearing dresses again. thatÂ’s the whole problem with a boss i can bully.<br><br>thanks for your reply, have a good weekend.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>colette<br><br>&gt;&gt;hi sparkle,<br><br>nice to see you again. iÂ’m not really concerned over what someone is thinking by the way i dress, more like if guys treat gals differently when she is in a dress. for example, a guy may like you and he dates you but he realizes that you dress as per normal for the dates, he probably will think that you are not that interested in him romantically since you did not make an effort to dress up for him. the situation is worse if they have seen me dressing up for work before this current boss of mine with whom i had a pact that i do not dress up for work, hehe ... he lived to regret that promise because he nags at me to dress with more decorum befitting a lady occasionally. and i had friends telling me that i should make more of an effort to dress up when going out on a date to show that i like him more than a friend than to just show up like per normal, but as you can see from my post to TinDonGal, the whole process wearies me and that would take more than half the fun out of the date.<br><br>maybe iÂ’m just bored and wanted to know what the other forumites think.<br><br>have a good weekend too.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>colette<br><br>&gt;&gt;hi FnU<br><br>no offence taken and atreiu is sure naughty, i hope he doesnÂ’t harbour cross dressing tendencies.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>[This message has been edited by colette (edited 04 June 2000).]</div>

Does wearing a dress mean something? Shrugs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, hi hi hi again, the stressed one posts again. Regarding the issue about wearing a dress, personally, I wouldn't mind if my date turns up in t-shirt and jeans or in a dress, but if she does turn up in dress, I would be secretly pleased since I know many girls dislike putting on dresses and for her to go through the trouble of putting on a dress for me would be very flattering for me. Will make me feel so good the whole time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> So can you put on a dress on moi on our date? kekekeke  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mi no like 2 wear dresses or even skirties..hehehe, mi is tee-shirt and jeans Clefairy (^_^) Dunno y, but I find dat dresses and skirts restrict a gal's movement alot, muz sit daintily, cross legs properly, even walk oso cannot walk wif big steps (mi is fast-walker). Hehehe. Den I dun suit dresses oso. My shoulders r not broad enuf, bearie bony, so notch nice. And I dun have a figure...haha, I am a rectangle flat-chested box...so wearing shirt n jeans can hide this ugly fact. (^_~)<br><br>Hmmz, going on a date, best 2 wear vat is comfy and vat u like. No need force urself wear sumtink supposedly "feminine" or anytink. Cuz if some awkward situation occurs, bearie embarrassing on a date. Besides, a date who likes ur way of dressing which u find most comfy in, is the rite date 4 u. Tis can oso be a test if ur date likes the real u, or juz likes those "feminine-looking" gals 2 show off or sumtink.<br><br>Juz tis little theory of mine, when going on a date, dun bother 2 doll up, juz wear casual, be honest, be urself. The reason behind many breakups and divorces is cuz pple alwiz doll up too much and fake too much in their behaviour during dating (act feminine, act gentlemanly), such dat when the relationship takes off, and the flaws start getting discovered, the true colors show up...yea well...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>------------------<br>~*Luv &amp; Huggies*~<br>BabyC|eFairy^ (^_^)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For me, I don't really bother what my date wears.  She can wear a dress, T-shirt and jeans, bermudas, whatever...what's more important is that I like her for what she is, i.e. her personality and whether we can "click" together or not.  Of course, you have to dress according to the occasion too, e.g. if it's to a formal dinner, it would be best to wear a dress otherwise you may end up embarrassing your date.  I don't really read too much into whether someone bothers to dress up for me or not, it's more a matter of personal preference or comfort.  The success or failure of a date depends more on the effort both of you put in into making it work.  Some dates I've had with girls in dresses have bombed not because of their style of dressing but because of differing personalities.  Conversely, some dates I've had with girls who came in T-shirts and bermudas were a success because we put in the effort to make it work.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think being comfortable with what you wear is just as important as whether you are dressed according to the occasion.<br><br>It will look pretty dumb if you go to a hawker centre wearing an expensive evening gown. Likewise, its would be appropriate if you went to a wedding in a singlet, bermudas and slippers.<br><br>Dressing up once in a while is fun, because its refreshing. If your significant other sees you (the ladies) in casual wear all the time (which I'm sure you people look manigficant in,) it would make it you even more dazzling if you dress up occasionally.<br><br>Doesn't everyone like to appear glamourous once in a while?<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 04 June 2000).]</div>
