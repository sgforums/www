The first time was when I was conned by a lady who gave me my BCG injection. That was many years ago.<br><br>Darn, I forgot Gillian Anderson's name. Nope, you haven't replaced her. She is still one of the big four for me. I know I might sound harsh, but picture me saying that with a kermit on helium voice and I promise, it won't feel bad after all.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Let me warn you also that I AM A  HEARTBREAKER! Woohooo. I have an image to uphold you know. Then again, look who's talking. You are the one who is announcing in public that I'm a spare tyre, a temporary relief from Revelations. Its like the doughtnut calling the ice kacang sweet.<br><br>In conclusion,<br><br>I LOVE COCO!! I LOVE BUFFY!! I LOVE ELVA!!

            <div class='col-md body'>wahhhhh!  such a long thread...very interesting but don't mind me just skipping the reading and posting my reply  =P  for i am a very lazy person... =P<br><br>Okie, I personally like to wear dresses and pants..kekee..I don't think you need dresses to make you look glamorous or whatever.  You can also look glamourous in pants... =D<br><br>Everything I wear depends on my mood...if i am out to impress then I will dress up...let it be pants or dresses.  If i feel lazy you will find me in my jogging pants! kekekee =P  My mood varys a lot tho...I can be in jeans and t-shirt one day and be in a little cute school girl outfit the next...it all depends...<br><br>as tet mentioned, it all has to do w/ the confident you have.  If you are confident in yourself and what you are wearing then even if you are in jeans and t-shirt you will look good.  I think what you wear is as equally balance as the attitude you have.  The kind of "class" you show ppl.  You can be in the most sexiest and expensive dress in the world, but if you attitude is shitty then that makes the dress cheap.  And on the other hand, you can be in just plain old t-shirt and jeans, if you portray yourself as confident and classy then the it make you more expensive and the stuff you wear...<br><br>get my picture?!  Or am I just yakking away again....<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...Sting like a bee...</div>
