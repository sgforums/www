If Iraq was under sanction, so be it, why attack it? we don't felt it as much but i saw reports that their live is as worst as b4, but worst in a different way. its easy for us to say, it is not us that r facing it. some suggest that stability will come soon, but when? after how many has died? Years? understanding the nature of extremist, i think that dream of stability could be rather far fetch liao.<br><br>after ns, i understand the chances of hit when in war. though we have seen nothing real yet, but the patrol exercise shld give u a hint on how easily that we can be killed - especially when being ambushed. war w/o valid reasons r definitely a no-go.<br><br>They shld have just concentrate in rooting out the terrorist in afghan lah. then again, we will always have differing opinions and for some who can't take differing opinions, will solve them using violence- making war kind of inevitable *sigh*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>I got a question for those pro-iraq war pple: if u were an american and were asked to perform ur tour of duty in iraq, would u have felt differently abt it?  or if sg is committed to send combat troops there, and u were 'choosen' would u have felt differently?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Just out of Curiosity  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>this i agree, well, DR M is a pretty good leader in a sense for the malays, can't blame them for liking him, still, he is getting pretty dumb and his comments getting stupider since he step down,</blockquote>Tat, I agree to a certain degree. He do control the country well. But nevertheless he is probably one of the most unpopular leader in the world. At some point of time he either piss off america, singapore, australia and other countries<br><br><blockquote>i would say that the world is a better place with Saddam in custody, and well, althou iraq is now a vacume and a perfect place for terrorist to hide, it would regain back stability soon,</blockquote>After 1-2 years, it is getting more off hand than ever. It is too long and the effect is too disastrous. It has already fail in promising a better place after saddam fall<br><br><blockquote>and well, for those who wants Americans to mind their own buisness, can i remind you guys that we do need them as a support, they are afterall the only superpower left in the world</blockquote>Tat is the problem. He is the only super power left, tat is why he can play big boss and do lot of unreasonable things like fighting a war without reason. Sounds like germany before WW2 ? Do u know tat he is the country tat owns the world the most money ? No one dare to make him pay back or impose some economic measures.<br><br><blockquote>(dun go and crap about PRC, they still need doggone years to be able to catch up), and well, what is it with you guys and war anyway? peace? please, if the world have humans, conflicts and war have to happen, stop being a pacifist</blockquote>But we always purposely try to avoid all conflicts isn't it ? In a war, there will be lot of conflicts, death, loss and possibly hatred. Tat is why we shouldn't start a war without reason.<br><br><blockquote>osama and his rodents won't stop their regime of terror? the next thing they would do is demand that girls should be allowed to wear turbans to schools, or they should burn down all churches, or they will attack again. </blockquote>If iraq is not attacked, then osama and his rodents will have lesser justification and reason to continue their regime of terror. Now Bush has successfully give them a good reason to continue their jihad and tat is why we see more of such terrorists attack now. If u do not want girls to wear turbans, burn down churches or attack, then u should starve off their primary reason for starting a jihad. How ? By stop showing policies tat appear to made muslim victims.</div>
