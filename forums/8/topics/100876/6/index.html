            <div class='col-md body'>No Muslim leader has been able to balance the interest of the religious fundamentalists against those of the progressives. In the Middle East, many of their leaders are weak. They have a strong dependence on the US. Furthermore, many of their societies are autocratic and conservative. Compared to them, Malaysia has free elections and a forward-looking leader who dares to stand up against those he feels are too big for their boots. No doubt the Malays have a system of affirmative action, but they do not condone genocide, which the Bush-Sharon axis is perpetrating against the Arab tribes.</div>

Compared to them, Malaysia has free elections and a forward-looking leader who dares to stand up against those he feels are too big for their boots. No doubt the Malays have a system of affirmative action, but they do not condone genocide, which the Bush-Sharon axis is perpetrating against the Arab tribes.</div></blockquote>so is this what u r proud of Dr. M? What about his injustice towards the chinese and anwar? What about his suggestion of giving anatomy to southern thailand? What about UMNO corruptions under his era?

U talk about malaysia have free elections, i am sad to say that the Keadilan Party had revealed UMNO cheating/ injustice tactics of gaining votes. I bet u have heard of it right.

Giving special rights to malay and treating chinese unfairly in M'sia, i believe is not part of the quran to discriminate other races.<br><br>Dr M realised of that he had been doing, which is to treat the chinese/indians unfairly and allow UMNO to give them names like "pendatang".

Ayat bagai " pulang lah ke China, atau kamu semua cukup bahagia bahawa kami memberi tempat untik lu tinggal" sering kedengaran. Adakah ini yang dikatakan keadilan? cubalah fikir dari aspek seorang cina dan agama. Patuthkah mereka dilayan demikian.
