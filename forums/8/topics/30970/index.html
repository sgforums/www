            <div class='col-md body'>In the human species, Reason becomes seeded with<br>the first breath of life on a specific date. The birthpath,<br>calculated from the day, month, and year of birth,<br>reveals the path in life for each person to walk and the<br>lessons to be learned. The potential indicated<br>by the birthpath consists of qualities to be developed<br>through one's thinking and the resultant actions.<br><br>To calculate your birthpath, add the month, the day,<br>and year and reduce the number to a single digit between<br>one and nine.<br><br>December 12, 1975<br>12 + 12 + 1975 = 1999<br>1 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 28<br>2 + 8 = 1 birthpath<br><br>A person born December 12, 1975, is a 1 birthpath.<br>Calculate your own birthpath using the method above.<br><br>Whether one's birthpath expresses depends upon the<br>name given, for the name creates one's personality and<br>is the compelling force. The birthpath is only a potential<br>until understood and expressed through mind.<br><br>1 birthpath<br>The 1 represents the quality of an awakening<br>intellectual power seeking to understand the<br>fundamental natural laws of life. The 1's are leaders and<br>explorers and they are naturally inventive along practical<br>lines. They learn through their own experiences. In work<br>they must hold positions in which they can give orders<br>instead of take them, and in which their independence is<br>not curtailed. They are self-reliant and strong-willed--the<br>qualities of a leader.<br><br>2 birthpath<br>The 2 is the peace maker and diplomat. Their lesson<br>is to meet and mix with people, to understand their<br>hearts and minds, and to help people in the solution of<br>their problems. As the 2 is naturally impressionable to<br>environment and association, they must learn to be<br>individual and not unduly influenced by others. The 2's<br>are extremely sensitive, understanding, and generous.<br>Their lesson is to understand the points of view<br>of others and to create harmony between people<br>through that understanding.<br><br>3 birthpath<br>Self-statement is the 3's keynote. They excel in<br>vocal statement, public speaking, art, drama, or as<br>entertainers, humourists, and sales people. Their<br>lesson is to use the power of the word to inspire and lift<br>others to see a happier, objective perspective of life. The<br>3's are congenial in association and cosmopolitan in nature.<br>They have a love for all people and desire to help<br>others.<br><br>4 birthpath<br>The 4 quality symbolizes a power in its technical<br>and scientific statement; it brings into being a very<br>systematic, technical, stable, patient, and scientifically<br>analytical nature. The 4 seeks an understanding of life,<br>delving into matter and form, searching for the secrets<br>of nature in materiality. The keynote of the 4 is<br>practicality; and their duty is to find a basic principle<br>governing matter and form.<br><br>5 birthpath<br>The 5 quality represents change--a step above the<br>technical phase. The 5's must seek a definite Spiritual<br>Principle and apply it; thereby developing the intellect<br>and seeking new ideas, new meanings, and theories, to<br>bring improvement to life. The 5's tend to champion the<br>less fortunate. They are quick thinkers, always searching<br>for a reason for things. They seek the truth. As they<br>love change, travel, and new experiences, they should not<br>be placed in positions requiring detailed routine that is<br>monotonous.<br><br>6 birthpath<br>The 6 symbolizes maturity and responsibility; it is the<br>number of the mind and signifies growth to the point<br>where mind begins to search within for the reason of<br>being and realizes its responsibility to humankind.<br>The 6's have the mental quickness and the analytical<br>ability of the 5, but without the 5's restlessness and<br>impulsiveness intensity. They desire to assume<br>responsibilities for others. Their love is more<br>universal, with an intense desire to serve. They carry<br>responsibility better than any other quality.<br><br>7 birthpath<br>The 7 is the quality of the philosopher and writer.<br>Their duty is to tune the mind to harmony and<br>balance for receiving impressions from within; for this<br>the mind must be placid and at peace. The 7's<br>keynote is placidity. The 7's deeply appreciate<br>the beauties of nature; they delight in mystery and<br>are naturally drawn to philosophy and the occult.<br>They should spend time in meditation and<br>reflection, and write down their thoughts.<br><br>8 birthpath<br>The 8 symbolizes a power that comes to demonstrate<br>the spiritual law in service to humanity. They are<br>the born executives and national leaders, and should<br>occupy positions where they can administer justice<br>and equality for all and work to create a just and balanced<br>economic system. The 8's should never be<br>subservient to others. They seem to understand<br>people and have the ability to direct others and to hold<br>positions of great responsibility.<br><br>9 birthpath<br>The 9 includes all the other qualities within itself. They<br>are born to serve others along the path of wisdom as<br>spiritual leaders and teachers. They are very sensitive<br>and inspirational. Their talents are many and varied,<br>covering the inspirational vocations or in business where<br>they have the opportunity to be of service to people in<br>some way--in charitable institutions, hospitals, or in<br>education or law. The 9's are charming, affectionate, and<br>respond quickly to kindness. The path of the 9 is the<br>highest and most inspirational, but it is the most<br>difficult to live.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
