              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>i take 6-7 meals a day, high carbohydrates, high protein to
              enhance my performance in the gym and overall fitness. i believe it
              is about eating the right food, not eating less food. my diet
              started from february onwards, by far i have eaten fast food only
              once and abstain from fried food whenever possible. i have not
              taken carbonated drinks for almost a year and stick to milk,
              protein shakes, water, sugar-free green tea. but my diet is of
              course different from many of you in the sense that my focus is on
              gaining mass and strength.</p>
              <p>in my opinion, those who want to lose weight should eat 3
              regular meals a day and juts cut back on high GI, fatty, oily food,
              not go on anorexic diets. For example: oats, boiled vegetables,
              steamed chicken, tuna would be a good way to start off. if you go
              on an anorexic diet, you are threatening your body systems, the way
              they function and they make you hot-tempered, unable to focus and
              this increases the urge to eat junk.</p>
              <p>many people have this misconception that in order to lose
              weight, one must run 45 minutes 5 times a week. the truth is the
              fastest most efficient to lose weight and to build a strong healthy
              heart is to sprint 3 times a week, do interval training in the
              following manner: sprint 100m, jog 200m for 7 minutes non stop and
              a workout is over. so 7 minutes x 3 times a week = 21 minutes you
              only need to put in to see results. but more importantly, as what
              the saying goes,"abs are made in the kitchen, not in the gym" . the
              food you eat is important.</p>
              <p>to msshells: you can actually take a high carbohydrate diet yet
              keep fit, if you burn of the calories through sprinting and
              swimming. but the high carbohydrate should come from food
              with low Glycemia Index, i.e. oats, multi-grain wholemeal
              bread, brown rice not food like spaghetti, white rice, white bread
              and potato.</p>
              <p> to waterfairy206: it is never too late to change for the
              better. the reason why you have not seen any change in your weight
              is probably because you have not tried hard enough meaning 1) right
              nutrition, as stated above, no junkfood, snacks. 2)right training,
              you probably jogged but have never done sprint training. work hard
              and you will see results. however a note of caution, dieting the
              right way and training takes commitment and patience. if everything
              goes well, you might even lose 1 inch around your waist in 1 month
              and that is significant.</p>

              <p>lol low carb diet? in a long run, its self destructive. It's never designed to upkeep in a long run. Mother nature created us to crave for carbs and sugars. Prehistoricially speaking, Man are hunters, they hunt for fruits, animals and herbs for their survival. What do all of them have in common? Carbs, sugar and protein. All naturale~</p>
              <p>Fast forward to 21 century which is the present, such nutrients are served in processed, nicely packaged boxes which relates to what you find : Chocolates, biscuits, jam, cereal bar, whatever you can think of.</p>
              <p>Then come to marketing strategists noting the trend of low carb, low fat, southbeach diet etc. The result? They include labels and markings to certify their products as "health food"</p>
              <p>Suddenly chains of health food stores and cafe starts appearing with labels sticking "Low Fat!, Low GI, No trans fats!" And mindless workaholic gets tricked into the scheme of eating "healthy".</p>

              <p>i personally do not subscribe to the belief that "eat all sorts of food in moderation". i believe that eating more protein and carbohydrate and taking shakes are healthly and will help me progress better. however, junk food and other oily food should only be taken unless absolutely necessary, i.e. really starving and no other alternatives. it is one's determination that determines the results. though i am afraid in my own situation when i go army and the food there is insufficient, i might have to resort to cup noodles like the other folks.</p>
              <p>to msshells: well, actually as what you said, you can afford to walk for 30 minutes a day, hence it would be good if you could spare maybe 5 minutes a day doing sprint intervals  - 5 minutes for girls, 7 minutes for guys. as to all those gimmicks or slogans that you see telling you situps give abs, they don't work. abs are made in the kitchen, not the gym. in my situation, i wake up everyday and have to go for work or school etc. and even when i do not feel like hitting the gym, i drag myself down and force myself to give it my all. maybe, you should write down your goals, how you going to achieve them, how much time you willing to spend on them and commit to that.</p>
              <p>in fact, during training, normally the mind breaks first before the body, it should be the other way round, your mind willing your body to move on. normally, sprint intervals leave me nauseous and an unimaginable discomfort, as if the food might just come out. but persevere on!</p>
              <p>to noahnoah: go clubfitt gym instead. their membership are 8 times cheaper than california fitness. and usually the truly tough people go clubfitt, when you go there, you'll be really inspired.</p>
              <p>to mrshadows: i absolutely agree with what you said: beware of what food nutrition companies are claiming. try searching "bsn cheaters' relief". it states that as long as you take that supplement, whatever junk you ingest will not be stored in your body as fat. <strong>what do you all think about it?</strong> i think we should reduce reliance on such supplements and maybe only focus on the following 3</p>
              <p>1) multivitamins</p>
              <p>2) fish oil</p>
              <p>3) protein shakes</p>
              <p>there are many misleading health products in the market capitalizing on the ignorance of the consumer. as a saying goes, "only eat food in the natural form", meaning do not eat things from cans, packets or tins. i myself am unable to stick to his principle as this is only for bodybuilders. but it is a good point of reference.</p>

              <p>.i think you do not have to overstress yourself by running 20 minutes. how about trying this, for maintaing a good waistline and losing fats: (note: this is only for treadmill training) run at a moderate speed: complete 1km in 5+ minutes. rest for 3 minutes. then do intervals on treadmill. 1 minute sprint, 1 minute fast-paced walk (meaning striding). do this full set 5 times for guys, 3 times for girls. if after this interval running, you do not feel tired or feel that you can still run some more, it means that you have not put in enough effort for the intervals. a saying goes , " if you ran without sacrifice, congratulations, you just jogged.".</p>
              <p>normally, i do a 16 or 16.2 for my 1 minute, and a 8 for my fast-paced-walk. i repeat this whole thing 5 times, and it really burns every part of the body, including abs.</p>
              <p>i think maybe you should not overtrain by doing weights. if you want to tone up, just focus on this interval running and most importantly, a very stable and healthly diet. anyway, there are many 7 minute weights workouts that are just as effective as 20 minutes. normally, i hit the gym for about 20 minutes, finish my 12 sets, all till failure, only 2 bodyparts, and head home. but then again, this is a workout for guys.</p>
              <p>if you are still insistent on weight training, then to train your abs, do not do situps, do only weighted crunches and rope crunches, if you aren't sure what these are, Google them. the most effective workout that works <strong>every </strong>part of the body is squats. try doing maybe 20kg squats at a public Gym, then start increasing the weight. You might need a spotter though, if you do to failure.</p>

              <p>Eat fats i think ok lar. Just don't take it too much. Eat moderately hor.. Anything if we eat moderately also fine mah ^__^</p>
              <p>Well i like unagi too! Taste like fish hor (^0^)v</p>

              <p>i think i rather work my arse off on sport then go dieting.... atleast it give me the freedom to eat almost anything anytime of the day for almost insane amount each time. What is the point of not enjoying one of the best thing life have to offer just to look good the lazy ways. Why cant enjoy life, earn the nice hard tone body and yet eat like a pig?</p>
              <p>Beside that, i do get the side effect of being more alert, happier and energetic as well.</p>
              <p>It make nua-ing at home during the weekend more enjoyable when guilt isnt ard to interupt.</p>
