              <p>At first i thought this will be so hard for me but now i find it quite ok since i still get to eat egg and veggie.</p>
              <p>Eating fat won't make us fat. Actually our body take longer time to digest and burn fat. That's why when we eat fat. It will take a longer time for us to get hungry ;p</p>
              <p>For me ya, the easiest way to find out if the food contain carbs or sugar is by the taste. If it taste sweet, sure confirm it contains sugar hehe ^__^</p>
              <p>I eat any kind of meat. Fish, chicken, beef, and pork occasionally (^OO^)</p>

              <p>I know exactly what you mean. I also love carbs a lot! I love
              rice, noodle, pasta, bread (omg.. mouthwatering LOL)</p>
              <p>At first i thought this will be so hard for me but now i find it
              quite ok since i still get to eat egg and veggie.</p>
              <p>Eating fat won't make us fat. Actually our body take longer time
              to digest and burn fat. That's why when we eat fat. It will take a
              longer time for us to get hungry ;p</p>
              <p>For me ya, the easiest way to find out if the food contain carbs
              or sugar is by the taste. If it taste sweet, sure confirm it
              contains sugar hehe ^__^</p>
              <p>I eat any kind of meat. Fish, chicken, beef, and pork

              <p>i take 6-7 meals a day, high carbohydrates, high protein to enhance my performance in the gym and overall fitness. i believe it is about eating the right food, not eating less food. my diet started from february onwards, by far i have eaten fast food only once and abstain from fried food whenever possible. i have not taken carbonated drinks for almost a year and stick to milk, protein shakes, water, sugar-free green tea. but my diet is of course different from many of you in the sense that my focus is on gaining mass and strength.</p>
              <p>in my opinion, those who want to lose weight should eat 3 regular meals a day and juts cut back on high GI, fatty, oily food, not go on anorexic diets. For example: oats, boiled vegetables, steamed chicken, tuna would be a good way to start off. if you go on an anorexic diet, you are threatening your body systems, the way they function and they make you hot-tempered, unable to focus and this increases the urge to eat junk.</p>
              <p>many people have this misconception that in order to lose weight, one must run 45 minutes 5 times a week. the truth is the fastest most efficient to lose weight and to build a strong healthy heart is to sprint 3 times a week, do interval training in the following manner: sprint 100m, jog 200m for 7 minutes non stop and a workout is over. so 7 minutes x 3 times a week = 21 minutes you only need to put in to see results. but more importantly, as what the saying goes,"abs are made in the kitchen, not in the gym" . the food you eat is important.</p>
              <p>to msshells: you can actually take a high carbohydrate diet yet keep fit, if you burn of the calories through sprinting and swimming. but the high carbohydrate should come from food with low Glycemia Index, i.e. oats, multi-grain wholemeal bread, brown rice not food like spaghetti, white rice, white bread and potato.</p>
              <p> to waterfairy206: it is never too late to change for the better. the reason why you have not seen any change in your weight is probably because you have not tried hard enough meaning 1) right nutrition, as stated above, no junkfood, snacks. 2)right training, you probably jogged but have never done sprint training. work hard and you will see results. however a note of caution, dieting the right way and training takes commitment and patience. if everything goes well, you might even lose 1 inch around your waist in 1 month and that is significant.</p>

              <p>Eat fats i think ok lar. Just don't take it too much. Eat moderately hor.. Anything if we eat moderately also fine mah ^__^</p>
