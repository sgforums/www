            <div class='col-md body'>Secondly, before believing in a religion, we first have to see if it is true or not. No point giving your emotion to an imaginary friend tat never exists. How we check is by seeing if the events tat had been described to happen had really happen or not. These can be quantified and thus verified. Tat is why scientific and logic have to come into the picture. Otherwise it just show people joining the religion due to impulse or not thinking rationally.</div>

I won't mention name.  The building is white white one.  Got some branches in Singapore.  They are very strict vegetarians and they expect everyone else to respect them and not to take meat in their presence.<br><br>They send their members overseas to preach buddhism, usually to Christian countries in Europe, Australia and America.  They encourage abandoning families here to 'preach the message'.  Once I was at a friend's place, her family was suffering because her sister ran away suddenly to an undeveloped country.  She was sent by the religion.  So the mother cursed this buddhist group for brainwashing her elder daughter like that.  Then on the night when I visited my friend, the whole bunch was these buddhist extremists came to visit and started telling my friend's mom that her elder daughter was doing the right thing, doing god's works blah blah blah.<br><br>In the end, my friend's parents were upset and my friend has to literally chase them out of the house.  She tried reporting to police.  But this group did not do anything illegal.  So mata don't chap.<br><br>Maybe I should start a topic on this hor?

No point giving your emotion to an imaginary friend tat never exists. How we check is by seeing if the events tat had been described to happen had really happen or not. These can be quantified and thus verified. Tat is why scientific and logic have to come into the picture. Otherwise it just show people joining the religion due to impulse or not thinking rationally. </div></blockquote>What do you mean by a religion is not true? U mean whether the teachings are true or not? All teachings of religion are good and beneficial to mankind.</div>

They actually believe in things like" if you dont accept jesus as your saviour, you will go to hell". thats full of shit. And its never fails to amaze me that some youths are joining churches nowadays is because of this statement made by their christian friends. Where is the logic and common sense when you need it???</div>

I won't mention name.  The building is white white one.  Got some branches in Singapore.  They are very strict vegetarians and they expect everyone else to respect them and not to take meat in their presence.<br><br>They send their members overseas to preach buddhism, usually to Christian countries in Europe, Australia and America.  They encourage abandoning families here to 'preach the message'.  Once I was at a friend's place, her family was suffering because her sister ran away suddenly to an undeveloped country.  She was sent by the religion.  So the mother cursed this buddhist group for brainwashing her elder daughter like that.  Then on the night when I visited my friend, the whole bunch was these buddhist extremists came to visit and started telling my friend's mom that her elder daughter was doing the right thing, doing god's works blah blah blah.<br><br>In the end, my friend's parents were upset and my friend has to literally chase them out of the house.  She tried reporting to police.  But this group did not do anything illegal.  So mata don't chap.<br><br>Maybe I should start a topic on this hor?  Then maybe aloka will continue to post his buddha blah blah blah text (copy and paste from some website only.  Nothing original).</div></blockquote>I agree with the stories, even know of some controversial (not hardcore) form of Buddhism.<br><br>But whats with aloka posting his 'buddha blah blah blah'. Because its Buddhist text which u dont like, or its because he state things without arguing?<br><br>Wonder who was the one who started this rather childish topic which implicitly flame our ancestors who believe in Buddhism, Taoism and ancient folklore?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually, every religion has hardcore ppl... be it christiainity, taoism or islam, there will always be these kind of people who totally damaged their religion reputation.<br><br>I always believed that having a religion is just to have someone to comfort your mind when you are in deep trouble.<br>For example, I always go to si bei rou to pray to the Goddness of Mercy when I have exams, troubles etc... even though deep down, I knew it's my efforts that really counts but it gives me peace when I knew that she will watch over me and give me the strength that I needed for me to 'stay alive'... it is just that..  I don't believe that by doing good deeds and not eating meat, I will go to heaven, I do good deeds like dontating money because I feel that these people needs our help... so I help... I can't go without meat so don't ever expect me to go vegetarian...<br>to tell the truth, actually, I don't believe in ghosts and such even though my religion says that are such things.. if there were really ghosts, than all murderers should have already been caught or scared to death.... religion is to give a peace of mind.. if people thinks that by following blindly, they can go to heaven, by all means do so.. but that does not gives them the right to burn people at stake, start religious wars just because people have different views from them... and then pushed all the blame to their god... telling people it is god who wants them to do such things.. oh please, get a life... if there is really hell, den there is no doubt these people will be going...</div>
