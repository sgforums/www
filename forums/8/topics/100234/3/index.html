If u look at how some ppl would just park their cars all over the place n cause inconveniences to others just for their church services, I wonder what the bible teaches them.<br><br>erm...didnt quote the whole thing coz a bit long. anyway, just wanna share smthing related but not responding to the quote,dun get me wrg.<br><br>Saw some ppl tried to use logic and reasoning even science to explain y they feel that the contents of the bible is not accurate or even untrue. erm, to me,i feel tat logically, a TRUE creator(god) is not an object of a creation(eg. universe). And to use logic,reasonin n science which is part of the creation to understand FULLY the creator who is 'outside' of the creation(imagine set n sub sets <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ),  its not possible. i wuldnt start a religious debate here.<br><br>My point is to explain y i wuldnt use science,logic n reasoning to PROVE parts of the bible which seems 'weird' or not accurate to me.Some other benefits which come from the bible or more important to me then tat, if u know wat i mean. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div></blockquote>the problem is that its not that i find the logic or the scientific or reasoning of the bible wrong. rather, i find that, deep down in my heart, I feel that its just, not correct. just as u can't explain it to non-christians, its the same thing i can't explain to christians, esp when they are set in  way of viewing their religion.</div>
