As I said you need to find a trustworthy and well experienced instructor. Hey nothing wrong with buying things during the course if the instructor can deliver the "goods".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, I just passed my driving test.  And I took my lessons in a driving school.  Well, it cost a bomb!  But, the lessons are quite well structured in school so I progressed on smoothly.  And the best part is that you don't need to book for circuit driving in school. If you are learning with a private instructor, you'll need to book for circuit driving.  The instructors are generally pretty ok, at least those that were teaching me.<br><br>I spent about 2.5k, cos I only passed on second try.  So, I guess you need to look at your budget.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think pte is more flexible, since there's more room for negotiation and less bureacracy?<br><br>Pte quite shiok also, since the instructor can drive his car to your house, then you take over and drive to the driving center! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> And you get to drive it back also. But that's provided you stay near his house.<br><br>Note that the pte practice is to book the circuit in the later stage of your learning, typically the last few lessons before your test.<br><br>I do not know how much does competence of the pte instructor matters, other than he should pinpoint your driving mistakes. I think it depends on your skill to a large extent. The lesson is about familiarising yourself with the car, get the 'feel' behind the wheel, and get acquainted with the routes and various traffic condition.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think you are worth the price you pay. got pros n cons lah<br><br>though i am taking private, but in my perspective why pple say sch easier to pass is coz they teach u all that is needed to pass the test. and prob good thing to me can get different instructor to teach you. becoz it is not very good to stick to just one instructor.<br><br>as my personal experience, recently i changed instructor coz i wanna get 2nd opinion. i failed my first attempt. i talked to my dad why i failed and he said the instructor failed to teach me quite a lot of stuffs. but i also know that instructors also cannot teach all the knowledge abt driving lah.<br><br>when i attended a new lesson with a new instructor just 2 days back...i was right abt my assumptions and glad i changed instructor. i learnt a lot of new perspectives fr another person. some pple may say it will confuse you and i had to baleh drive a new car. anyway not to worry the new instructor car is a similar model to the last one....and i believe if my skills are solid, why worry abt the stupid car?<br><br>i know school can book particular instructors if u like, right? just more expensive....<br><br>but hor just my advice, if u find ur instructor attitude very bad and dont like teaching driving....drop him/her! i regretted staying so long with my that first instructor....end up i spent so much money learning nothing but to know his indifference. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi jus to mention my 2 cents worth. I got my driving experience from SAF. As i am not a driver so i am unable to convert my licence. Anyway after I ORD, i tried private instructor. He saw that i can drive so everytime he just ask me to drive around and tell stories(sian). Sometimes he called up and said he is not free and once he went to Thailand without telling me when we were suppose to have lessons. In the end i switch to school. though i know how to drive but i must admit i gain a lot of experience from the instructor at CDC. In the long run i feel if private you cant pass and have to retake, it will add up to almost the same amount.  So dun worry too much about the cost cos in the end it will be money well spent .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I'm new in the forum and would like to seek some advice. After reading all that message posted, i know that it is not easy to pass the driving test at 1st attempt. I strongly agree that it really depends on the instructor. Any recommendation for private instructor?  who are good and charging at a resonable price? Coz i know that some instructor are not responsible.<br><br>Regards</div>
