            <div class='col-md body'>Man, I think I've got something against taxi drivers, BIG TIME. Anyone else have the same feeling? I just read in the newspapers, again, that in 2 separate cases, taxi drivers knocked down people again. Seriously, I think there should be some form of regulation in the quality of our nation's cabbies. My personal experiences with them are awfully bad as well. Taxi drivers frequently hog the rightmost lane, change lane without signals, drift into my lane causing me to brake. More than half the time I've had to brake so hard I can feel the ABS shifting into action, the cause was a taxi. Here are some of the occurences.<br><br>1. My first driving test. I came out with the right turn signal early while in the middle lane. The taxi in the right lane refused to give way. The one behind sped up as well. The third car, which happened to be a taxi as well, attempted to speed up too, but I had reached the turning and had to turn, so I was forced to shift in, causing him to brake. I got 20 points there, for making him brake and a couple of things like dangerous driving according to the instructor, and failed.<br><br>2. I was driving down Braddell Rd in the middle lane at a reasonable 60kmh. A taxi turned into Braddell Rd from the "give way" slip turning. The leftmost lane was completely clear, but instead of staying on it, he turned into the middle one, just in front of me. I bad to brake so hard, I swear my car was at one point less than 50cm from his bumper.<br><br>3. I was going down Bukit Timah Road in the middle lane, and there was a taxi in front of me at 50 kmh in the middle lane, and 2 cars on the right lane at 50 kmh as well. With no good way to overtake, I went to the left lane(there was a lorry 50m before me at 40kmh) and sped up. The taxi driver sped up as well, drawing up next to me so that I couldn't shift back into the middle lane in front of him. And of course, I was forced to brake with the lorry in front of me. I looked at the taxi driver next to me, the fellow raised his hand in a gesture of victory...<br><br>I really hope the LTA will do something about the courtesy, and more importantly, the safety record of our Singaporean taxi drivers.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have 2 experiences to share too...?<br><br>1st case, my dad was driving along highway... A taxi tried to CUT my dad (he was in small lane, my dad along highway)... But he was forced to brake as my dad's vehicle was already quite near him.... He NOT HAPPY, and tried to overtake my dad's vehicle by speeding up from the back and abruptly cutting right in front of his vehicle.... As he was doing that he shown his MIDDLE FINGER....<br><br>2nd case... I was crossing a pedestian crossing at night... A taxi just suddenly speed up out of nowhere and almost knocked me down.... Luckily I was quick to reflect and jumped off the path of the taxi.... The taxi was travelling at least 150km/hr.... What NICE SWAY turn that was INDEED...? Can even hear the TYRE's FRICTION... If it was an old folk instead of me, the person would have been SMASHED PUMPKIN... If I was HIT, I would most probably be RESTING in my coffin by now....<br><br>Of course, there're still the nice and FRIENDLY taxi drivers (friendly ESPECIALLY when you're their customer...).... But as for the HELL-RIDERS.... Hope the authorities could do something about them as it's REALLY NO JOKING MATTER....</div>
