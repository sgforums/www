All not ladies, but behave like one and worse it's auntie behaviour. (no offence but it's real childish you know that!)<br><br>Same theory like when you first fall in love with a lady, wanna have her as your stead, then if the lady decline your offer, would you:<br><br>1) give up and find another lady who's much better?<br>2) coz your friends laugh at you, the more ways your try and think to make her yours!!<br>3) go around and say all ladies are bad, then either you become I-Single all your life or II-Go be a monk better or III-Be a gay?<br>4) heart-broken, take some time to realised what you did wrong, then try again at another lady, if fail, then keep trying until you become married?<br><br>[b]<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Out of the above choices which one would you choice (if you are in the right stead of mind)<br>Of course you will choose the 4th choice la.<br>Only losers will give up after 1st attempt, say gals cannot make it de la. But think, are gals really 'cmi' or ARE YOU  the person who is really CANNOT MAKE IT? </span></strong><br><br>Today if you read my post above and deep it's something deep, then you go analyse again and again. Just think:<br><br>Today you earn a few $1k++ you only use your body and time to exchange for $$. But think, if you're the boss, you just use your brain to work and share ideas with potential investors, find others to develop it, then you get to earn lots of money. Isn't the 2nd choice better? Isn't this scene like a Bill Gates in the past when he's still poor?<br><br>I'll just have to say 2 things to wrap up:<br>Using body to work, poor forever, yes you can work til you age, but only earn max a million, havn't miuns off those expenses incurr over the years.<br><br>If you're an employee, YOU'll be forever being manipulated by the executives for sure, office politics, sabotage people, finding a scape-goat, being blamed for something that you didn't do. As long as you manage to kick the person above you out, you rise to the position, then get pay increment, isn't it?<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>Result of being an employee:</strong></span><br>Have money but no time, can't spend the money happily<br>Have time but no money, coz u didnt work, more worries sets in, how to be happy?<br>Once you have a family, your hard work money goes to family, you spend nothing or perhaps just a little?<span style="color: red;"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Are you reaping what you sow? Answer: No!! You are sowing just a tiny portion of what you reap only!!</span></span><br><br>Using your brain and mouth to work, makes you your own boss.<br>Being a boss, you just have to make sure you business partners stay close and on good terms with you, that's all, once the business is going on 'auto-pilot' mode, you can leave all the work to the GM, then absent yourself and open another company/ do other things. <span style="color: orange;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">As a boss: Do you reap what you sow too? Answer still NO!! BUT You not only reap what you sow, but also reap what others sow too!! Isn't that great?</span></span><br><br><span style="color: orange;"><strong>Result of being your own boss:</strong></span><br>Have time, have money, then when your have a family, can spend time with them. You happy, your spouse happy, your kids also happy, coz they will not complain that you didnt spend time with them when they are still growing up.<br>If you didnt spend enough time with them, arguements occur, teenagers (your future kids mix with bad company; dun return back home for a few days, go committing crimes like gang bully, steal things fight.) Would you want all those to happen? It's all over the newspapers and television, all these are facts and reasons why kids now-a-days go stray and do the bad things, i was once like that, i know.<br><br>It's logic. Would you wanna go back home to have a family worrying bout retrenchment, not enough money, wife, parents nagging at you, have to settle disputes even on minor household chores and pub bills or would you want to go back home, and have you wife saying, dear, you've return, busy day isn't it, let you get you a hot bath, dinner is ready!!<br><br><strong>If you think it's multi-level marketing then it is for i didn't say it is.<br>If you already tag my offer and classifiy it as mlm, but i tell you guys its Concumer Franchising, would you believe?</strong>[/b]</blockquote>You left out your email address in the above reply.
