            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">E-mail-borne Viruses</span></strong><br><br>Over the past few weeks, there has been reports of two more mass-mailing viruses, Beagle and Mydoom (variants A and B). The technology used in these viruses is no different from last year's mass-mailing viruses such as Bugbear, Sobig and Mimail etc that were widely reported in the media.<br><br>Unsolicited email messages, seemingly coming from someone familiar and containing attachments, are sent to unsuspecting recipients. They may contain a return address, a provocative name, or something else that encourages the receiver to open it. This technique is called <strong>social engineering</strong>. Because we are trusting and curious, social engineering is often effective. In Mydoom case, the mail was crafted to be like a mail delivery error.<br><br>Our mail and desktop anti-virus are kept updated with the latest virus signature patches. However, the new virus signature patches may not be available fast enough for us to download and protect our PCs from the new viruses.<br><br>You can help to prevent any unintended virus spread by being vigilant and by following the simple guidelines below before opening your mail attachments.<br><br>1. Do not open email attachment from strangers. Delete the mail.<br><br>2. Be suspicious of any unexpected e-mail attachments from someone you <strong>DO</strong> know. Verify the suspicious email by calling the sender.<br><br>3. Mail delivery failure emails usually include the <strong>subject</strong> and <strong>recipient</strong> of the failed mail. Verify that you have sent such mail.<br><br>4. Be suspicious of internal emails from own company if the mail header shows the full internet email address (e.g. john_tan@xyz.com.sg). Verify the email by calling the sender.<br><br>e.g. an email from ITD staff John Tan, should have a mail header John Tan/IS/HQ/XYZ or just John Tan.  If john_tan@xyz.com.sg is shown in the mail header, it is a high chance it is impersonated.<br><br>5. IT companies (Microsoft, Adobe, Symantec, IBM, Sun, Dell etc) do <strong>NOT</strong> send software updates/patches as attachments in emails. If you receive such attachments, it is a very likely to be infected. Delete the mail.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Phishing (pronounced "fishing")</strong></span><br><br>Phisher scams aim to steal personal information. It involves the mass distribution of false e-mail messages with return addresses, headers, links to fake websites, which appear to come from the established legitimate banks, insurance agencies, retailers or credit card companies. These fraudulent message instructs you to click on a web link that sends you to a fake website where you are asked to provide personal information to the scam artists. Such messages and bogus websites are designed to steal the user's personal information like account usernames and passwords, PIN, credit card numbers, NRIC numbers, etc. Recent targets of phisher scam includes Citibank, Visa and DBS (Hong Kong).<br><br>To avoid getting caught by one of these scams, observe these measures:<br><br>1. <strong>NEVER</strong> reveal your PIN or password to anyone. Be suspicious of any email asking you to provide sensitive personal account information.<br><br>2. If you get an email that warns you, with little or no notice, that an account of yours will be shut down unless you reconfirm your billing information, do not reply or click on the link in the email. Instead, contact the company cited in the email using a telephone number or the Web site address you know to be genuine.<br><br>3. Avoid emailing personal and financial information.<br><br>4. Avoid filling out forms in e-mail messages. You can't know with certainty where the data will be sent.<br><br>5. Don't trust e-mail headers and logos, they can be forged easily<br><br>6. Review credit card and bank account statements as soon as you receive them to determine whether there are any unauthorised charges. If your statement is late by more than a couple of days, call your credit card company or bank to confirm your billing address and account balances.</div>
