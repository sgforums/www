              <p>Don't care about them eating shit in Singapore lah. I like people who can appreciate other people cultures and try to look at things from different point of view and be tolerant to old people.This people even criticize our singaporean old folks! and cirticizing about our way of speaking - our culture - one country's culture is simply stupid. Don't need to care about them.</p>
              <p>What i don't like is Singaporeans saying we suck. ok, not we suck, but our english or chinese suck and should change. Fuck off lah, then you go and be american lor! this is our culture mah! Singaporean can speak and write English well if they want to. At least the china PRCs can say they are proud of their country, but you leh? if you're a singaporean and there is a foreigner coming by and criticizing us and all they can think is yes yes yes, we're wrong, then you're even worse than that low eq and iq foreigner!!! The worse citizen is someone who cannot be proud of who they come from. This is really bad.</p>

              What an eye opener!!! such a website full of filth... I did not know such hatred from china chinese in Singapore. How arrogant they talk!!! this is outrageous... 
              
              I though the government can track erroneous bloggers and bring them to justice, I feel this is the right thing to do to these people, round them up and send them packing. In the name of racial harmony, they should not be allowed to sprout such nonsense in forum. What will potential Foreign talents think if they saw this?

              <p>I've been to china a few times backpacking, yunnan, shenzhen and guangzhou. And one thing that really irks me, is that the people on the street level have very little social etiquette.</p>
              <p>They spit more than necessary and talk extremely loudly over the phone, I could hear a lady sitting at the opposite end of the macdonald's I was in, yelling into the handset. </p>
              <p>And there was one time on a tiger airways flight, the plane was taxiing into position and this lady was on her handphone quarrelling<span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; white-space: pre;  "><span style="border-collapse: separate; font-family: arial; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px; white-space: normal;  "> with someone. The crew had to persuade her to turn off her handphone and she actually told them off for being nosey. At least her countrymen sitting beside her was kind enough to tell her to lower her volumn. </span></span></p>
              <p>Of course not all PRCs are like that, some of them are really nice people. But I have to agree the rudest chinese all seem to hail from northern china </p>

              <p>As for those forum comments, I bet some of them were just striking back on Singaporeans who kept despising, criticizing, discriminating them. We have nvr stopped doing that! From what I know, some (or most?) PRCs are really happy when I said I could not recognize them as PRC. What does this show? To risk generalization, I would say this means they actually exhibited sense of inferiority and scared of being discriminated against as PRC! How sad it is... Just to put yourself in their shoes la, being ashamed of where your origin/nationality is. Some of them who din manage to hide their identities (not everybody is a genius who can take up new culture and languages easily) might attempt to protect themselves, and there comes "ego" and  "arrogance".

              <p>I truly hope everyone could just show some empathy... It's never easy to start out a life in the foreign land. Our ancestors did that, struggling, and now look at the Malaysian Chinese, they too are still fighting for their rights. Please acknowledge that these foreigners are equal to us, not anyhow inferior, though different in terms of culture and languages.

              <p>what a nice topic! so heated.</p>
              <p>I am from China,my english is not good, but i want to say sth.apologize for my humble english first!</p>
              <p>Yes, i also disagree with some of what my China fellows said in sgchinese. yes, if we are too proud, we should pack and go back to China, but if we want to stay and make money, we must learn to adapt, get used to everything here and dun talk shit a lot. I feel this is quite right. Now i am enjoying living in this country and have good relationship with my neighbors. i dun care my nationality is PRC chinese or singaporean. It really does not matter as long as i am happy and ppl like me.</p>
              <p>But on the other hand, some of you are way too much! China women come to SG to suck SG dicks?? come on, just some of them, because they are poor and you are "rich". you try go to beijing and shanghai, who will give fcuk about you unless you are millionare. High-end beautiful girls all go with real rich guys in china, and you are only looking into weak groups here.Btw, have you heard of many singaporean beautiful girls also like sucking PRC chinese's dick cuz many of we PRC chinese are also "rich". does this also hurt your feeling? and many many of us can affort condo and expensive car easily, but many singaporean still struggle damn hard to buy those. You can go east coast costa del so or goodman road to ask how many china guys buy houses there, even full payment, then you will know. does this hurt you? or you can ask your sales friends whether they v  seen any good china guy before, dun think they will look down upon us all. and dun mention we provide you singaporean lots of jobs every year and promote our singaporean employees from ground.So what i meant here is not to flame you singaporean, i love this country, i love many ppl here, i love my friends here and i disagree with some of what my fellows said in that forum(actually if you can read mandrin, you will find many of them also disagreed ), BUT you also dun be so mean, and try not to stereotype us all!what de f**k is "let us all voice our unhappiness towards them"??? i believe life really does not have other things for you to care about? Man, what s wrong with you?!</p>
              <p>i only respect and appreciate those who really know China, know what is going on and know how to respect ppl and yourselves. face the reality!</p>
