              <p><em>Yes, I am a Chinese (PRC). But that Singaporean mother is also a Chinese person from Fujian (originally), what makes her so special?</em></p>
              <p>==================</p>
              <p>So when you Singaporean guys read all this, dont dismiss these words as nothing.</p>
              <p>THis mother has a point; i remember my nephew's playing with Singaporeans hdb playgrounds. Well my nephew didn't have problems, he was white and pretty burly for his age, he could defend himself, but i remember the local chinese kids not wanting to play with the malay kids. ANd my nephew had his toys taken repeatedly, but the parents were sorry and apologetic, but they weren;t to the other kids. So there is that preferential treatment.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are prejudiced toward PRC Chinese, yes i agree to some extent, PRCs are loud, obnoxious and can be crude. But so can the Singaporeans. I remember back in the early 1990s, we would complain about the Singaporeans being rude, dirty (Standing on toilet seats), spitting in the street etc. Yet today in 2009, barely 10 years... the Singaporeans are holding their noses up at other wogs. It's just really interesting.. especially since Singaporeans today are a product of endless campaigns designed to make people "nice"</p>
              <p>-smile campaign</p>
              <p>-courtesy campaign</p>
              <p>-babies campaign haha</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But i really do find it strange that we have a LOT of PRCs here, You can tell them by the number of children. If they have more than 2 children, their definitely PRC haha! I think it's the government efforts to maintain Chinese as the majority ethnicity here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But yeah. Guys, we should be mindful of how we behave.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another example of Singaporean prejudice:</p>
              <p>When i flew SIA with my nephews, they always got the toys and the extra attention from stewardesses for being white and cute and preferential. But the hong kong kids didn't get toys, or visits to the cockpit... i wonder why. This really angered me, and they apologized.</p>
              <p>Okay im done.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><em>Yes, I am a Chinese (PRC). But that Singaporean mother is also a Chinese person from Fujian (originally), what makes her so special?</em></p>
              <p>==================</p>
              <p>So when you Singaporean guys read all this, dont dismiss these words as nothing.</p>
              <p>THis mother has a point; i remember my nephew's playing with Singaporeans hdb playgrounds. Well my nephew didn't have problems, he was white and pretty burly for his age, he could defend himself, but i remember the local chinese kids not wanting to play with the malay kids. ANd my nephew had his toys taken repeatedly, but the parents were sorry and apologetic, but they weren;t to the other kids. So there is that preferential treatment.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are prejudiced toward PRC Chinese, yes i agree to some extent, PRCs are loud, obnoxious and can be crude. But so can the Singaporeans. I remember back in the early 1990s, we would complain about the Singaporeans being rude, dirty (Standing on toilet seats), spitting in the street etc. Yet today in 2009, barely 10 years... the Singaporeans are holding their noses up at other wogs. It's just really interesting.. especially since Singaporeans today are a product of endless campaigns designed to make people "nice"</p>
              <p>-smile campaign</p>
              <p>-courtesy campaign</p>
              <p>-babies campaign haha</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But i really do find it strange that we have a LOT of PRCs here, You can tell them by the number of children. If they have more than 2 children, their definitely PRC haha! I think it's the government efforts to maintain Chinese as the majority ethnicity here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But yeah. Guys, we should be mindful of how we behave.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another example of Singaporean prejudice:</p>
              <p>When i flew SIA with my nephews, they always got the toys and the extra attention from stewardesses for being white and cute and preferential. But the hong kong kids didn't get toys, or visits to the cockpit... i wonder why. This really angered me, and they apologized.</p>
              <p>Okay im done.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>You are absolutely right. Which is why i find it weird when locals claim they are english educated. Try talking to bureaucrats at the ICA;</p>

              <p>Ofcourse in the end i got to what i wanted, but the process is just so tedious haha, because i was under the impression the guy's name was "Argh" and so i called back looking for a mr "Argh" and the guy's name was actually Teng. LOL. All this stuff should be recorded for a tv show.</p>
              <p>Yeah i think the main problem with the way Mandarin is taught in singapore; is that the MOE does not teach Chinese literature or classics or history. And when they teach composition writing; they teach by getting our students to just blindly memorize passages and flowery language for use in all possible topics- definitely not the way to write, not even in English.</p>

              <p>No big deal; it's basically a question asking if Singaporeans
              think themselves too smart. No further detail. No biggie.</p>
              <p>I think Singaporeans can be overly proud, the way they treat
              domestic workers and the way they look down on other southeast
              asians from the lesser developed areas. Singaporeans are generally
              not polite/friendly, but i dont think that has anything to do with

              <p><em>Yes, I am a Chinese (PRC). But that Singaporean mother is
              also a Chinese person from Fujian (originally), what makes her so
              special?</em></p>
              <p>==================</p>
              <p>So when you Singaporean guys read all this, dont dismiss these
              words as nothing.</p>
              <p>THis mother has a point; i remember my nephew's playing with
              Singaporeans hdb playgrounds. Well my nephew didn't have problems,
              he was white and pretty burly for his age, he could defend himself,
              but i remember the local chinese kids not wanting to play with the
              malay kids. ANd my nephew had his toys taken repeatedly, but the
              parents were sorry and apologetic, but they weren;t to the other
              kids. So there is that preferential treatment.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are prejudiced toward PRC Chinese, yes i agree to
              some extent, PRCs are loud, obnoxious and can be crude. But so can
              the Singaporeans. I remember back in the early 1990s, we would
              complain about the Singaporeans being rude, dirty (Standing on
              toilet seats), spitting in the street etc. Yet today in 2009,
              barely 10 years... the Singaporeans are holding their noses up at
              other wogs. It's just really interesting.. especially since
              Singaporeans today are a product of endless campaigns designed to
              make people "nice"</p>
              <p>-smile campaign</p>
              <p>-courtesy campaign</p>
              <p>-babies campaign haha</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But i really do find it strange that we have a LOT of PRCs here,
              You can tell them by the number of children. If they have more than
              2 children, their definitely PRC haha! I think it's the government
              efforts to maintain Chinese as the majority ethnicity here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But yeah. Guys, we should be mindful of how we behave.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another example of Singaporean prejudice:</p>
              <p>When i flew SIA with my nephews, they always got the toys and
              the extra attention from stewardesses for being white and cute and
              preferential. But the hong kong kids didn't get toys, or visits to
              the cockpit... i wonder why. This really angered me, and they
              apologized.</p>
              <p>Okay im done.</p>
              <p> </p>
