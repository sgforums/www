              <p>So Americans should worsip Gordon Brown and his equally witty Brits?</p>
              <p>What I don't like about PRC is that they believe the world has to conform to their standards.</p>
              <p>It happens in the UK where I reside right now. They can't even speak English proper even after many years in their host country.</p>
              <p>They are anti-social, rude, arrogant and no wonder the ang mohs don't like them.</p>
              <p>Ang moh always surprise my engrish so good. Thanks PRC for really giving a bad name for all chinese people. I always remind them I am SINGAPOREAN.</p>
              <p>ABC and BBC (British Born Chinese) can speak both Cantonese, Chinese or English really well.</p>
              <p>But PRC remain arrogant.</p>
              <p>Funny thing is, even the BBCs don't like the PRC. No one likes them.</p>

              Haha... our ancestors are bad doesn't mean we (a few generations down the line) are bad. At least we (Singaporean Chinese) are slowly becoming better (more civilised and westernised). How about HK people then? Aren't they considered China citizens too?

              <p>Hey, you the northern Chinese, Mandarin is not the international language.   Many people do without Mandarin in business dealings.    They need to learn to do as the Romans do in Rome.   </p>
