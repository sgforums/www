            <div class='col-md body'>When I first started my software business in the late 90s, I too did not have much inkling of business strategy. All I had was technical knowledge, some contacts, a product and a business plan.<br><br>I agree that you don't have to look at sustainability strategies immediately. However, marketing and pricing strategies are a must. The moment you price anything at all you are engaging in some form of strategy, whether you know it or not. About six months down the line (if you are still in business), then you should start looking at sustainability issues. The moment you start hiring (I only started hiring permanent staff after 2 years), it opens a new can of worms. Back then I did not have my MBA yet but I wish that I did have some of that knowledge. It never hurts to read up more and strategize before jumping in. Having a proper plan will also greatly assist in securing funding from venture capitalists. However, I have never had to ask for funding - my first projects funded the subsequent one and it just kept rolling from there. But if you require funding, no one is going to listen to your case if you go in there with just "passion" - they will laugh at you and ask you to go back to rethink your business.</div>
