            <div class='col-md body'>A story from the mid-1930s, U. of Edinburgh medical school,<br>second-term human physiology course, Prof. Kenneth Ivors,<br>Instructor:<br>"Good morning, class. Before we begin today's lecture, I should<br>like to discover how well ye have been tracking the previous<br>material. Miss MacMaster, will ye stand?" {She stands.)<br>"Can ye tell me, which organ of the body achieves 10 times its<br>normal size when it is excited?"<br>{She stammers, reddens, says nothing.}<br>"Ye may sit down. Mr. Campbell, can ye answer that question?"<br>"It is the pupil of the eye, sir."<br>"Very good. Now, Miss MacMaster, I have three things to say to<br>you: One, you have not done your homework,<br>Two, you have a dirty mind, and<br>Three, you're in for a big disappointment."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In 1993, the American Government funded a study to see why the<br>head of a man's penis was larger than the shaft. After one year<br>and $180,000, they concluded that the reason the head was larger<br>than the shaft was to give the man more pleasure during sex.<br><br>After the US published the study, France decided to do their own<br>study. After $250,000, and 3 years of research, they concluded<br>that the reason was to give the woman more pleasure during sex.<br><br>China, unsatisfied with these findings, conducted their own<br>study.

            <div class='col-md body'>It was time for Father John's Saturday night bath and young<br>Sister Magdalene Edwards had prepared the bath water and towels<br>just the way the old nun had instructed. Sister Magdalene Edwards<br>was also instructed not to look at Fr.

"I've been saved."<br>"Saved? And how did that fine thing come about?" asked the old<br>nun.<br>"Well, when Fr. John was soaking in the tub, he asked me to wash<br>him, and while I was washing him he guided my hand down between<br>his legs where he said the Lord keeps the Key to Heaven."<br>"Did he now," said the old nun evenly.<br>Sister Magdalene continued, "And Fr. John said that if the Key to<br>Heaven fit my lock, the portals of Heaven would be opened to me<br>and I would be assured of salvation and eternal peace. And then<br>Father John guided his Key to Heaven into my lock."<br>"Is that so?" said the old nun matter-of-factly.<br><br>"At first it hurt terribly, but Fr.

And no, we are never going to think of it that<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; way.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; * Crying is blackmail.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; * Ask for what you want.

We refuse to<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; answer.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; * If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; * Let us ogle. We are going to look anyway; it's genetic.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; * You can either ask us to do something or tell us how you want it done.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Not both. If you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; * Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; commercials.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; * Christopher Columbus did not need directions, and neither do we.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; * The relationship is never going to be like it was the first two months<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; we were going out. Get over it. And quit whining to your girlfriends.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; * ALL men see in only 16 colours, like Windows default settings. Peach,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; for example, is a fruit, not a colour. We have no idea what mauve is.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; * If it itches, it will be scratched. We do that.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; * We are not mind readers and we never will be. Our lack of mind-reading<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; ability is not proof of how little we care about you.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; * If we ask what is wrong and you say "nothing," we will act like<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; nothing's wrong. We know you are lying, but it is just not worth the hassle.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; * If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; don't want to hear.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; * When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Really.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; * Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are prepared to<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; discuss such topics as navel lint, the offside rule, or motor bikes.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; * If you choose to wear revealing clothes, you loose your rights to<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; complain if we MEN look and stare.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; * You have enough clothes.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; * You have too many shoes.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; * No you really do have too many shoes.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; * It is neither in your best interest or ours to take the quiz together.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; No, it doesn't matter which quiz.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; * BEER is as exciting for us as handbags are for you.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; * I'm in shape. ROUND is a shape.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you for reading this; Yes, I know, I have to sleep on the couch tonight,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; but did you know we really don't mind that, it's like camping. .<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> </div></blockquote> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Another essay.
