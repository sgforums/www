He admitted to five charges, from insulting a woman modesty to theft.<br><br></strong></blockquote>When a person commit a lesser infringement like man wearing bikini (pink) at 3.15am in public Â– the police search his home to find evidence of other more serious crime, check through all criminal records for past crimes (charged or not), and compile all the records and charge the person to make sure that the person is punished sufficiently (not wasting court time).<br><br>If there is no other evidence of criminal records, the chances is that the man wearing bikini at 3.15am will be given warning and let go, I think.<br></div>

How come this insluting thing applies to woman only?<br><br>I feel insulted when i see woman wearing man's clothes, like those butches binding their breasts like men in public pools.<br><br>Don't you think that current laws favour women too much?</div>
