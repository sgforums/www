            <div class='col-md body'>This topic recently crosses my mind as I ponder upon a problem that requires me to look deeper into my moral self.<br><br>The things that separate us humans from mere animals are few but one that strikes me the most is the concept of socialization and the ability to philosophize. We think, therefore we are...this quote came to my mind quite frequently when I engaged in some mind stimulating exercise. From barbaric livings to full-fledged civilizations, we have indeed come a long way. The question I kept on asking myself is..."Does morality plays an important part in social conditioning and the betterment of the human race"<br><br>To further narrow down my thoughts, I became more focused on the idea of retribution and karma. My knowledge on this field is profoundly lacking and I make do with my presumption that I do know bits and pieces. Karma and retribution rest most at home in Asiatic philosophies and being Singaporean Chinese, I grew up on this belief. Most of my actions since youth are governed by this simple (some say superstitious) and effective thinking. Do not do unto others what you do not wish others to do unto you has been my motto all these while. Let me give you an example.<br><br>My father was a hawker. There was this time in which I had my dinner in a coffeeshop. The hawker undercharged me without knowing it and at that moment, I can just walk off scoot freeÂ…satisfied with the knowledge of having a meal only at half the price. But I did not. Instead, I went back and clear up the mistake with him. All this for the simple reason of karma and retribution. For I believed that my actions will result in my father experiencing the same thing too, as in undercharging his customers.<br><br>Thus, is moral underline by fear? For what are retributions and karma but your bad deeds back to haunt you. Would we live in a better world if everybody subscribes to these beliefs?  And why not? Why do we need a watchman for, when we ourselves is the best watchman? Â“Hey, better not do that manÂ…never know when might kanna me backÂ” The law might not catches youÂ…but you can bet your ass that Mr. Retribution is watching. And yeah, Madame Karma is just waiting to get her hands on you when you are done with this life.<br><br>It might sounds hocus pocus and intransigence, all these talks about R and K. But the fear about such things will never go away. Will you be more aware of your deeds if several of your recent actions resulted in also immediate repercussions??? Would you not believe that retribution is always just lurking around the corner???<br><br>There was a study done on superstitions and curses. Voodoo was so successful back in the early ages was due to its success. Most people who are cursed seldom lives more than 2 weeks. Studies concluded that the victims of such curses are made known about their situation and they usually just wilted and dieÂ…so strong is their belief. If we can properly encouraged this concept of R and K, would we not be in a similar positions too??? IsnÂ’t this school of thoughts another way of social conditioning, to make man less barbaric and revert back to their animal instincts???<br><br>I believed in realism and this philosophy has been my underlying mechanism in my attitude towards life. I am a moral person because I am afraid of retribution. Does that makes me a coward or any less moral??? You tell me.<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Hata-San,<br><br>When I am younger, I used to believe in the Christian God, then when I get older, I realize that I lack faith in God, so I become an atheist which is totally on the other side. But I suppose that for me now, I still adhere to the Christian virtues, which are also embraced in other faiths or moral philosphies.<br><br>I don't know where there is really a proper distinction between good and evil in modern society. I felt that the moral code we have in these days is decided by the society of this time. An example will go like, people in China of the past condemns adultery and would punish the adulterous pair by throwing them into the river, but look at today, the matter is settled by divorce. In short, there seemed to be a moral degradation of values but I don't think so, because morals are so relative.<br><br>So how does the discussion of morals come into the picture of retribution and karma? Well, believe it or not, the older I get, I realise that there is retribution and karma, based on the backlashes made by my own actions in the past. Perhaps, the question is that once a person suffer the retribution and acknowledges the matter in an repentant manner, he or she should move on. However, when I look back, some of the actions were not considered "bad" because there are people who would say that they would have done that as well.. So I guess, retribution and karma are more of the consequences based on a certain moral action which one has done in the past. The world is not really black or white but formed by shades of grey.<br><br>After all the backlashes and of course, I have paid enough for the "bad" deeds which I have done, I suppose I just live my life happily in another way... I once asked myself recently suddenly while watching people passing the cafe by the window pane, whether I am happy, and then I looked again and smile,"I may not be eternally happy because I have not found that someone, but at least now I appreciate what I have and be contented with I have." In that sense, I would prefer to be nice to people and help them when needed and not expecting anything back... Well, I always greeted the waitress in Starbucks cafe in my town, and one day, they actually gave me free coffee.. That I thought was good karma at work...<br><br>I do believe that one should not expect any rewards when doing good, hence there does not exist good karma, but retribution due to bad karma, yes, I do believe that.... Life is  suffering, and that is how it keeps people going....<br><br>Merely opinions of mine... Just two pennies worth..<br><br>yours,<br>Prodigal<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights. However, love is not about finding someone to relieve you, but love is about you devoting your heart and soul to love that someone, even if you know that someone do not love you the way you do."<br>- Prodigal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>But think about it, how many would have actually though retribution when they have done the misdeed? When they gossip behind ppl's back, backstabbing and all, have they considered the consequences and the outcome? Retribution and karma? Yeah!If u were to backstab ppl, ppl will backstab u but u will get backstabbed too even u did not do anything wrong. But it is the evil of Man that brings woe to themselves, it is an endless cycle.<br>Imagine those gals who always break hearts or woman who cheat on guys or vice versa. Will they get cheated back or will they take revenge for having cheated?<br>How about those businessman who go through unscruplous methods to get their contracts and deals? Being unethical in the things they do to climb the corporate ladder? DO they know what is retribution? Maybe on the next generation?<br><br>My, my this is what the world is made of, all kinds of ppl. I say... the most vicious will be the tongue, the taming of the tongue seems highly unattainable, esp in woman. I think the guys are also getting the hang of it as well. All those tabloids and parapazzi is driving the celebrities crazy and we ( I admit I read them too.) just have a good laugh and make that the gossip of the day though it is simply not our business. " Mind your Ps and Qs" is what my high school teacher always says. Don't do anything to others if you do not want others to do it on u!Be graceful and merciful, I say, to make this world a better place!Are we born evil or what?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Trinity (edited 07 July 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for all those replies flowing (wish i can use the word flooding instead  :p)in, time to add in my thoughts to your views.<br><br>To lex,<br>thanks<br><br>To Fireice,<br>Is it conscience, or something else that you are talking about. Because to me, it's the fear of bad karma that deter me from doing evil deeds (Laws of the land aside). Conscience??? Do I and you possess that?? Maybe, but i wouldn't put too much thoughts into it. Is conscience what the Chinese call "Liang2 Xing1" I doubt much people have that.<br><br>To Proddie,<br>Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Yes, some actions done in the folly of youth always return to haunt us and who is to say what's the shade of grey in this matter??? Certain things are so blurred in nature that i seriously wonder how Mama Karma would apply her weighting scales. Like you, i tend to take things easy as i grew older. However, at the back of my mind, i can't help but question very moral questions that came along in consultation with Papa Retribution and Mama Karma. I guess old habits die hard.<br><br>To Trinity,<br>Hallo!!! Gald to see you taking your precious time to post in this thread. Reading through your examples on why few people reflect their unsurplous behaviours, I would say that their sense of Papa and Mama is not ingrained in them yet. Gal heartbreakers and Cheating man might be less proud of their actions if Papa and Mama starts to dish out their punishments. Ditto for all those businessmen you mentioned. Which brings me to the point, what happens if a gal continues to breat hearts and businessmen continues to con people, and worst of all, seems impervious to Mama and Papa. Oh well, their just desserts will come to them in another form. Oh oh, trust me on that account, it will.<br>and yes, i do think we are born evil.<br><br>To jiliu,<br>thanks for ur advice<br><br>To moose,<br>yeah, hahaha, does sounds sexist didn't it.  :p<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have been a buddhist for 12-14 long years, and what I am going to tell you now, maybe<br>is satanic for your level of understanding in buddhist philosophy.<br><br>In any case, buddhist philosophy is one of my most well read philosophies, so there is a<br>lot I can say about this.<br><br>Retribution and Karma are conditional entities in buddhist philosophy - they exist by virtue<br>of a lack of understanding or a lack of enlightenment. Once enlightenment is reached,<br>retribution and karma make no sense to him.<br><br>Let me explain, buddhist nirvana aims at depersonalizing the self, and since retribution<br>and karma precedes from an assumption of self (something which retribution can inflicts<br>its effects on), believing in Retribution and Karma is actually the greatest hurdle to cross<br>before mental enlightenment - Nirvana.<br><br>I hope I am making sense to you, because many buddhists do not find me making any<br>sense at all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i am a buddhist too,but i would say that i do not accept wholesale about all tt they teach.<br>karma: i believe in it,that if u do good u'll have a good life and if u do bad u'll suffer for it.<br>but the thing is not to be controlled by it. a person should do good out of his own conscience, and not because he wants good fortune to befall him in future. and he should not commit unforgivable doings because he is afraid of retribution,but because it is morally wrong to harm others in any way.<br>believing in karma and retribution does help a person to be more responsible in his actions,but don't u think it's the reason tt lies behind ur actions and inactions tt is more impt?to do or dun do something because u noe it is morally correct is better than because u are afraid of the future.<br>this is my personal opinion too. i hope i m not harsh in any way.just tt the topic triggered off some ideas  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bingo! There in the kitchen, hovering over the stove, was my momÂ—and directly in front of her on a large tray were twenty-four of the most beautiful, mouth-watering chocolate chip cookies I had ever seen. They were fresh, warm, and (best of all) ready to eat!<br><br>My stomach was growling. My mouth was watering. I had to have some of those cookies.<br><br>I looked up at my beautiful, loving Mom, and we exchanged smiles. Politely, I said, Â“Mama, could I have some of those cookies, please?Â”<br><br>Mother continued smiling. She replied, Â“Son, IÂ’m sorry but youÂ’ll have to wait. ItÂ’s too close to suppertime. YouÂ’ll ruin your appetite.Â”<br><br>I thought, Â“Ruin my appetite? Who cares? I want some cookies.Â” Forcing a smile, I begged, Â“Please, Mom, I really want some cookies now. How about just two?Â”<br><br>Mom held her ground. Â“Not now, Steve. It will ruin your dinner.Â”<br><br>In that moment, my whole attitude changed. I was not just hungryÂ—I was mad! That which could satisfy my overwhelming desire was just inches from my nose and mouth. I thought, Either I get them now while they are fresh, warm and chewy, or I wait until after supper when theyÂ’re cold and hard. Mama, why are you doing this to me?<br><br>But it wasnÂ’t Mama! It was my mind. There was a warfare going on inside. The one voice or power wanted me to do right, while the other wanted me to do wrong. It wasnÂ’t just with the cookiesÂ—it was also there when Mom and Dad wanted me to go to bed, when they told me to take out the garbage, and at other times.<br><br>The one power seemed to lean toward obeying my parents, and the other always wanted me to have my own way, no matter what. And now these powers were fighting it out again.<br><br>One voice was saying, Â“Cool it! Obey your mother. Go back to your room. You can have some cookies after dinner.Â”<br><br>The other voice argued, Â“You were in your own room minding your own business when that aroma drew you in here. ItÂ’s your motherÂ’s fault; she made the cookies. The least she could do is give you some of them.Â”<br><br>It was no contest. I gave in to the secÂ­ond voice again. Now I just had to decide how to carry out my will. Should I get mad and holler at Mom? Should I cry and do the you donÂ’t love meÂ” routine? Or, I could grab some cookies and eat them before Mom caught me?<br><br>But the second voice had a better idea: Â“Wait until Mom is done in the kitchen. When she leaves, sneak back in and take them otit of the big, porcelain pig cookie jar. They will still be warm and chewy.<br><br>Sure enough, in just minutes Mom had gone to her room, leaving the kitchen unÂ­guarded. Carefully and quietly, I tiptoed into the kitchen, placed a chair by the counter, climbed up, reached in and grabbed a handful.<br><br>Aahh! Success! Back in my room, the stolen treasure was gone within seconds. My stomach was satisfied. But something else was wrong; I didnÂ’t feel good inside. I was nervous.<br><br>My heart was beating faster than norÂ­mal. My conscience let me know I had done wrong. I was guilty, I had given in to my selfish voice, but now I didnÂ’t like this guilty feeling. I wish it would just go away, but it didnÂ’t. Should I just learn to live with it?<br><br>Stone Cold Heart by Stephen Hill.<br><br>This man tells his true story of his past.....his terrible past.....<br><a href="http://www.yesweb.f2s.com/praise/truth.htm" rel="nofollow"> Continue to read on..... </a><br><br></div>
