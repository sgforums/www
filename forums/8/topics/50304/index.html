Where are all the good-old-traditional trashing/communicate/talk things out?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Understand this point: Without the above element - relation will fall eventually and when regret take places - its probably too late - you created a crack out of the vase.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Seek for her forgiveness or wanting this relationship back? If you still desire the relationship - before popping the question back: talk about this existing problem first and seek for mutual compromising. If forgiveness is all you seek, forget about everything and move on with your life - with love automatically comes hurts. Its both positive and negative energy of the word Love and its naturally. Nobody's at fault, nobody is to blame.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
