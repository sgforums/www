            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting, I was thinking about religons just now. Back in the ancient, the world is filled with gods. As in people's heart, as the world start to modernize I wonder how would religon change with time. Is pop/rock part of the modernization of religon? Then Christianity is leading the trend. LOL.<br><br>Another question I was wandering, what's the real motive of a christian? Did they become christians because they wanna be saved by God after they died? As in saved from the devil. Why do we need god(In general)? Is it just about after death? I have no religon and I don't see all christians are happier than me! =P</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jack,<br><br>Being a Christian calls for no motives. You become a Christian because you finally see the light in realizing what this world and its creation is all about. It's not about man himself taking charge, but that God Himself first took charge when he created the universe.<br><br>Once you understand and accept this very simple piece of truth, everything falls into place, including your question as to why you need God. Simply because he's in control of your destiny. But you have that choice of finding yourself the right destiny.<br><br>Once you understand and accept this very simple piece of truth, questions like 'Why did Satan fall from Heaven if Heaven is perfect'? need not be answered. Because God is in charge.<br><br>Remember - He writes the script the way He wants to. And who are we to change that?<br><br>But back to the issue. I think most Christians would agree pop culture has no place in God's heart. Please do not be deceived by Ho Yeow Sun's balancing act of pop singing and church-going.<br><br>God may move with the times, but His methods of doing so will always remain UNCONTROVERSIAL. Man find His ways controversial because they choose to read in between the Bible's words too much.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>According to a friend in CHC, she said since Sun Ho started out her singing career ard 100,000 ppl are saved.  She was with them for 1 of the trip (they'll watch the concert/performance first, the second half will be preaching and alter call for ppl to respond.)<br><br>If i'm there, i'll not enjoy what i see. Simply because i'm there to watch concert not preaching.  For God sake, ITS A CONCERT!!<br><br>If she wants to sing cancel off the preaching, if she wants both be a gospel singer.  Now, that she's breaking into America market and 'she forgot to bring her preacher along'.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> Don't even know what she wants to do.  If she cant make up her mind, QUIT!! By the way, she have made LOTS of money.</div>
