            <div class='col-md body'>Lately, I coloured my hair, but when I met some friends who did not meet each other for a long time, I was teased by them coz they thought that coloring hair is out of trend now. Last year, when there was a fashion for colouring hair, most of my friends around also joined the trend and coloured their hair too and they even  persuaded me to go colouring with them, but I did not. Some of them already coloured  their hair black when the trend was over. They are such high-fashioned gals, in their eyes. I usually am the one who can't catch up with fashions. I admit this frankly.  Anyway, I like the colour of my hair now.  So  I am not  angry with their comments, just laugh it off.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>This is only a small matter, and I don't bear it in mind, but it brings me a thought about fashions. Living in a modern society, fashions more or less affect our life. It can direct us to follow a certain style of conduct.<br><br>Being regarded as the old-fashioned one, am I really insensitive to fashion? It may not be the only reason. Where do we get the information about fashion?  Most are from mass media, especially the fashion magazines. If you get a fashion magazine on hand, it can tell u what is up to date in fashion: just follow it and you  will be the most "IN" person. Nowadays, most of us young ppl like to go after trends and follow the ideas from the fashion magazines. Especially for the ppl aged between 14 to 20. Some of them just follow the fashion blindly, That is the reason why youth has quite similar taste in fashions and are similar in dressing and conduct. No offence to anyone who is keen on fashion, after all, not everyone can  try the most " IN" things. for example,  guys wear earrings. Only the young guys dare to try it. The younger ppl are more willing to try the new things. Maybe age is another reason for me always being out of trend. For the people of twenty something or older, they may be more choosy at following the trend. issit?<br><br>Actually, fashions relate to the global culture. We can't talk about fashions without mentioning global fashions and mass media. As we know that Japanese culture affect us so much nowadays. if someone interest in this, I would like to hear more about it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, go advise ur frds to get their fashion ideas straight n updated lah!!! Hahaha!!! Colouring the hair was highly popular during the past 2 years becoz of the new way of hair colouring... in multi hues (be it same tone or not). Not juz hair colouring alone.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Black, at a time (in fact, a very short period), was considered "in". But it never really took off... Wif the exception of aunties wif greying hairs.  :p<br><br>------------------<br>ming4 zhong1 ruo4 you3 zhong1 xu1 you3<br>ming4 zhong1 ruo4 wu2 mo4 qiang2 qiu2</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear kitty,<br><br>I did not say that my friends considered black colour of hair as the "in" fashion. Black hair is the natural colour of us Asian. When the trend of coloring hair was out, people tend to favorite in natural colour, so they follow the trend again to make their hair black as "natural". That's what I mean.<br><br>Quote: "Black, at a time (in fact, a very short period), was considered "in"."  really?  was black hair also considered as fashion? when and where?  ahahaha,  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> if u don't tell me, I really don't know this "fashion" leh. Again, it proves that I am old-fashioned liao.  :p<br><br>Anyway, that is not the most I concern about whether colouring hair is still popular or what is updated fashion now, but the "following fashion" that matter.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
