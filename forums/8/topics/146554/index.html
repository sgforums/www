'<br><br>Response:<br><br>Jesus Himself said to 'let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven.'<br><br>I fully agree that what makes a person a saint isn't the favour that he has found with men; but I also deny that if a person is a saint then the good deeds which he does could fail to be made manifest to those who are in a position to observe them.<br><br>If we really did our duty to God, then it will not matter to us if we gained the respect of our fellowmen; but more often than not doing our duty to God entails helping the least of Christ's brethren in a world where there are so many opportunities to help those who are less fortunate than ourselves on so many levels; in a world like ours, our good deeds in this regard will generally therefore not fail to go unnoticed by most people.<br><br>That was my point - stop distorting it.<br><br>Finally, ask any informed Catholic whether he will not be offended by your statement that he is not a Christian and you will then be told by him how much he thinks of your lying claim that you respect Catholics.<br><br>You are deceived.<br><br></div>
