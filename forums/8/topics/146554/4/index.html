            <div class='col-md body'><br>All I remembered about protestant was that when my friend converted from a Buddhist (to escape some troubles she cannot deal with), she started to denounce her old friends. 3 of us was at her wedding as her "auntie" and we all know we lost her as a person/individual. She tried to tell us how good the religion was but we know she is the sort that is easy to convert and would believe in whatever twisted things people put up to her ... so my view of xtian is not very good all this time (I am always approached and told how I would head to hell and my parents will go with me) and then to lose a friend to religion..

            <div class='col-md body'>also another interesting fact that i found out was that the vatican once condemned the entire spanish netherlands which is today's netherlands to death for "heresy" . also another interestng fact, spain, italy and portugal had no non-catholics until reccent times probably 200? years ago? all the moors/muslims,protestants were all expelled, same thing with france where all the french protestants the hugenots? were driven out of the country to england or the new world, which probably accounts for the fact that many englishmen have french names like "aimes".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by laurence82:</div><div class="quote_body">interestingly, the stuarts period begun when elizabeth make james, king of scotland, the heir to the english throne, therefore known as james 1 of england, as repentance because she killed his mother, mary, queen of scots <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>To be fair, Elizabeth executed her cousin very reluctantly...that's why she kept her imprisoned for so long. It was a difficult time to rule when you knew that a sizeable number of your nobles were catholic and leaned towards Mary, Queen of Scots, who was catholic. As Elizabeth was the virgin queen, it was quite clear that Mary of Scots would be the natural successor. The question was, would she bide her time or would she try to overthrow Elizabeth?<br><br>I think Elizabeth was loathed to execute Mary, not for reasons of kinship, but it would be the equivalent of declaring war against Spain. With Mary dead, there was no chance of a catholic on the throne of England, something Philip of Spain (Mary Tudor's husband) wanted. Sure enough, the Spanish Armada came soon after..<br><br>Of course in the end, Elizabeth died without heir and the next in line to the throne was her cousin's son, James VI of Scotland, who succeeded as James I of England. Thus the crowns were united..<br><br>Incidentally, Henry VIII tried to divorce his wife Catherine of Aragon to marry Ann Bowelyn mainly because he wanted a male heir to consolidate his position. Unfortunately both women gave him daughters, Mary and Elizabeth Tudor.</div>

Take my secondary teacher as a example, she says those who dont believe in GOD will go to hell. Wtf?? And she says this infront of the whole class.
