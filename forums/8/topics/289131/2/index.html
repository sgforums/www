He just felt compassion for the old lady who still has to slog to make a living.  Don't you feel that way sometimes?<br><br>Yes, perhaps she is as you say, "willing and able to support herself by working", but we can also conclude that perhaps she has no choice but to continue to work to make a living.<br><br>I hope your experience with the Ah Pek who threw the dollar you gave him have not hardened your heart against all these poor ah peks and aunties.<br><br>We may not be able to support their living, but we should at least show some compassion when we come across them.  Two dollars may not be much for you, but may be a very pleasant surprise for the old woman.</div>
