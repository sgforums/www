            <div class='col-md body'>since u wan to cry, dunno this story of mine will help... but hope it will really help....<br><br>Hi, to whoever is reading this, I am going to tell u a story about my ex-girlfriend and myself. This is a true story and not a fragment of my imagination. 4 years ago, on a day, which would change my life forever, I met my ex-girlfriend, Sayang. It all happened like this... My best friend DD chanced upon a couple of girls. He ventured to tease them, in the hope of making friends with them. He succeeded. But being the shy guy that I am, I stayed in the shadows of obscurity. Sayang took a fancy to me..... I got to know this when she confided her affection for me to DD. DD persuaded me to woo her but I told him that its not possible because she wasnÂ’t pretty at all. DD then suggested that I woo her for the sake of sex. I hesitated for a while before agreeing. We came up with a plan to snare her. I was to pretend that I was interested in participating in an imaginary threesome with DD and another gal. I was tp pretend to ask her for advice, in the process gain more information about her. She advised me not to...... She showered me with care and concerned..... She was truly concerned....... I was amazed by her sincerity and self-less devotion to me...... Never in my life have I been this touched by a gal...... I never knew that a plain Jane like her could have a heart of gold, the melodious soul of an Angel ..... I felt like a jerk then. I couldnÂ’t even begin to understand why I had come up with this devious plan to trap an innocent soul like her. Before I could even stop to think, I was in love with her. Totally and uncontrollably in love with her. I couldnÂ’t, for the love of God, stop myself from falling into this endless pit of love...... After a month of phone calls, I gathered enough courage to ask her to be my other half. True, it was over the phone, but I can still remember the joy upon hearing her agree. It was to be the happiest moment of my life. From then onwards, my life took a different turn. I was a changed man..... It was like my life was complete. Totally and wonderfully complete. Looking back, I realised that she was the one bright spot in my otherwise gloomy existence in this cold cruel world. I still can remember the first time I held her hands..... We were crossing the road one day and I just pretended to guide her across the road. I didnÂ’t let go of her hands after weÂ’ve crossed the road. I canÂ’t help but to recall her slight blush..... What wouldnÂ’t I give for her to give me that blushing face again. ItÂ’s the face of an angel. Minor things like these are all buried deep within my mind. Though I never let her know how much actually remember of such stuff, I really did. I regret that I didnÂ’t take that chance to show her how much I cared. At this point of time, my life was at its peak..... Everything was wonderful. I can go tell you every little thing that has happened. I can because all these incidents are still so vivid in my mind. I can remember the incident when I told her off about paging me endlessly..... She was crushed. She apologised to me..... Frankly speaking I felt like shit. I didnÂ’t mean to sound so harsh.... It just came out my freaking mouth. I regretted like hell. But manly pride prevented saying sorry. Damn my pride. But life with her was peppered with childish yet unforgettable memories. Memories that I will bring to my grave. I remembered the first time when I kissed her hand. It may seem to be insignificant to many. But such is the love I have for her; such is the foundation of my affection for her. She was pleasantly shocked but very pleased. I still can remember the look on her face....... I still smile at it. I was overly protective and possessive, as many of my friends will testify. But I hope that you can understand this. I cared for her more than anything in this world....... I was afraid that the world was going to bring her hurt. I wanted to shield from her from the cruelties of the world. Please donÂ’t look at me if I am some over protective jerk. Because I am not. Up till now IÂ’ve had been telling you about the times and feelings I encountered during my wonderful time with her. I thank you for your patience. Perhaps its time I let you know a little about myself. I didnÂ’t have much of a happy life. I m very shy. Many call me a shellfish..... Because I will withdraw into the little world whenever unhappy incidents hurt me. My behaviour is considered as eccentric by many because I behave differently from others. I have always thought that life is a drag..... Never believing that any single person can bring me happiness. Sayang proved me wrong. She can, she did and she always will. Perhaps its time I talk about incidents leading to our break-up..... I must confess that I have done many nasty things to her. I made her cry often..... Just so that I can coax her. I never meant to hurt her in anyway.....God knows that I wonÂ’t do it again. Perhaps itÂ’s just that sadistic part of me that is bent on making her cry.....I regret now. I can remember all the things that she has done for me.... Well just to let you know, SayangÂ’s parents didn't like me.... Well there was once that I was sick, and she changed into her school uniform and came to my place at 2 am in the morning. Just to keep me company and put an ice pack on my head.... I told her that I appreciate it. But in truth, I was weeping at the love she has for me. I never knew that I could be so touched. She gives me a body rub whenever I am feeling stressed out.... It may not seem much to you, but itÂ’s the way that she does it that has touch the inner depth of my soul. She cooks, she washes, she cleans for me..... She is akin to the perfect wife. I can still remember my absolute resolve to take her as my lawfully wedded wife. I still do....... If I hadnÂ’t met her, I wouldnÂ’t have like her. If I hadnÂ’t like her, I wouldnÂ’t love her. If I hadnÂ’t love her, I wouldnÂ’t miss her. But I did, I do and I will. Her absence has taught me a cold harsh lesson. When she was around, I didnÂ’t treat her like the princess that she is, now that sheÂ’s gone, I have realised that I didnÂ’t cherish the treasure that God has given me. I didnÂ’t know that sheÂ’ll leave such a big void in my life. I am sorry. Oh yeah, I was in Australia for 2 months for an exercise. Sayang wrote a special diary.... She recorded all the SMS that I sent her from Australia. She cried countless time.... My heart broke everyime she shed a tear for me. It was every bit as hell for me as it as for her..... I can still almost feel the aching need to feel her gentle touch, the reassuring kisses..... In fact, I do feel the need now...... Well, the catalyst for our break up was Counter Strike. DonÂ’t be astounded be this.... No, I am not a compulsive gamer. ItÂ’s just that the last few weeks of our relationship, I sensed that something was amissed. I tried to pull up my socks but the damn C.S was there to distract me. I succumbed to the temptation of online gaming.....That was the last straw. She told me that she wanted to leave me in search of freedom.... But alas she couldnÂ’t do it because she missed me. God knows IÂ’ll miss her. But the bloody C.S took my love away. IÂ’ll never touch C.S again. Before you go thinking that its ridiculous for her to leave me over such insignificant fault, I need to let you understand the pains that she has gone through. She felt neglected...... I admit with shame that I hadnÂ’t showered her with all the attention and love that she deserved. I was a jerk. She has an unhappy life with her family and the only consolation was I. But the selfish me didnÂ’t care enough for her. I was glad that she tolerated me for so long. How I wish that things had been different...... You might wonder why the ending is so vague and short...... because this couple of weeks has been a complete blur to me. Faces glide and slink away..... I canÂ’t recognise anyone. I hear voices.... But they donÂ’t register at all. I would really want to write about how I feel and what I have done wrong..... I really donÂ’t know now. I will come to understand in time what exactly went wrong ..... But right now I am contented to think fondly of her. I just want to remember the times when I help her squeeze black heads... the time when I startled her by giving her a sudden hug when she was cooking dinner for me..... The time when I felt the childish pangs of jealousy when she chatted with other guys..... The time when she gave me a pout after I tease her..... I miss her...... The tears I have shed for her is........ I donÂ’t know how to describe them. If tears can wash away the hurt that I am feeling now and the hurt that IÂ’ve caused her, I will gladly cry myself blind..... Thank you for bearing with me through out this long and tiresome story...... I hope that you have gained some insight into my life.... The wonderful life I had within my grasp with Sayang. I hope that whoever you are, you will treasure your fairer half..... DonÂ’t take the path I took. I understand that when you are with someone for long, you are bound to take your partner for granted. ItÂ’s the truth.... I know because I am paying dearly for this cold had truth. Given a second chance, I promise that I will never commit the same mistakes again. No, I swear that it will never happen again. But itÂ’s too late now. SheÂ’s gone from my life and it hurts like hell. I feel like I m so hollow inside. I donÂ’t dare to go anywhere, because her shadows are lurking everywhere..... I donÂ’t know.... Guess itÂ’s my punishment. Well, this can go on and on, and IÂ’ll rather not. Please, for the love of God, give your loved ones more care and attention. True love does not have a happy ending, it simply doesnÂ’t end. Baby, I miss you...... Regards...<br><br></div>
