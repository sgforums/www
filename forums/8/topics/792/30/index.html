            <div class='col-md body'>There was once a good buddy of mine, who brought a lot of smiles into everyone's lives. He was a good friend, a good brother, but yet, he led a painful life. He had a girlfriend before, who he tried to cheer her up. I still remember during new year eve ( 1 jan ) we were in sentosa, trying to spend the eve. his girlfriend was not able to go out due to parents restrictions, and she left him a voicemail. The voicemail said something about she wanting to see sunrise, and this friend of mine, without any other considerations, he dashed all the way to Changi Point just to fulfill the wish came true. He tried by taking pictures of the sunrise, forgetting all the so called planned-fun with us beforehand. But we didn't complain, because we knew how dear he was to everyone, and he was trying to make someone he cared most happy. But the pictures ended up a waste, as the girl didn't even bother to look at them afterwards. He took them back home, with despair, but well, in the end he smiled. Know why?<br><br>He said, "At least she smiled for a while, that is good enough." The girl broke up with him soon, and we at last knew why the pictures were turned down. He was a substitute for the girl's ex boyfriend, and he didn't complain either. He knew it, but yet he just allowed himself to be hurt. We did try to scold him, but he would just smile and say, "I don't think you will reject someone when someone is sad, and when the person is happy enough for what you did, you won't really bother about pain or hurt."<br><br>They broke off, he was happy, but we knew that it was a painful thing. He took a lot pills one or two weeks later, ended up in hospital for suicide. What happened? The girl didn't even wish to turn up. BUt well, she did message him afterwards, but just to ask for hello kitties! ( she didn't even bother to ask how he is!)<br><br>We all were furious, but my friend didn't bother about being angry. He went to get them, ended up fainted due to his illness (people who knew him will understand what i mean by this). He was restricted, and he was not able to get them himself. He instead, posted offers in web, to buy the whole set of kitties. He got them, including additional kitties from HongKong and Japan ( I remember the nice kitties ). But then the girl got very bored of them, and decided not to have them in the end. The kitties ended up in my safekeeping. He wasn't even angry about the girl's attitude!<br><br>He spent his days trying to smile so that everyone would smile too, but we felt his pain and tears when he would just gaze away. He was my buddy.. yet i couldn't help him.<br><br>He got another girl in his heart months afterwards, and to found out that the girl left him without a single message. Not even a single call or news. He was worried sick if anything happened to the girl, and no news. We tried helping him, and we asked too, why he was so anxious over her. He confessed that the girl was vulnerable, and he actually fell for her, and she told him that she loved him too. But she just walked away and no news. He couldn't take the pressure, his illness worsened, and he couldn't take the pain anymore. He died in his struggle of releasing his pain.<br><br>Wondered what illness was that? It was cancer.<br><br>I miss you, my buddy, always.<br><br>Rainboy is gone, but the rain will always be with us.</div>
