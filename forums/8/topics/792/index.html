            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Fragile,<br><br>you want a sad story, I will give you a sad story for you to cry out loud...<br><br>Here it goes :<br><br>Once upon a time, there is this nice guy, who always spend his time helping others in need, then till one day, he fell in love with this gal. Subsequently, he manage to try to court the gal and they become together. Then the gal fell in love with a scum, who smokes, drinks and rides a motorbike, and hangs out with nothing but a bunch of gangsters. The scum won her heart, and the poor guy was left without his loved one. He tried to move on. U will hope that like all fairy tale that he would be in his most depressed times, that he would have this new gal coming into his life and make his life different. Of course, we know that reality does not work this way. Instead things get worse and worse, and he give up more and more, till one day, he could not take it, and he died. He did not kill himself, but what he was killed, was the good heart of his, which was wasted on loving people who never spared a thought for him... So he turned evil and tried destroying the world, and then he was subdued, and died in the end.<br><br>--------<br><br>So if you think that the story is not sad enough, I can always provide worse. I just constructed it out of a few minutes. Because love is blind and selfish, the poor guy has to suffer... What more can I say....<br><br>yours,<br>Prodigal</div>
