            <div class='col-md body'>A spokesperson for the Ministry of Education today announced a drastic revamp of Singapore schools syllabus to take place with effect from 1 Jan 2004. Applicable to PAP kindergartens all the way up to tertiary level, the spokesperson announced that a new compulsory subject will be added to the current curriculum.<br><br>At the press conference held today, the spokesperson announced, "From next year onwards, all students will have to study the life of our FIRST Prime Minister. Yes I mean Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew. Did you all hear that clearly? I'll repeat it once again, the life of Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew who was our FIRST Prime Minister. Parents please take note and inform your children accordingly. As such, they will have to study Mr Lee's memoirs, yes, all of them, as part of this new syllabus. In fact, the universities will also be offering a new course within these 2 academic years, offering interested students and those on government scholarships an indepth knowledge of this great man. At the kindergarten and primary school level, we are in talks with several publishers to produce a picture book of SM Lee's memoirs. We feel it would be more appropriate for these young children and it can even be something for their parents to read to them at bedtime! As we speak, Jack Neo is filming a specially commisioned video featuring an all star cast from both MediaCorp and MediaWorks as part of this new syllabus. I can't name names yet, but believe me, there will be a tear or two and a twist at the end! An animated film feature might be next on the cards, we can't rule that out yet. And yes this subject is examinable."<br><br>The spokesperson denied that this move was in response to last night's episode of Singapore's Brainiest Kids where one of the young contestants did NOT know who Singapore's first Prime Minister was and mistakenly answered David Marshall.<br><br>Insiders had earlier reported that Parliament scrambled for a secret midnight conference upon watching the program and were concerned that "If this is one of Singapore's Brainiest Kids, god knows how the rest of them are?!?!"<br><br>The spokesperson also denied that the ISD have tracked down the parents of the abovementioned child as well as her teachers. "Not yet, I mean, NO!" was his emphatic response.<br><br>I'm in cut and paste fron talkingcock.com mode now  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
