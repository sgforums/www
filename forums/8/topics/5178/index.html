I dunno if anyone gave it a thought, but it seems that society hv given us the standard of right and wrong.<br><br>And when someone did something agst society norm, they are being despised by the society... but are wrongs really wrong and rights really right? Like when someone cheat on their wife, shd they be consider as doing something wrong, and shd we be using the word cheat(which is degrading) or is cheat a degrading word... maybe under an open society where no right or wrong comes into play, cheat is just another neutral term like donate?<br><br>I know my topic is not going to get anywhere, cos nobody will be able to tell me anything concrete... but maybe all forumites can think about how society actually bring tragedy to many people who hv gone agst the norm and got excluded fm the society itself...<br><br>I'm a bit confuse with what I wrote now... but confuse or not, right or wrong, like asif I care...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>PS1: Fadingstar, how did u make the smiley face with the big open mouth smile?<br><br>PS2: SG Forum is becoming more and more sexual huh... but I liked to say I benefitted fm it, and learn more and more thru' the postings of Purr and Firewire... thks!  ;p<br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming?

            <div class='col-md body'>Dun worry about your English. No one's perfect. It is the content of your topic that matters most. English only make it colorful.<br><br>Society norms evolve. If one have to look at Maslow's Motivation Theory (sorry for bringing this in, for those who dunno, it is just a theory about personal needs hierarchy where needs are incremental as it goes up).<br><br>Look at the US, started out as a restrictive society, then all the human-rights stuff come in. So they have to liberalise and start giving ppl freedom.<br>First, gays are treated differently, now they are treating them as equals.<br><br>Same as in Singapore, norms will evolve and it is inevitable. Look at ppl in the late 80s early 90s... do you see lots of girls with speghetti straps?? At that time, it would be taken as over-exposing, etc.<br>But look at Orchard now.<br><br>So the issue of Societal rights and wrongs is always controversial.What is normal to some maybe not be the case for others. That's why laws change, ppl change, society change.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm.. it's true that society generally forces us to behave in a certain ACCEPTABLE manner, with preconcieved notions of what's right and what's not. for example, some people find it repulsive to breastfeed in public.. some people think couples shouldn't kiss in public, there are lots of "conditions" we set for others; everyone has their own standards of what's acceptable and what's not, it's only when they begin FORCING others to conform that the problem begins..<br><br>people love to judge others by their own standards, and they expect others to conform to society's "norms" just because they don't dare to. i'm not advocating rebellion, going against the "establishment" etc., because that's stupid and useless unless you really have something to rebel against. (DOH!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">) i guess it's inevitable to judge others, but.. just remember that there are other standards out there in the world, other ways of living, other "social norms" that might not necessarily go hand in hand with yours. afterall, everyone condemns cannibalism, but for a person that grows up as a cannibal, can you really say he's bad? that's he's doing wrong? yeah.. eating fellow humans may be bad, but that's the way HE was brought up, that human beings are sources of food just like that chicken or pig down the road..<br><br>human beings will NEVER become neutral, but what you can do, is always keep an open mind, be willing to hear the other side of the story, and even if you don't agree, respect the other person's point of view. afterall, isn't that what you expect of them too?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>------------------<br>I believe in the sun, even when it is not shining.<br>I believe in love, even when i do not feel it.<br>I believe in God, even when He is silent.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Finally something interesting to write about  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I feel that the expectation of society can be looked upon as an unspoken law; one that enforces control and moderate standards through passive means.<br><br>But who is to say what's right and wrong? Yes, some of us may not agree on certain things that are dubbed "acceptable" in society and choose instead to go against it. To us, we are right; To society, we are wrong. Yet in fact, both of us can be right and wrong at the same time, depending on which point of view one is looking from.<br><br>The concept of preconceived notion has also been brought up earlier. This is how the expectation of society is formed. Let's suppose suddenly, for some unknown reason, the colour green is suddenly called red and the colour red is called green.<br><br>"Cross the road when the red man is displayed"<br>"The leaves on the trees are red"<br>"Green means danger"<br>"Oooo! So romantic! U gave me a green rose!"<br><br>Sounds funny dosesn't it? That's because we have been brought up associating red with red and green with green. The same goes with the expectation of society. Naturally real life is not as clear cut as red and green, but you get the pictue  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>But often such expectations are in place for good reasons. It must be noted the expectations of society is a product of every (well..most anyway) individual in it and this expectation ultimatly benefits society. This in turn translate into written laws that gives a "safety net" in the event socity's law does not contain the rebel.<br><br>Dishonesty, violence, adultry, disobedience etc etc are frowned upon for good reasons. I shudder to think what our society would become if such acts were allowed to run rampant.<br><br>Of course, what's right now may be wrong in the future and vice versa. In the past it was wrong for women to work outside of the family unit; now its perfectly all right. All it takes is a spark of rebellion that can ignite a series of events that change our perceptions. It doesn't happen everyday, but it will happen  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I'll leave that to the visionaries out there; For me, I'll just sit here with my cup of coffee and watch as events unfold  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>------------------<br>I do not embrace my dark side, but I do acknowledge it;<br>else I can never be whole<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow Bochup, this question you have posted is quite profound. I don't think we, being mere mortals, will be able to answer that. What's right and wrong? That's not really something for the society to decide.<br><br>As a individual we are intelligent. We can make sound judgements. Unfortunately, there's the society. It affects the way we think. It tells us what decision will be right because it was right before and so therefore it will be right again. If we look carefully at the society, its just a collection of individuals. As a huge group, there will be no individuality. Hence no intelligence. The mass will act no differently from a single cell organism. Imagine telling a group of people there's a fire in the building. The whole group will scramble for safety, just like a cell. There's also the the example of collective stupidity, showing how dumb people can be in a group. (Ever wondered why its so hard to make a decision to go out when in a group?)<br><br>As the society has been proven to be unintelligent by me, therefore the rules set by it isn't supposed to be totally logical. So that must mean that the rights and wrongs decided aren't really right nor wrong.<br><br>If an individual is able to break away from the society, he/she becomes intelligent again. He/she will not be affected by society in anyway. He/she will be the only one to decide what is right and wrong for himself/herself.<br><br>Enough being said, being too intelligent can be a disaster. Aliens might aduct me for experiments. You can take the above as a load of crap, but there's always truth behind.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>----------------<br>Merry Christmas!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>[This message has been edited by Crab (edited 14-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I haven't surfed for my porn for a long time so this will be a bit short unless I get into it while I'm writing...:-) ha ha...:-)<br><br>rite and Wrong...hmmm...Society has a set of rules that dictate what is the norm and what is out of the norm (unacceptable), but I believe that the whole point of this is that it shows the level of social consciousness in our collective minds at that time...And although it respresents these "acceptable" guidelines, it isn't meant to dictate anything to everybody.<br><br>As a guideline, it allows people to amend it in their own ways but keeps people from forgetting that one shouldn't go too far overboard.  Even still, most people see anything different from the "norm" of society as pariahs or rebels or menace or sluts or fornicators...etc....etc...<br><br>The problem is that most people see these societal "laws" as written in stone and whatever is written shouldn't be broken....(because everyone else doesn't do it, so anyone doing it is wrong or shameless).  It's especially evident in Asian societies...as we all know...of course, the west also has it's own tolerance levels...not that anyone is worst, but it's different because it reflects different societies.<br><br>Humanity can be broken down simply into a few groups:<br><br>Visionaries and leaders (as braveheart stated, affects change, amends rules/societal norms by action or words.  Doesn't necessarilly have to be politicians or leaders in normal terms...can be private citizens with a different mindset or sees a larger picture)...<br><br>The common populace (sheep, will follow the next sheep even if it jumps off a cliff...ranges from rich to poor and from this group and the next emerges the few leaders and visionaries)...<br><br>The lone wolf/rebels of society (people who feel distant from and have no or little personal association with socitey as a whole....but live in it tenuously nonetheless...)<br><br>The accidental genius (quite by accident, manages to affect a minor or major shift in minsets... can be a mixture of the last two groups...)<br><br>Suffice to say that since the general populace is in the majority, they have a great say in what is considered correct and normal...but it is based on the grounds set by the leaders and visionaries who in turn are inspired and influenced by other sectors of society.<br><br>In retrospect, it seems to be that the general populace has within it the ability to grow and reach the next levels of social consciousness, but it takes the leaders or accidental geniuses to weed out the shit from the gold...people who see the larger picture and can see society beyond just themselves...<br><br>But society does change and different countries change in different areas and at differring speeds according to their own people and how ready they are for change.<br><br>Even still, we can be highly advanced and accepting of great things, yet some people will still cling onto old ways...and it's these people who taintprogress...or is it that change taints these people...<br><br>So the question that needs to be asked now is what everyone thinks of people who refuse to change from the old ways of thinking...people who harbor old prejudices..etc etc....?????<br><br>Doubtless we all move forward whether we want to or not.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm....this topic is actually very wide. it covers ethics, political theory, and possibly some aspects of the theory of knowledge. i really shouldn't write too much and bore everyone to death. but maybe i can try and outline some points. i'll try not to turn this into a thesis (else rinoa will scold me again).<br><br>1. Assumption: ppl are basically evaluative and judgemental. hence there is no possibility of neutral terms, as in bochup's example above. Even the word "donate" is not neutral. it usu has positive connotations and will be evaluated as such. To donate may be seen as the "right" thing to do, because a premium is placed on altruism of whatever sort. but what if i say, well whether or not you get an abortion is up to you. i am "neutral" regarding that. it's your choice and i won't say whether what you choose is "right" or "wrong". again, it would seem that even if you were to say this, a premium would have been placed on "your freedom to choose". this implies that if i forbid you to choose, you would say i have no "right" to do that, or what i am doing is "wrong".<br>hence, it would seem that we are basically evaluative creatures and this is something we can't change.<br><br>2. Granted that we are evaluative creatures, where do our evaluations come from? Let's list some possible sources. They may come from religion, tradition, reason or sentiment.<br><br>3. Evaluations from religion: religious commandments are usu taken as the guidebook to social action and to notions of right and wrong. what's good abt this? ppl know what to do and there is less room for moral dilemma. What's bad? Galileo prevented by the Catholic Church to publish a book supporting Copernican theory that the earth actually revolves ard the sun and not the other way round. The church was determining what was right and what was wrong in the realm of astronomy and science. should the church only restrict itself to the realm of morals and morality and not science? other commentators say that religion is a tool of domination and control by the bourgeois agst the "unthinking masses". religion is seen as the opium of the ppl. but is religion all (and only) abt power and subjugation?<br><br>4. Evaluations from tradition: typically of a non mono-theistic and ritualistic community. what's good? see point 3 above. what's bad? is progress really possible? is it even a goal? should it be a goal? if progress is both desirable and possible, what should be the medium of change? that is, how do we decide what to change or what  values or practices to abandon? do we resort to communal consensus? do we let the light of reason guide us? is reason universally binding? that is, can reason guide everyone and lead us to the "truth" about what ought to be the case?<br><br>5. Evaluations based on reason: immediate problem: what is reason and rationality? is reason really "objective"? there is a painting by Goya showing a man sleeping on a table and at the background are images of monsters and goblins. the caption at the bottom says (in spanish): the sleep of reason brings forth monsters. meaning of course that if we don't use our reasoning powers and faculty, all kinds of monstrosities may occur. we should let the light of reason rule agst mere feelings and passions and allow the best argument to guide us thru. but in spanish, the word "sleep" can also be translated as "dream". this changes the meaning of the phrase completely: the dream of reason brings forth monsters. meaning, it would seem, that the use of reason itself brings forth all kinds of dastardly deeds. whatever could this mean? does it mean that with reason we can justify any and all kinds of actions? so using reason, can we still find out what is right and what wrong? can arguments convince absolutely? can we say, let's be reasonable abt this and discuss it - may the best argument win. would notions of power and control come in here? or should we rather rely on reason to provide us not exactly with what to do but only with a formula of what to do - perhaps similar to the Golden Rule (do only that which you would have others do unto you). Would this lead to agreement in what is rite or wrong?<br><br>6. Evaluations based on sentiment: are things like "lying" or "murder" or "adultery" objectively wrong? are they wrong in themselves? or do we only say they are wrong (not because reason tells us so but) because they offend our sentiments and feelings? whether something is rite or wrong would then depend on whether they give us feelings of pleasure or displeasure. there is no objective rite or wrong, only rite or wrong depending on how we feel abt it. is this really the case? but wouldn't this be overly-subjective? is reason really a slave to the passions? how do we build consensus on mere subjective feelings? nazi germany managed to stir up the passions of the nation. so feelings can unite. but divorced from reason and good sense what kind of monstrosities could occur?<br><br>7. We've considered some sources of notions of rite and wrong. but let's say u want to build a state. from scratch. what kind of a society would you want? a united one based on unified values? how would you determine these values? from the sources listed above? by means of a social contract? by means of democratic consensus? but based on what ideals? freedom and liberty maybe? but how far would u want individualism to progress? should the individual be free to act on his own values? should there be a limit on his freedom of action? should we say, fine go do and think whatever you want as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else? but this kind of independence and autonomy has repercussions on other parts of the state. it may mean the economy is run on principles of non-interference by the state. is any kind of paternalism then justified? does it mean the govt has no right to ban guns or encourage you to eat healthy food? if u were running a state, what notion of right and wrong would you say best serves the ppl and the country?<br><br>8. so when u ask "are wrongs really wrong and rights really right"? ask yourself first, what kind of a society do u want? one sure of it's identity and values or one that is questioning and liberal but also uncertain and fragmented? there are good and bad points to both options and to any other alternatives for that matter. so perhaps there are no rights and wrongs in and of themselves. but in order to build a society, there has to be some values. what should these values be? well maybe it all depends on your vision of an ideal society. and maybe even in that we will quarrel abt what is right and what is wrong!<br><br>okay....better stop now. there is lots more to say (tip of the iceberg actually), but i should leave it to someone who can say it better. as i said, it's a very large topic. oops! written too much again. sorry guys! now rinoa will scold again..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>cheers!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I tend to think that there ARE rights and wrongs, based not exactly on the view point you are looking from, but the situation which you are in.<br><br>No matter what we decide is right or wrong, there has to be a consensus. I think someone called it  compromise. If everyone had their say then there would be anarchy i.e. no peace. Thats why there are always some losers to the rules that we have. I'm not saying that they cannot be improved, just that you cannot satisfy all the people all the time. I do agree that when humans come together into a collective group there will be no intelligence. But since we have to live both as a group as well as individuals at different times, it means that we have to play by different rules in different situations. I'm suggesting that these two can go side by side i.e. you do what you want so long as you are not in a group where you can intefere with other people's freedom, but when you are living in a group environment you play by the rules.<br><br>I'm not sure if I read things correctly, but it seems that people seem to equate change with improvement, and whatever that is against society (i.e.not the norm) is a new and improved perspective. I think this is not right. Perhaps this is what Firewire is saying when he mentioned that only some people can separate the shit from the gold. But then, perhaps I can't use argument because I'm instilling a value judgement on the things?<br><br>As for evaluations on sentiment, I think we humans deserve a bit leeway in terms of being allowed to judge by sentiment. Many of our decisions are influenced by feelings, the most common one being feeling sorry for someone else. e.g. letting someone off the hook because we feel sorry for them. Its hard to say that this is a deficient way of dealing with things, because as humans you cannot separate yourself from feelings. Some people try, some jobs require it, but I don't think its neccessary all the time.I think people as a group decide based on emotions rather than other things. Since emotions are so hard to suppress, I suppose unless we agree to become borgs, separating emotions from our decisions on what is right or wrong will be very difficult.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>pacman - just a few notes abt your last post here. when u mentioned that there are rights and wrongs depending on the situation u are in, the question then is: how would you resolve a case where the interests of the individual are opposed to the majority? how do you tell who is right? what principle of discernment applies? the majority isn't always right. take nazi germany. some lament that if only certain key figures at the time had had the moral strength to stand up for their convictions, stand up to hitler, that maybe many of the atrocities would have been prevented. what happens when national goals are in conflict with personal beliefs? on your account, it would seem that the individual should always give in to the larger interests of the state.<br><br>which leads to my second point. it is certainly true in many instances that sentiment cannot be separated from acts which we consider morally repugnant or salutory. the crucial point, however, is whether sentiments play a primary role in our notion of right and wrong. which has primacy? the sentiments or the judgement? do they go together? do they really go together? the point being that if you view morality as being mainly about our feelings of pleasure or displeasure at some act, then could these feelings not be intentionally created?<br><br>for e.g. when u say, i really hate it when ppl park in lots for the disabled. is that not a notion that has been drilled into you? would u not judge someone who parked in a handicapped person's lot with disdain only cos u were made to associate ill feelings with particular acts? by this line of reasoning, it would be okay for the nazis to associate feelings of disgust with the sight of a jew, for instance. but if we think that this is wrong, then what is it that tells us it is wrong. our sentiments? but why have our sentiments been shaped like this? what is responsible for our feelings of right and wrong? is morality just (and only) a social construct? depending on the political mood of the day and the means of propaganda at ur disposal? who decides how we SHOULD feel?<br><br>so if there are certain principles that "should" guide us in our actions, then maybe feelings are secondary. just wanted to point out the implications of your statement: "we humans deserve a bit (of) leeway in terms of being allowed to judge by sentiment". because it may seem that u are arguing for the primacy of sentiments when it comes to making the right (or wrong) judgement. if you are, then you should also be aware of the possible consequences of that line of thinking and whether you will ultimately be able to live with those consequences.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fadingstar: Nice to meet you here too!<br><br>You raised some pretty good points from a philosophical point of view, and to be honest I'm not sure I have proper arguments, so bear with me and I'll see how I go.<br><br>Regarding your first point on how to resolve the wants of the majority and the wants of the individual, I guess you have to ask another 2 questions. Does it go against humanity (i.e. would you want the same thing to be done to you) and whether you can live with the results. Taking the nazi example, they would be able to answer the latter but not the former. But the fact is that in a majority like a country, they would be able to answer the latter but don't give a shit about the former. So, my answer is, use a variety of methods to see if an event is right or wrong. Even if its in retrospect.<br><br>Your second point about what it is that guides our feelings or actions... I guess you are asking the chicken or egg question. The notions that guide our feelings can themselves be influenced in an earlier event by feelings as well.<br><br>So, in answer to your question, I don't know. I don't know what guides our sentiments which guides our actions which influence our notions. Its everything around us, it depends, it changes.<br><br>I had a thought once. It was during this debate on hospital funding and access to treatment. I was thinking: For those people not in the government, they would be the ones making the decisions on people that they don't know. Would they be able to make the best decision based on the fact the money is a FINITE resource for a country, so there has to be a limit to how much money you can pour in the system. To those people/ people with relatives that need hospital beds but couldn't get it, it would be very hard for them to accept that. One argument would be that the gov might not cap the funding at X amount if they were the ones needing the bed. But then I thought, it was precisely the fact that the leaders were not in the situation that they were able to think logically and weigh the needs of other neccessities against health funding. But how the hell would anyone tell someone else that this could be the reason?  Was I right or wrong to think this way? Would I be seen as a monster? Would the fact that I be seen as a monster affect the rightness or wrongness of the situation?<br><br>Fadingstar, I'm not sure if I have counter arguments. I have trouble in expression. But I tried. You're making me look bad man.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 22-12-1999).]</div>

I was paying more attention to those which points to the argument of Majority v. Minority interest, and the fact that religion hv also been used as a tool for creating a norm for followers.<br><br>You know what, my stubborn and hardheaded personality always brings me to side with the minority most of the time..., and thats when I felt the overwhelming power of a crazy mob(just using a term here... never was I beaten up...) to bring many issues to a level of unreasonableness(no such word huh...). What is sick about this is that most of the time, the minority will then become the victims of the majority for not conforming, which brings upon this topic of discussion in another way. Just think of "Wen Ge"(Cultural Revolution) of China as one of the best example of a crazy mob running over the innocents...<br><br>I've once discussed with I of my more thoughtful(spiritually thoughtful I meant) fren about the perfect world being what Chinese call as "Da Tong Shi Jie"(World of Equality). Which means everyone is equal, and we(the humans) take care of other people's kids and elderlys just like our own.<br><br>My fren retort that while this may seems a perfect situation, it will not be possible with the limited resources, while already disregarding the fact that humans are usually selfish and despicable, and will not be able to form such a society.<br><br>For example, if there is only 1 serving of medicine and there are 2 patients, which one must we save? If one of them is my son or nephew, I'll say save the other person first, but this act in itself already deflect from the ideal of equality, becos due to the fact that one of them is my relative, I'll save the other person, and with that, my relative will not experience the perfect world of equality....<br><br>getting a bit confuse again... will post somemore if I get new triggers fm fellow forumites....<br><br>*Still Stoned*.....   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>PS: Can we get the Hello Kitty softtoys if we buy a McSuess Meal?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>McSuess McSuess where are you, McSuess McSuess where are you...<br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming?

            <div class='col-md body'>In this world, there is no absolute right or wrong. You may be right to some and wrong to others. Usually it is the society u live in tht use the broadest term (majority) to define them apart. However, wht is wrong or right is likely to change if you move to another region or another timeframe. Wht is right now may be wrong in 10 yrs time, wjo knows?<br><br>Therefore, let your conciousness and your morale be the judge. And then do wht u think is right for tht circumstances. This is because if you always conform to society's definition, either in the end nothing is done (cos of everchanging mindset abt right or wrong), or too much compromises are given and in the end rendered your action ineffective.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry, I'm late again. Just saw this thread only today.<br><br>Think what I've posted over at MysteryRider's thread on "Eyes Are Deceiving" is more applicable here. Hence, I'll do the pathetic copying and pasting job. Do visit that thread for more interesting readings.(fadingstar and pacman, I'm doing advertising?!)<br><br>"Well, I think there's no definite in life. When an end seems to be a start, when a start isn't a start, when a start is an end, when an end isn't an end. If you live a life so engrossed in looking for the definites, you become so detached from the real world that you'll lose the you in you.<br>Hence, the definites that you're looking for are actually defined by you yourself; trying to get someone to define it for you is as good as getting someone to redefine you.<br>That is why whatever you wished to do, as long as it's not against your conscience, do it. Life's short, treasure it and use it to the fullest.<br>I think I should touch a little on expectations. "Definites" originates from expectations. Without expectations, there will not be the desire to seek definites. Terms like justice, fairness are all expectations from us that they should exist. Hence, because of these "expectations", people go in search of the "truth". But what is exactly the "real truth"?<br>There are many "claimed truths" around us, more often accepted as truths 'cos they relieve hopes.<br>Leads to the point of hope.
