              <p>The country of your home is just like any serious committed relationship. Monogamous in nature. Just like a wife, you cannot have 2 or more and claim you love all others equally, not just lustily.</p>
              <p>Dual citizenship entails much more committment, and not just financial aspect alone, after all, money can always be earned if one is capable.</p>
              <p>To hold dual citizenship would means one would have to contribute to 2 societies. Not an issue for the one who is serious and committed to serve both faithfully.</p>
              <p>Problem arise only when one refuses to work and contribute, preferring rather to be depended on others' hardwork, feeding on social spending for oneself and one's family despicably.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The serious problem with dual citizenship will come from national security issues. No 2 persons will think alike, fault lines within societies will always be present. Should such faultlines erupt into major outbreaks, that dual citizenship will represent a conflict of personal interests and obligations to society.</p>
              <p>Futhermore, it imposes hard decisions to be made by society and its administrators - can these dual citizenship holders be trusted? Even during WWII, the american Niseis were kept behind barb wires. full fledge americans yet treated differently just because their countries were at war.</p>
              <p>How much more the impact in these days and age of multi cross-borders trans national terrorism, whereby animals and beasts hide among us within society and seeking for sympathy.</p>
              <p>The road to hell is often paved with good intentions. Dual citizenship as an idealism is fine, but still a slippery slope to be throd upon by us flawed humans.</p>
              <p>Think further, for we have yet to evolve to ideal beings, and as such, there are many more consequences that will reverberate and tear our social fabric apart.</p>
              <p>Monogamy had been tried and tested for centuries. It had worked well for us imperfect human. As said, if it aint broke, there is no need to fix it.

              <p>It might do either thing, but either way; dual citizenship is good because it gives people a choice and respects the rights of the individual. No one wants to be tied down to any one place, especially in todays globalized world.</p>
              <p>1st world EU states and USA have got that right, which is why they do allow dual, because they have gotten past that petty nationalist part of the history. There is no harm in allowing a citizen to have aspirations abroad. Singapore is still a young country, so i doubt it will get past its pro nationalist citizen-stage anytime soon. The last time we in europe had such notions was in the world wars.</p>
              <p><br>I say aye.</p>
              <p>Pros; in the long run it allows greater freedom to the individual, and you would have people coming to Singapore who really want to be a part of Singapore whilst enjoying other avenues else-where. At least you are guranteed of a positive result from giving someone the freedom to choose. If you deny that freedom, then foreigners might just see a controlling state which they do not want to be a part of. This is my personal view as a foreigner.</p>

              <p><br>All people will wish to avoid war and conflict and strife because all people want a better living. if there was a war in Singapore, i am sure people would leave as well.</p>

              <p>The country of your home is just like any serious committed
              relationship. Monogamous in nature. Just like a wife, you cannot
              have 2 or more and claim you love all others equally, not just
              lustily.</p>
              <p>Dual citizenship entails much more committment, and
              not just financial aspect alone, after all, money can
              always be earned if one is capable.</p>
              <p>To hold dual citizenship would means one would have to
              contribute to 2 societies. Not an issue for the one who is serious
              and committed to serve both faithfully.</p>
              <p>Problem arise only when one refuses to work and contribute,
              preferring rather to be depended on others' hardwork, feeding on
              social spending for oneself and one's family despicably.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The serious problem with dual citizenship will come from
              national security issues. No 2 persons will think alike, fault
              lines within societies will always be present. Should such
              faultlines erupt into major outbreaks, that dual citizenship will
              represent a conflict of personal interests and obligations to
              society.</p>
              <p>Futhermore, it imposes hard decisions to be made by society and
              its administrators - can these dual citizenship holders be trusted?
              Even during WWII, the american Niseis were kept behind barb wires.
              full fledge americans yet treated differently just because their
              countries were at war.</p>
              <p>How much more the impact in these days and age of multi
              cross-borders trans national terrorism, whereby animals and
              beasts hide among us within society and seeking for sympathy.</p>
              <p>The road to hell is often paved with good intentions. Dual
              citizenship as an idealism is fine, but still a slippery slope
              to be throd upon by us flawed humans.</p>
              <p>Think further, for we have yet to evolve to ideal beings, and as
              such, there are many more consequences that will reverberate and
              tear our social fabric apart.</p>
              <p>Monogamy had been tried and tested for centuries. It had worked
              well for us imperfect human. As said, if it aint broke, there is no
              need to fix it. Improve it - yes, but at a pace of change all can
              be comfortable with so that none be left behind on our
              egalitarian Earth, or as egalitarian as our planet seeks to be.</p>

              <p>This sort of thinking is backward. I think people think like this because nationalism is only recently emerging in Asia, therefore governments like Singapore are still hungup over dual citizenship and the possibility of evil "traitors" emerging at any moment.</p>
              <p>Disallowing dual citizenship is not stopping emigration or immigration.</p>
              <p>IN today's worlds, cities are all trying to be the best and they are therefore being more alike. "Malaysia truly Asia," "garden city," and i have seen the word "cosmopolitan" used far too many times to describe all cities. All cities try to make themselves unique and attractive and end up becoming the same.</p>
              <p>That said, cities are for everyone to come in and leave to fulfill a need for work and a desire to live. The world is changing, and the more talent pool you have, the better your  city can take advantage of technological improvements and innovations; limiting your growth with citizenship restrictions is merely limiting your own development.</p>
              <p>But Singapore has other traditonal core priorities and guards its security stringently in its "unique" region. It has its own way of dealing with things.</p>
              <p>But i feel people do not take kindly to being restricted in their options.</p>
