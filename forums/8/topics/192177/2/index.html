            <div class='col-md body'><strong>OUR INHERITED DYSFUNCTION</strong> (partial)<br><br>If we look more deeply into humanityÂ’s ancient religions and spiritual traditions, we will find that underneath many surface differences there are two core insights most of them agree on. The words they use to describe those insights differ, yet they all point to a twofold fundamental truth. The first part of this truth is that the Â“normalÂ” state of mind of most human beings contains a strong element of what we might call dysfunction or even madness. Certain teachings at the heart of Hinduism perhaps come closest to seeing this dysfunction as a form of collective mental illness. They call it <span style="font-style: italic;">maya</span>, the veil of delusion. Ramana Maharshi, one of the greatest Indian sages, bluntly states: Â“The mind is maya.Â”<br><br>Buddhism uses different terms. According to the Buddha, the human mind in its normal state generates <span style="font-style: italic;">dukkha</span>, which can be translated as suffering, unsatisfactoriness, or just plain misery. He sees it as a characteristic of the human condition. Wherever you go, whatever you do, says the Buddha, you will encounter <span style="font-style: italic;">dukkha</span>, and it will manifest in every situation sooner or later.<br><br>According to Christian teachings, the normal collective state of humanity is one of Â“original sin.Â” <span style="font-style: italic;">Sin</span> is a word that has been greatly misunderstood and misinterpreted. Literally translated from the ancient Greek in which the New Testament was written, to sin means to miss the mark, as an archer who misses the target, so to sin means to <span style="font-style: italic;">miss the point</span> of human existence. It means to live unskilfully, blindly, and thus to suffer and cause suffering. Again, the term, stripped of its cultural baggage and misinterpretations, points to the dysfunction inherent in the human conditionÂ…Â….</div>

But that might seem constricting to those who disagree with us on the key points. I feel being exclusive is hard to avoid, for faith is by nature exclusive.<br><br>Even the belief in all ways has to contradict the belief in one way, and it seems both of them can't be absolutely right at the same time. So something has to give.<br><br>It might very well be that most differences are just on the surface and that many religions share basic truths. But then it also seems that there are in the basic truths that exists differences that cannot be reconciled without changing either one or both. In either way this assumption of all-rightness assumes that this current state is not the right state, which assumes that this current state might not be desirable or evolved enough. Surely enough objectivity arises to lead us in the way that shall eventually be an exclusive one way, in which all beliefs outside it are lies.<br><br>Perhaps it is the vale of illusion to suppose that enlightenment and unelightenment can co-exist, and surely this was never your illusion.</div>
