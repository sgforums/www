            <div class='col-md body'>Simulated reality describes a hypothetical environment that, although experienced as real, is actually a highly detailed simulation of reality. Unlike the currently technologically achievable concept of virtual reality, which is easily distinguished from the experience of "real" reality, a simulated reality would be impossible to tell apart from "real" reality. Hyperreality describes postmodern ideas regarding the perceptions of reality which in some ways parallel this concept.<br><br>The modern version of this involves a thought experiment along the lines of imagining that the person experiencing the simulated reality is somehow plugged into a computer of immense power that is programmed with all the rules of the simulation, and provides them with all of their sensory input. A deeper thought experiment may even assume that the person experiencing the simulation is itself simulated within the simulation, and may have no physical existence at all outside of the simulation<br><br>One practical, one philosophical, and one ethical question arise immediately:<br><br>1)Is it, even in principle, possible to tell whether we are in a simulated reality or a real one?<br>2)Is there any difference between the two?<br>3)How should we behave if we knew that we were living in a simulated reality?<br><br>Several people have pointed out that if a human brain is analyzed in sufficient detail, the mechanism of that brain might be electronically simulated. The result would behave as an electronic duplicate of the original human brain, as occurs in mind transfer. Whether the speed is similar to the normal speed of a brain would affect how it could interact with the real world.<br><br>The simulation argument, claimed by the philosopher Nick Bostrom, investigates the possibility that we may be living in a simulation. The argument attempts to prove the disjunction of three hypotheses:<br><br>Either A - the human race will never reach a level of technology where we can run convincing reality simulations; or B - races who do reach such a level do not tend to run such simulations; or C - we are almost certainly living in such a simulation.<br><br>His argument uses the premise that given sufficiently advanced technology, it is possible to simulate entire inhabitated planets or even larger habitats or even entire universes as quantum simulations in time/space pockets, including all the people on them, on a computer, and that simulated people can be fully conscious, and are as much persons as non-simulated people are.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some Hindu writings states that the soul is a cosmic force, a kind of energy or waveform which can't be seen . With every birth the soul enters a living foetus after its previous cycle. At each cycle the soul retains some defining characteristics of it sprevious life and the knowledge attained.Along many cycles the soul attains knowlege, During its cycles when the soul attains the ultimate enlightment it breaks free from Maya and its recurrent Life and death cycles. In order for it to break free, it needs to defeat the Matrix which is Maya. This can only be done with attaining the ultimate truth<br><br>If you look at the Matrix movie, some scenes show infants connected to some wires<br>The matrix is feeding on this cosmic energy called the soul.<br><br><img src="http://www.crystallotus.com/SuJok/images/reborn.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cosmic Maya carried the burden of time. Cosmicly aware of cycles of time the Maya were bound, as we are, by walking through time in a linear fashion. They were awarethat beings of earth had lost the natural ability to ride the cycles of time/light/energy, to time travel. It is also known by the Cosmic Maya that this present linearfashion of time will transform into multidimensionality, and will not be limited to linear time on earth much longer.<br><br>The calendar with it's twenty Sun/glyphs are cosmic memory activation tools that intuitively interacts with your body's memory, your DNA. The calendar is not only an incredibly accurate map of the cycles of the cosmos, but is also a tool to accelerate and activate your memory into recalling the truth behind the mystery of the cosmos.<br><br>Each glyph is charged with precise information in the form of feelings or emotions to help active you in a very personal and individual way. Each person will remember their own personal perspective of the truth based on their place in the calendar system. This is not something you need to learn, it is something you will remember.<br><br>Understanding the Tzolk'in with only the mental body was not the approach the Mayas themselves intended. To understand their knowledge of the Universe, they would have to leave remains behind that would bridge all cultures, languages, and all levels of education.<br><br>This is what the Maya have done. The knowledge of the cosmos is available to all. It is available to those who can open their hearts to the wonder and curiosity of the universe once again. The encoding of the calendar is intuitive and is remembered with feelings. It is also very mental and can be learned with study. As daykeeper, Hunbatz Men say, we need to use all our bodies to remember everything. The physical, mental, emotional and spiritual bodies are needed.<br><br>Without desire, wonder and curiosity there is no intention to remember. Without study there is no understanding. To reconnect to the cosmos and receive information from the Sun, as the Maya do, one must not only place intention by physical study, but desire to remember! As we move our physical bodies into action to study, the intuitive side will activiate, but desire is most important and quite essential. That is it! This is what the Maya intended.</div>
