              <p>My brother lives in Singapore and loves it.

              <p>I was in prison in England for 6 months last year and hated being locked up after attacking someone but he said I was lucky not to be in Sinapore as I would have been in jail for a lot longer and probably got the cane.

              <p>Singapore still cane people.</p>
              <p>But at least we don't punish people like in Iran.</p>
              <p>Some people support caning and some don't.</p>
              <p>But if you have been a molester/rapist, most in SG will have support for you to be caned.</p>

              <p>I'm amazed about that. Is the cane though only for the really
              bad crimes or could somebody who did something like what I did (got
              into a fight and hit the guy with a bottle) get it? And is it
              instead of jail or along with jail?</p>

              <p>Along with Jail.</p>
              <p>The heavier the crime, the more strokes.</p>
              <p>Fighting usually results in 3~6 strokes, unless it is a gang fight or someone died.</p>
              <p>Oh, and girls don't get caned, only guys.</p>

              <p>rapists use to be anal raped by those ''da ge'' in the prisons, but nowadays, the prisoners are getting more and more educated, and they know how to sue left and right after getting out of jail, hence such incidents are unheard of anymore.</p>
