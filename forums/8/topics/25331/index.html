            <div class='col-md body'>Article extracted from this issue of FHM Magazine. For reading pleasure.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> The entire article is kinda long. And will come in separate post.<br><br><strong>Looks and money donÂ’t matter. ItÂ’s whatÂ’s inside that counts.</strong><br>LetÂ’s start with money. ItÂ’s important. IÂ’ve said this before IÂ’ll say it again: without money, how will you afford us? I donÂ’t mean money like Donald Trump kind of money. I mean simple money like a man who qualifies for a credit card. You know, John Tan or Philip Cheah Â– he earns at least $30,000 a year and can afford a new shirt without going into debt. Still, thatÂ’s scraping the bottom of the barrel. Anything above $45,000 is slightly more than decent. Above $60,000 is just nice. Above $80,000 Â… now weÂ’re talking.<br><br>As for looks, no one wants to go out with an ugly cow, (unless of course, youÂ’re Benecio Del Toro or crater-faced Mark Lee, if push comes to shove, then wealth and fame overrides your hideousness). So technically, sheÂ’s lying about that too. Now if you happen to be handsome and rich, but have the personality of a tree, is she going to stick with you? Of course she is. We can overlook something under the glare of money and good looks. But once youÂ’ve run over your third kitten on purpose or slept with someone she knows, youÂ’re out.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>IÂ’m not interested in marriage</strong><br>Dude, by the time you get to your second date, sheÂ’s picked out her wedding dress and the colour of your suit in her head. Sure, sheÂ’s not interested in getting married now, but eventually sheÂ’ll want to. Even if sheÂ’s like 17 or 18, sheÂ’s planning that wedding, donÂ’t event doubt that. If sheÂ’s over 27, you have about a year (if youÂ’re lucky, three years) before the Â“is this relationship leading us down the aisleÂ” talk comes up.<br><br><strong>I donÂ’t want children</strong><br>Only dykes mean that. You know why? Because they know itÂ’s cruel to bring up a child with two mothers (double the PMS, double the nagging). Many women think theyÂ’re ok with not ever having children. But once other women start getting pregnant, sheÂ’ll waver. When these couples given birth to real live babies, sheÂ’ll ask you if not ever having child is such a good idea. Now whatever you do, donÂ’t let her touch anything below four years of age. The minute sheÂ’s got them around her arms, sheÂ’ll secretly stop taking the pill.<br><br><strong>IÂ’ve never faked an orgasm.</strong><br>We all fake it. Every single one of us. I suppose this might not apply to a chick whoÂ’s only just lost her cherry, but give her time, and sheÂ’ll be faking it too. Faking is good. It means she cares for you and doesnÂ’t want to hurt your feelings. Our not being able to orgasm doesnÂ’t always reflect badly on you. Sometimes we can get all hot and heavy and in the throes of it, and then suddenly it dawns on us that this is one of those days when weÂ’re just not as horny as we could be. It doesnÂ’t mean weÂ’re not enjoying the performance; it simply means we just canÂ’t climax. Period. (Ooh! That could be a reason too). Put it this way: it costs us nothing and it seems to make you happy. And if you must have a scientific explanation for it, sextologists say itÂ’s an instinct passed down from one generation to another. Honest.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Size doesnÂ’t matter</strong><br>IÂ’m sorry, but it does. It definitely does. ThereÂ’re women out there who swear by quality over quantity, but thatÂ’s because theyÂ’ve married those men with small dicks and theyÂ’ve probably never slept with anyone else. But for the discerning lady, size certainly does matter. Too small, and like, weÂ’re better off sleeping alone. Too big, and youÂ’re treating us like weÂ’re cheap porno stars! So according to the Global Sex Survey this magazine did recently, it should be 5.5 inches high and 1.3 inches wide. Erect. Is that a collective sigh of relief I hear?<br><br><strong>ItÂ’s ok. Really it is</strong><br>No, itÂ’s not! When it comes to premature ejaculation or the inability to get it up, we can exercise patience and support. But only up to a certain extend. Two to six months is as long as a wife can shelter a husband from the fact that if he canÂ’t perform, sheÂ’ll have to think about replacing him with another stud. The best thing he can do is seek help and let her know that heÂ’s doing something about it. That way, she can support him, and it may just bring both of them closer together. DonÂ’t sit around and imagine that the problem will just disappear. SheÂ’s more likely to vanish first.<br><br><strong>I donÂ’t enjoy watching porn. I donÂ’t get turned on by it</strong><br>Oh, but we do. Not only do we enjoy watching it, weÂ’re also almost always turned on by it Â– well, except for those really sick ones with goats and kids. ThatÂ’s little bit too hardcore for us. As you well know, itÂ’s impossible not to be turned on by a spot of voyeurism. ItÂ’s just that weÂ’re simply too shy to tell you that weÂ’re really turned on by the works of Ron Jeremy or Janine. Another thing to remember is that we like our porn to come with a plot. And by that I donÂ’t mean bikini-clad-girl-tips-and-falls-on-unsuspecting-man-and-cant-resist-a good-romp-by-the-swimming-pool-that-just happens-to-be-there. Think once and again with sex.
