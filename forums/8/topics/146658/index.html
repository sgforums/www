And older people don't have very good command of English.<br><br>So, it's a plus if u can speak Chinese. It's just a linguistic skill.

            <div class='col-md body'>It is one of Singapore's vulnerability to giants like China. Undoubtedly Almost all educated Singaporeans talk and bred in English but the China MNC's are not.<br>English is not widely spoken and there will be a communication barrier. One may argue the same about the Indian companies but it is a fact that most Indian FTs converse in English and India was a british colony once. On the part of the Govt, they should have standard guidelines to tackle the issue. This is where the shorcomings are inherent. If the govt wants to have fairness and equality in the light of a multi racial harmony, they have a problem.<br><br>English is the business lang of the world. It is unjust that minorities who cant speak mandarin should be sidelined. It is not their right to learn a language which determines their career chances.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's just a communication skill. It's a skill like any other skills, like typing skill, public speaking skill, computer skills, etc. It's a linguistic skill in this case. Of course companies would recognize a skill as a plus, as long as it's a relevant skill for them. In this case, SG still has large percentage of people speaking mainly in Chinese, so it becomes a relevant skill.<br><br>It doesn't have anything to do whether a particular SG company is doing business in China or doing international business, because domestically it already operates in an environment where Chinese is used significantly. Naturally it would see a Chinese speaking candidate as having a plus.<br><br>For English to truly be THE language, without the need for requiring Chinese, it's only possible if SG society's linguistic topography change drastically. That is, everybody communicates in English, firstly and mainly. Everybody can express their ideas in English fluently. English is the language of choice.<br><br></div>
