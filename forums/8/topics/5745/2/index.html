            <div class='col-md body'>There are a few points of contention in the post, but I will like to point out some of the following misconceptions in Confucianism.<br><br>First of all, there are 2 eras of Confucianism, the first era dominated by Confucius, Mencius and Xun Zi and the second era by Zhu Xi from the Song Dynasty to the other contemporary philosophers of today. The first era stressed on the issues of ethics and political philosophy because of its historical and political settings and the second era hinged on epistemological issues, on how people acquire and understand knowledge. The 4 books in Confucianism are compiled by Zhu Xi in the second era, where people now called Neo-Confucianism, and are entitled "Analects", "Book of Mencius", "Great Learning" and "Doctrine of the Mean".<br><br>Someone has made the point about Confucianism rests on the fundamental basis of goodness in human beings. Unfortunately this is not true and it is utterly rubbish. I will say that the person have not properly dwelled into reading the four books or the modern commentaries to the subject. Both Mencius and Xun Zi held two opposite views to this issue. Mencius' assumption is that all humans are naturally good at heart, but can be corrupted through the environment, hence moral cultivation is required. Xun Zi held the other helm of argument, declaring that humans are naturally evil and selfish, and requires education to imbue moral values. Hence it is not true that Confucianism starts with the assumption that human nature is originally good. The theme of ethics in Confucianism is focussed on this nature vs nurture in the first era. Of course, Confucius was the first to discuss what these moral virtues are, but made no indication about whether human nature is good or bad. Confucius' discussion of ethics parallels to what the present contemporary philosophers are interested in ethics, something called "Virtue Ethics", where one trys to justify the course of action not by the consequences that follows from it, but from the virtue of the action. I am not a philosopher and not even as well read as some of the people here for example, Ng.<br><br>The next misconception which people have about Confucianism, is that it is a system of morality which is rigid and dogmatic. It is recorded in both Analects (I forget the reference on Confucius), and Mencius in one of the statements where I can quote the exact reference in Mencius, IVB :11, Mencius warned people that one should not carry the action to the end, if it is not the right thing to do (this is a statement on caution against blind loyalty).<br><br>What people like to accuse Confucianism about the rigid and traditional practices and all the rules and regulations which led to China in her downfall, is not pure Confucianism. It has been written in a Chinese commentary that emperors of the various dynasties have exploited Confucianism by corrupting into a pseudo-form known as feudalism, where values about absolute obedience and the disregard to science and technology. Pure Confucianism preaches about learning from mistakes, and the spirit of inquiry. Without proper study of the literature, people will accuse Confucianism of introducing Chinese practices such as arranged marriages, absolute obedience and etc. Even in the doctrine of the Mean, nobody says such things. The Doctrine of the Mean is just a prescription in living a life with a conscience and the Great Learning focused on understanding about the laws of nature. And worse, Analects says nothing about absolute obedience but caution against that.<br><br>I will be inclined to agree with the arguments against Confucianism for the flaws in the political system it tries to expound. The ideal political system known as the "Da Tong Shi Jie", the Great World, parallels that of the world painted in Marx's manifesto of Communism. However, there are subtle differences in both systems. Nevertheless, the political system as preached by Confucius was one of the many attempts in the Spring and Autumn period in China to deal with the problems of war in that time. Hence, in my opinion, a philosophy like this which is made for to deal with the problems of a period, it has to be modified if it will have any impact to modern society. Similarly, so many people are talking about adapting Machiavelli's "The Prince" and Lee Zong Wu's "Thick Black Book" into modern society clearly shows that the pure form of the original ideas spoken of may not be relevant to today's society. Well, we all see the downfall of the communist countries. Similarly, countries like Japan also have problems like the loss of ideology in the younger generation and corruption in government even though their version of Confucianism are mixed with Buddhism and Shintoism (or other forms of religion). In any case, I doubt any country in the world now, not even in the historical China, is practicing pure confucianism.<br><br>Just my 2 sterlings worth...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>GO PRODIGAL!!!<br>at least i can understand ur view... dun look at me for any philosophy arguments though... i only read confucius, mencius, taoism through the comic book written by this HongKong guy i think... i dunno whether u all know or not... but quite funny one... he also drew SUn Tzu's Art of War too... but i read dat when i was 15 and dat was as much philosophy as can i handle... well, everybody has their own views and my view (or feeling) is dat i dun like ngkaihoe saying Confucianism is nonsensical... i think the word is too DAMN strong and imply u tink u so great like dat... i know u got ur point and  i try to understand ur point with watever limited knowledge of philosophy i have... but there's just something wrong with implying Confucius is an idiot just like saying Mao is stupid for preaching Maoism and all da communist stuff...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i've begun to notice a trend in the posting here. everytime an issue is brought forth there are basically 3 stages of posting.<br><br>stage 1 - the initial stage of reasoned arguing and debating which is the whole point of this forum. at this stage the topic is new and people are vaguely interested and are forthcoming with opinions since whatever they want to say has not yet been said. this usually lasts to 4-5 postings.<br><br>stage 2 - things turn ugly. at this stage someone or some people for whatever reason begin to miss the spirit of the debate. perhaps they are frustrated because they don't understand the topic or line of argument or perhaps they cannot dermarcate between an academic exercise thus taking things personal. their inability to join the discussion lleads them to misconstrue earlier posts by being insulting or ignorant.<br><br>stage 3 - the antagonism between progenitors of the issue and their unconstructive critics leads observers to do 2 things.<br>A. throw a huge blanket over the issue by saying things like everyone has his/her own view, in the process missing out on the nuances of the argument.<br>B. taking sides.<br>it is at this 3rd stage where the debate dies a generalising death.<br><br>firewire; education is here is not as important as orginal opinions and a desire to understand. you are too hard on yourself. some of your comments were rather refreshing to hear. keep it up.<br><br>cheers<br><br>[This message has been edited by Terence (edited 21 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okie, for one, I do not think all that<br>Confucianism has got to offer is all<br>bullshit.

            <div class='col-md body'>hehehe... agree with u on dat buddhism depersonalization thing... got a friend who went into a monastery for 1 week coz his Buddhist mum forced him to go there, to clean his body and soul or someting like dat... the first rule was dat no one was allowed to speak at all... Can u imagine not speaking for 7 days? and having to meditate at the same time... he told me the funny thing was that if u dun speak at all, u get all sorts of thoughts in ur head... which makes meditating really hard to do... the whole goal of the "program" was to become nothing... no desires, no ego, no (dat something extra) like u said... but i dun think my fren changed much coz he's still a prick, get into fights, and still says stuff to piss people off...</div>

Ironic thing is I'm buddhist too but not the hardcore Buddhist... u know, the one with more Taoism and Chinese legends influence on it...<br>Terence,<br>u wanna interview my fren? hahaha...<br>go ahead... one thing he told me was that the monks had told them (he wasn't the only one there) that if they wanted to leave anytime they could... but they preferred it if the kids will tell the monks instead of just running off hehehe... The kids were not allowed to take showers and had vegetarian meals everyday... Naturally their body stank but the funny thing was that the monks, who didn't take showers at all, didn't smell at all... Most probably something to do with their diet. He said something about eating meat having to do with the odor... u can always ask me and i'll ask him later =)</div>
