            <div class='col-md body'>One of the most ridiculous ideas of<br>Confucianism is that nature already defines<br>an inherent system of morality. And thus<br>human beings, on the path to be a jun zi,<br>must adhere to nature and be "moral" (in<br>the confucianistic sense).<br><br>If you read the Analects, Doctrine of the<br>Mean (the most stomachable book, as far as I<br>am concerned), Great Learning, Mencius etc,<br>you cannot find any logical substantiation<br>that there is indeed, an inherent system of<br>morality as defined by nature. Morality, in<br>Confucianism, is taken as it is and beyond<br>question.<br><br>Xun Tzu is the most rational among the 3<br>Confucianistic philosophers, for he says that<br>man is born without any sense of morality,<br>and that morality is acquired through<br>activity, thus making it valuable. But Xun<br>Tzu, our dear friend, has NEVER substantiated<br>why such an activity should be embarked upon<br>or even why activity makes something<br>valuable.<br><br>Perhaps Confucianism is not a logical<br>exposition and should not be taken as one.<br>But its practically unchallenged claim<br>(inherent system of morality) is a blasphemy<br>to men of good reason and propriety. Any men<br>of good conscience has the "moral" (hiak)<br>duty of pointing that blatant fault out.<br><br>[This message has been edited by ngkaihoe (edited 20 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Looking at ShaoLin Boy, it seems to make<br>me think about the state of chinese in<br>Singapore. Though I am violently against<br>Confucianism, I cannot deny 2 things;<br><br>1) Chinese is distinctly confucianistic<br>in values. Though I must say it with much<br>qualification, the presently chinese society<br>is not purely confucianistic, but a hybrid<br>between confucianism and the yuppie (or the<br>gen x) culture of the west. Through decades<br>of social intercourse, our society now<br>possesses a sociological profile unseen in<br>human history.<br><br>2) Though I would very much like Chinese to<br>see the stupidity and how brainwashing is<br>Confucianism. Looking at people like ShaoLin<br>Boy, if Confucianism is viciously removed,<br>what kind of decadent philosophy or moral<br>conduct will ShaoLin Boy or other chinese<br>subscribe to? The deconstruction of values,<br>if not accompanied with maturity, will lead<br>inevitably to nihilism. The result can be<br>disastrous for our society.<br><br>Any solutions?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ngkaihoe<br><br>The whole point of an overriding code of ethics and morality is that it gives meaning to peopleÂ’s lives. The dangers of replacing this overriding code (or metanarrative) are both implicit and explicit since not every one possesses reason, clarity or intelligence Â– example Shao Lin Boy and others like him. As such the removal of this overriding code, although can be proven to perpetuate the legitimacy of the ruling class, will lead to anarchy.<br><br>Have you read Pierre Bourdieu? You are intelligent and well read and will understand how Bourdieu deals with the circulation of knowledge. The ruling classes and the bourgeois are aware of how values and morals exert compliance from the lower classes, i.e. they may be unruly, uncouth and mostly poorly educated but still adhere to this overriding code since it gives meanings to what they do or think. As such with this code in place, they can be exploited by the ruling class. I see Confucianism as but another overriding code which our establishment employs to keep people in check. Just look at the number of people so far who have talked about Ren, Respect, Authority etc. All these have been logocentricism which can be manipulated for compliance and order. They donÂ’t realise it because this code has internalised itself. It has ceased to become just another code but A Way Of Life. The first step to political manipulation has already begun.<br><br>cheers<br></div>

You or Me?<br><br>First, understand that there is a difference<br>between your attack on Confucius and my<br>attack on Confucius.<br><br>1) My attack is purely academic. My<br>disagreement with him is purely professional,<br>we simply choose to see thing differently. I<br>still respect him as an academic whom had<br>the guts to express those ideas which he had<br>expressed. Given how nonsensical Confucianism<br>is, Confucius had had to be one of the<br>bravest persons to express these nonsense to<br>rulers whom he talked to.<br><br>2) Your attack on Confucius is childish. You<br>probably have not even read Analects,<br>Doctrine of the Mean or Great Learning. You<br>probably do not know all the pros and cons<br>of Confucianism.

I, unfortunately, am not as read as you others...but that's not to say that I dun have my own mind about what is happening when it's about social brainwashing and such....kekekeke...You;re talking to the conspiracy man himself...<br><br>I dun have a real opinion as to whether confuscianism is to my liking or not, but I do have some rather uninformed comments about it and could possibly refer to many other avenues of thots also.<br><br>When you look at it, confuscian-ism was almost a necessity in dealing with the people(as terrence has said, people refers to the common mass)...a way of pacifying the common folk for the educated and royalty to better control....while at the same time it gives the people somethign to believe in that is harder to throw out or overthrow because it is something that later became a major part of the asian consciousness...so much so that you ALMOST cannot be a true asian if you somehow haven't been touched by confuscianism in some form or the other....<br><br>It seems to be quite pervasive...I believe that Japanese are also influenced in a major way by confuscianism.  While it gives the person on the street a common bond in values and ways of life between their brethren, it also helps to hold together communities and families...or so I believe it is supposed to be so.<br><br>Personally I don't subscribe to it being a westerner of asian descent.  It has produced a group of people who have a hard time thinking for themselves or for standing up for anything....It is a pacifying force.  A very potent one because people have accepted it into their lives and passed it down as holy knowledge that every child must learn and abide by.<br><br>I mean what is the point if the next door neighboor thinks pretty much the same as me...If something happens and I say let someone else handle it, then my neighboor also says...and so on, then how?....<br><br>Does confuscianism bring about progress fr the development of human values or in human conditions...Maybe it did in the past, but I think that it is very dated in this new millenium....As you said yourself Kai, these newer generations are a cornucopia of belief systems...maybe the correct way of going as it will inevitably help to accomodate societies beliefs in the future as Globalism becomes widespread and more "global".<br><br>Anyway kai, I believe that it will slowly ease itself out of the asian pshyche anyway...eventually...I mean how in the world are people going to hold on to old wolrd beliefs when the new world demands that you start to think differently just to survive within it's framework????<br><br>yeah ok, so I'm not really saying much here but ok lah...I not so educated as you and terrence there...hiak hiak<br><br>:-)<br><br>ps- it is the more subtle form of socialism/communism which we already know doesn't work...once peole start to realise this maybe things will change.<br><br>now that I think abot it,...it really doesn't empower a person to do anything but conform right?hmmm...<br><br>ok I'm toking nonesense in this university forum here....better get out before the lecturer Kai notices a non registered student sitting in his class...</div>
