The previous verse which I had posted in my previous posts explains it a bit more clearly. Basically this verse, I hope I'm correct, is referring to "jihad". Those who "threatened" the muslims. Not innocent people. But if those people who had "threatened" muslims repent sincerely then they are forgived.</div>
