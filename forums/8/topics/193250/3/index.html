Allah must not have rivals.Â¡Â±<br><br>Ishaq:326 Â¡Â°If you come upon them, deal so forcibly as to terrify those who would follow, that they may be warned. Make a severe example of them by terrorizing AllahÂ¡Â¯s enemies.Â¡Â±<br><br>QurÂ¡Â¯an 8:7 Â¡Â°Allah wished to confirm the truth by His words: Â¡Â®Wipe the infidels out to the last.Â¡Â¯Â¡Â±<br><br>QurÂ¡Â¯an 8:39 Â¡Â°So, fight them till all opposition ends and the only religion is Islam.Â¡Â±</span><br><br>from what i know, islam is the only religion that wants its believers to DESTROY the non-believers. Other religions like christianity, instead instructs believers to convert believers. Should the non-believers fail to convert, they perish in hell.<br><br>so that means, if you're a hardcore muslim, you're probably a terrorist, because of all those instructions in the quran.<br><br>correct?<br><br>PS. this sounds damn anti-islam.. but its what the quran says.. muslims pls correct me if im wrong.</div></blockquote>Why are you all so hard on him? All he did was ask some questions... If any of you here knows the answer perhaps you can enlighten him. Are these quotes really in the quran in the first place? If it does then maybe that can explain why some people might misread it and interpret it differently and result being we have people like Osama going around today.<br><br>From how i see it, this is just a discussion. There is no need to feel offence. If you don't like it you can choose not to answer his Qs but if you know the answers, you can help him to understand the religion better right.<br><br>Actually, you can't blame him for feeling that way cos most terrorism today is committed by muslim. Be it in Russia, Spain, London, New York, Even China &amp; Thailand have problems with their muslim countrymen. I have said in my earlier post that not all of them are like that, its just that the few are making the news. They even kill fellow muslims. Therefore, how can you blame him for forming this perception.<br><br>In my earlier post i asked, Why can't a muslim convert to another religion? Is it allowed? If a Christian or Buddhist wishes to convert into a Muslim, there wouldn't be much problem but on the other hand, This cannot happen with islam. I recalled not too long ago, a Afghanistan man wanted to convert to Christianity and he was sentenced to death by the court. I guess its a bit over-doing it right? Cos no civilize country should kill another cos he choose to belief in another faith don't you all agree?<br><br>Lastly, as i have said earlier, I still believed that religion needs to be embrace and not forced upon one. If a muslim friends here thinks that they can convert to another religion without any trouble from fellow muslims or problems from family members do share your views cos i have seen chinese, ang mo convert to muslim but never the other way round.<br><br></div>

If you had read the whole chapter, you would probably get a clearer understanding and not just selective reading. Try reading the chapter without any bias feelings and you will find that your misunderstandings will be cleared.</span><br><br><span style="color: violet;">And from the same website maybe you can read the chapter 8 also from where you got the rest of your quotes.</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">I wonder where you get that Ishaq verses?</span><br><br><span style="color: green;">(Pardon me if I got this wrong) The "non-believers" actually meant those who knew and understand what Prophet Muhammad(PBUH) had delivered to them but intentionally reject the teachings, although they had seen and experienced the "powers" of God(I don't know how to phrase this but God gave all his prophets "powers" to aid them in convincing the people). Some of these "non-believers", or rather most, at that period of time, were not "peaceful" and were out to destroy the teachings and Prophet Muhammad(PBUH) himself. This is where the concept of Jihad comes in. "Protection" of oneself, and the religion, if threatened. That's all.</span><br><br><span style="color: olive;">Maybe you are lazy to click on the link. I give you the verse that came before [9:5].</span><br><span style="color: red;">At-Touba [9:4] - (But the treaties are) not dissolved with those Pagans with whom ye have entered into alliance and who have not subsequently failed you in aught, nor aided anyone against you. So fulfil your engagements with them to the end of their term: for Allah loveth the righteous. </span><br><span style="color: olive;">Maybe if you understand this verse, it might help your confusions.</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Hope I don't offend anyone, if I do I'm sorry.

Then it must have been rather easy for you not having to explain your own holy book's criticisms. The others here have thankfully explained and repeated something about context which you didnt make use of.<br><br>Ishaq: 324, 326 and QurÂ¡Â¯an 8:7 doesnt appear in the book.<br><br>In Quran 9:5, dinky1409 explained. Adding on with a cookie cutter reply, the small Muslim faith was emerging, surrounded by hostile Arab and Bedouin tribes. Peace treaties were made and broken so consequently permission for self defence was made. The context of that is "war on progress" and not a general directive. Btw, theres no "harass" there, lol.<br><br>Quran 8:39, its about being oppressed. Yours is a mistranslation again - "And fight them until tumult or persecution is no more, and religion is all for God. But if they cease, then lo! God is Seer of what they do."<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by OO_OO_OO:</div><div class="quote_body">Quran  Surah 5: The Table Spread<br>Christians will be burned in the Fire<br></div></blockquote>Surah 28, 30, 40, uhm, can't seem to find those verses.<br>Surah 5, yes there is one verse saying "the Fire will be his abode." and it was directed not to the faith, but the alleged fallibity of some who ascribed partners to God. The pre and following verses are different though, such as attesting<br><br>a. "the closest of love among the believers are those who say, "We are Christians", because amongst these are men devoted to learning and men who have renounced the world, and they are not proud."<br>b. the succession of faith by Jesus bestowed with the Gospels<br>c. and believe it or not, that we all(the monotheists) go to heaven, lol.<br><br>Hope stuffs are cleared up or something.<br><br>Edit: Zocoss, yeah, they're bad people.</div>

Since he don't understand the religion or the Quran as obviously he is not a muslim, you and ur fellow muslim brothers as a believer has a duty to try and enlighten him. If Prophet Muhammad had the patience and endurance to convince the non-believers in Mecca to the faith in a non violent &amp; hateful manner there is no reason fellow muslim today cannot do likewise.<br><br>As for your views that the trend of Islam being branded as terrorism started in the early 90's i think its wrong. Islam was never branded or related to terrorism through out the 90's at all. It was only after 2001 New York that made people think otherwise. The fact that it is unfortunate that Osama used the religion to commit acts of killing the innocent was despicable. In my views, this person and his followers has done a disservice to the religion and give Islam a bad name by killing more innocent people in Russia, Spain, London, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Egypt, Indonesia...<br><br>For your views that oil is the reason for the war, Its not true. Oil was never a commodity for the last 1000 yrs, maybe only the last 100. Have any western country taken over the middle east oil production? In fact, todays oil prices only benefit the Middle East countries and done them no harm at all.<br><br>Actually, the west &amp; middle east enjoyed a reasonably good relation over the years... In fact, when Russia, the old Soviet Union had wanted to conquer Afghanistan during the 70s 80s period, note Afghanistan have no oil wells. It was the US that came to the aid of the Afghanistan state. Some had wondered that had the US not intervene then, todays problems could be a lot lesser and maybe Osama might have been dead a long time ago already.<br><br>For your endorsement for suicide bombers i think its sad. Cos i can't possibly see any reason whatever, how anyone can support such a thing. There is no right for someone to walk into a restaurant or bus and blow himself up to kill all those innocent unarmed civilians. It is wrong, If it was an army personnels i can still understand but not cilivians. And for your info, the people that instructed these fools to blow themselves up and kill the innocent and promiss them 100 virgins waiting for them in heaven are still alive and well. They send others to sin but they themselves stay away like cowards do. If there are people like you who think this way, then how can you blame the Author of this thread for having this perception too?<br><br>We should work to make others understand us better and not just kill them if they are different.</div>

Therefore, chances are they will also toe the line.<br><br>I understand your reservations but given the present state where no one is in charged and you see people like osama step up, i think one with a supreme leader would be better. But unfortunately, this won't happen cos the Islamic faith presently is just too divided. </div></blockquote>honestly speaking, its not those loyal to the faith that we need to worry about, its those disloyal ones that "hijack" the religion to get personal gain/satisfy their own lust for influence/power/control/fame/wealth that we need to watch out for (think this is a problem most major religion have to face also). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
