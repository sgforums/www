You cannot believe everything you read on the net is true. Go get a real quran and read, I believe none of these exist in it. All religion are suppose to be peaceful. As for those who made it unpeaceful, these are the people who took religion into their own hands and twist it into something they want it to be, and start their own twisted religion using the original's religion's name.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I am neither a Christian nor a Muslim. My view for what its worth... Non-muslim i don't mean all, do have this perception that islam somehow is related to terrorism. Cos we somehow or rather read in the newspaper or watch it on tv that almost 60% of the world terrorism is committed by muslim. Be it in Russia, Spain, London, New York, Even China &amp; Thailand have problems with their muslim countrymen.<br><br>The thing is not all of them are like that, its just that the few are making the news. They even kill fellow muslims. Perhaps they read too much into the Quran unlike ordinary people. So that could be the reason why some people have this perception that islam is violent &amp; hateful.<br><br>But there is one thing i still don't quite understand which is i hope muslim friends here would not take offence. My question is, Why can't a muslim convert to another religion? If a Christian or Buddhist wishes to convert into a Muslim i think its ok, there wouldn't be much problem but on the other hand, This cannot happen with islam. I recalled not too long ago, a Afghanistan man wanted to convert to Christianity and he was sentenced to death by the court. I guess its a bit over-doing it right?<br><br>I still believed that religion needs to be embrace and not forced upon one. If a muslim friends here thinks that they can convert to another religion without any trouble from fellow muslims or problems from family members do share your views cos i have seen chinese, ang mo convert to muslim but never the other way round.<br></div>
