Allah must not have rivals.Â¡Â±<br><br>Ishaq:326 Â¡Â°If you come upon them, deal so forcibly as to terrify those who would follow, that they may be warned. Make a severe example of them by terrorizing AllahÂ¡Â¯s enemies.Â¡Â±<br><br>QurÂ¡Â¯an 8:7 Â¡Â°Allah wished to confirm the truth by His words: Â¡Â®Wipe the infidels out to the last.Â¡Â¯Â¡Â±<br><br>QurÂ¡Â¯an 8:39 Â¡Â°So, fight them till all opposition ends and the only religion is Islam.Â¡Â±</span><br><br>from what i know, islam is the only religion that wants its believers to DESTROY the non-believers. Other religions like christianity, instead instructs believers to convert believers. Should the non-believers fail to convert, they perish in hell.<br><br>so that means, if you're a hardcore muslim, you're probably a terrorist, because of all those instructions in the quran.<br><br>correct?<br><br>PS. this sounds damn anti-islam.. but its what the quran says.. muslims pls correct me if im wrong.</div>
