            <div class='col-md body'>A well known speaker started off his seminar by holding up a $20 bill.<br><br>In the room of 200, he asked, "Who would like this $20 bill?"<br><br>Hands started going up. He said, "I am going to give this $20 to one of you but first, let me do this." He proceeded to crumple the dollar bill up.<br><br>He then asked, "Who still wants it?"<br><br>Still the hands were up in the air. "Well," he replied, "What if I do this?" And he dropped it on the ground and started to grind it into the floor with his shoe. He picked it up, now all crumpled and dirty.<br><br>"Now who still wants it?" Still the hands went into the air.<br><br>"My friends, you have all learned a very valuable lesson. No matter what I did to the money, you still wanted it because it did not decrease in value. It was still worth $20."<br><br>Many times in our lives, we are dropped, crumpled, and ground into the dirt by the decisions we make and the circumstances that come our way. We feel as though we are worthless.<br><br>But no matter what has happened or what will happen, you will never lose your value. You are special - Don't ever forget it!<br><br>Please pass this onto everyone in your email address book. You will never know the lives it touches, the hurting hearts it speaks to, or the hope that it can bring!<br></div>
