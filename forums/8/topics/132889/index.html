            <div class='col-md body'>I guess different age group go for different requirements? But I have to say appearance definitely plays an important for all ages.. When we go shopping, we would definitely get attracted by something, due to appearance, like bags, shirts and such.. Then quality comes next.. Its just how important the quality is that varies according to age groups I guess..<br><br>For most youngsters, appearance is very much important, cos they want to look good.. Quality can come later... Thats why the first thing in mind is always appearance. As for people for the older age groups, especially most housewives, quality is very important.. So that things can last and such.. They think more on the cost aspect..<br></div>

Perhaps those people who have passed the teenage years can explain too? What I have noticed and gone through is that, during teenage years, we always care a lot a lot about appearance.. To attract opposite sex, to seek attention and like to be praised or like people to envy us.<br><br>As for the cost of the thing, have read before that business use this mindset of cost of the thing is quite equivalent to status in people.. LV bag for example.. The cost of it is high and naturally people will bring up the status.. So when u get a real LV bag, many people will have the impression of you being rich or a higher status.. Of course there are people who think otherwise.. hmm.. A simple question for you maybe.. Two adult men, one wearing a Rolex watch, one wearing a simple casio watch.. What's ur impression of both men? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Some focus on design.. They will buy even though it is not branded as long as they like the design.. Some focus on the brand.. They will buy that brand of bag even though the bag might not suit him or her.. Some look at the quality of the bag.. How "detailed" a shopper are you? Do you look at every single bag and analyze, or do you just glance through and focus on one which attracts you? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> That will answer your question..<br><br>For a new brand to compete with other established brands, one difficult thing to do is to attract the attention of people..
