There was once when I was feeling a bit rich and searching for a nice one.....but at the store, I saw that they had a sale, with some sports bags placed on the rack.<br><br>Just out of curiosity, I browsed through the items on the rack and found a branded one (a low end, unsophisticated model with thin walls).  It was only a quarter of the money I was prepared to spend.  Having gotten tempted, I told myself "why not?  after all it works for me".  So I bought it.<br><br>A few months later, it got a bit worn out at the seams.  I also didn't like it anymore (too squarish).  So I bought a new one (a more expensive and more elaborate one, with pockets for different items and all).<br><br>I guess we all balance price, quality, design, type of usage, etc.  For me, I knew that I would change sports bags often anyway, so I didn't care if it was cheap and would be worn out shortly.  For me, it was also which feeling dominated during the time of buying (price, quality, design, etc.).<br><br>Have you noticed that most customers here will not choose the most expensive or cheapest model where most types of products are concerned?  Maybe the mentality here is to average out all aspects by choosing something in the middle (price-wise and quality-wise).<br><br>In the case of your customers, perhaps they trust that everything sold at your shop would be of acceptable quality.  So even if they chose a cheaper one, it would still serve its purpose.  Maybe....<br><br></div>

For example, if the shop located at Queensway shopping centre.. Many people who go there to buy bags will have this thinking that the bags sold there are cheap.. That would mean that quality comes second place after price.. If the shop is located at one departmental store at Taka for example, people going in to really buy, would either be looking for branded or good quality bags..<br><br>If your shop sells all not so good quality bags and a few good quality bags, people will set the impression that your shop's stuff is more of not so good quality bags.. Likewise vice versa..<br><br>Have to admit that many singaporeans want cheap and good stuff.. True that, there are things which are cheap and good.. There are also things which are expensive but not good.. But if you take the probability, its still that good things dont often come cheap.. Just that people still prefer to take the risk of buying cheap and try to get good stuff, than to buy expensive.. due to the fact that some expensive stuff are not good... And of course the budget issue..<br><br>But Singaporeans complaining is a norm already.. They say poor quality, as compared to what kind of bags? To branded good quality bags, then of course the quality is poor.. They seldom compare to those even cheaper bags and find that the quality is actually not that bad.. Its how they look and compare I guess.</div>
