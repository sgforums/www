              <p>Avoid travelling alone at night. Use well-lit and busy sidewalks. Keep your mobile phone handy in case you need to call for help.</p>
              <p>These were among the security tips sent via e-mail by the National University of Singapore (NUS) to its students on June 20, two days after a sexual assault in Clementi Woods Park opposite the campus.</p>
              <p>
              
              On June 18, a female NUS student in her mid-20s was attacked at 10.40pm while walking along a footpath in the park, a short cut between the campus and the housing estate in that area.</p>
              <p>The police and the school were unable to release more information as investigations are ongoing.</p>
              <p>But it has since become a talking point among university students here. Many said it was the first time they had heard of a sexual assault involving a student on or close to campus.</p>
              <p>When contacted, NUS, Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and Singapore Management University (SMU) said they had no records of similar incidents.</p>
              <p>While the circumstances of the assault are unknown and the incident happened outside the school's grounds, two issues have surfaced from the current discussion: Are university campuses here safe? Are students complacent about safety?</p>
              <p>Going by what 60 university students told The Sunday Times, most feel their campuses are safe and are satisfied with the existing security facilities, though some think more can be done to enhance safety.</p>
              <p>NUS third-year economics student Preetika Gupta, 20, pointed out certain routes in her school which are not well-lit. One of them is the route leading from her hall at the Prince George's Park residences to the Faculty of Science building.</p>
              <p>Ms Choo Pei Ling, 20, a second-year arts and social science student at NUS, said: 'There are so many dark and deserted corners in the school; anyone can just come in and hide.'</p>
              <p>Students at NTU voiced similar concerns. Mr Ong Kai Sin, 26, a final-year engineering student, said: 'I always wonder why there aren't more street lights at NTU. It's probably even darker than some parks in Singapore.'</p>
              <p>NTU, which is located near Jurong West, is surrounded by forest and a military live-firing range.</p>
              <p>Some students were also wary of the increasing number of outsiders they see in their school.</p>
              <p>NTU third-year accountancy student Soh Xinyi, 21, said: 'There are so many construction sites in school these days; the school should employ more guards to patrol the campus grounds.'</p>
              <p>Students seemed to have fewer complaints about SMU, which is in the city.</p>
              <p>Third-year business student Jeremy Ching, 24, said: 'Within the school, it is very safe. The only dangerous spot near the school is near the Timbre nightspot where many people park their cars. It's rather secluded and spooky there.'</p>
              <p>All three campuses are open to the public, though there is usually restricted access to school buildings and hostels. Entry points are monitored by CCTV cameras while security guards patrol campus grounds.</p>
              <p>Besides the e-mail circular, it is not known if NUS will take immediate measures to step up security, although its spokesman told The Sunday Times that routes leading to the campus are generally safe.</p>
              <p>The school works closely with the police and neighbourhood groups to resolve safety concerns outside its compound.</p>
              <p>NTU and SMU did not say if they would further tighten security, although NTU added that its security framework is reviewed regularly. It also has no plans to make visitors register their names.</p>
              <p>Most of the students interviewed, however, said they would be more careful after the incident. This includes walking faster along deserted roads and avoiding studying in school till late.</p>
              <p>NUS first-year mechanical engineering student Chng Hui Min, 20, said: 'The latest I would leave is around 9pm. It is just good sense.'</p>

              between the campus and the housing estate in that area.</p>
              <p>The police and the school were unable to release more
              information as investigations are ongoing.</p>
              <p>But it has since become a talking point among university
              students here. Many said it was the first time they had heard of a
              sexual assault involving a student on or close to campus.</p>
              <p>When contacted, NUS, Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and
              Singapore Management University (SMU) said they had no records of
              similar incidents.</p>
              <p>While the circumstances of the assault are unknown and the
              incident happened outside the school's grounds, two issues have
              surfaced from the current discussion: Are university campuses here
              safe? Are students complacent about safety?</p>
              <p>Going by what 60 university students told The Sunday Times, most
              feel their campuses are safe and are satisfied with the existing
              security facilities, though some think more can be done to enhance
              safety.</p>
              <p>NUS third-year economics student Preetika Gupta, 20, pointed out
              certain routes in her school which are not well-lit. One of them is
              the route leading from her hall at the Prince George's Park
              residences to the Faculty of Science building.</p>
              <p>Ms Choo Pei Ling, 20, a second-year arts and social science
              student at NUS, said: 'There are so many dark and deserted corners
              in the school; anyone can just come in and hide.'</p>
              <p>Students at NTU voiced similar concerns. Mr Ong Kai Sin, 26, a
              final-year engineering student, said: 'I always wonder why there
              aren't more street lights at NTU. It's probably even darker than
              some parks in Singapore.'</p>
              <p>NTU, which is located near Jurong West, is surrounded by forest
              and a military live-firing range.</p>
              <p>Some students were also wary of the increasing number of
              outsiders they see in their school.</p>
              <p>NTU third-year accountancy student Soh Xinyi, 21, said: 'There
              are so many construction sites in school these days; the school
              should employ more guards to patrol the campus grounds.'</p>
              <p>Students seemed to have fewer complaints about SMU, which is in
              the city.</p>
              <p>Third-year business student Jeremy Ching, 24, said: 'Within the
              school, it is very safe. The only dangerous spot near the school is
              near the Timbre nightspot where many people park their cars. It's
              rather secluded and spooky there.'</p>
              <p>All three campuses are open to the public, though there is
              usually restricted access to school buildings and hostels. Entry
              points are monitored by CCTV cameras while security guards patrol
              campus grounds.</p>
              <p>Besides the e-mail circular, it is not known if NUS will take
              immediate measures to step up security, although its spokesman told
              The Sunday Times that routes leading to the campus are generally
              safe.</p>
              <p>The school works closely with the police and neighbourhood
              groups to resolve safety concerns outside its compound.</p>
              <p>NTU and SMU did not say if they would further tighten security,
              although NTU added that its security framework is reviewed
              regularly. It also has no plans to make visitors register their
              names.</p>
              <p>Most of the students interviewed, however, said they would be
              more careful after the incident. This includes walking faster along
              deserted roads and avoiding studying in school till late.</p>
              <p>NUS first-year mechanical engineering student Chng Hui Min, 20,
              said: 'The latest I would leave is around 9pm. It is just good
              sense.'</p>

              <p>Lucky I never felt threatened....</p>
              <p>Singapore is quite safe.....</p>
              <p>The only place I sincerely feel unsafe to go walk alone is some areas of Geylang....</p>
              <p>Last time I brought fruits there....and also eat porridge...at one of the restaurants...the celeb restaurant....</p>
              <p>But really it is quite intimidating to walk on other alleys....</p>
              <p>Other than that, Ive never felt unsafe anywhere in Singapore so far....</p>
              <p>In fact sometimes I feel sorry to make other people feel unsafe....</p>
              <p>For instance when I was walking behind a lady one time, during broad daylight.....after some distance, she stopped, move sideways abit, and let me pass ahead......I could tell she was suspicious......heheh...</p>
