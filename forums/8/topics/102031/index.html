"It was not handled in the proper way," she said, declining to give details of Nokia's concerns.<br><br>In a settlement announced Monday, Microsoft agreed to pay the CCIA an undisclosed sum in return for the trade group's ending all antitrust actions against it on both sides of the Atlantic.<br><br>The CCIA, which claims to promote fair competition in the technology industry, had been one of the European Commission's staunchest allies, and its interventions were credited with having played a prominent role in pushing the European regulator to issue a tough ruling against Microsoft last March, which Microsoft is now appealing.<br><br>Nokia supported the CCIA's combative stance towards Microsoft because it feared that the software company could extend its dominance of computer operating systems into the mobile phone market, as the two industries converge.<br><br>Edward Black, chief executive of the CCIA, said he regretted losing Nokia as a member, adding: "We understand their reasons."<br><br>A person close to the trade group said he did not expect other members to follow suit. "If anything, this may boost the CCIA's ability to recruit new members," the person said on condition of anonymity.<br><br>Many companies are scared of antagonizing the software giant because everyone relies on Microsoft software in one way or another, this person said. Historically the CCIA has been seen as Microsoft's enemy No. 1, so there has been a risk attached to membership of the trade group.<br><br>CCIA members include Sun Microsystems, which ended its feud with Microsoft in April after securing a cash payment of almost $2 billion from the company and a promise to disclose secret details about the Windows operating system which are needed in order to allow Sun to make its software work properly with Windows. Other CCIA members include Oracle, Yahoo, Fujitsu, Nortel Networks, Time Warner and Verizon Communications.</div>
