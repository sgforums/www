            <div class='col-md body'>Possibly true, then again, who's to say?<br>We all know abt mothers who go to fortune tellers to see if their daughters are compatible with their prospective son-in-laws etc etc but then again that's chinese astrology... ok anyway i think its fun to read and sometimes it can be surprisingly accurate, but its quite far-fetched to think that the arrangements of stars determine your personality. I'd like to know how it works though.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No, love does not exist. It is merely a phschological state induced by a conspiracy of world governments to keep the masses under control. It is induced by a substance added to the water supply in varying amounts according to how much control they feel they need at any particular time. The U.N. and W.H.O. are major players in this world wide conspiracy.<br><br>Plain fact is lust is real and love is used as mind control.</div>

I'm sure astrlogy always keep saying that u are going to meet someone tomorrow, but u never do...blah blah blah...<br><br>Agan, it is another way for us humans to try and put some kind of sense into something that we have no control over...I met a few really hard-core astrology believers(quite young also), and it's so wierd because they keep saying we're not supposed to get along and they make themselves believe that when in fact we do get along,...and quite well I might add....Then they make themselves believe all this rubbish and work to make sure that what they beleiev comes true...<br><br>We make our own destiny.  We meet who we want to meet, and ultimately, in a way, we love who we want to love...has nothing to do with my stars and garters.<br><br>Some people use star readers to give them fortune and insight, but actually they go there because they fear the unkown that is life...By going to them it makes it easier for them to beleieve that life isn't so random....It's not bad or anything, but there is a danger of beleieving too much and not living ur life to ur own destiny but by other people's destiny they create for u...<br><br>case in point:<br><br>Growing Up----The father agve up his daughter because the fortune teller said that she was going to bring the family bad luck...duh???I realise that a lot of people still believe that kind of thing, but I would have to go the other way.<br><br>I'm sure a lot of you beleiev as me also...nothing controls us.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi! I have been quite interested in the Field of Astrology in my late teens, After reading much about the Stars and the moon I finally realized that Astrology is not be always true and can applies! Especially about love! Reasons:<br>1. They usually says what stars sign is comp. to which but come to think about that does that mean that all Cancer and Leo are ideal couple (Example)<br>2. As far as Stars signs we usually talk about only have 12 of them ! But U people must also consider the other planets! Which would be important esp Mercury!<br>3.Anyway, why people say that they are  are true cos they always talk about generic stuff and if they talk about 10 1 or 2 will be right and u will think that they are accurate!<br><br>I guess that's all I have to say so far!</div>
