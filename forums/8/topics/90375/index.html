BUSH<br>1600 Pennsylvania Avenue<br>Washington, DC 20520<br><br>EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE:<br><br>Law Enforcement:<br>I was arrested in Kennebunkport, Maine, in 1976 for driving under the influence of alcohol. I pled guilty, paid a fine, and had my driver's license suspended for 30 days. My Texas driving record has been<br>"lost" and is not available.<br><br>Military:<br>I joined the Texas Air National Guard and went AWOL. I refused to take a drug test or answer any questions about my drug use.

I was a cheerleader.<br><br>PAST WORK EXPERIENCE:<br>I ran for U.S. Congress and lost. I began my career in the oil business in Midland, Texas, in 1975. I bought an oil company, but couldn't find any oil in Texas. The company went bankrupt shortly after I sold all my stock. I bought the Texas Rangers baseball team in a sweetheart deal that took land using taxpayer oney. With the help of my father and our friends in the oil industry (including Enron CEO Ken Lay), I was elected governor of Texas.<br><br>ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS GOVERNOR OF TEXAS:<br><br>- I changed Texas pollution laws to favor power and oil companies, making Texas the most polluted state in the Union.

In my first year in office, over 2 million Americans lost their jobs and that trend continues every month.<br><br>- I'm proud that the members of my cabinet are the riches of any administration in U.S. history. My "poorest millionaire," Condoleeza Rice, has a Chevron oil tanker named after her.<br><br>- I set the record for most campaign fund-raising trips by a U.S. President.<br><br>- I am the all-time U.S. and world record-holder for receiving the most corporate campaign donations.<br><br>- My largest lifetime campaign contributor, and one of my best friends, Kenneth Lay, presided over the largest corporate bankruptcy fraud in U.S. History; Enron.<br><br>- My political party used Enron private jets and corporate attorneys to assure my success with the U.S. Supreme Court during my election decision.<br><br>- I have protected my friends at Enron and Halliburton against investigation or prosecution. More time and money was spent investigating the Monica Lewinsky affair than has been spent investigating one of the biggest corporate rip-offs in history.<br><br>- I presided over the biggest energy crisis in U.S. history and refused to intervene when corruption involving the oil industry was revealed.<br><br>- I presided over the highest gasoline prices in U.S. history.<br><br>- I changed the U.S. policy to allow convicted criminals to be awarded government contracts.<br><br>- I appointed more convicted criminals to administration than any President in U.S. history.<br><br>- I created the Ministry of Homeland Security, the largest bureaucracy in the history of the United States government.<br><br>- I've broken more international treaties than any President in U.S. history.<br><br>- I am the first President in U.S. history to have the United Nations remove the U.S. from the Human Rights Commission.<br><br>- I withdrew the U.S. from the World Court of Law.<br><br>- I refused to allow inspector's access to U.S. "prisoners of war" detainees and thereby have refused to abide by the Geneva Convention.<br><br>- I am the first President in history to refuse United Nations election inspectors (during the 2002 U.S. election).<br><br>- I set the record for fewest numbers of press conferences of any President since the advent of television.<br><br>- I set the all-time record for most days on vacation in any one-year period. After taking off the entire month of August, I presided over the worst security failure in U.S. history.<br><br>- I garnered the most sympathy ever for the U.S. after the World Trade Center attacks and less than a year later made the U.S. the most hated country in the world, the largest failure of diplomacy in world history.<br><br>- I have set the all-time record for most people worldwide to simultaneously protest me in public venues (15 million people), shattering the record for protests against any person in the history of mankind.<br><br>- I am the first President in U.S. history to order an unprovoked, pre-emptive attack and the military occupation of a sovereign nation.
