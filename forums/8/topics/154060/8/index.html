I am a born a bred Brunei Chinese having stayed here the last couple of years. I have no chinese education watsoever. And of all my 23 years of living, it's a fact I have learnt to regret and live with, if you can put it that way. Why do I say so? Although I can speak mandarin, I cant read a single word (that is if you exclude my chinese name).<br><br>You can't imagine the jokes and teases being made on you. I can't understand what's so the tok kong with these Americans. Their english isnt so great as well. Just look at their version of football. It's being played with both hands and legs, should've been called the hand and foot mouth. They can't even name their own games propery.<br><br>Coming from Brunei, I can speak 3 main languages, English, Malay, Mandarin with Hokkien, Cantonese, Hainanese as my dialects. But hey, Miss Bianca, do you know how it felt like to be told off by a caucasian tourist holidaying here when he was asking me about something?<br><br>It went something like this:<br><br>AngMoh: 'Excuse me, could you help me translate what these Chinese writings on this shirt mean?'<br><br>Me: 'Err, I'm so sorry, but I can't read chinese, sorry I can't be of help.'<br><br>AngMoh: 'You're not Chinese?'<br><br>Me: 'I am, but am not educated in Chinese.'<br><br>AngMoh: 'Here we are most of us westerners being particularly interested in your mother language and writings, yet you're telling me that you as a Chinese can read.'<br><br>Well, that was part of a conversation, but he meant good in a way. All this while, as Miss Bianca was trying to impersonate the Americans, more and more caucasians over the world are keen on learning Mandarin, writing Chinese. So what if when there is a time when Mandarin becomes the worldwide language of the world and not English? People like Bianca would be termed as Aliens I guess. Please go back to the la sap tang where you crawled out from.<br><br>*Note: something lame but just to let you guys know: I did not quote English as the universal language of the world, because simply English isn't the universal language. Mathematics is the Universal Language, whereby almost every living  literate person in the world knows and understands even the simplest mathematics, even computers uses complex mathematical languages. Imagine a world whereby we only speak by combining numbers to forms sentences eg. 12 means hi how are you? How good is that? Just a thought tho.<br><br>Hope my posts is too freaking long for you guys to read on, but hey just sharing what I think only... do send me a crow flying over my head if it's lame.<br><br>Cheers.</div></blockquote>I'm half Bruneian myself.Even my Hokkien has been commented as something weird in terms of accent.</div>

From the pictures you posted in your other thread, I can see how 'good' your taste is.<br><br>If you really are a girl, then I can tell you're a very young misinformed girl. Hopefully you will be able to achieve some level of maturity, it's not too late yet.<br><br>But if you're a guy (which I suspect), congrats, you've totally succeeded in being a total attention seeker.<br><br>Carry on being a poseur, you're pretty good at it I guess.</div>
