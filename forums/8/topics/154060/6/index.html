I mite come up wif a guys version soon nuff! :]<br><br>DONTS-<br><br>Actin cute by puttin ten different colored hair pins or hair clips is nt cool.. ya probably end up bein singled out by teachers for bein too strikin N havin poor color coordination.. it makes ya look lyk a friggin xmas tree wif it.. juz w/o da lights.<br><br>Wearin different shoes on each foot is nt cool.. it makes ya look stupid rather thn hip.. Ya see.. u'd think she's a weirdo thts either as blur as a sotong nt noeing how ta differentiate shoes or she's plain dumb cuz they aint matchin at all.. I still see girls exchangin shoes.. wearin a pink shoe on da left N baby blue one on da rite.. in da MRT! N standin side by side.. it's such a disgrace in my opinion..<br><br>Crumpled skirts or exceedingly short skirts is nt cool.. makes ya look lyk ya wearin a tablecloth or fabric thts four sizes smaller thn wht it shld be.. They think there victoria secrets' models by wearin lingerie as sch skirts.. it's totally childish cuz most of em.. first they don haf da looks N their bodies are so normal N nt sexy at all.. innocent sch girls i'd say.. Some of em fold N wring it up until an obvious N prominent bulge is seen on their abdominal area N da whole skirt gets flared up cuz its pulled upwards too much it becomes lyk an umbrella.. Guys might love ta see this but i personally think it's too much N nt cool at all.. They haf no brains N invitin trouble cuz ther unaware of lechers N pervs arnd..<br><br>Assessories such as sex bands, wrist bands, bracelets etc are nt considered cool ta me if they are worn with LARGE quantities.. ive seen girls wearin 3 wristbands on each hand plus watch.. at least 2 ankelts N stuff lyk tht.. nt cool too.<br><br>I also observed tht some sch girls love ta draw on their hands or body parts usin marker pens or highlighters.. it's lyk so passe..If ya wan designs go get air brush tats or henna.. at least it dont look fake N its better drawn cuz some of their art sux.. basically scribblin GRAFFITI on their own hands.. juz earlier today i saw a grp n*ss girls havin almost their entire forearms covered wif pen marks.. childish behavior agn.<br><br>Speakin hokkien or cheena in a goddamn cheena accent is nt cool at all.. only goes ta show tht ya english sux.. More N more young gals are learnin very fast.. even sec 1 girls are speakin fluently in hokkien N actin lyk stupid ah lians.. same goes fer guys too.. please fer f uck's sake dont scold vulgarites in hokkien cuz it makes ya look lyk thos roadside gang member N it's nt only low-class but unglam.. cheena kids..<br><br>Stuffin bubble tea straws in their frickin ear holes is another thing girls love ta do.. it's stupid N nt cool cuz it only shows tht they are too poor ta afford REAL jewlerly.. at least wear somethin decent.. N wats da use of makin da hole so big?.. I dont see da beauty in it.. Tho i have six holes (added up in both ears).. ive already promised myself nt ta pierce further cuz it only destroys ya ears.. Too much is nt cool.. mine's juz nice. Some pple cant understand this..<br><br>BIG BIG bags wif a thousand small small badges on it is nt cool.. only attracts attn fer pple ta steal it.. eventually da badges get lesser N lesser.. N whts da point of imitating a lame childish show tht promotes da collectin of GYM badges if ya noe wht i mean.. bet the person wasted lotsa money of em shiity badges..<br><br>Spiky hairstyle.. bed head, explosive head.. strikin hair colors with no color coordination is unglam too.. Why act lyk a bung.. some girls spend hours tryin ta spike their head or make emselves look lyk guys. while others havin strange colored hair lyk.. dirty dirty brownish yellowish greenish poo colored fringe.. it leaves me wonderin how those girls got pass checks in their assed schs. Nt tht im jealous or wht but it shows ther taste in fashion sux..<br><br>Surprised thers still pple doin these things mentioned abv..

Behave lyk it's prom nite N exhibit ya most gentlemenly N lady-lyk side of ya especially whn ya in sch premises! nt ta act high class but more ta prevent shamin yaself unnecessarily.. Accidents occur all da time ya? Be on ya best N stay calm regardless of situation whether an asshole spilled laksa on ya blouse or skirt.. Scold N screw tht b!tch someone nt in public so ya dont shame her N yrself too.. Demand fer money ta buy a new one or exchange dirtied article of clothin fer da day.. simple as tht!<br><br>It's glam ta converse in english.. i repeat N thts good english nt ah beng's kind of slip-slop substandard english tht i dont comprehend.. Refrain frm usin slangs N languages tht may infuence others ta think ya belong ta a lower class N haf a mindset tht u are a typical sg beng or lian fer tht matter.. Speak as tho ya takin da oral exam for practicin N always watch ya grammar N pronounciation!! A tinge of american accent makes it a fantabulous finish to ya quest to speakin with class.. it's always good ta speak wif a rich voice N be confident whn conversin in english.. Use N showcase ya superb vocab too.. tht's if ya have it.. Important.. i repeat dont use hokkien unless absolutely necessary..<br><br>Movin on ta dressin.. off ta hell wif da multicoloured clips N pins only suited fer cheena lians.. ya hair is NOT an xmas true fer god sake. Have a special hairstyle tht nobody has.. be unique N classy.. nt followin da damned stereotype tht gals look great wif dead straight rebonded hair.. Yes i agree it does make a gal looks demure but it's nt da only way ta look classy N furthermore rebonded hair is overrated cuz too many pple spot tht hairstyle.. Dont agree with me? walk ta orchard road N see for yrself.. For me i'd recommend a lil of jap plus plus emo style.. wif SLIGht tints N highliting.. definately nt dye-ing a monotone tht makes ya look lian.. sometimes even Auntie. watch out for lousy hair salons tht costs 10 bucks for a ladies haircut cuz usually its nt of satisfactory standards.. ta me. Layers is nice but nt whn doin it excessively.. Juz a tip.. everythings good whn its nt done in da extreme side. For me i prefer a long fringe N nice distinct layers with a couple of hair extentions tht makes it stand out.. i'm daring i agree. For me i use diff kinds of hairspray ta give a slight colorin effect N holdin effect whn i feel there's a need ta.. sometimes even in sch.<br><br>Okay bout body piercings.. its my pleasure ta share my experience wif ya.. See im nt really a piercing freak or fan but ive made some pretty darin decisions. I pierced my tongue afta my o lvls N cldn't speak properly for a week but da feelins heavenly cuz i cld play wif da barbell in my mouth N it makes a gal look sophisticated (again my opinion). But now it's gone cuz durin da first three mths in jc.. i misplaced da 'ball' part of da barbell somehow.. dont think i swallowed it but it's gone. I replaced another one N thn my supervisin tutor Commanded me ta remove it instantly.. he's kinda dictative N i admit im scared of him.. he's singh btw. So it's gone until now.. Nt sure if da hole's still there but im thinkin of tryin ta put da barbell in soon afta my promos.. bout ears, TOO MUCh is nt appealing. I see secondary sch lians havin lyk 10 black studs in each ear with their fringe put behind their ears N actin cute in front of da neoprint mach N scoldin hokkien vulgarites at their mates.. unglam. Wht i've done is ive got 2 on my right ear N 4 on my left. 2 at da bottom, 2 on top for left...N one bottom N the other pierced at da tiny piece of flesh at da middle part of my right ear.. tht was da most painful one N my favourite piercin by far cept my tongue!! Nice ta touch it N looks very cool N stylish.. lurvs it loads.  I'd always haf dangling earrings or hoop ones cuz they look stylish nuff. Have one shaped lyk an ankh N i lurf it a lot.. often wear it. As for da other holes normally i put shiny studs tht look lyk bling blings.. (silvery stuff) or if sch thn it'll be stixs/studs.. Another in my collection is one of a blue/red dice.. made of acrylic.. looks damn cool but it's heavy..<br><br>Nose piercin makes a gal a woman.. lyk take kelly clarkson for example most guys think she's hot. it brings out da style in gals N at da same time shows bit of ther rebellious nature N naughty side which guys adore i noe.. I dont haf it but im contemplatin ta pierce it soon but nt sure whn yet.. my mom's surely goin ta object cuz as i said, she's still livin in da stone age wit totally conventional mindsets of equivalence to tht of a caveman.. or woman for tht matter..<br><br>In my opinion, jap style wif a mix of western style is totally hippie N glam!! Also theres no rule indicatin gals arent allowed ta wear thongs/ sexy underwear ta sch.. in my sch tht is.. nt sure for others. All i noe is tht we arent allowed ta wear coloured bras.. If ya prefer ta wear shorter skirts ta once again bring out da flirtatious N sexy side of ya.. ya might wanna listen ta this.. Go get ya sch skirts altered.. DONT fold or 'wear em high' juz ta make it looks short cuz acc ta my frens N also speakin frm experience, they dont work well.. Go ta tailor shops N ask em to retain da slits.. wasitline N all but alter it so it's dominantly shorter.. Yes.. tht N wear it low preferably on ya hips.. with a much shorter skirt sittin on ya hips, no matter wht it'll still be short.. I compared mine wif one of my frens frm XJC.. her skirts' newly bought frm da bookstore.. mine's lyk slightly less thn half its length but looks as good. Backtrackin.. wear it low nuff ta reveal bit of ya thong.. Tuck out ya shirt whneva ya can.. if nt push it slightly in ya skirt N pull it out again ta make it look loose N style.. Gals who wear big big shirts/blouses are nt cool but butches instead.. Always fold ya sleeves a bit.. juz a lil bit nt until it's lyk a frickin sleeveless top cuz tht makes ya look lyk an uncivilised lian preparin ta fight.<br><br>Stick some accessories such as glitter tattoo thts nt so strikin but visible if ya go near to ya arms juz below da line where ya fold ya sleeves to show ya style.. Dont choose or put somethin stupid.. obviously im nt tryin ta tell ya to get a real tattoo cuz it hurts f uckin badly N it's expensive N permanent. i do haf one however.. it's TINY.. 2x2 cm it's a letter B on my hip. A cool bandage on ya hands might be nice too.. but watch out for designs.. some are auntie N nt stylish.. See? bandages can be used for trends nowadays.. ha! Yes if ya wanna get a fake tattoo or airbrush.. do it on ya ankles.. it looks real good. Once again.. choose da rite design!!<br><br>Choice of bags/shoes are godly important.. Bianca's rule #2 is nt to use da same sling bag, tote bag or wear da same shoes with anyone in da school.. my #1 rule is nt to do anythin EXCESSIVELY for example piercings.. dying of hair etc.. Act as stylish as possible wif ya nice designer bags.. Dont go for brands lyk nike, adidas, puma etc cuz too many pple are usin them.. Choose brands frm da states tht's famous there N unheard of here N yet looks cool.. For example i'm wearin le coq shoes N usin a diesel bag.. It's limited edition so dont eva think cuz ya wont get it for cheap in singapore.. if ya wanna buy da EXACT same bag as me. I try ta change my bag almost everyday.. sometimes i use roxy N others.. Wear same shoes on both feet.. nt exchangin shoes wif ya friend N wearin diff ones on each feet N actin cool.. sorry it doesn't work.<br><br>Accessories.. wear at da most TWO rings N TWO bracelet.. makin it as if TWO is da magical number cuz anythin more will make ya look poseur N fake.. Chanel N gucci is nice but costly.. Speakin bout necklaces or whtever ya wear on ya neck.. i wear a silv necklace wif a coin N a letter B inscribed on da face occasionally.. B for bianca. most impt is ta be original.. lurv studded collars N wrist bands too tho it's a lil too hardcore punk.. so i dont use it in school..<br><br>Anything else i'll add as soon as i think of it.. tks fer readin guys.. Be sure ta follow if ya think wht i'm sayin is constructive in bringin out a hip and glam person in ya.. Impress pple wif my suggestions.. ;]<br><br>Bianca <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div></blockquote></div>
