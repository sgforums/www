If Taiwan really refuses to return to China, war WILL break out but may not be in the near future. Jiang Ze Ming once VOWED that before his term as the Chairman of Gong Chan Dang (Communist) ends, he will make sure that Taiwan returns to China. Well, after WWII, China leaders had always said what they mean and mean what they say. So i believe a war is inevitable between China and Taiwan if the latter does not give in.<br><br>Is China afraid of US ? Yes. But not in terms of military strength. China is afraid of economic sanctions, its WTO status and Human Rights Status. But face value is the most important to China, money, nah. She will be willing to pay all price to get Taiwan back.<br><br>Don't forget, China had once beaten US in the Vietnam War and she still possesses nuclear power.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The talk of Taiwan shd be independent is nonsensical! Taiwan hv always been part of China since the historic days, and reason why China didn't care Taiwan was being taken over by the Japs was becos they were already struggling with the Japanese on the mainland!<br><br>Lets put it this way... if Taiwan ever declares independence, as a Chinese, I'll support a war agst Taiwan, whether USA is in equation or not(well, if they are in the equation, the more we need to declare war). Such a declaration can be viewed as a rebellion by a state, and in my opinion, cannot be tolerated.<br><br>So what if Tibet follow suit? And maybe Fujian Province can declare independence also... sounds great... break up China in a few pieces, and we still hv USA as big brother.<br><br>What I can say is that USA is really scared of China, and thats why they are trying to interfere with Taiwan affairs. China already got back HK, and if they gets Taiwan back, 2 of the 4 economic dragons of Asia will be under China... imagine the economic impact, and the money it will generate for China's military building.<br><br>Be afraid... be really afraid....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming?

            <div class='col-md body'>bochup,<br><br>you are right ! If Taiwan goes to war, Provinces like Tibet, Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang , may follow suit. These provinces have longed to be independent (not Fujian though). Inner Mongolia is not much of a problem now, Tibet ... Dalai is not as powerful as before. Xinjiang, there is no distinct political figure, but if Taiwan declares independence, who knows if these provinces will take the chance to stage a revolution ? And the US will back them up (US has always been siding Tibet).<br><br>China will have to learn from the old Russia and not to follow her footsteps.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LittleMan,<br><br>Erhm, let's just make this clear. Tibet is NOT a province of China nor was it historically linked as part of the Middle Kingdom. To assimilate a national identity based on historical continuity also smacks of dangerous ideological biasness ; this is perhaps best illustrated by Iraq's insistence on having Kuwait since it was all a part of the Babylon empire, of which Bagdhad was the centrepiece.<br><br>To go back to Tibet, the theocracy was annexed by China, clear and simple. The political implication of Tibet was it's proximity and it's borders with India and at the time of annexation of Tibet, China was keen on creating a buffer zone between the Mainland and the Indian peninsula. It's safer to secure another "warfront" if need be, and it would be better still, if it was someone else's backyard which was bombed, you see. Tibet itself was really causing China any problems, but, you know, political survival means sacrifice, and there are no morals.<br><br>cheers.<br><br>------------------<br>It doesn't mean that love always has to obey Mariah Carey ...

            <div class='col-md body'>Just in case I had confused some young forumites here regarding Tibet, here's some facts I gathered while i was doing Chinese Literature years back and when I spent 4 months in China just last year :<br><br>Barclay, for your info too, enjoy !<br><br>What the Western Countries say :<br><br>Tibet was invaded by the Chinese PLA in 1949. An uprise by the Tibetans took place in 1959. Since then Dalai Lama had seek political asylum elsewhere ... The issue was brought up to the UN but the Chinese PLA never leaves Tibet.<br><br>What the history of China says :<br><br>The Tibetan Kingdom started as far back as the 7th Century as the Tubo Dynasty. During that time, China was ruled by the Tang Dynasty. Relationships between the 2 dynasties had been excellent. In 641, Princess Wencheng (member of Tang Taizong's family) was betrothed to Tibet. In 710, Princess Jincheng was also betrothed to Tibetan King Tsugtsen (correct spelling ???). Both dynasties were VERY closely related. 3 "Tang-Tubo Alliance Stelae" were even erected. One still stands at Lhasa (go see for yourself !)<br><br>After the Tang Dynasty came the Song Dynasty. Similarly, both Song and Tubo Dynasties had enjoys years of good relations.<br><br>After that came the Genghis Khan who unified China. It was then when Tibet was conquered and ruled under the law of Kublai Khan (121?-1294), Yuan Dynasty. Since then Tibet has been under the central government at Dabu (the present Beijing)<br><br>After that came the Ming and Qing Dynasties and Tibet remained as part of China and was under the control of the central government. But they enjoy certain level of autonomy, like religion and customs.<br><br>In 1911, the Qing Dynasty was overthrown in the Xin(1) Hai(1) Ge(2) Ming(4) (Xinhai Revolution). In 1949, People's Republic of China was founded by Mao Zedong of course.<br><br>In 1951, representatives of the central government and local tibetan government signed the 17-Article Agreement. I shall not bore you with the details of the Article. But basically it says :<br><br>a.  PLA will march into Tibet to drive out the imperialists and the local tibetan army will help PLA with that.<br>b.  Tibetan customs will be protected and religious freedom granted. The old Tibetan system will also be unaltered and Dalai Lama will remain as the religious and political leader of Tibet.<br><br>In 1959, an armed rebellion took place. It aimed to abolish the feudal serf system and wanted democratic reform.<br><br>In that same year, Zhou Enlai, dissolved the Tibet local government and abolished the feudal serf system and implemented democratic reform as requested by the Tibetans.<br><br>The new Tibet was formally formed in 1965. But before much can be done, the Cultural Revolution took place and it lasted 10 years from 1966 to 1976.<br><br>1976, Mao Zedong died, and Gang of Four arrested. Then it came Sun Zhong San's Gong Chan Dang and Jiang Jie Shi's KMT .. blah blah blah .. not important liao.<br><br>And so ... we have the Tibet today !<br><br>So who do you believe ? China or the western countries ? Your choice. The truth is out there, not here. hehe</div>
