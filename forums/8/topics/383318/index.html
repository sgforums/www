              <p>Get her to sell you half the flat. You pay her with CPF money, i.e you transfer half  the CPF cost of the flat from your account to her account.</p>
              <p>Have HDB list your mum and yourself as joint owners of the flat.</p>
              <p>For joint ownership, the survivor gets all. That means if your mum dies the whole flat belongs to you. If you die, the whole flat belongs to your mum.</p>

              <p>it would be better to sit down and talk about it. you might just say it out straight instead of thinking of ideas to beat around the bush.</p>
              <p>like what kitty said, it's better to put up a will or nomination so that in future, when she passes on, she can choose who to give her assets to. it's a wiser choice to go instead of asking her to put your name in. since you are the only child, chances are you will get all of her asset unless you are not in her books.</p>
              <p>give her choices instead of telling her what to do (don't push her into a corner).</p>

              <p>HDB and CPF is different thing.</p>
              <p>And you did not mention your own age which means I can only give you general answers.</p>
              <p>So Yes.  The HDB flat could be under yours and your fathers name if she passes on.</p>
              <p>And in the event that your grandmother survive, the CPF will pay out to you and your grandmother, and if you are below legal age, the finances will be managed by your grandmother till you turn 21.</p>
