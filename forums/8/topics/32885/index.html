            <div class='col-md body'><br>Online shoppers jump at offer of printer at bargain price of S$66<br><br>By Wong Siew Ying<br><br>Some online shoppers thought they had hit the jackpot when they found a Hewlett Packard colour laser jet printer, which usually costs S$3,800, going on sale on Monday for just S$66.<br><br>One of those who jumped at the offer at the website run by Digiland Mall is Mr Tan, a student.<br><br>Advertisement<br><br>Mr Tan knows a good deal when he sees one, and on Monday morning, he took up the offer after hearing about it from a friend.<br><br>And the university student is not the only one, many others have ordered the printer that's usually priced at S$3,800.<br><br>Some have even been billed the S$66 advertised as the printer's price.<br><br>But just a few hours after receiving confirmation for his order, Mr Tan discovered the webpage had been taken down.<br><br>He, and many others who ordered the printer, hope the local online company will honour the deal, even if it was a mistake.<br><br>Mr Tan said: "They'll have to be so-called responsible for their actions, because with regards to e-commerce, it's just like setting up another shop and making price tags."<br><br>But when contacted the Consumers Association said that although it is good practice for companies to honour such deals, online transactions like these are not binding even if a customer's credit card is billed, if the company doesn't accept payment.<br><br>In such cases, consumers just have to accept that the company made a mistake and the deal was really too good to be true.<br><br>And that is exactly what's happened.<br><br>In a statement released on Monday, Digiland says it received 4,000 orders for the printer at the wrong price but adds that it was a genuine mistake and the company does not intend to process any of them.<br><br></div>
