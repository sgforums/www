Max 18,19... Despo for wat? Don't have gf then dun have lor. Time is still on your side.<br><br>And stop lumping yourself with disabled people. Face it. You are worse than them. They adopt positive outlooks on their lives and do not whine about their disadvantages.<br><br>What annoys me is that you try to allude your perceived lack of looks as a disability. Give some respect to the disabled man. They do <strong>NOT</strong> deserve this kind of attitude from you.<br><br>I am flaming TS not because he is despo or he is 'disabled' or what. His attitude sux downright.<br><br>The disabled see their disability as a stone on which buildings can be built on. You see the stone as an obstacle in your life.<br><br>Thing is, your 'stone' is wayyyy smaller than theirs. Who knows, the 'stone' may not even exist.<br><br>Please wake up. Nothing is going to change if you do not do anything about it.<br><br>Whining will get you nowhere. Actions get you something.<br><br>If TS still wallowing in self-pity, please just go rot and die.<br><br>Society is much better without you.</div>
