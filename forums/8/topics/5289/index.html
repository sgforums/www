            <div class='col-md body'>I've had this experience that when I went out with different guys on different occasions, I was accused of 2-timing. Sometimes pple juz assume that u are his/her gf/bf coz u go out together often. Its not a good feeling, so if I ever suspect my bf of doing that, the best solution shld be a direct confrontation instead of blindly assuming that I am right. Most of the time, things are not what they seem.<br><br>Also, beware wat frens say, innocent situations often explode into full-blown rumours when they get passed ard.</div>

She wouldn't have found out but I told her about it eventually. I broke up with her because I knew I would be unfaithful to her again. I didn't want to lie to her again because she loved me very much.<br><br>Although I loved her, the love wasn't deep enough to keep me out of flings. I really had to break up, I hated lying all the time. And it was very stressful keeping so many girlfriends at one go.<br><br>(P.S. I am now a '1 woman' man.

I dun knoe if i am able to trust her again as i had trusted her before.
