This particular neighborhood has its taste of uniqueness. And the particular warmth and friendliness makes it special in my heart all through childhood. Of all the history that I had here, what really sets me reminded of the place long after I moved out is this neighbor of mine Nancy. She was a friendly middle aged lady in her 50s who loves to bake chicken pie. Her skill excels tremendously in this particular liking of her and often baked extras for everyone in the neighborhood. I loved her chicken pie with much fervency to the extend of occasionally craves upon the softly tender chicken and the aromatic flour linings covering. Thinking of it makes my tongue shivers.<br>One day she disappeared from the neighborhood. Little was known why. Time fades the remembrance of this kind lady, until recently during a family gathering had my mum reminded us of this lady whom we so kindly remembered for her pie. She was actually arrested for murdering and mutilating her four years younger husband. When the police arrived, they could only find the few remaining parts of the heads and limbs in the fridge. The other parts were never found....</div></blockquote>told u guys human meat makes good food. especially pies <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

I sympathized with her and decided to help her. In the end she fell in love with me and in West Philadelphia, born an' raised, on the playground is where i spent mosta my days, Chillin out, maxin', relaxin' all cool, An' all shootin some B-ball outside of the school, When a couple o' guys who were up to no good, Started makin' trouble in my neighbourhood, I got in one little fight and my mom got scared, She said 'You're movin with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air!' I begged and pleaded with her day after day,but she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket I put my walkman on and saig 'IÂ´d might as well kickin' First class, 'Yo, this is bad' drinkin orange juice out of a champange glass 'Is this what the people of Bel Air live like?' 'Hmm.. this might be allright!' The way IÂ´d hear the percy, boots white and all I had to sit as I have a place of they just in this school cat 'I donÂ´t think so', 'I see what i get there' I hope theyÂ´re prepared for the Prince of Bel Air! Well I, tha plain land and when I came out there was a dude look like a cop standin' there with my name out 'I ainÂ´t trying to get arrested yet, 'I just got here' I sprang with the quickness like light has disappeared I whistled for a cab and when i came near, The license plate said 'Fresh', And had dice in the mirror, If anything i could say that this cab was rare, But I thought 'Nah, forget it - Yo, home to Bel-Air!' I pulled up to the house at bout seven or eight, I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo home, smell ya later!' I looked at my kingdom, I was finally there! To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air!<br><br></div></blockquote>Sounds like a song... WAIT! i remember! it's the opening song thing for a really old tv show starring will smith.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by banzie:</div><div class="quote_body">One more<br><br>Years ago I lived in a rather spacious part of Singapore in the outskirts towards the shores in a particular private landed estates. This particular neighborhood has its taste of uniqueness. And the particular warmth and friendliness makes it special in my heart all through childhood. Of all the history that I had here, what really sets me reminded of the place long after I moved out is this neighbor of mine Nancy. She was a friendly middle aged lady in her 50s who loves to bake chicken pie. Her skill excels tremendously in this particular liking of her and often baked extras for everyone in the neighborhood. I loved her chicken pie with much fervency to the extend of occasionally craves upon the softly tender chicken and the aromatic flour linings covering. Thinking of it makes my tongue shivers.<br>One day she disappeared from the neighborhood. Little was known why. Time fades the remembrance of this kind lady, until recently during a family gathering had my mum reminded us of this lady whom we so kindly remembered for her pie. She was actually arrested for murdering and mutilating her four years younger husband. When the police arrived, they could only find the few remaining parts of the heads and limbs in the fridge. The other parts were never found....</div></blockquote>Ok now this is scary. I am not kidding.</div>

For me I had this liking of going to pubs and bars after work till late preyed upon girls who are willing to spend the night with me in waves of passion till morning as I left for work. I guess that is me. So one night I went to this bar which is one of my favorite liking to enjoy the night in musics and alittle drink before long did I noticed this girl sitting opposite me entices me. Pretty and stunning is what I would used to describe her. I know what she wants in her mind and what my desire is thinking. I approached her as we surprisingly chatted for a rather long period of time and it seems she had every interest which I liked and involved in. What really intrigued me is her uncanny familiarity to someone whom I had known before.<br>We thoroughly enjoyed the night while it last. As we left the pub, she wanted me to her house. As we reaches her house we instantly sticked upon one another in rows of foreplay, kissing and fondling. Before long, she wanted to play something unusual. Although I had never done so with anyone before, I was thrilled to my every hair submerging into my personal fantasy of exotic eroticism. She dimmed the lights and tied the naked me unto the bed post with her petite little strand of power and willfulness but with every utmost of tediousness to ensure I couldn't get out. Gosh I'm aroused.<br>Then she careful grinned at me, she lean forward and reaches for the drawer beside the bed groping for an item, it shines in the dimmed lights meant for romantism. Its a scissor. She whispered "Remember me, Rosy? The girl you dumped 6 months ago, how's my new plastic?" as she wail the scissor with a smirk.<br></div></blockquote>this 1 dun really have that mysterious twist.</div>
