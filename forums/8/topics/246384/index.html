            <div class='col-md body'>I also got this story to tell, there was once I was eating at a restaurant, I met this beautiful girl, she said she worked very hard to support her family and she does 3 part time jobs as well as go to school and but her money is running out and she has to quit school. I sympathized with her and decided to help her. In the end she fell in love with me and in West Philadelphia, born an' raised, on the playground is where i spent mosta my days, Chillin out, maxin', relaxin' all cool, An' all shootin some B-ball outside of the school, When a couple o' guys who were up to no good, Started makin' trouble in my neighbourhood, I got in one little fight and my mom got scared, She said 'You're movin with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air!' I begged and pleaded with her day after day,but she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket I put my walkman on and saig 'IÂ´d might as well kickin' First class, 'Yo, this is bad' drinkin orange juice out of a champange glass 'Is this what the people of Bel Air live like?' 'Hmm.. this might be allright!' The way IÂ´d hear the percy, boots white and all I had to sit as I have a place of they just in this school cat 'I donÂ´t think so', 'I see what i get there' I hope theyÂ´re prepared for the Prince of Bel Air! Well I, tha plain land and when I came out there was a dude look like a cop standin' there with my name out 'I ainÂ´t trying to get arrested yet, 'I just got here' I sprang with the quickness like light has disappeared I whistled for a cab and when i came near, The license plate said 'Fresh', And had dice in the mirror, If anything i could say that this cab was rare, But I thought 'Nah, forget it - Yo, home to Bel-Air!' I pulled up to the house at bout seven or eight, I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo home, smell ya later!' I looked at my kingdom, I was finally there! To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air!<br><br></div>

Years ago my uncle and I started a simple textile business which seems to work pretty well over the years. Of course we expanded the company rapidly. My uncle had always taught me to work hard with our bare hands to achieve what we wanted. He was really an inspiration of my life. I aspire and admire him greatly and remember much he taught me thru the years. Until things turn different... He was a very sporty and healthy person until he was diagnosed with a strange illness shortly after his marriage.<br><br>Doctors were unable to determine the cause of this illness as my uncle consistently having cardio arrests. What is really pitiful is the newly wed wife Susan. They were married barely months. She was a young stunning lady bout 20 years younger than my uncle. While my uncle was hospitalised. Susan had almost everyday visited Dave bringing personally cooked porridges feeding him patiently to the very last moments of my uncle death. I would be lying if I had not a sense of envy or Jealousy. Everyone in the hospital said praises of this magnificent woman. How nice she is and how fortunate my uncle was. I saw it personally a couple of times and was really deeply touched by her love for my uncle. Guess love have no boundaries, but whatever to end will ends one day. My uncle dead eventually. We grieved over his death which is extremely painful for both of us. It was a year ago. Both Susan and I loved him so much.<br><br>Now I'm too infected with the same kind of unknown illness which my uncle had. The doctor said it could likely be genetic. I felt my moments are ending soon. Perhaps no more than a week or so. There Susan who is now my wife, brought her personally prepared porridge feeding me by my bedside day by day. How loved I felt.....<br></div></blockquote>I get the other 2 stories but for this, Susan is the one that killed them both with the porridges also? sick.</div>

Well I did... and I happened to got to know this girl, online of coz. We chatted for sometime, years in fact. Somehow we had a click towards each other. We talked about almost everything under the sun. She seems to be the person for me and me the person for her. We even vowed to marry each other. We expressed love and calling each other darlings. Things was of course going well for us until I met someone else I loved. Someone in person. My heart changed for her. Many a times I tried to avoid her. But upon much request and pleading we met... She's not particularly pretty or neither is she ugly. But I guess she is quite pleasant by any standards. But I guess my heart was with another person now. After that particular meeting, I tried hard to avoid her so as not to hurt her further.<br>One day, while leaving for my house as I opened the door she appeared. She waited for me, but I was kinda furious how she managed to got hold of my address. We chatted shortly before I made an excuse and left. For days she kept calling my handphone and smsing me. Soon she started to appeared at my work place, which I'm really starting to get kinda annoyed. Finally in order to spite her I told her I was attached and planning for marriage, she was so hurt that she left in tears. Although I felt kinda bad, but I guess its the best for both of us.<br>As usually the days goes by but only for one that I hadn't heard from her anymore. I attended a company function and got home kinda late, feeling alittle ditzy from the drink earlier. Traveling through the usual route home alone when suddenly I saw a light coming towards me.<br>The next thing I know is I'm in a hospital as the doctor beside me telling me to be prepared as I'm going to be paralyzed for life and to be on wheelchair. I had an car accident and it was her who sent me to hospital. Now she came into the room sat beside me as she whisper gentle, "Now I can take care of your forever....."</div></blockquote>I like this one. I was smiling when I read near the end.</div>

Some are pleasant, some aren't as nice.... me too.... guess what I remembered most about my childhood, is Anne.  Cute, petite and quiet little girl which I got to know in my primary school. She only joined our class at the start of primary 6, with not much friends I seems to be her only friend at school. We got kinda close playing together despite my other boys friends reluctant to let her join. The only problem with her is her sickly body.  She is always sick, often complaining of stomaches and vomiting.<br><br>I know little of her background, except that she had a very stern mother that refused to let her eat anything than what was cooked personally by her and refused her to know much people. Her father left her family after he got to know her mother was pregnant with her. Anyway our friendship was kinda close.<br><br>She did brought me to her house once. Where it was quite empty, what else could one expect from a single parent family. Only one that does find particularly of interest to me. Is the number of rats poison her mother had bought. She said it was for the rats in their house which is a 13 storey HDB. I had that wonder for years after the incident. Shortly after our visitation her mum got home and chased me out and a tough scolding to her petite daughter. After that she got 3 day MC for severe diarrhea. Little did I know why but she never brought me to her house again and months later, a week before the Final exam she no longer attended school.....<br></div></blockquote>sounds like the 6th sense... brrr<br><br>pm me the source, its nice...</div>
