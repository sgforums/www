            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore striker arrives on trial<br><br>Story by Rob Davies<br><br>Notts County Mad<br>12 July 2005<br>Singapore International striker Noh Alam Shah has today arrived at Meadow Lane for an initial two-week trial, with a view to a permanent move if all goes well.<br>Shah comes with an excellent record from his native league, having scored 15 goals in 16 games this season for top S League club Tampines Rovers.<br><br>And, after recent speculation on the NCM messageboard, the pacey Singapore international touched-down in England today and will immediately start training with the Magpies, hoping to impress Notts boss Gudjon Thordarson enough to earn a permanent deal with the Magpies.<br><br>The talented hitman was recently voted one of the best players in Asia and has longed for a move abroad for a considerable amount of time. To say he is highly-rated in Singapore would be a vast understatement.<br><br>Where's 'yer ark?<br>The move has come about due to the fact that manager of the Singapore national team, former Notts County goalkeeper Raddy Avramovich, has maintained good relations with non-executive director Howard Wilkinson since the pair worked together at Meadow Lane.<br><br>It is believed Avramovic has told Wilkinson that he believes Shah is already good enough to cope with the rigours of League Two football.<br><br>"A lot of people have worked very hard to make this possible and I am going there to try my very best," Shah told a press conference in his native Singapore.<br><br>"It's the dream of a lifetime. I am very excited about this chance for sure and I hope to achieve something out of this trip."<br><br>One worry for the striker had been his lack of height, with the 25-year-old standing at just 5'8. Fortunately though, the blossoming worldwide reputation of last season's top scorer, Glynn Hurst, has re-assured Shah that it can be done.<br><br>"I've had a look at their (Notts County's) website and guess what? Their top scorer from last season (Glynn Hurst) is the same height as me.<br><br>"They've got some very tall defenders but it's quite encouraging to know that even someone who is as tall as me could do well there."<br><br>Should the trial at Meadow Lane prove unsuccesful, Shah shouldn't be too concerned. Portsmouth, Norwich City and Coventry are all thought to be monitering the hitman.<br><br>As well as Shah, Avramovic is also believed to have recommended goalkeeper Lionel Lewis, though a possible move for Lewis is likely to come much later, with next summer a possibility.<br><br>Should the striker sign for the Magpies on a permanent basis, he would become the seventh first-team frontman at the club, with Andy White signing for Gudjon's men in the past week.<br><br>If nothing else, Shah's trial has ensured that Notts County is a name now frequently used in both the national Icelandic AND Singapore media. Spread the word: We're on the up!<br>For any update's on the Shah story, be sure to check back to NCM.</div>
