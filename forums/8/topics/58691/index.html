            <div class='col-md body'>Welcome to the world of Reverse Pinkerton Couplings or rice-loving white women and sarong party boys<br><br>SHE is white, but embraces all things Asian, including the men.<br><br>He is a confident global nomad, unafraid of the expressive Caucasian woman.<br><br>They are more likely to have met overseas, but now live here in HDB flats or restored old terrace houses. Traces of Singlish have crept into her crisply enunciated accent.<br><br>Welcome to the world of Reverse Pinkerton Couplings, which are a rarer sight in Singapore than those between Caucasian men and local lasses.<br><br>Forty-nine Asian men tied the knot with Caucasian brides here last year, compared to 402 marriages between Caucasian men and Asian women.<br><br>It looks like the Pinkerton Syndrome, named after the American naval officer who seduced the Japanese geisha in Puccini's opera Madama Butterfly, is very much alive and well.<br><br>Still, LifeStyle found the reverse scenario of Asian men dating ang moh women to be catching on here, with more local lads at ease with white gals.<br><br>Arm-wrestling for love<br><br>SPARKS first flew between marketing communications specialist Stephanie Green-Chen, 37, and her Singaporean creative director-husband at work.<br><br>After meeting about seven years ago, they got married in 1998, and now have a four-year-old son.<br><br>Originally from Perth, Australia, Ms Green-Chen says she is seeing a lot more mixed-race couples in the 10 years she has lived here, 'and not just old farts and their SPGs'.<br><br>She thinks local guys who check out Caucasian women are likely to be articulate white-collar professionals who frequent clubs like Zouk and trendy restaurants.<br><br>German Stefanie Steiger, 30, has worked as a graphic designer here for four years and dated several Singaporean guys.<br><br>She describes such men as 'self-confident, usually educated or raised overseas and with ambitions that reach beyond a four-room HDB flat'.<br><br>This description could well apply to Raffles Hotel executive assistant manager Nikheel Advani, a 32-year-old Singaporean-Indian engaged to Brazilian-Czech hotelier Tina Lyra, 24.<br><br>His dream location for their wedding ceremony in 2006 is a beach in Brazil - on a resort to be built and owned by the couple.<br><br>Mr Advani, who met his fiancee while they were both working in New York, says he 'enjoys the physical and mental challenge that I don't usually experience with Asian women, perhaps because of our education system which doesn't encourage you to challenge authority'.<br><br>Among other things, he enjoys arm-wrestling with Ms Lyra, and notes that many Caucasian women do not expect the guy to foot the bill 'till they feel that both are a true couple'.<br><br>While acknowledging that this could be intimidating to Asian men used to more submissive or gentle behaviour from women, he thinks times are changing.<br><br>He knows many Asian guys with Caucasian partners, among them his best friend, 'a Singaporean Bangladeshi who speaks Malay and who married a wonderful French lady. They live in San Francisco - both true global citizens'.<br><br>Meeting the parents<br><br>THE success rate for Reverse Pinkerton Couplings seems to be higher if the pair meet overseas, perhaps because Asian guys are a minority in Western countries and hence stand out as more 'exotic' and also because they feel less pressure away from home.<br><br>That is the view of business development executive Edwin Tan, 28, who had a Scottish girlfriend while at university in Edinburgh, but has not dated any Caucasians here.<br><br>Apart from there being fewer expat women here in their 20s, he thinks that most Singapore guys are quite content with Asian women. When abroad, however, the men would be more adventurous, in the name of 'cultural immersion'.<br><br>Ms Tracie Pang, 35, the British wife of MediaWorks artist Adrian Pang, feels 'a lot of Singapore guys don't think that a Caucasian girl would fancy them, so it really means that the girl has to do all the work'.<br><br>She also thinks that while men here may take more chances and ask girls of different races out, 'as they get older and of marrying age, they seem to become old-fashioned again and date a good Chinese girl'.<br><br>Others say this is largely because Asian men and women are very much ruled by their parents in making decisions.<br><br>Briton Tracey Stanton, 33, who owns RedAlchemy, a company which runs holistic workshops, has dated three Asian men here of different races: Chinese, Indian and Indonesian.<br><br>Each man lived with his parents.<br><br>She was never asked home to meet their folks, either because of religious or cultural differences 'or because you are not yet ready to get married'.<br><br>The flip side of this, however, is that dates between Singaporean guys and Caucasian women can be more relaxed, with fewer expectations of marriage.<br><br>As women tend to start having sex earlier in the West, they may be more adventurous in bed, although as Mr Edwin Tan puts it 'just because they have the potential to sleep around doesn't mean they will. You've still got to turn them on'.<br><br>Local roots<br><br>REVERSE Pinkerton couples are global in their outlook. In their day-to-day lives, however, they are as Singaporean as they come.<br><br>Ms Green-Chen notes: 'Most of us feel uncomfortable with the typical 'expat' tag. We don't do the American Club. We don't have the huge bungalows, or the company-paid private school education for the kids.'<br><br>Australian Yvette Flanigan, 33, lives with her Chinese-Singaporean physiotherapist-husband in an executive HDB flat in Tampines.<br><br>She is planning to send her six-year-old son Reuben to neighbouring East Spring Primary School next year.<br><br>The international schools here are too expensive for her, and 'I like that he'll be learning Mandarin in school', she says.<br><br>Family matters<br><br>LIFESTYLE aside, the importance of the extended family plays a significant role in the success or failure of a Reverse Pinkerton marriage.<br><br>Ms Green-Chen says that 'Caucasian women would not take kindly to living with their mother-in-law, so that could be a problem if he is a traditional kind of guy'.<br><br>But there are exceptions to the rule. Ms Flanigan had no problems living with her Hokkien-speaking in-laws for nearly five years. They picked up English to converse with her.<br><br>When she and her husband moved into their own place two years ago, they did a very Singaporean thing - they moved into the flat just below his parents.<br><br>Perhaps, just as Caucasian women assimilate into life here, Singaporeans are growing more accustomed to the global melting pot this island is slowly becoming.<br><br>As Ms Flanigan puts it: 'When I first came to Singapore nearly 10 years ago, HDB heartlanders would turn and stare at me, but not anymore.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Freed from the apron strings<br><br>FUNNYMAN Adrian Pang, now 37, was cavorting about in drag here in a 1994 Singapore Repertory Theatre (SRT) comedy, The Magic Fundoshi, when he first met Briton Tracie Howitt. She was the stage manager.<br><br>A year later, they tied the knot in London, where he was based for 10 years as a stage actor.<br><br>In 2001, the couple moved back to Singapore with their two boys, Zack, aged four, and Xander, three.<br><br>He is now an artist with MediaWorks while Tracie, 35, who now goes by the name Tracie Pang, is artistic director of SRT's children's theatre division, The Little Company. They live in a terrace house in the East Coast.<br><br>HE SAYS: 'When I first went to the UK, my first girlfriend happened to be Chinese. When I told a friend back in Singapore about her, his reply was: 'It's like going to Burger King and ordering char siew fan.'<br><br>'After that, I had girlfriends who were English, American, German, Swedish, Jamaican and Indian, as well as Chinese.<br><br>'Perhaps it was because I had these relationships away from home, I did not feel any pressure from my own species to abide by any traditional and more conservative 'Asian' norms.<br><br>'I think that the Singapore man who dates a Caucasian woman is probably one who has been, to an extent, freed from the apron strings of his family.<br><br>'Since family plays such a big part in our lives as Singaporeans, a guy will inevitably feel a considerable amount of pressure to stick to the 'tried and tested' road of settling down with a nice girl of the same culture.<br><br>'The majority of Singaporean families are pretty conservative and still harbour a vague suspicion of 'the Evil White Man', and his terrifying counterpart, 'the Evil White Woman'.<br><br>'As such, the average Singapore Joe will probably not be able to convince his frantic family that his ang moh char bor peng yu (Caucasian girlfriend) is worthy of their precious 'boy-boy', until they are married, and beautiful half-ang moh babies are produced for good measure.'<br><br>SHE SAYS: 'I first came to Singapore in 1989, on my own, to visit my parents - my father was a diplomat who had been posted here.<br><br>'I found it a clean and safe place for a single woman to live and work. I liked it so much I stayed on for four years, even after my parents left. I worked in the theatre here as a stage manager.<br><br>'Previous Singaporean men whom I dated were not really your run-of-the-mill Singapore guys. One was a deejay and the other had spent many years living in New York and, you know what? They were no different from any other men whom I had dated.<br><br>'So what set Adrian apart? His talent - I think talent is an aphrodisiac.<br><br>'We lived with his parents for a few months when we came back here two years ago. It took me a while to get used to how Asian families work.<br><br>'For example, grandparents here expect to help you out with your kids, whereas in Britain, they want to just enjoy their grandchildren - the understanding is that you do the parenting yourself.<br><br>'I think where both partners are Singaporean there is already an understanding of what is expected of them in an extended family situation, and you just get on with it.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>She can rough it out<br><br>AS A first-year undergraduate at Australia's University of Queensland, Tan Hai Yang was usually holed up in his room studying.<br><br>He emerged for a college Christmas party in December 1990, where he first met fellow student Yvette Flanigan.<br><br>They started going out several months later. In 1994, they got married in Singapore, and have lived here for the past eight years.<br><br>Tan, now 33, is a physiotherapist at Changi General Hospital. His wife, also 33, is a manager at Exploit Technologies.<br><br>They live in an executive HDB flat in Tampines with their three sons, Reuben, aged six, Ryan, four, and five-month-old Rowan.<br><br>HE SAYS: 'I had never dated a Caucasian girl before Yvette, but I felt really comfortable with her. My previous girlfriends were all Chinese-Singaporeans.<br><br>'I guess being overseas, your perspective on life changes. I liked that she and her friends were down-to-earth and not at all materialistic. They could cook, make their own clothes and take care of themselves.<br><br>'I was impressed that she could rough it out. Once, she went backpacking with a friend in Tasmania, and they just pitched a tent and slept out in the open.<br><br>'My Hokkien-speaking parents, who speak only a little English, respected my decision to marry Yvette. We lived with them for nearly five years before we got our own flat.<br><br>'But when my late grandmother found out I was dating a Caucasian, she asked me why I did not go for a Singaporean-Chinese girl. Eventually Granny accepted her and would talk to her, even though they didn't speak the same language. Yvette would just hold her hand and listen.'<br><br>SHE SAYS: 'When I was an undergraduate, I had many Singaporean guy friends, all of whom were keen on committed long-term relationships.<br><br>'This really struck me and my girlfriends. Maybe this is something instilled in them by the education system here, or from 2 1/2 years of national service.<br><br>'In comparison, all the guys we knew from Australia, Europe or even other Asian countries like India and Japan were not interested in any kind of commitment until they hit 30.<br><br>'Two weeks after we first hit it off, Hai Yang was already broaching the subject of where we wanted the relationship to go, which was a little scary.<br><br>'But later I saw it was really responsible of him, because as a PSC scholarship holder, he would have to go back home after his studies to serve out his bond.<br><br>'Living with my in-laws here was a blessing. They helped us watch the children and do the housework while we worked.<br><br>'We got so used to it that when the unit below their Tampines flat became available, we bought it, instead of getting a place further away.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>She popped the question first<br><br>SINGAPOREAN Nikheel Advani, 32, is ethnically Indian but was born in Nigeria, speaks fluent Mandarin and spent seven years studying and working in the United States.<br><br>Three years ago, he met his Brazilian-Czech fiancee Tina Lyra, 24, when they were both working at The Ritz-Carlton hotel in New York.<br><br>They have lived here for 10 months in a condominium in the West. He is now executive assistant manager at the Raffles Hotel and she, catering sales manager at The Regent Singapore.<br><br>HE SAYS: 'My impression of Caucasian women is that they are bold, in your face and very aggressive in a good way. Before Tina, I dated several Caucasian women in the US.<br><br>'When I first met my fiancee - wow! - she had this energy and passion for life that I could feel. And she has the most beautiful blue eyes.<br><br>'She has a great sense of adventure and travel which keeps us jet-setting every chance we get. Being hoteliers, we don't often get long breaks. So we have coined the term, 'our 24-hour quickies'.<br><br>'These are short trips of about two to three days packed with activities and great dining.<br><br>'I think the difference is that traditional Asian women tend to be more conservative and comfortable with the status quo.<br><br>'Let me give you an example: Tina was the one who proposed to me first - on the knees, ring and all. Wow! I can't see an Asian girl doing that.<br><br>'This gender role reversal is what makes us equals. Some months later, I proposed to her in New York on a helicopter ride.'<br><br>SHE SAYS: 'My family background is very cosmopolitan and complicated. My father is Italian-American and my mother Czech.<br><br>'I was born in Brazil and have Brazilian-Czech citizenship, but have lived all over the world since the age of 12: Mexico, Switzerland, Paris, New York and now Singapore.<br><br>'Before I met Nikheel, my impression of Asian guys was that they tended to be very disciplined and studious. While Latinos tend to be openly bold and almost flamboyant, I would say Asian men are more private.<br><br>'The most amazing thing is that while still being extremely structured and meticulously organised, Nikheel is a passionate romantic. I think I have the best of both worlds with him.<br><br>'On our first date in his apartment, he asked me what I wanted for dinner: Thai, Indian or Chinese?<br><br>'Ten minutes after I told him Chinese, he made this amazing three-course Chinese meal out of whatever ingredients he had in his fridge.'<br><br>http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/lifestyle/story/0,4386,213054,00.html?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
