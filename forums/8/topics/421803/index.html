              <p>Still... on the issue of credit cards and banks.</p>
              <p>When I was earning lots of moolah as an IT Consultant, yes I con and then I insult, there was a period of time when everybody told me, rex, you gotta get into unit trusts and financial investment. Hence and therefore, I bought my first life insurance, TPD, accident, hospitalisation, and concurrently I achieved my very own credit-worthiness when I submitted my payslip to HSBC for a GOLD card.</p>
              <p>Two months later, I realised I got conned by HSBC, because my friends were all using PLATINIUM Citibank cards.</p>
              <p>Dog Gone It! How could I, a 2nd upper honours graduate, be using a gold card when a 2nd lower is using a PLATINIUM ONE, it is like Manchester United re-signing David Beckham while Arsenal re-bought Thierry Henry.</p>
              <p>Well, both are sh*tty players whom the whole world looks as if a symbol of status, but David has gold hair while Thierry has nice black... whatever.. the colour of the Platinium Card.</p>
              <p>Eons after I gotten the credit card, I began buying on installments, and before I knew it, I was in debt. Laptops are dirt cheap when you only pay $150 per month, and they only start to mean something when Lehmann Brothers came and your Nestleness got retrenched and even milo looks expensive.</p>
              <p>Hey. Stop this track, can you put on another record please?</p>
              <p>Ah, this other record is better.</p>
              <p>....... spin......</p>
              <p>And there and then, somebody said, how to take care of your credit card debts when you are out of a job... well, simple, cancel it!</p>
              <p>The nice girl, wow, Citibank counter girls wear black stockings and are super spicy.. she told me that if you want to cancel your credit card, I have to pay up all the outstanding debts. Well, I ask, can I pay in one lump sum then? She replied, sorry no. If you do so, will incur a penalty charge of $X. Then I said, what then?</p>
              <p>Well, she recommended, you can just cut your card up into two and stop buying.</p>
              <p>WOW.</p>
              <p>That is, genuine wisdom.</p>
              <p>Can I tear up your stockings into two, so that I can see your toes? Come on, just your toes. I will stop after that, I promise.</p>
              <p>Love,</p>
              <p>rex.</p>

              <p>I shall not forget to mention that she spoke with an unmistakenable FT accent. I swear, I love FTs. =) =) =) FT jobs are just what I need to pay off my credit card bills, and the FTs I encountered at my previous FT job was in worse debt than me.</p>
              <p>You know ah, in a Zhou called Hang ... the graduates are so poor that they have to check into hotels every vacation. They cannot afford marriage, if they get married they need to rob their parents and ancestors of all their money, and they heard also that if not, they can come to Singapore to work, but over in Singapore it is rumoured in the Zhou of Hang that every 1 in 10 crossover visitors get murdered. You must be careful of Singaporeans, if not you are rich and cannot make your way back home.</p>
              <p>Exercise caution when you earn Singaporeans money, that's what my FT colleague told me he was told when he had to choose between staying in the Zhou of Hang, of Singapore, or USA. Romance of Three Nations.</p>
