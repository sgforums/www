            <div class='col-md body'>In 2000-2003, LHL reduce the retrenchment benefits of workers from the usual practice of 1 month per year of service to just nothing. LHL has explained that this is done for the OVERALL GOOD of Singapore Workers.<br><br>He has clearly explained that if such termination benefits are not reduced and removed, the employer will have little incentive to hire people and hence there will be no jobs in Singapore. You have to ponder hard about this LOGIC, because it is reasoned by our elite leaders. If such benefits are taken away, McDonalds will not even set up in Singapore.<br><br>Now with such benefits removed, our dear leaders have created so many jobs by attracting many MNC. That is a real demonstration of genius by our beloved leader. However, not many people appreciate the beauty of the PAP's thinking..<br><br>Oct 1, 2005<br>Is it common for companies to sack older workers<br><br>I had been a loyal employee of McDonald's Singapore for the past 22 years and had risen from a Trainee Manager to Senior Restaurateur.<br><br>I had a reasonably good performance record over these years. In the past 12 months, my performance rating was excellent.<br><br>Recently, I was shocked to find myself given a Notice of Termination and was told to leave the company immediately without being given any reason.<br><br>I was given one month's pay in lieu of notice. I have to admit I had been naive to believe that a company needs to have reasonable cause to ask an employee to leave.<br><br>I subsequently wrote to the company to find out the reason for my termination, whether it was due to non-performance or something that I might have done that warranted such an action.<br><br>The reply I received was that 'contractually for termination of service or resignation from employment, either party is required to give one month's notice in writing or make payment of one month's salary in lieu thereof'.<br><br>So it had complied with the contractual obligations. This means that legally, it can terminate any employee's service anytime without having to give any reason.<br><br>In the past when McDonald's Singapore was a franchise, it showed compassion when it retrenched its employees, unless it was a case of dismissal.<br><br>It appears that McDonald's Singapore today, now owned by McDonald's Corporation in USA, would not hesitate to make use of a termination notice to remove its employees.<br><br>Employees are regarded as valuable assets for a company but if this is how valuable assets are treated, employees need to be wary of their vulnerability. This serves as a wakeup call.<br><br>I write to find out if this has become a common practice in other companies in Singapore, whether they have used this method to terminate the services of their old employees.<br><br>If there are others who face a similar predicament, perhaps they can write to share their experience. We can approach the Ministry of Manpower together to see if management employees can be given protection from companies which abuse the use of the termination notice.<br><br>Boon Geok Poh (Ms)<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ysatul:</div><div class="quote_body">if pap is willing to pay me, dat will b great. cos currently  i'm serving ns. as all would know, its difficult to get by with dat foreign worker's type of pay(300+). some more cos i had to do ot often until about 8+, i had to quit my part time job.<br>i said all those above only b'cos those r e facts! go to malaysia o indonesia n philipines n  c wat r their living standards like! c how r e average chinese been treated overthere! u r very fortunate to have time sitting in front of a pc complaining. most of the ppl living in other sea countries r either busy working, trying to earn enough to eat o dun havea pc at all.<br>may i know is anybody here perfect? did u score 100 in every test n exams dat u had taken  since e day u r born? nobody is perfect, so do pap n lky! com'on this is all jus common sense!</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've travelled far and wide to many countries - in Asia, Europe and North America. I can tell you there is one thing that other countries cannot beat us and that is the ability to provide employment for the elderly. In most countries, most of the elderly are unemployed, they are either sitting around in the park feeding pigeons, looking after grand children or playing chess with another unemployed elderly. I feel sorry for the elderly of these countries that their govt is unable to provide jobs for them.<br><br>This is where the Singapore government excels. You see old people working everywhere in Singapore at McDonalds, they even call me "Sir" and they say it with pride. In Hong Kong, there are so many unemployed old folks, they end up hanging around as customers at the McDonalds, so many that the McDonald's gives them discount cards....but discount cards are not the same as jobs which gives dignity and a sense of purpose to the old.<br><br>In Hong Kong, I saw so many old folks at McDonald's, I ended up buying a Happy Meal, because I felt so young . Most of them are just idling away their time reading the newspapers and chatting with friends instead of doing something useful. You might ask where did all these old folks in Hong Kong get money to eat at McDonalds?<br><br>Well, the Hong Kong govt is so lousy at redesigning jobs for them, they end up giving welfare from their financial reserves which is far smaller than ours - oh the Hong Kong govt is so lousy compared with the PAP. The PAP govt can use the money for far better things such as investing in Suzhou, Chartered Semiconductor and in Indonesian banks.<br><br>Our ministers have redesigned many jobs so that our old can continue to be employed for as long as they live. This is a uniquely Singapore success story. I'm beginning to appreciate the beauty of the PAP's thinking. Its absolutely brilliant!
