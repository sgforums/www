If you live pass 101 months than you gain $500 until you die.

            <div class='col-md body'>We singaporean should be thankful to our elite government for redesigning of jobs. The employment rate in Singapore subbornly stays at historically high levels and I thought the government might be at its wits end. But that is not so!!<br><br>I work at a small company in Kallang Basin, needless to say most of the workers are from China including the programmers. Many of them cannot speak English so I have to double up as TRANSLATOR which secures my job as the employer is not good at Mandarin.<br><br>During break time, like a good host, I always treat them some of our local delights available at the canteen. *Remember, my job as a translator depends on them..<br><br>While I was chatting with one of the Chinese PRC software programmers, he told me he has applied for Singaporean citizenship and will most likely get it. He said he receive much encouragement to be a Singaporean. WOW! I thought this must be a stroke of GENIUS by the PAP government :<br><br>1. By converting mainland Chinese to Singaporean, it would mean our unemployment will go down since there is one additional citizen with a job. Now I fully understand what the Singapore minister means when he said 'bringing foreigners to singapore will help to create jobs for Singaporeans'. Jobs are created for Singaporeans because the foreigner becomes a Singaporean!!! If that is not genius, what is?<br><br>2. The conversion of Chinese to Singaporeans will also quickly help solve the problem of Singaporeans unwilling to take up the responsibility of having kids.<br><br>From this episode, I can say some of the brilliance of our govt cannot be so easily appreciated...<br></div>

When you die, you don't have to worry about your children fighting over your CPF remainder because an annuity ends when you die. What a beautiful idea, you come to this earth with no money and leave no money when you die.<br><br>The Singapore government also sets a fine example in serving Foreign Talents. Around the world they have "Contact Singapore" offices to help these foreign talents find jobs in Singapore and they also help them to settle in well. In 1996, the Singapore govt also realise some of these FTs would be taken aback by the high housing prices in Singapore. Therefore, they provided enormous help to these foreign nationals on accomodations.<br><br>I think Singaporeans should be proud when they serve their National Service. They are protecting not just their fellow Singaporeans but the large number of FTs and PRs that reside here.<br><br>I'm beginning to appreciate the beauty of the PAP's thinking. Its absolutely brilliant! Singaporeans should consider themselves lucky to have such great leaders to guide them.</div></blockquote>Just wondering, how high is your IQ? To write such a sacarstic piece and fooling lots of people to think that you are supporting PAP.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>The health minister recently realised that the local tax payers had been paying subsidies for all the employers and foreign nationals medical bills.<br><br>Local house policies is anti sg. Its well known. My office "FT" laffs so hard everytime they read the HDB rules. And they added that they now understand why all of us Sg people don't feel we belong to sg and want to migrate out. The indian/prc "FT" were using Sg as a stepping stone to Aus so as to retire there. But while they are here, these people make extremely full use of the subsidies...<br><br>ultimately I wonder with all that taxes paying "FT" to stick around here, did it make us any $$$ or did it drive sg into worse positions than before... There will never be a real answer cause there's always a lot of cover up..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I found caramon's observations shallow and incomplete.<br>Talking about 'FTs creating jobs' is a serious distraction from the original purpose of attracting the FTs. We must realise that FTs pay tax too, even though our low income tax design for them only allow them to contribute a symbolic amount to our various multi-millions projects. And just by making themselves(FTS) available to be employ at a much lower rate than local, they help our companies save huge amount of money, which then allow our companies to commit into more multi-millions projects. Which then allow them to employed more FTS, and the circle goes ...<br>As a native, you might now feel left out of this circle. Don't worry!!! You are not!<br>Take our upcoming casino as example: while on average there will be 1000 jobs created for each casino build, our government said the figure could be 35000!!! If that figure is true, minus the large numbers of Chinese, Indians, Philipinos, Caucasian etc. so call competitive FTS, and minus some positions reserve for some people's people, you still could expect to find some left over vacancies available for us. You see? Jobs created!!!<br>And don't be shallow to think that the benefits eventually only goes to these companies. These companies sub their contracts to their affiliated companies, and these affiliated will then re-sub the contracts to their affiliated companies, and so on... You see, many people do benefits.<br>Seriously speaking, the existence of FTs also help in improving the Employer-labour harmonious relationship. Excluding some of the FTs who are given very good benefits, most of the rest generally have lower expectation in terms of pay and fringe benefits, as in the first place, they have 'no choice but to except' whatever their employer provide. This condition helps to alightened the natives into easy acceptance of the 'no choice but to accept' realty which, without them(FTs), might creat unneccessary labour discontent. Which then affect the competitiveness of our economy, thus affecting the profitability of the 'companies'....<br>got to go...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Two days ago, I woke up in the middle of the night suddenly remembering the enjoyable time, I had in my last vacation in Australia. Spontaneous thoughts about migrating there for a better life started to corrupt my mind. I quickly grab a copy of the Straits Times and started reading all the good news about Singapore to banish those thoughts.<br><br>I also remember my job as a TRANSLATOR in my company. Where else in this world pays you such an easy job?<br><br>On the Straits Times that I picked up, based on LHL's national day speech Singapore is all set to become a major Global city. This means that the proportion of foreigners is set to increase rapidly over the next few years. If the internet is not controlled and certain individuals can incite hatred towards others, how can Singapore be a Global City with more foreigners? The government will ensure that these foreigners are welcomed and feel comfortable in Singapore.<br><br>We cannot allow a handful of individuals on the internet to incite hatred towards others especially foreigners. That will jeopardise our aspirations to be a global city.<br><br>Certainly, those unlicensed website run by average Singaporeans whose purpose is to cast aspersions against our govt has to be shut down and these people have to be charged in court for sedition.<br><br>It is also carefully crafted in our media that those who are sick, homeless or jobless are basically fussy Singaporeans who up to no good. Those evil websites that seek to shatter our citizen-govt harmonious relationship and paint a different picture from that of Straits Times are clearly seditious in nature and have to be put down.<br><br>After putting down the paper, I am finally convinced where my future lies. We singaporean should be lucky that we have such great leaders to guide us. The media is spontaneous with our government ideas and policy. It is difficult to find same thoughts between the government and media in other part of the world and from the papers, I know we are in good hand and in the same direction.</div>
