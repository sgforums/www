            <div class='col-md body'>I am just curious. How many of you here will keep your finances separate after you get married? For me, my gf and I already had a joint account where most of our salaries go to, so I guess for us, it will be a shared finance. But I was watching this show on SCV last night saying that separate finances helps to protect the other party such that in the event of a bankcruptcy on either party, only that party's wealth has to be confiscated. But if the finances are not separated, both party's will be confiscated.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just as no expects anyone to give up an outside life upon marriage, separate finances support the notion of independence. Most enter marriage with the Â‘happily ever afterÂ’ slogan written on their wedding napkins but an average of 40%(?) of marriages end in divorce and the number is rising. I think its healthy even if the wife is not working to squrriel away some savings just in case anything goes awry. As such, a source of personal finance is not only a good idea, it is a sense of security within security.<br><br>Cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>highly unfair to seperate the finances....highly<br><br>Especially int his day and age it should be combined...But there must be some perosnal savings each moth that the other party can't touch...from both partners.....<br><br>because u can see the f.u.b.a.r.(fucked up beyond all repair) aspects of it...If got divorce the woman takes half of everything the guy owns...and then some more she keeps her money also...so basically if i was a woman i might as well get rich quick what....<br><br>damn unfair...I could say more intelligent things but i get worked up over such lopsided things ....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Split finances doesn't mean that husband and wife keep their $$$ in separate bank accounts. You actually have to go and register with some government body (in Taiwan, not sure about Singapore) upon ur marriage stating that finances between husband and wife are separate entities.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well ..actually I won't support total sharing of money. coz I had a friend .. who contributed a dollar a day for two years. His girlfriend did the same but she was the one who kept the funds .. when things didn't work out  ... the money wasn't divided.  Actually there should be a budget plan .. each having an account of their own and one joint account where every month both parties are to put money in . How much each should put in .. should be a mutual agreement. In that case both parties can spend their own money when buying stuff .. the joint account have to be disscussed before being used .. like buying house .. or car .. stuff like that lah ..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>ZeroS</div>

Where does it leave the non-income earning party? We all like to assume we'll enjoy 'trust' and 'love' with our partners forever, but so did the divorcing couples! A personal financial pool ensures you'll not be more broken upon separation. Not only is it a safety net, it also allows a spouse to indulge him/herself with some semblance of independence.<br><br>cheers</div>
