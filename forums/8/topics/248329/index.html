            <div class='col-md body'>1. Be grateful for the tiny stuff.<br><br>Maybe you always say thanks when he does something huge, like backs up your computer files or cleans out the basement. But most days, we're guessing the ordinary contributions he makes barely register. "Over time, we stop noticing what our partner gives. His nice gestures become like wallpaper," says Levine. "We think, Of course he'll take the trash out. So we don't bother to say, 'Thank you.'" Here's why you should: Those two words not only make your man feel like a rock star, they also bring out his sweetest feelings toward you (making him more inclined to thank you for all you do). And the more you acknowledge the tenderness that's already there, the more conscious of it you'll be, and the more you'll truly appreciate just how downright great your love is.<br><br>To show him how grateful you are, "get really specific," urges Betsy Sanby, a licensed marriage therapist in Minnetonka, Minnesota. ("Thanks for picking up the take-out Â— I was so exhausted and you made my night!") You can even jot down your gratitude, as Jennifer Miller, 38, of Santa Clarita, CA, does. "When my husband has been great to me, I write it down on a slip of paper, date it, then place it where he'll find it later, like on the computer keyboard or in a stack of mail," she says. "They're often very concrete things, like 'Thank you for staying up late last night and making sure the bills got paid.'" It takes all of ten seconds, she says, but "I know it means a lot to him, because he keeps every note."<br><br>2. Stop being so darned efficient.<br><br>It's easy to drift out of couple mode when you're each racing to divide and conquer every task on your to-do lists. "Often, both of you get so busy managing your household responsibilities, it's like you're a tag team, on parallel tracks," says Sanby. In the blur of jam-packed days, you may not even notice what a great team you make Â— or have a conversation beyond, 'You pick up Dylan, and I'll get Maddie. Okay, go!'" But even the strongest couples need lazy moments Â— ideally Ã  deux Â— to kick back, crack up (in a ha-ha way), and rediscover the joy of being together.<br><br>One solution: "Buy some time together Â— literally," suggests Sanby. "Hire someone to take care of onerous tasks, like mowing the lawn." You don't need to burn through cash, though, to carve out us time. Consider dropping the least-loved activity from your (or your child's) schedule. Also, take advantage of free childcare, from eager grandparents to that neighbor who would gladly swap Saturday afternoon baby-sitting duties with you.<br><br>And don't underestimate the power of carting the Chinese-food cartons to the table (instead of noshing in front of the TV or at the counter). Elizabeth Hurchalla, 36, of Venice, CA, has found that simply sitting down together keeps her and her man connected during extra-stressful times. "We've both been working really crazy hours lately. But we try to have dinner together every night, just like our parents made us do with the family when we were growing up," she says. "Even if we're just eating leftovers, we light a candle and sometimes even put on music before we sit and talk about our days."<br><br>3. Connect for two good minutes a day.<br><br>Sure, weekly date nights are great, but who the heck can consistently pull them off? A more practical intimacy builder: Connect for 120 seconds every day, advises Cheryl McClary, author of The Commitment Chronicles: The Power of Staying Together. "Even the busiest pair can find two minutes to focus on each other," she says. "My husband and I pick 9:30 at night, when our kids are in bed." Spend the time giving your man one good compliment ("Your new haircut makes you look hot") or sharing a moment that made you smile ("It was so sweet when you took Ethan out for a bike ride after dinner"). You can also use it as check in time: Ask him, "Anything you wish I were doing more of?"<br><br>What's crucial is that you sneak in this one-on-one talk almost every day, even if it's when you're lying in bed at the end of the evening. "It doesn't work to wait until the weekend," adds Sanby. "You can drift far during the week." What you're really doing is reminding each other why you fell in love in the first place. "It's so beautiful to hear, that two minutes feel like 24 hours," notes McClary.<br><br>4. Wear your sweats Â— but in moderation.<br><br>We all, ahem, relax our beauty standards once we're nestled in a cozy relationship. Maybe we lounge in clothes we'd never be seen in public in. Or we blow off our hairbrush. Often, our guy encourages us, either by letting himself go, or by complimenting us when we look our absolute worst. "Patrick tends to tell me I look beautiful when I'm sweaty after a run, or I'm a mess first in the morning, so it makes me try less," admits Amanda Dundas, 31, of Brooklyn, NY. "I don't spend an hour straightening my curly hair or bother with makeup, because it doesn't seem to matter to him."<br><br>Having a guy who accepts you as is can be a wonderful gift Â— but it's easy to abuse. You don't need to blow out your hair as meticulously as Jennifer Aniston (and please, who has the time?), but you'll do your bond a big favor by making some effort, some days. It's not just for him, points out Levine: By touching up those roots or slathering on a rich body lotion, "you stay connected to your sensual side" Â— meaning you'll stay connected to your sexual side, too, helping to keep up the intimacy and romance that makes love fun.<br><br>From:MSN.com<br></div>
