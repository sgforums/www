Poor thing actually. Some are runaways. Some have no skills , no work - nothing at all. And some would have criminal records. I remember volunteering at the soup kitchen - they will tell you why they are homeless.<br><br>Always remembered that beggar who came and help me with those teenage muggers .

Hertz is one of the reputable car rentals company. For your reference:<br>http://www.vroomvroomvroom.com.au/content/FAQ.asp<br><br>You might as well buy one second hand vehicle for 2-3 k to drive around if you are coming in for a month . Then you sell it back to the shop. Not sure about insurance aspects though but usually salesman will tell you how to get it. Risk : your car can break down in the middle of no where.<br><br>If you go down to perth from eastern australia or vice versa - be vary of the road trains. Even my cousin who is an experienced driver dare not try to take them on .<br><br>The Stuart ( can't remember what it is called)  Highway in South Australia is crap and prone to accidents . Melbourne highway is quite good until you hit NSW Federal Highway - that is a nightmare to negotiate at night and then you end up in Canberra to Sydney .

Hertz is one of the reputable car rentals company. For your reference:<br>http://www.vroomvroomvroom.com.au/content/FAQ.asp<br><br>You might as well buy one second hand vehicle for 2-3 k to drive around if you are coming in for a month . Then you sell it back to the shop. Not sure about insurance aspects though but usually salesman will tell you how to get it. Risk : your car can break down in the middle of no where.<br><br>If you go down to perth from eastern australia or vice versa - be vary of the road trains. Even my cousin who is an experienced driver dare not try to take them on .<br><br>The Stuart ( can't remember what it is called)  Highway in South Australia is crap and prone to accidents . Melbourne highway is quite good until you hit NSW Federal Highway - that is a nightmare to negotiate at night and then you end up in Canberra to Sydney . Not sure about NT and Perth - going to NT involves  dirt roads and going in the middle of nowhere.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Alle_Varianten_LZV.jpg"><br><br>road trains ^</div></blockquote>Thanks dude for the info. There are lots of train travel guides available as well so I reckon some research needs to be done. Alice Springs looks like a nice place though am not sure what the chances are of going around via trains. Perhaps driving might be a better choice.<br><br></div>

Cheaper.<br>http://www.gsr.com.au/<br>If you take a plane to Perth - rent a car for a few days - drive around to Port hedlands, Broome and return your car. Then you go by train to South Australia - you will ride across the longest straightest track in the world in Nullabour Plains ...from perth into South Australia.<br>At South Australia - have a gander into Barossa valley for wine and the germanish town in Adelaide Hills<br><br>Then return to the city , catch a country link train (Cheaper) , the GSR train (think got more views)  or coach to Melbourne (free views but butt hurt). For your reference:<br>http://www.countrylink.info/travel_passes/travelpass_agencies<br><br>Melbourne - rent a car again - wander about the city , go to Grampians if it is not burning in summer as usual , Geelong , Ballarat , Bendigo . Return car<br><br>Take a coach to Albury Wodonga and then catch the train into Canberra or Sydney straight. Canberra - stay for 2 days enough to see the sights . Then proceed to Sydney. From Sydney , fly to Adelaide , bypassing Queensland and take the Ghan GSR train to Central Australia.<br><br>From Central Australia - go to alice springs , check out Ayer's rock and then at Darwin - catch a plane to either Cairns or Brisbane to see queensland.<br><br>Flights are cheap sometimes if you book in advance : we got virgin blue , qantas domestic, jetstar  and tiger airways now<br><br>You need about 1 month to do all these. That is what I planned for my friend who is coming down from America.<br><br>GSR Train routes:<br>http://www.gsr.com.au/our-trains/train-routes.php<br></div>
