Cheaper.<br>http://www.gsr.com.au/<br>If you take a plane to Perth - rent a car for a few days - drive around to Port hedlands, Broome and return your car. Then you go by train to South Australia - you will ride across the longest straightest track in the world in Nullabour Plains ...from perth into South Australia.<br>At South Australia - have a gander into Barossa valley for wine and the germanish town in Adelaide Hills<br><br>Then return to the city , catch a country link train (Cheaper) , the GSR train (think got more views)  or coach to Melbourne (free views but butt hurt). For your reference:<br>http://www.countrylink.info/travel_passes/travelpass_agencies<br><br>Melbourne - rent a car again - wander about the city , go to Grampians if it is not burning in summer as usual , Geelong , Ballarat , Bendigo . Return car<br><br>Take a coach to Albury Wodonga and then catch the train into Canberra or Sydney straight. Canberra - stay for 2 days enough to see the sights . Then proceed to Sydney. From Sydney , fly to Adelaide , bypassing Queensland and take the Ghan GSR train to Central Australia.<br><br>From Central Australia - go to alice springs , check out Ayer's rock and then at Darwin - catch a plane to either Cairns or Brisbane to see queensland.<br><br>You need about 1 month to do all these.<br></div></blockquote>I don't think air trekking is a good idea. In a nutshell, you're saying for those interested in spending a week driving around Alice Springs area, visit Ayers Rock etc. a round trip ticket from Singapore to Queensland should suffice, before boarding a train to central and then renting a car if necessary.<br></div>

Additional taxes which others might have is their education if they offset the cost to ATO but that is only taken if they hit a threshold (income &gt;37k per annum) and again it is bracketed at how much they can take.<br><br>And usually I get to claim back some money from ATO. About 1-2k per financial year.<br><br>I don't mind medicare levy  - I have to see the doctor and if he bulk bills - I don't need to pay a cent. If I end up in hospital - I still don't need to pay a cent. If I need blood tests and they bulk bill - I still don't need to pay a cent. And if I do need to fork up money upfront - I go and get it back from Medicare.<br>It's a fair system .<br><br>So anything else you would like to know?<br><br><strong>Look Australia may not be for some people and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it is definitely not perfect </span>but until you actually work , live and pay the taxes here , then you will know how it is.
