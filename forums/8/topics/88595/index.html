            <div class='col-md body'><strong>...Sacked Sports School Coach</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">by Sporting Cock</span><br><br>The ang mor who was recently sacked as the chief soccer coach of the Singapore Sports School defended himself today against charges of sexual harassment, saying that people had simply misunderstood his attempts to demonstrate the tactics of star footballer David Beckham.<br><br>The coach, Mr. George Michael Billabong, was sacked less than a year into his contract following allegations of inappropriate behaviour with a female staff member.<br><br>Â“ThaÂ’s a load of old cobblers, innit?Â” said Mr. Billabong, over a pint of lager at the Cricket Club. Â“I was employed to show these liÂ’ul nippers Â‘ow to play fooÂ’baw like, wossit, Ronaldo, Zedane and wossisname, Dive-id BeckÂ’um.Â”<br><br>Â“I was merely demonstraÂ’ing to the youngsters the kind of winning tactics that Becks uses on and orf the field,Â” he said. Â“You honestly fink Â‘ee plays like Â‘ee does, simÂ’plee wif try-ning? Bollocks Â‘ee does! Â‘Ee gets all Â‘is strengf from geÂ’in a bit of nookie whenever Â‘ee can, dunÂ’ee? Cor! Like that model bird from Malaysia and Down Under what Â‘ee pulled the last time Â‘ee was down Â‘ere? Fwoaaarrr! She was a biÂ’ of awÂ’right, wanshee?Â”<br><br>Mr. Billabong said that he had simply decided to give a real live demonstration of BeckhamÂ’s technique with a female staffer, rather than talk about it in the abstract.<br><br>Â“Talk, talk, talk,Â” he huffed. Â“ThatÂ’s all you Singaporeans do, innit? You got to Â‘ave some action! I mean, even your facking supporÂ’ers are soft as tissue, innit? You look at British lads, when theyÂ’re at the facking stadium, theyÂ’re fackinÂ’ tearing up seats, bashing each other senseless, flashinÂ’ their arses, head-buÂ’in the bobbies. Your lot, they just sit politely in their seats scoffinÂ’ curry puffs!Â”<br><br>Despite his sacking, Mr. Billabong is still staying on in Singapore, at the request of the Gahmen.<br><br>Said a spokesman for the Ministry of Manpower, Â“Mr. Billabong is still a foreign talent and his skills are still of great value to this country. We believe this misunderstanding will fade eventually, and once he finds the right position, he will contribute greatly to the progress of our nation.Â”<br><br>MOM is currently arranging for Mr. Billabong to be transferred to the Romancing Singapore Campaign, where, the spokesman said, Â“His skills will be more appreciated.Â”<br><br>Meanwhile, he is on secondment to the Speak Good English Movement.<br><br>Â“Â’Issa larf, innit?Â” said Mr. Billabong, raising his pint. Â“ItÂ’s about bladdy time you all learned wot a nayÂ’ive BriÂ’on really sounds like, not like all these toffs youÂ’ve Â‘ired, all of Â‘oom wot sound like they came orf the BBC wif their poncy palaver. Like theyÂ’ve gorra fackinÂ’ pertayter in their moufs or summick. Well, IÂ’m looÂ’in forward to puÂ’in summick else in the moufs of the staff of yer Speak Good English Movement. LetÂ’s say I intend to put some real English in there, know wot I mean, nudge, nudge, wink, wink, say no more, eh, guvÂ’nor?Â”</div>
