            <div class='col-md body'>Devil1976: yea...I know I was a bit harsh, but that is the truth, and the truth has to be said, right?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>gUms: Have you seen a ghost yourself? I definintely have never seen a ghost before. Its always other people who have seen it or they know someone else who has seen one, and those first-hand stories I've heard are rather dubious...always a lot of lost details as a result of being so freaked-out, etc. Last year when I went for OBS at pulau ubin, I was actually trying to look for a ghost...I went to the extent of shining my torchlight at trees, and taking a late-night walk through the supposedly "dirty" old OBS building, but nothing actually happened...I saw nothing. So basically unless I saw a ghost myself, I wouldn't believe in them...More often that not its just peoples' imaginations getting the better of them.<br><br>peiyi: As to how man came about in the first place, that has yet to be explained by science. Although that may seem to be impossible, do remember that a lot of things possible today were thought to be impossible before they were invented, or science explained them. So basically when science finally explains our origins, religion would go down the drain. Either that, or the scientists who made the discovery would be accused of "playing god". The religious people are already accusing science of playing god anyway.<br><br>In my opinion, if someone told me that we were actually monkeys that were genetically-engineered to be much smarter by aliens, that came to experiment on us a long time ago and that person gave me enough proof, I would definintely buy that. I definitely don't buy the christian story of god creating the earth in a week, etc, and with all the political bias and leanings in a lot of the bible stories, it just makes it seem even more to be work of man, not god. And with all the different sects and whatnot, its very hard to take the religion seriously. Is the idea of god creating earth in seven days literal or figurative? Was earth really created in 168 hours, or is seven days figurative, actually referring to seven billion years? What in the bible is to be taken figuratively and what is to be taken literally? At the moment, it seems that all the stuff that doesn't make sense in the bible is taken figuratively by christians, and all the stuff that makes sense is taken as irrefutable proof of the bible's truth. This sorta double-standard doesn't speak well for their religion or themselves, in my opinion. It just shows they can't think straight.<br><br>And lastly, can we even be sure the bible is a religious book? For all we know, it may have been a best-selling trilogy at that time. Like the Star Wars Trilogy. Maybe an archaelogist 2000 years later will dig up a copy of Star Wars and the people in that time will start worshipping the jedi like jesus, and darth vader would be like satan or something. This theory to me, isn't really that far-fetched. It could be closer to the truth than we all think, right?<br><br>In my opinion again, anything taken from the bible as evidence that it is the true word of god, is like the idea of a snake eating its own tail. Such an argument goes nowhere, and proves nothing.<br><br>ok I think that's enough for now   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>sorry about the long post<br><br>[This message has been edited by chamenos (edited 19 April 2002).]</div>
