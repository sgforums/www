Sure the kid may have made a mistake in cheating but there should be a reformative element in any punishment that the principal wants to mete out to the student. In this case I think injuring the student and leaving her in a cast goes way beyond trying to reform the student and getting her to see the error of her ways. In addition,  warning the students not to tell their parents might mean that the school principal knew that her method was wrong (or maybe she can't be bothered to deal with noisy, complaining parents). I think there will be fair-minded and objective people in MOE who will hear both sides' stories out if the student decides to persue the matter.<br><br>To the student: I suggest you take up the matter with the appropriate authorities. Lodge a police report and a letter to MOE. If you have eye-witnesses and medical reports and if what you say is completely true then you should have no fear.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MOE won't blacklist students and prohibits them to take their exams, and neither the teachers could help each other as their actions are answerable to the Teacher's Society, which in turn reports to MOE on their regularities.<br><br>Most systems under MOE are very transparent now and nothing would be swept under the carpet.

Of course, in situations such as this in which you obviously have to bypass the principal, you could either go one level up to cluster superintendent (the one who supervises all the principals in the cluster; but your school does not seem to be part of a school cluster system), or directly to MOE HQ.<br><br>In cases like this, the only way is to go straight to MOE HQ; it is very difficult for a teacher in your school to help you, because he/she would by right have to inform the principal, who would then attempt to silence this complaint before it reaches MOE.<br><br>So you have to do this yourself, with your parent's help, of course. Send an e-mail as well as a feedback submission to MOE giving them brief details (but don't give the name of your school or principal yet), and asking them who in MOE should you speak to regarding this.<br><br>E-mail MOE :<br><a href="http://www.moe.gov.sg/corporate/contact_us.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.moe.gov.sg/corporate/contact_us.htm</a><br><br>Feedback submission :<br><a href="http://www.moe.gov.sg/corporate/feedback.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.moe.gov.sg/corporate/feedback.htm</a><br><br>Include a statement saying you (say you're a parent) need their advice on the matter of confidentiality, because you're concerned that your child may be further punished by the principal if she finds out about this, which is why you have no choice but to go directly to MOE to seek their advice.<br><br>I cannot guarantee how your case will be handled, whether the MOE pple there who receive your email and handle your case, will handle this fairly and justly or not. Your case is quite boderline in terms of seriousness of offence by the principal. If you want to go ahead and complain, you have to get doctor's letter to certify the seriousness of the injury. It is more difficult now that it has been over 6 months since the incident.<br><br>Most likely, your principal Elaine will get warning from MOE, and she may have to apologize to you and your parent (privately). And although she may be buay song, and may be tempted to make things difficult for you, but she will remember that you may again complain to MOE, so she will also be more careful. Or if need be (although things are unlikely to come to that stage), apply to change school.<br><br>If you feel all this is not worth it, then you can forget about the incident, but do take better care of yourself and don't let Elaine have the chance to do something like that to you again.<br><br>There are always both good pple and nasty pple everywhere, no matter students, teachers, guys, girls, from all different groups and walks of life. Don't be disheartened by the bad apples, you will always have pple who care about you. What is most important is that you take care of yourself, respect yourself and love yourself; and then you can also do all these for others around you.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>look she isn't repentant at ALL, all she's saying is<br><br>"look , i'm already punished so lets forget about what i've done"<br><br>she doesn't feel thats she's done wrong, only that once she's punished it should be over , if i'm her father , girl or not i would have beaten the crap out of her<br><br>for me i'm ok if you're not punish when you really feel sorry for what you've done and you feel its wrong ,you won't do it again that sort of stuff<br><br>this girl is definately not that kind of person , basically she's just here to see how she can get back at the principal<br><br><blockquote>i scolded that gal who reported me because out of so many people who cheated. she only reported me. whcih meant she did it like for personal joy. i was then interrogated and forced to write down those who had cheated in the test as well. We cheated by askin the previous class what were the questions that were coming out in the common test.</blockquote>so what you're saying is you're not going to get mad at her if she reported on everyone else too? bullsh@t!<br>or maybe you would feel better if she state that she did it out of honour ?<br><br>and lol being forced to write down those who had cheated as well , looks like you don't like them too much do you?</div>

I think the answer is yes, i cannot confirm this though since this was allowed when they allowed public caning some years back, if it is changed since... i dunno.<br><br>2) If you are complaining if being beaten is allowed, but the punishment given to you may have exceeded allowable limit set by guidelines (which i dunno what the guideline says), then by all means you may forward your case to MOE.<br><br>3) But before you complain you must be able to provide the following,<br><br>a) Why you waited for a year before you want to complain.<br><br>b) you must be able to write a credible statement. as in CREDIBLE STATEMENT, stating the facts and circumstances surrounding your eventual punishment.<br><br>c) provide the facts of the punishment.<br><br>d) of course, you must know what you want out of the complaint.<br><br>hope this helps.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello....<br><br>Did you say this happened a year ago?<br><br>So why now do you want to complain?<br><br>What exactly do you wish to accomplish by complaining?<br><br>Im asking this to know what objective you are seeking. You have not mentioned them. After knowing your objective then you can plan whether your method is right.<br><br>What is your objective?<br><br>If I read from your post, I can only guess that you are dissatisfied and want her to get reprimanded.<br><br>But what gain will this bring to you? Have you thought about this?<br><br>Will it in fact possibly bring you losses instead? Do you want to go through the process, and then after that, possibly have a hard time being under pressure from your principal?<br><br>Is it worth it? Do you think by reporting her it will bring you gains, or losses?<br><br>My advice is, just simply forget it and move on. Learn a lesson and move on with your life.<br><br>On the other hand, if you are really 'scarred', mentally, then it might be worth it to report her, so as to make you heal better, to make you come at peace with yourself.<br><br>It's up to you.</div>
