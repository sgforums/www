It is not against any school rules and national law to write about a school in a blog as long as they are trueful and objective. posting a link to a school-hate-site is not morally and legally wrong either.<br><br>i think you should report this matter to the MOE, this is no small matter, as the principal's action is an act of tyrancy. what you write is your freedom as long as it does not hurt anyone. maybe you may also consider writting to the newspaper...make the incident known and sensationalize it by revealing the name of the school</div>

That guy threatened to expose you continaully and you have to provide for him and his wants.<br><br>Will you continue to do so?<br><br>I want to ask you, and woe be with you if you fail to answer at least trutufully. Are you willing to be the receiving end of threats, actions far worse than what you have initially committed?<br><br>You may say that the principal's minor "action" can turn up this kind of response. It was a minor action of releasing a policy in Communist Russia that created a huge famine -- read up on the War Communism policy, if you are willing to. It was a minor event of inspiration that led to many great creations of literature, art and improvements to our daily lives. It was a minor action of co-operating between three people, to create something for you to sit in front of -- your TV.<br><br>Criminal Intimidation is not fun. No, you won't want to receive them. It can range from "You better do this or else" to "WATCH OUT" with three or more bullets in the same envelope. There are minor forms of this but it still falls under the same category.<br><br>Many people want their rights. You cannot blame them -- I dare to challenge you that you will not tolerate a boss that works you overtime for a few hours a day for weeks and no pay you for that, and even gives you lesser for a normal working month. In fact the only people who do not want their rights are those who had no more to live in the world.<br><br>Some people like to misuse their priviledge -- purposely misbehaving when they know that they cannot be punished by the methods applying to their counterparts. That, I propose that a new method be found that could grant some power to rule. But I nor others I believe, with the possible exception of you, will not accept dictatorship in the school. Setting up Secret Police forces, instilling the same atmosphere and fear that could be felt in Singapore during the Japanese purge of "Chinese anti-Japanese" can not be physical punishment, but the next level of psychological punishment.<br><br>Psychological punishment is far more harmful than doing good. The scar remains there, taking far more time to heal or never heals at all. If you were to come across such a punishment on you and manage to come off it, I will dare say that you will not like such things to happen again. Humiliation in public is not a tool. It is an infridgement of rights -- If you try and subvert this argument, I want you to take a good look at the Abu Gharib prisoner abuse videos or photographs. If you feel that is too mild, I suggest you be isolated from the world -- your mind has hardened beyond that of the coldest criminal.<br><br>Human rights is important -- then why the protests over the photos of prisoners? The imprisoned politician in Myanmar? Human rights ensure your most basic form of protection in your daily life. Imagining being humiliated every second not only to the public but to the whole world -- how would you feel?<br><br>I am not defending the threadstarter's actions in case your meagre interpretation skills lead you astray. Yes, she cheated and so do others, by asking questions about the upcoming test. In exchange for 25 metal ruler hits? What about the not-so-recent principal forced to resign by just hitting a irl with a book? It also comes by that the sister called the triple-digit number instead of going through long procedures in MOE. I can agree that discipline in school is losing steam, but enforcement of it cannot be applied with sub-human emotions and thoughts. It is not the problem of being hit less than others but the severity of punishments. It is the same as caning a 5 year old kid because his poor colouring of a kindergarten assignment.<br><br>I stand behind the threadstarter. Cold punishments, ruling with the iron fist. Iron rusts over time. It is time for the rust to happen.</div>

I was sec 2 then. Then that day i also went home and blogged about this incident, lamenting over my rotten luck but i did not mention any names or hints of who i was refering to.<br><br>The next day my principal called me to the office and scolded me becasue a parent had complained to her about what i wrote. I had also linked the school hate website in one entry and said that it was wrong of people to write such stuff about the school and i agreed about the lockers being small. Then she accused me for being anti-fairfield<br><br>Then she whacked me using a metal ruler 25 times in front of two classes until my hand skin tear and bled. It was also the mid year exams period and i could not write properly. the swollening of my hands also affected my joints. The pain did not fade for two months until august when the wrist was sort of disconnected from the joint asnd i had to wear a cast. (my vb playing made it worse)<br><br>My princiapal  also whacked a few other students but their injuries were not as serious as mine. She told us taht she did not want to hear any parents complain. Isnt it a form of threatening????<br><br>Are female students allowed to be caned in school publicly???<br><br>what should i do about this?</div></blockquote><span style="color: green;">no one can cane a gal as it's a disgrace. only your parents ahve the rights</span></div>
