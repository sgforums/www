            <div class='col-md body'>Cruxes of the issue:<br><br>Punishment over the mistake made over cheating is justified and you admitted it's your mistake in doing so.<br><br>Primary punishment with a steel ruler seems a bit too much with 25 times, depending with the amount of strength used in carrying out the punishment, resulting in skin tear and bleeding. There should be a maximum punishment for such an offence.<br><br>According to MOE's guidelines, should the punished student's area of impact be resulted in open wound (in this case is already an open wound but yet the principal carried on), the punishment would be suspended or postponed.<br><br>The principal had also warned you not to inform your parents or complain. You need to ascertain whether the tone the principal speaked is in a threatening tone (e.g. loud and suggestive). If it's as such, on reasonable grounds with witnesses' statements, you should report such instances to MOE, Academics Division.<br><br>Honestly speaking, the principal didn't carry out a fair investigation on the complaining parent and if you should be found to be the one, your parents should be informed and an appointment should be arranged so it's more transparent. Should you be required for punishment, counselling should be the first option rather than any form of primary punishment be meted out. In your case, the principal is in an outright abuse of powers as stated in your record.<br><br>By the way, is there any form of links between the parent and the school like the parent is a Honourary member of the school's Parent Committee, School's Board of Members or anything? If so, it could be clearly an act of pacification for the parent.</div>
