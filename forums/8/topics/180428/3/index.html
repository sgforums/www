            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Wei Jie,<br><br>I am an ex-student of that school and I know what the conditions are like, or at least have a good level of experiencing them. I have personally had encounters with her before and it definitely was not pleasant.<br><br>My advice to you now is, if there are any marks present on your hand(s), like scars or scabs or anything of that sort, please seek medical attention <strong>immediately</strong>. If possible, get your doctor to write you a detailed description of the wound, as well as the possible source(s) of infliction.<br><br>Even the strictest and most horrifying person to be sent to (at that time while I was still there), known to most as Mr H**, would never ever use any force against a girl. Mr S*** as well would not even think about it. It was clearly a no-go zone. Maybe now she thinks it's ok for her to do so as she's female as well.<br><br>Next, tell your parents about the incident. Hopefully, they will be supportive and do the right thing to fire off some strong-worded emails to MOE. I don't mean vulgar, I mean stern. What my parent did when I had my nasty experience was to shoot off emails, one directly to the minister at that time, and another to the department in charge. Within a week, if I remember correctly, I was seated in her office, together with my parents, then vice-principal Mr Tony Low (an immensely magnanimous and most pleasant gentleman), as well as the cluster superintendent.<br><br>When I'd first stepped in, I'd almost mistaken her voice for the Pastoral Care's teachers'. It was definitely far from the tone she would use on any other day. She was absolutely polite and gentle, patient and would back off at any time to listen to anyone else speak. Definitely not her usual self. As understood from information given to me by a classmate, whose mother was also a superintendent, it would take a very serious matter for them to make a trip down to the school.<br><br>What happened after that, PM me if you're interested to find out.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I will be more than happy to help you out as much as I can.<br><br>It is no secret at all that a lot of staff who were once loyal to the school's name are now shying away from it. I even had one of my ex-teachers call her something really profane. Countless teachers have left that place already, and it is pretty obvious why.<br><br>For those who are interested/curious/kaypoh, here's a short list, off the top of my head, of other revolting actions taken by her:<br><br>1) During one chapel service, she spoke to us about a couple who was featured in the news regarding their divorce and the huge amount of asset that was to be divided. She went on to muse aloud about how she wished that she knew that lady, who had received a big piece of the pie, and that she would not hesitate to ask her for the $3 million dollars which we needed to fund our renovations. I felt that it was utterly disgusting of her to have openly displayed such an act of superficiality and wiliness. There are some things money can't buy; for everything else, there's her. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>2) One morning, she was in her usual morning mood and decided to share her Good Morning! with everyone for not lining up in time in the assembly area. In this case, it was something like be there 15 minutes ahead of the bell's ring. Extra greetings were sent to those who had arrived past 7.20am, and had special places to stand. I remember extremely vividly that part of her Good Morning said, "I WILL RULE YOU WITH AN IRON FIST IF I HAVE TO!" And I was there, shocked, yet unsurprised, while this mother had her mouth half-opened, wanting to look at me for help.<br><br>3) There was another morning of hers where she had an urge to do something drastic to some of the guy's pants. There was a supposed problem that many of the guy's pants had been worn too low.<br><br>Now I myself have flipped through the school diary or whatever they called it, the one which is blue and included a lousy diagram of their ideal male and female student. It had never stated anything about the level at which our pants was to be worn. As we all know, the pants we had were ridiculously short and made us look like right pansies. What happened next was utterly incredible. She got her prefects, I called them the Sturm-Abteilungs (Nazi Storm Troopers), to pick all the boys who had unsatisfactory pants height to stand in front of the rest of the school. They were then stripped off their school pants and left to stand there in whatever they had left.<br><br>4) Another incident I remember very clearly was a random haircut for the spiky-haired boys. Again the SA was sent out and any male with a spikey hair-do, or any gel on their heads, were first sent to the toilets for a good washing. After that, we were marched to the hall where we had to line up side-by-side. She then marched down the line, with a pair of scissors, and angrily snipped at every boy's hair till she felt satisfied. In a show of protection of their rights, a big majority of them had their heads shaved by the next day.<br><br>5) Muslims during chapel - This particular new regulation was definitely uncalled for. Before her rule, Muslims, and if I'm not wrong, Sikhs, were allowed free period during chapel service. This meant that they were free to roam the school grounds, except classrooms of course, but staying in highly visible areas such as the library or canteen was strongly recommended. After she had been instituted, they were all to sit at the back of the hall, each person at individual tables separated from each other, while the rest of us attended chapel.<br><br>6) Throwing of furniture down the school building during cleanliness checks. She was unhappy with their standards and proceeded to dispose of their tables and chairs in an absolutely unruly and uncivilised manner, reasoning that they did not deserve their places.<br><br>These are just a mere few cases of her actions. If anyone has more to add, please do so! Good luck to you, Wei Jie. In any society, the iron fist will never survive long.</div>
