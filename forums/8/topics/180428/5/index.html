            <div class='col-md body'>In my opinion, this is a serious matter because of the nature of the punishment and the medical implications involved. ("The pain did not fade for two months until august when the wrist was sort of disconnected from the joint asnd i had to wear a cast")<br><br>From your description, the damage done to your hand (right hand) seems excessive, and have complicated you in your studies/CCAs.<br><br>One thing that I know is that female students are not caned. When male students are caned, it is done either in front of the class in the classroom, or in front of the school. This is usually carried out by the disciplinary master.<br><br>However, I'm unclear about the use of corporal punishment in the classroom, though it seems to me that the punishment has gone overboard, if in the first place, corporal punishment is condoned by MOE.<br><br>My advice to you is to talk to your parents and let them know about it. I'm quite certain, in MOST circumstances, schools like to inform parents about their child's misdeeds in school to keep the parents in the loop.<br><br>The principal is wrong to say that he/she doesn't want to hear any parent complaints. Students are enrolled in schools, whereby teachers and ultimately the principal are answerable to the parents for the student's education, discipline, and not to mention welfare and well-being.<br><br>That being said, parents have the right to know what has happened to their child in school, and report to the relevant authorities, should they find that there has been misdeeds by the school.<br><br>Often students/children might not know what is regarded as wrong-doings (or "mismanagements") by the school, and cases like theses may never see the light of day. <span style="font-style: italic;">Hence I advise you to talk to your parents and let them decide on the appropriate action.</span><br><br>In such a situation, the head of the school is involved, hence, complaints may have to be directed towards a higher level. However, it would be good for your parents to talk to your principal to see what are his/her reasons for such  harsh physcal punishment.<br><br>Regards</div>
