            <div class='col-md body'>Might be a feeble attempt, but I try lah...... cant say I am completely correct though......<br><br>For a company to be registered as a pte. ltd., one important thingie is the accountings. All monetary dealings have to go through periodic professional auditing. Therefore, no hanky panky with the $$$, even if you own the company.<br><br>And if I am not wrong, for pte. ltd. in Singapore, there must be some high up local entity. There must be some local guy among the directors, or the owner of the company must be local. If that is not the case, you need to employ some local manager just to maintain that local entity.<br><br>And if I am not wrong, once you have the name of your company registered under a pte. ltd., no one else can open up a new company with the same name without your written approval.<br><br>Sighz.....like I said, not a business grad. Never read the rules book for this either. What is written is from impression, so might not be accurate. Hopefully someone with better knowledge will enlighten me, for I would like to know too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>let me try to give a summarized version.  You can refer to RCB (Registry of Companies &amp; Businesses) for more details.  Their website is <a href="http://www.rcb.gov.sg." rel="nofollow">http://www.rcb.gov.sg.</a><br><br>For a company to be private limited, there need to be at least 2 directors in the company, one of which must be Singaporean/ PR / Singapore Employment Pass Holder / Dependent Pass Holder/ foreigner who has obtained an in-Principle approval from Employment Pass Dept of MOM.  Directors must be at least 21 years old and a non civil servant.  A secretary and an auditor must also be appointed for a private limited company (several restrictions apply for these 2 appointments; check the RCB website).<br><br>Hope the above helps.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A company register as a PTE LTD in Singapore is considered as an entity by itself. The company owes money in the form of capital to the business owners. The company must have at least 2 and not more than 50 partners. And thus in this case the company owners would be considered as Creditors to the company. Meaning they lent this entity(the compnay) a sum of money as a form of capital. The company registered under PTE LTD will need to have at least $1 (One Dollar) as a capital in the company to exsits. The partners will then be know as directors of the company, the profits that the company earns will not be given directly to the directors. But they will get the profits at the end ofthe accounting year as Dividends. They can choose not to draw out the sum of money as Drawings and return it to the company as capital. Thus the capital of a company grows and it owes the directors more money.<br><br>The assets within the company e.g. Vehicles, Machinery, Buildings, Cash, Computers, e.t.c will be the property of the company and not the directors. The same goes to the company's liabilities e.g. Overdraft, Creditors, loans, losses. And thus if a company goes Bankrupt, the creditors of a company can only claim as much as a company's asset is. But in this case the directors being an investor cannot claim for returns in the form of debt. And will too be declared as a bankrupt. But their own personal assets, e.g. Flat, houses, e.t.c. Will still belong to them as they are not part of the company.<br><br>A PTE LTD will also have to pay taxes to Inland Revenue. It is like a income Tax as the company itself is considered an entity. This will be on top of the taxes that the directors pay for their own Income and profits.<br><br>There are several guidlines and rules which a private limited has to follow. They are as such:-<br><br><strong>Annual Return/Annual General Meeting</strong><br>Every company is required to hold its Annual General Meeting (AGM) within 18 months of its incorporation to present its audited accounts to its shareholders. These audited accounts must not be made up to a date older than 6 months from the date of the AGM. After that, an AGM must be held once every calendar year but not later than 15 months from the date of the last meeting. Failure to comply with this statutory requirement will render the company and all its officers liable to prosecution. The company's Annual Return together with the audited accounts must then be filed with the Registrar not later than one month from the date of the Annual General Meeting.<br><br><strong>Prosecution Information</strong><br>The Registrar shall commence prosecution action against officers of companies that have failed to hold the Annual General Meeting and file the Annual Return by the due dates prescribed under Sections 175, 197 and 201 of the Companies Act. Such offences may be compounded if the defaults are rectified prior to the date of mention. Defendants may enquire on the exact amount of composition fine payable by calling the Compliance Control Department.<br><br><strong>Appointment of Officers/Auditors</strong><br>Every company must have at least one secretary appointed within 6 months of the date of incorporation. The secretary must have the requisition knowledge and experience to discharge the functions of a secretary of the company and who is either of the following:<br><br>1) A secretary of a company for at least 3 of the 5 years immediately preceding the abovementioned date of my appointment as secretary of the abovenamed company.<br><br>2) A qualified person under the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161).<br><br>3) An accountant registered with the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Singapore.<br><br>4) A member of the Singapore Association of the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators.<br><br>5) A member of the Association of International Accountants (Singapore Branch).<br><br>6) A member of the Institute of Company Accountants. Singapore Branch.<br><br>An auditor for a company must be appointed within 3 months from the date of incorporation.<br><br>All companies must have a minimum of two directors at least, one of whom must be either a Singaporean, a Singapore Permanent Resident, Singapore Employment Pass Holder or Dependent Pass Holder. Any person above the age of 21 may be appointed as a director. However, some individuals eg. bankrupts, are disqualified from being directors. A director cannot resign unless there are two other directors remaining in the company, one of whom must be a local resident.<br><br><strong>AUDITED ACCOUNTS WITH ONLY 1 DIRECTOR'S SIGNATURE</strong><br><br>Section 201(5) of the Companies Act, Cap 50 stipulates that the directors of a company shall cause to be attached to every balance-sheet a report made in accordance with a resolution of the directors and signed by not less than 2 of the directors. Section 201(15) requires every balance-sheet and profit and loss account laid before the company in general meeting to be accompanied by a statement signed on behalf of the directors by 2 directors of the company.<br><br>YOu can refer to  <a href="http://www.rcb.gov.sg" rel="nofollow">www.rcb.gov.sg</a>  for the detailed information that I have provided.<br><br>I hope I have been informative enough.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Atti:<br>Setting up your business?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Give me a call and tell me about it.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Callan (edited 12 November 2000).]</div>
