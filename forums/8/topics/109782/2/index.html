I'll tell you whether what you heard was true, or I will expand on a topic you may have a question about.<br><br>Ask away!</div></blockquote>I guess the preceived bad blood was also partially due to the massive americanization, exportation of all things america (from religion, to entertainment, to values and cultuire, everything!) over and replacing other cultures that is happening...<br>As per all countries, there are always bad blood. (eg: Malaysia and Singaproe are not exactly chummy and we are neighbours). Different colors and different strokes.<br>However, I think loads of asians and color folks happen to have a nasty encounter with some back water, prejudiced white trash in your country and other white countries (such as any place in Europe). (Yes, I am not pro white person either and I have white colleauges who constantly harass/bully colored colleagues. But in comparison, the american are more tolerant while the europeans can be really anal.) However, the white people who come to asia will assume a "superior than thou" stance in all things (yes, many clever white fibbers are working in high positions in Singapore because they know how to out talk and out present anyone but they are really useless when it comes to real competence. However, there is no convincing our local government they are morons for employing foreigners instead of local talents. I attribute it to the myopic views of the government for treating locals as second class to their elisist group and their foreigners "friends". ) which the asian, although asians do not agree with it. However, had choosen not to take it to task but instead treated white folks better than our own asian folks. There's a dilemma somewhere but its hard to describe.<br>The white folks would generally think they have better everything, although I beg to differ and there are many an asian thing that are far advanced, fair and better than white everything... but I shall not argue. What is lacking is the willingness to listen and to understand each other better and to set aside one's preconceived perceptions and adopt a open view. For that, I would said the asian are better than the whites folks but of course there are exceptions.<br>Somewhere out there, is a middle point, but I don't think anyone is going closer to it.<br>So there will always be this so call alignment issues and there will never be a day where there is agreement. Its never utopia.<br><br>As for the iraq issue, I think the americans missed the message of the whole muslim movement and over-estimated the American ability to "save" the world. Its going to be another vietnam or korean war. Obviously bush is too dumb to read history. But I must say, american are more patriotic although stupid lot to vote bush again knowing that it is exactly what the terrorist wanted. But seriously, of such a large country, isn't there a better person for the role of a president than morons? But its the same for Taiwan with Chen Sui Pian (Another moron!).<br><br></div>

This is the cultural clash, let me share (its a video, so its hard to describe) :<br><br>----<br>The one thing that White cultures cannot understand is the high context society that asian are brought up in. while the white folks talk and talk and talk... just to argue their point. Asians will accept and conceed and ponder and come to a middle path within himself/herself. Our silence to many issues are seen by asians as respectful and speaking of volumns in terms of thinking and in terms of meaning. To the white folks. The silence from asian folks are seen that the asians do not understand and are too stupid (yes it was literally the word used by the white businessman describing his Japanese partner in the business discussion) to understand and that, they the great white american had to push harder, present more, talk more, hard sell and do whatever it takes to get the stupid asians to go along.<br><br>----<br><br>The white, to me, are brash, barbaric and unrefined people who tend towards selfishness and are bias against other races and are close minded group.  To me, I know for sure, they cannot understand asians and will never so call bend below themselves to understand asians.  Anything viewed different is thought of as inferior and in need to be eridcated..  History books tells us so...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>mistyblue-<br>Sorry you feel that way.  I don't think I am better than Asians, and I didn't get the feeling when I visited Singapore that they thought they were better than me.   Maybe what you are seeing is that hosts (in this case Singapore) always want to treat their guests well and build a mutually benefical relationship.  So Singapore hires a few americans, in return America imports products from Singapore.<br><br>About the Iraq situation, the US has already spent over USD$200 Billion (about S$350 Billion).  That's twice Singapore's gross domestic product (GDP).  That's a lot of money.  And it's turning into another Vietnam war.<br><br>I was against, and am still am against the war.  However I think now that we started it, we should finish the job.  Otherwise if we pack up and leave now the country will return to chaos once again.  I would be very happy to see the Iraqi people living in a stable society.  I'm not saying this can't be done without help from the US, it just probably won't happen as quickly because right now Iraq can't afford to rebuild itself.</div>

It boils down to people needing to tolerate other's cultures more.  And you are citing one businessman's opinion.  You can't hardly expect that one businessman to represent all americans.</div>
