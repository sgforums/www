The way it works is the US government runs a program called social security that will pay a small pension upon retirement.  If I can remember wayyyy back from a class I took two semesters ago....the way this works is 12.5% of your paycheck is deducted and deposited in social security, while you're employer is required by law to match that 12.5%.  So every paycheck you are getting 25% of it in social security.<br><br>I'm not very well educated on how company pensions work here... I know we have something called a 401(k) which is a tax free retirement plan, usually the way it works is the employee will pay into that plan and the employer matches it up to a certain percentage of the employee's annual salary.</div>
