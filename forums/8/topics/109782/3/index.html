In fact Amtrak which is the company that runs the nationwide train service is going bankrupt due to lack of passengers.  Most people drive between states.  We have a nationwide highway system called the Interstate highway system which is how most people travel state to state.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>1. Why is it a majority of Americans have the perception that if you are Asian, and not a citizen of the state, you can't speak English well?</strong><br><br>Probably because they assume being from a non-english speaking country that english is not their first language?  If I go to Thailand I am sure people would assume I can't speak Thai.<br><br><strong>2. What's the illiteracy rate in America now? I read somewhere before that there are people in the USA who can't even read the road signs because they don't know how.</strong><br>Most people are educated.  People are required by law to attend school until the age of 16, most people continue on through to get a university education too.  In american without a university degree you are almost guaranteed a Shitty job.<br><br><strong>3. Any online shopping websites to recommend that delivers Old Navy or Banana Republic clothes to Singapore Razz</strong><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> No idea<br><br><strong>4. Why does the average American think that their neighbours (the Canadians) are stupid or are they just sore how an under populated country like Canada can beat them in a war in the past?</strong><br>I don't think most people think the Canadians are stupid.  We just like to poke fun at them, and they like to make fun of us.  It's all in good fun.  Mainly people make jokes about their accents.<br><br><strong>5. Why is it a vast majority of average Americans are clueless about anything outside the state they are living in? Are the television news service that bad or people just tune in to MTV??</strong><br>My guess is people just don't care about the outside world because they don't plan on leaving the US.  I don't really know how to answer that...<br><br>And I don't like to watch american news channels...especially Fox News.  I much prefer watching the BBC.  And most people don't get their news from MTV...</div>
