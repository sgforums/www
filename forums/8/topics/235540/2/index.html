            <div class='col-md body'>Mt E does have an A/E department. They have an obligation to stabilize the patient and decide if he is fit for transfer to another hospital. If he is unfit for transfer, Mt E will have to treat him. The threadstarter does not know the condition of the worker. For all we know, he might just have dislocated a shoulder, not at all life-threatening.<br><br>Second, as he is a foreign worker, he would be treated as a non-subsidized patient at TTSH as well. The differential in fees between Mt E and private ward charges in TTSH is not that much (not to say they are similar).<br><br>Third, foreign workers may be covered by medical insurance purchased by their employers (it is going to be a statutory requirement in future). The insurance companies may have stipulations as to the hospital for treatment, except in life-threatending situations.<br><br>The threadstarter is typical of those who pounce on any excuse to criticize the government, without facts, without reason, without brains.<br><br></div>

My friend was working in Tan Tock Seng hospital (TTSH) at that time and he saw a critically injured construction worker being rushed into the A&amp;E department.<br><br>He was "transferred" from Mount Elizabeth Hospital (Mount E). The construction worker had fallen from 7th floor to 5th floor and then to the ground floor. His college rushed him to the nearest hospital, which was Mount E.<br><br>However, instead of treating this serious injured guy, he was simply put on drip and transferred to Tan Tock Seng hospital.<br><br>[b]Why wasn't he treated or operated immediately?</strong> It's a matter of life and death. The transfer from Mount E to TTSH could take anywhere between 20mins to 40mins or even longer depending on traffic condition. <strong>This time difference meant that he may lose his life.</strong><br><br>Well, the reason is actually quite simple - <strong>He is a lowly paid construction worker from China. He will not be able to pay the hefty hospital bill </strong>... so why give him treatment?<br><br>To Mount E, it seems that these ppl's lives are not worth saving! It's better to use the resources available to treat the rich ppl! I don't know who made the decision to transfer the serious injured guy but I believe it's a common practice over there.<br><br>It's really sad, disappointing to see such things happening. Should the motto of a doctor or hospital to try their very best to save lives, no matter who they are?<br><br>I'm posting this because I feel that such things 've to be made known. I wonder how ppl feel after reading this? Ignorant, indifferent ....?<br><br>PS: The construction worker is now in the high dependency ward  (ie bet normal &amp; intensive). <strong>It seems that his life is still NOT out of danger yet.</strong>[/b]</blockquote>If he is in a life threatening condition - he will be in the intensive care ward, not high dependency .<br><br>Mount E has no specialist A&amp;E doctors . They have private specialists who treat private patients, those usually manning the A&amp;E are locums and they usually call down all the specialists relevant to the parts of the body injured. It is better to transfer that man to TTSH.<br><br>Treatment - first doctors have to assess the patient and then if the doctor state that he is stable medically for transfer - he will be transferred. At least they gave him a drip .Operation can only occur when the patient is stable enough to take the general anaesthetic or else he will die on the operating table. Sometimes the risk has to be weighted against the benefit of operating someone.<br><br>His colleague should have called the ambulance if his life was in danger.<br></div>

So even if the accidents happen in front of the hospital, they can't do anything about it.<br><br>I think when that accident happened, the colleague should have called an ambulance as the paramedics are trained to handle people with serious injuries and know which is the best and closest hospital to send him to.  The colleague could have done more harm to the injured man even though it is out of his good intention.</div>

Perhaps you need to find out more. Don't just look at the tip of iceberg.<br><br>Yes, most private hospitals do have a premium. but, I don't believe if critical, any doctors, nurses or hospitals would reject. That's an insult to their profession and their ethics.  And for those who jumped on the bandwagon, shame on you.<br><br>Please rem what happened during the SARS saga, how we all benefited from their TLC (tender loving care).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On what basis have you made your conclusion - ignorance?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>The construction worker may be lowly-paid but he won't be liable to pay the medical fees if he sustained the injury in the course of performing his work. It is his company which will be liable. The company will most likely have insurance coverage for its workers. So the fact that the worker is poor is irrelevant right from the very beginning.<br><br>Secondly, it is probably more likely that Mt E does not have the facilities/ doctors to treat the injuries suffered by the casualty which Tan Tock Seng has. The victim was definitely not just "put on a drip" and transferred. He most probably will have first been ascertained to be stable first, that is, his life is not threatened, before arrangement is made for the transfer.<br><br>As such, your conclusion is most laughable and biased. Perhaps you've got  something against the rich........?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
