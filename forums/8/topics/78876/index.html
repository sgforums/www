            <div class='col-md body'>Why is it possible for girls to fall in love at the first slight?<br><br>Why they never seem to give up hope no matter how much you choose to ignore them?<br><br>Let me tell you my story:<br><br>I get to know Katze and JT on the internet, at the same time PT was my classmate. All the three of them fall in love with me at the first slight. I knew S and C from my circle of friends, both of them fall in love with me too at the first slight.<br><br>Katze was from Guang Zhou, it was actually a long distance relationship. We knew we love each other deeply, because we always got a lot of things to talk about. We always got a very different kind of view, I think that is what make a conversation interesting. I actually want her to be the one, but I broke her heart when I let go of her hand when I suddenly think about my ex.<br><br>JT was a cheerful girl, she always told me that her dream was to find a rich man, get married and enjoy the rest of her life. She was the only child, so she is very tempermental. I really don't know what she like about me, for I don't really fit her maych of marriage material.<br><br>PT was also a cheerful girl, but she become very sad and depress everytime I pretend to ignore her. She is always trying very hard to please me and I know she will make a good wife who take care of family. I know she will give up her career for me, maybe because I didn't want that to happen, so I still continue to pretend that I didn't notice her affection for me.<br><br>S actually love K, but K didn't accept her love because he think he was not good enough for her. So K decided to introduce me to S, in hope that she will find true happiness. Happen that my friend L was there too, and he told me that he was interested in S. I knew K is still in love with S and due to my friendship and love debt, I decided to step out and help them instead. But S was very determine, she start to ignore L and try to get close to me instead.<br><br>C and I knew each other when we went out for clubbing, that time she was harrass by another guy which she doesn't like and hint me to save her from that guy. We have that kind of connection which we knew what the other think just by some simple body language. But I don't know why, everytime we went out together, something bad seem to happen. Once was my cousin car break down and we are stranded on our way back home. Once was my cousin got drunk, pick up fight and we had to send him home instead. If our relationship really bring that much bad luck, I felt it is better for us to stay apart.<br><br>I really don't know what to do, I really don't know who to choose, I guess I will let nature take it course.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
