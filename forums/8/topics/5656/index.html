            <div class='col-md body'>Actually its the guy's fault. Even though  she initially expressed to him she didn't need him giving her lifts from work, the fact that he PROCEEDED to do so meant 3 things.<br><br>1. He felt that he NEEDED to do so. No doubt obligation of duty, expression of manhood and patriarchial perceptions of women came into play. The question is, why did he not feel the need to send her back on the day he wanted to go out with friends when he oblivously saw the need to do so every other day?<br><br>2. He felt that she actually meant 'YES'when she said 'NO'. This is more dangerous since it is like saying to her - "I know you said 'No need lah', but I know you actually want me to.' This is purely assumptional and thus an invasion of will with chauvinistic intent.<br><br>3. The fact that he fetched her home everyday created a trend, a routine she could count on. This is prima facie of a right that he himself gave her. By withdrawing that right, not for an emergency but for drinking with friends, he was taking away what was hers through habit. Classical Pavlovian behaviour.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's the gal's fault.<br><br>Whether the guy sending his gf back is because he wants too or needs to is not the question. By sending her home he is showing love and care towards his gf. But surely a guy is entitled to spend times with his guy pals right? Having a gf doesn't mean a guy has to be with her everyday. And besides, he did give a ring to inform her that he won't be able to send her home that day. So she has no right to be so pissed of about it. It is like Rinoa said, she's petty and not understanding and taking his care and concern for granted.<br><br>My two cents worth...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, i think we got to see the situation. If the guy has already promised the gal tht he will be sending her home tht nite or day i think he should go and send her back regardless or wht.  Coz he has already promised her in the first place. A promise to me is a promise.  I never break it. Unless the guy told her b4 hand tht he can;t come to fetch her tht day and if the girl is still angry, i think tht;s the girl 's fault.<br>Girls really matter abt such things especially if u promise them to do it.  I think in this situation here your guy friend must ahve already promised her b4 hand to fetch her but last minute he can;t make it.  just take yourself in the girl position, if your friend A promised to meet u and at the same time your friend B asked u out too but u promise to go out with your friend A and he can;t make it in the last minute. Won't u be pissed off too.. Sometime we got to empathy withthe other party position. just 2cents worth of ideas..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I feel that the girl might be a little over reacting.<br>Girl had not given any consideration for the guy's offer, which to me looks like an act of kindness. Ergo, guy is not bound to send her back every day. I'm wondering if there is an implied consent between the both of them that sending her back is reliant on other external factors.<br><br>If he needed to send a friend to the airport to catch a flight, or to run errants for his family, or to take his dog to a vet...etc.<br><br>I)The duty to a girlfriend may and can be overridden by other factors of greater importance. Guy just thought that at that point of time, duty to friends was more important.<br><br>II)True, it might be an 'invasion of the will of chauvanistic intent'. So shouldn't she not want this imposition of chauvanism and assert her individuality?<br><br>III)That it has become a routine to which she did not give any consideration would also imply that he was neevr bound to fetch her everyday.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well i'm experiencing something close but not exactly there. Perhaps the gal has told her friends that his bf is so nice and all and one day he lets her down last minute...she'll react obviously. The gal seems very possessive of the guy and wants all his free time to herself? Can't blame her on this one cos i think its only natural for her...<br><br>Maybe go ahead and tell the guy to just give in to her on this and apologize and make amendments. The gal doesn't seem to be going to give in on this. The way i see it, since he's started the send-her-home routine, he's gonna have to carry it on cos perhaps she has taken the send-me-home routine to be a gauge of whether he cares. "You used to do this and this...but you don't anymore..." kinda thing...<br><br>And maybe, guy interpretation at time of calling, "Ok, i've been spending so much time with her that i'm neglecting my buddies...i think she'll understand this." and gal goes something like "He'd rather choose his buddies over me? Fine."<br><br>-*ShruG*-<br><br>Just my thoughts...=)</div>
