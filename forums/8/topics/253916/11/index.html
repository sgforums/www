You are correcting people yet your English is still so LOUSY, not LOUZY. Don't try and correct people's English when you can't. You are saying an upper primary school kid can write better than most forumers here. True, but we are saying in short-form English, which we use to save time. If you do not want to save time, GO AHEAD and waste time writing in full sentences and phrases. You yourself are saying that our English is so lousy so we should not post in the forum and calling them disgraceful. How about you, you are no better. You should go to other forums instead to see their style of writing. They also show this style of English.

You are a beggar yourself, finding food on the street yourself. You be kind to yourself. Others do not need to be kind to you. You take care your ownself and make sure other beggars don't bully you.
