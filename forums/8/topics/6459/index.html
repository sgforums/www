            <div class='col-md body'>Hi people, I'm back. After taking a long break, I've forgiven and forgotten what everyone has done to me.<br><br>I'm back here to let everyone know something.<br><br><strong>Banner At The Bottom</strong><br>Has anyone here ever notice the banner at the bottom? A page from this high-participation forum can get so long, that people don't even see the banner. And yet Chief is earning from its impressions. I don't think it's fair.<br><br>[/B]Double-Impressions[/B]<br>Whenever you reply to a topic, Chief gains 4 banner impressions. One on top, one on the bottom, and 2 more inside the box that contains the page for the topic you're replying to.<br><br>The method Chief is using helps him gain more impressions in a shorter time, and thus, he will earn more. For your info, this is considered <strong>cheating</strong> to the Internet advertising community.<br><br>Advertisers pay people for impressions is because they hope that someone will see the banner and click on it. However, Chief loads the banner but hides it in an isolated area. Aren't you a bit cruel to your kind sponsors?<br><br>So Chief, please stop it. Don't earn by hurting the Internet advertising community. If you want to earn, earn it the right way.<br><br>Please don't say anything like, "I need the money to continue this website!". It's like saying, "I steal food because I'm hungry."<br><br>And please everyone, don't post flamings in this topic, it only shows that you're an immature person.<br><br>Regards,<br>Jack</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks Rinoa.<br><br>Shaolin Boy (AKA Jack Chen)<br>Ads at the bottom and at the top of the page are known as 'companion ads' in the advertising industry. Advertisers sometimes makes use of this ads collectively to send a stronger message.<br><br>sgForums.com is not 'cheating' its advertisers. We do not 'hide' banners or attempt to generate false impressions or clickthroughs. We are very honest and straightforward with the advertising companies and they are welcome to look at our pages ANY time and see where their ads are placed.<br><br>I also do not have time to entertain a lonely little boy (trouble maker) like you. You are ruining my good name and if you persist I WILL take legal action.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, the banners are for advert and not for the chief to gain impression. So it is not right to blame Chief for that. I am sure those sponsors of those banner owners would want to be in these pages since its so popular.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would also like to say that advertisers, after looking at the (VERY) strong community here, are quite eager to feature their products on our pages. sgForums.com will NEVER mislead an advertiser. All advertisers know what they are paying for and I must say that their money is well spent.<br><br>Thank you all for your support and I am very happy that the sgForums.com community has been growing stronger and larger with each day.<br><br>Every new friendship made, every common understanding/bond achieved, every idea shared, even every argument argued out has made the hard work and effort I put into sgForums.com worth it.<br><br>The truth of the matter is, when all is done, the time I spent working on sgForums.com would have earned me more money if I had been working as a waiter. However, with higher paying advertisers coming aboard and more traffic coming this way, I expect more revenue to be generated... and YES... I do plan to throw a sizable chunk of that profit into parties for our members (and other exciting social-beneficial stuff).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>OK, if you people still don't get my point, let me change things a little to help you understand.<br><br>Let's say, sgForums is now a magazine. Chief is the chairman of the company that produces the magazine.<br><br><strong>1st Situation - Banner At The Bottom</strong><br>The price for advertisement on the magazine is $10. There are 2 advertisers who wants to advertise on the website. "Advertiser A" (which is the top banner) paid $10 and gets his advertisement placed on the first few pages of the magazine. "Advertiser B" (which is the bottom banner), paid $10 also, but his ad was placed in a section with low readership. Is that fair?<br><br><strong>2nd Situation - Double Impressions</strong><br>A half page advertisement costs $5. "Advertiser C" wants to advertise a half-page ad. Chief randomly chose a page, and placed <strong>2 ads</strong> on the page. Now, the page is filled with 2 <strong>same</strong> advertisements. Then Chief goes up to "Advertiser C", and says, "Hey, I've placed 2 of your ads on my magazine, now your bill totals to $10." Again, is that fair?"<br><br><strong>3rd Situation - WE DON'T CARE!</strong><br>When this matter was made known, a reader (which is me), commented negatively on it, and yet the readers of the magazine goes hopping mad, screaming, "We Don't CARE!".<br><br>???<br><br>So what if you don't care? You <strong>DON'T HAVE</strong> to care, as you're not the one paying!<br><br>A change of situation again to help me bring out my point.<br><strong>Change Of Situation</strong><br>An "ah beng" (which is Chief, chairman of the magazine company), is <strong>"beating up"</strong> (note, they're in quotes) the "advertisers" in...erm...Tampines Mall?. You people are the crowd standing around to look at the "beating up", and I'm also one of the crowd. I see the helpless "advertisers" kena beat up, and I come forward to stop the fight, but guess what? The crowd started shouting, "Oi! siam lah! Don't care about the people kena beat up, I want to see free show!"<br><br>That's even worse then the article in the NewPaper that reports a little boy kena beat up by 3 bengs! You stand around, don't help, and yet you're helping the bengs! What is this world coming to?<br><br>(Note: the beating up mentioned above is meant to be "ripping off", which means, "shi zi kai da kou", Lion Open Big Mouth.)<br><br>And now, the chairman of the company who is ripping off its advertisers want to sue the reader who commented on the incident. ???</div>
