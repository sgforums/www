How many are 24 hr and require more manpower? what the heck are u going to do with 40 000 girls??? besides to look at them?<br><br>or are u going to ballot like in Thailand?</div>

Or even those technical jobs that do not require their presence on the battlefield in times of war.<br><br>Nurses would take too long to train and I am sure the government is not going to cut short the training period and risk having incapable nurses taking care of the sick. That would be unimaginable.<br><br>I still remember after I came back from Thailand and went to the medical centre to get a HIV blood test. The medic poke poke poke and then dunno what happen, after he drew out the blood i had like a mini-baluku the size of a ten-cent coin!!! It swelled up to abt 1cm high!!! Then while he was drawing blood he still cana ask the other medic whether what he was doing was right!!!

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the whole idea of girls serving NS as nurses is to take a further step to more utilise manpower in S'pore,not pinpointing at GIRLS as some of u wrongly sensed.<br><br>Someone mentioned '...girls CANNOT be medics...',well,no offence,either u hav not serve ur NS or ur exposure during ur NS life is really limited.For everyone's info,there r actually female medics in MINDEF,&amp; some r even senior medics.<br><br>I agree that nursing courses r veri professional &amp; lengthy.But i oso believe there r many many types of nurses.My opinion is to get them to specialise in diff areas...eg if a girl is sent 2 the therapy dept,she will just have to learn the basic knowledge concerning therapy(of course in therapy itself,there r physiotherapy,occupational therapy......).Beside,there will always b a professional ard to guide her.i mean, isn't tis wat we guys r doing in NS rite now.if we were to learn all the vocations during our NS,i tink can ORD liao....<br><br>Someone oso mentioned 'does guys serving NS help solve SAF manpower shortage?'.well,if there r no NS,wat do u think is the scenario???oR r u trying to doubt the decision made by the govt so many yrs ago since we declared independent???all tis yrs the govt have been providing more &amp; more incentives &amp; the sign-ons % r certainly increasing.<br><br>Lastly,dun ever doubt the girls' physical ability to serve NS.If so many young ladies can sign on &amp; go through OCS to become officers,y not others??it's onli the mental behaviour of the society that's the barrier.<br><br>therefore,i think tis idea is not unworkable,but will take at least 6-7 yrs of planning b4 actually girls start serving NS....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bush: Thanks for supporting me.. i also almost have the same idea as u... My point is not to get all the gals into SAF medical centres but mainly to the hospitals in Spore to solve the prob. of shortage of nurses also.<br><br>Altrex:I admit training to become a professional nurse may take some years but dun u tink that training to become a soldier also take years...u tink that u are a professional soldier after ur NS? i dun tink so. Everything takes time to train but gals serving their NS as nurses are like guys becoming soldiers during NS. Solve the prob for the govt serving the country. They can be trained to do simple duties in the hospitals in a short time also.<br><br>For those who say that there will be more soldiers reporting sick, i think that u are the ones who like to 'chao keng' a lot.</div>

They can become clerks, storemen, RP, just to name a few.  I think that female nurses will not do the army any good.  If there is a chiobu in the medical centre, imagine the super-long daily morning report sick queue outside the medical centre!</div>
