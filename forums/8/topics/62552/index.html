            <div class='col-md body'>China is growing, no doubt.  But it is not growing evenly.  The cosmopolitan parts of China are growing too fast for the rural parts of China to catch up.  This is esp. unhealthy national growth, considering these built-up cities make up only a small percentage of the country, with the bulk made up by the rural areas.<br><br>Let's take for example a teenager now going through the growing stage of puberty.  Can you imagine what will happen if say the arms grow super fast but the rest of the body grow slowly?  This is the same with China.  It is understandable that they are changing as they need to catch up wif the western powers, but if they continue with this rate of growth, nation-wide segregation will arise.<br><br>Initially when the gap is not as wide, the more backward people will admire the developed people, and work towards being like them.  But this will not be, as the government is not letting the country grow evenly.  Eventually the gap will widen, and this admiration will turn into resentment.  Social classes may develop, and unhappiness will brew.<br><br>China holds one-fifth of the world's population, and is now growing like a ticking time bomb.  Watch out.</div>
