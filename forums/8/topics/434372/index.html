              <p>Hi Guys,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I had a friend who approached me for help. So here i am asking.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My friend had a company with a few partners not long ago. Recently, he made a mistake by taking company cash(from what i know, its a small amount). In short, he informed his partners about it and offered to return the cash on top of removing himself from the company in order not to blow the matter out of porportion, an agreement done via phone conversation and smses. On behalf of  that company one of the partners who was liasing with him agreed and then said that he will email him the draft of the agreement on a certain date. But months later when he asked the partners again for it, they said its in the company's best interest to do up the agreement in the next meeting. Thing is, the company is really small, like only 2 partners are working for the company and the rest silent partners, but unfortunately the one who liased with him was supposedly a silent partner. And my friend owns 15% of the company.</p>
              <p>So when it came to that he asked for the agreement letter again, they said that in the best interest of the company and him, they decided to reopen the matter and reported him to the police, on top of that, they claim that he mis-read the agreement between him n the liasing partner that they agreed to his offer.</p>
              <p>My friend is upset because this is a breech of agreement. Is there anyway around this for him to act to settle this between the company and him? He did send an email to them saying that he offered to return the cash and remove himself from the company and hopes that they reconsider.</p>
              <p>Please advice..cuz to my honest opnion, i think this issue can be settled amiciably without blowing things out of context.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks bros and sis out there!</p>

              <p>HI Fireice,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks. But thats costly, so instead of immediately asking a lawyer, i'm asking if there is another way to mediate the issue.</p>

              <p>Because of the ease of IT communication, peoples tends to overlook on hardcopy agreement, and that is sad. Email and phone conversation is not a court evidence, cos they can be change and manipulated unless it is homicide and cheating case where investigation are involve.</p>
              <p>The situation is pretty simple, those partners are looking for him to give up his shares of the company. That is how most business partner wil exploit another with their weakness point.</p>
