Pls stop scolding &amp;<br>blaming mcs. mcs had done their best for zt.<br><br>some of her fans (remember that mr liu who called<br>LHZB hotline, &amp; complain that mcs should 'GROOM'<br>zt not fann?) still think that mcs gave fann the<br>opportunities, they refused to see that mcs is<br>using fann to open up overseas market.<br><br>some of zt's sour-grapes fans jeered at fann<br>being given the role of a 'hua ping' in 'shanghai<br>knights'. they didn't know that zt is also craving<br>for this 'hua ping' role. (re her interview with<br>tnp). they didn't know that fann is paid tons more<br>for this role than zt's leading role in 'the tree'.<br>they also forgot that zt has taken a 'hua ping'<br>cameo role in 'liang po po' movie.<br><br>there are many more things i can go on writing but<br>sorry no time.<br><br>p/s: for those zt fans who are genuinely concern<br>about her, pls don't waste your time here telling<br>us how good she is. it's better to spend your time<br>asking zt whether she is ok or not. she looks very<br>tired &amp; her wrinkles are showing beneath her eyes<br>(not to mention those crowfeets). she also got<br>eyebags (probably due to stress &amp; late filming<br>of her tv blockbuster). but worse of all, her<br>face seems to have bubbles, pls ask whether she<br>has used the wrong eye-cream &amp; face cream. she is<br>the queen of caldecott hill, not man-in-street like<br>us. she has to look good &amp; glowing, while we can<br>afford not to look good. that's why we are just<br>fans not stars. pls ask her is she ok, now that<br>she is no longer a phillip waine's poster girl,<br>is she ok with no ad revenues. pls also advise<br>her not to be spendthrift as her earning power<br>is diminishing. her husband also got a dangerous<br>job, so she shouldn't vent her frustrations on<br>him. wow, zt fans have lots of worries.<br><br>pls don't worry about fann, she is very prepared<br>for the day when she has to do motherly roles.<br>she is matured enough to accept nature &amp; she<br>will age gracefully. you all should worry for zt<br>who can't seem to accept it (you can tell from<br>her look-dejected &amp; lack radiance).<br><br>pls also don't worry about fann's marital status,<br>it's a trend to marry late &amp; she is very<br>independent financially &amp; socially.<br>whoever she marries eventually, she will have<br>our blessings. pls make this clear, she is the<br>one who ditched her ex-bf. pls don't laugh at<br>her because her ex-bf flirts. don't forget zt's<br>current husband is also her 2nd (so she claimed)<br>serious relationship. she said she was heartbroken<br>when her previous relationship failed (was she<br>ditched? who was that guy? does it mean zt was<br>ditched even when she was soooo young?)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>from now on, i would not say what i've already<br>said. it's very tiring to always bring up all<br>zt's short-comings, as there is a long list of<br>them.<br><br>however, i will continue to write them if these<br>people continue to come here &amp; make fools out<br>of themselves. i find them pitiful, so i've to<br>knock some sense into their heads. got to save them!!!<br>although they choose to be stubborn or rather choose<br>to adopt the 'ostrich''s behaviour.<br><br>i didn't want to repeat them but these detractors<br>are asking for it. i take it that they enjoy reading<br>all zt's short-comings that i listed out, when they<br>come here to be rude to fann.<br><br>what's more, what i've posted are all facts.<br>i did not use vulgarities.neither was i being rude<br>to zt or her fans.<br><br>in fact, i was very mad with her replies<br>in her tnp interview. if she had been more<br>gracious &amp; know her short-comings, i would<br>keep my mouth shut. but obviously, she was<br>very sour &amp; sore about fann. but at that<br>time, i just kept quiet 'cos i'm not always in<br>the mood to pin-point her. but once i got<br>into the mood, she &amp; her fans will have an<br>earful from me.<br><br>to be honest, i've never went to zt's forum.<br>i don't even know where is it. i've no time<br>to go there too. to me she is passe, so why waste<br>time going to her web.<br>i didn't go to any other artistes's web too,<br>since there are sooo many fann's sites to<br>browse.<br><br>i also hope that fann's fans would not go<br>to zt's site &amp; post rude remarks.<br><br>as long as we are not rude &amp; say things like<br>zt sucks or call zt names etc., like what her<br>fans did, i think it's perfectly fine to<br>defend fann.<br><br>no, i don't hate zt, i don't hate any artistes<br>for that matter.<br><br>but yes, i don't respect her (but that was only since<br>a few years back after i heard her interview on<br>933). yes, i don't admire her abit. i've some expections<br>of stars as i've grown up watching hk dramas &amp; movies.<br>to me, stars must at least have good complexions<br>&amp; looks. i've seen zt many years ago, she was<br>as plain as man-in-the-street, no star appeal,<br>so she doesn't fit my idea of an actress.<br><br>i didn't say this before, but i will say it now.<br>my friend's friend who has some business dealings<br>with zt (her zee10 coffee house), met zt face-to<br>face. zt was without make-up, this friend said you<br>won't take a 2nd look at her if you passed by her,<br>because she has no glamour &amp; just like your plain<br>neighbour next door. what's more, she said zt's<br>face was very dry &amp; wrinkled. i swear, i'm not<br>lying about this &amp; i will not say this again.<br><br>i'm not being arrogant &amp; boastful of fann's<br>achievements. i did say before that 'shanghai<br>knights' MAY BE (or maybe not) her 1st &amp; last<br>hollywood movie. but this movie offer has proven<br>that with better management, she can go further.<br>that's why we can 'scold' mcs for not being<br>aggressive enough with fann's career path.<br><br>i also know that one day, fann will also have<br>to play elderly roles (if she stays on), i'm<br>prepared for it. i wasn't laughing at zt for<br>accepting motherly roles. i didn't look down<br>on zt for having no overseas market or offers.<br>i emphasized once again, that i only dislike<br>zt for being sooo DISHONEST.<br><br>if her fans stop accusing mcs for giving<br>fann more opportunites than zt. if her fans<br>stop saying how good zt is compared with fann.<br>if zt behaves like xiang yun &amp; recognize<br>her inadequacies. i won't list her short-<br>comings.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HK has more beautiful actresses but S'pore hardly any. To be honest, MediaCorp has so few actresses &amp; Fann stands out to be comparable  because of her height, complexion, face flat &amp; body too skinny. Next is Jeanette Aw but she is too short &amp; body not so nice. Wong LilIn has natural prettiness with the least makeup, good height, average body but complexion lose to Fann.<br>The rest are average looking, Zoe may look glamourous 15 years ago but she lost all of it the past few years, unfortunately she looks like an old hag for her young age. Well she can join the veteran group and act more motherly roles. I wouldn't blame Zoe for the naughtiness &amp; unruly behaviour of her fans who are the guilty ones fighting to defend Zoe. I'm sure it's not her wish for her fans to be so rude because they are unable to differentiate between right &amp; wrong, they are interested to down the rival in the path of Zoe's success. They will get over it when she really becomes passe. When their mouth stinks with bad breath no amount of dettol or listerine can erase it, their teeth or digestive tract need to be treated by surgeons.</div>
