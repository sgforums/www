I seriously don't think the gov is doing all thise just so Elian can go home...THey are doing this b'cause of politics with the gov of CUba...<br><br>I just think that Elian is stuck in the middle of politics between the two opposing gov...All i can say is...that i really pity Elian...TO have a mother dying is enough...But to all through all this crap...IT's almost like a drama or movie... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Worm, firstly you have the facts all jumbled up.<br><br>The boy was being kept by his Cuban relatives IN THE U.S. Yes, that's right, his relatives are legal citizens of the United States, the boy is not. The boy's father is the one living in Cuba.<br><br>How this came about was because, the boy's mother FLED TO THE U.S. by boat, but in the process, tragedy struck, the mother drowned, although the boy made it. So his relatives took custody.<br><br>The U.S. action was not taken on Cuban soil, for goodness sake. Do you think the local U.S. police SWAT team has the jurisdiction and resources to even operate outside their city, let alone country?<br><br>What the United States did was simply to re-unite the boy with his LEGAL guardian, which is the father, now that the mother is dead. Not the grand-uncles living in Miaimi, Florida, USA.<br><br>As it is, the fact that the U.S. took this long to do so has already drawn much criticism and hostility from the Cuban government and citizens.<br><br>Make no mistake, the U.S. government is acting perfectly within it's power to evict illegal immigrants, just as our government sends illegal foreign workers home. Moreover, in doing so, the U.S. is re-uniting the boy with his father, who is now the legal guardian.<br><br>Now, whether the father is making the right decision or not in bringing the boy up in such a country as Cuba, that is debateable. However, as so many here have stated, it is not for the governments to decide that.<br><br>------------------<br>Cya,<br>Praetor<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At present if the child is returned to Cuba, Clinton/Gore would be in violation of a court<br>order, not that this is a problem to them, so it may happen. As it stands they've skirted the law to the point that Reno is probably in big trouble come Monday, probably to the point of getting kicked out of Congress.<br><br>Castro was threatening to dump his jail/asylum population on the US again right in the middle of election season, which would cause problems for Gore.<br><br>The relatives were willing to hand the boy over, but wanted the father to come to Florida. He had refused to meet with them under any circumstances, even though when the thing started, he had phoned them and told them to take good care of his son, expressing no interest in the boy going back to Cuba. It is very clear that the father was/is being "handled" by the Cuban gov and their lacky (and Clinton's) Greg Craig. They know the father would express to the family that he wanted to stay and they couldn't have that. He had already applied to come to the U.S. on 2 occasions and been denied. Last evening the family had agreed to meet with the father in Georgia, then bang the door came in. The Feds knew their hand had been called and they couldn't go any further with negotiation.<br>As for the boy's appearance, there are numerous analysts on T.V. right now saying the shots are staged and the boy is very uncomfortable. Take a look for yourself, he's stiff.<br><br>As for those US federal agents you refer to, they are actually INS (Immigration and Naturalization) officers, These guys were<br>fat, and their gear didn't fit well. They're real low level, about the same intelligence as prison guards. If someone had shot back, they would have crapped on themselves.<br><br>On the Elian issue, it is a lot more complicated than we are being lead to believe. It is a fight between Castro and the exiles and neither side has come away from the thing clean.<br><br>The bottomline is Clinton is a coward, who doesn't know how to take a stand on principle or how to deal with a tinhorn like Castro. He is definately scared of Cuba, because a big reason why Clinton was booted as attorney general in Arkansas was due to riot by Cuban immigrants in that state in 1980. Losing office and hence all the perks, freebees, and poon tang that comes with it is Clinton's greatest fear. Castro has been threatening him since Elian hit shore here. If this thing went to an immigration hearing it would have taken months and Castro wasn't going to put up with that. The resolve would have been probably with whole  the whole  damn family staying in the US). Castro just wouldn't stand for that though and Clinton took the chicken way out, just like he has his whole life.<br><br>This has caused many more problems with the fact that the exiles are all rioting in the US eg. setting tyres on fire all because Clinton is too chicken.<br><br>All in all, Clinton is one of the biggest twat presidents in the history of United States.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Masturbated once and fucked twice - Story of Man United against Real Madrid</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well...i suppose they would HAVE to snatch the boy, but i feel that it's excessive usage of force.<br><br>while i support the decision to return the boy to the father (the mum's dead, if not the dad, then who else? grand-uncle big deal..), they could have used less force.<br><br>i was quite shocked by the photo of the agent with the gun. yah....the gun is not pointed towards the boy and the finger is outside the trigger guard.<br><br>Big deal....doesn't basic military training teach u that in the first place? by raising the gun in such a threatening manner is definitely wrong.<br><br>the video of the boy rejecting the father was crap. what does the boy know at 6? c'mon, little kids at 6 are so damn easy to con and get them to do whatever u want them to be. i wouldn't be too worried abt him being traumatised by the dramatic snatch. if he was not afraid then, i would be VERY surprised. Heck...even I would be stunned if it happened to me and faced with such a situation, I wouldn't be surprised if a large number of girls in this forum cried as well. it's natural to be traumatised.<br><br>anyway, now the kid's happily back with the father, but mark my words, the story isn't over yet.<br><br>politically, the issue is too sensitive and the powerful Cuban-American community won't let this rest. It's going to be a few months at least, before Elian gets back to Cuba. If he's lucky, he'll get to spend Christmas in Cuba. If not.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For those of you who don't know, the whole Elian thing started back in November. Castro<br>didn't give a rats ass about the kid until it hit the network news around Christmas.<br><br>Up to that point the father hadn't expressed any interest in the Elian returning. As soon as this happened, the whole dynamic changed and Justice altered the manner in which they were handling the case. The parallels are too direct to be coincidence. Greg Craig's involvement is further confirmation of this.<br>No doubt, if the father is sincere in his desire to get Elian back, his wishes should be granted.<br><br>Remember though that children in Cuba are property of the state from their date of birth. Furthermore, at age 11 most children are taken from their parents and sent to work in the fields. You all should be very clear on what awaits Elian and how things really are in Cuba. That is precisely what the Miami relatives were trying to point out, with absolutely no help from the media.<br><br>The only good thing that happened during yesterday's riot was that CNN got a bunch of<br>their gear smashed as the exile community was tired of that network's pandering to Castro and its slandering of his critics. My advice to all of you: if you want a real perspective on the USA don't "Turn to CNN". The quality of their news service is crap. Use the Internet, and other alternative sources if you really  want to get a true picture of what's going on in this country.<br><br>Believe me, this whole situation is a lot more complicated than we can even attempt to<br>cover on this board.<br><br>My final word on this is issue is that there is NO excuse, repeat, absolutely NO excuse for the methods that Reno used yesterday. There were no warrants against anyone in the house and contrary to the crap coming from various bureaucrats, there was no evidence that there were any firearms in the house.<br><br>Reasonable law enforcement officials have said that this was not appropriate. Some have<br>gone as far as to say that they have seen less force used against drug king pins and<br>organized crime bosses.<br><br>No, what you saw yesterday was government sponsored terrorism, the type of thing that brings lunatics out of the woods, just as the government screw-up at Waco allowed Timothy McVeigh to justify murdering all those people in Oklahoma City.<br><br>It is designed to intimidate, but it has the opposite effect: it  makes people angry, some of them irrationally so.<br><br>Such bullying tactics are a direct result of Clinton's psychosis. I feel badly for people in Serbia and the Sudan, among other places, just as I feel badly for the people in Miami. This stuff has to end, and hopefully it will after November.<br><br>- Oakland Stomper<br><br>------------------<br>Masturbated once and fucked twice - Story of Man United against Real Madrid</div>
