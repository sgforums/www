            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large">LTA Seeks Your Views On Names For Circle Line Stations<br><br>For the first time, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) is seeking public's views on the names for the 12 stations along the first three stages of Circle Line (CCL).<br><br>With more than one million passenger trips made on the Rapid Transit System (RTS) network each day, members of the public come into frequent contact with the RTS stations. This feedback exercise creates a unique opportunity for the commuting public to have a say in the names of the stations for the upcoming CCL, where they will pass through or use on their journeys.<br><br>Names of the earlier MRT/LRT stations have been determined based on the views of the community leaders living in the vicinity of the stations. The Housing Development Board (HDB), Singapore Tourism Board (STB), Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and National Heritage Board (NHB) are also consulted on the suitability of the names. Thereafter, the recommended names are put up to the Street and Building Names Board (SBNB) which decides on the final names for the stations.<br><br>Seeking public's views on station names for the first three stages of CCL is one of LTA's efforts to foster greater participation from the public in the naming of the stations.<br><br>How to Participate<br><br>The feedback exercise will be held over a period of six weeks, from 26 March 2004 to 9 May 2004. The public can give their feedback via the Feedback Unit e-consultation portal at (http://www.feedback.gov.sg) or the LTA website (http://www.lta.gov.sg).<br><br>To guide public in this exercise, LTA has proposed two names for each of the 12 stations for selection, based on the following criteria:-<br><br>they depict the locality of the area;<br>they reflect the historical and heritage of the area; and<br>they represent the multi-racial/multi-cultural character of Singapore.<br>Alternatively, the public can suggest other names for the stations taking into account the above criteria. A copy of the questionnaire is attached in Annex A.<br><br>How Station Names Will Be Finalised<br><br>Following the exercise, LTA will evaluate and shortlist the station names, based on the above criteria, taking into consideration the relevance and uniqueness of the proposed station names. LTA will also propose appropriate Chinese names for the stations. Thereafter, the SBNB will decide on the final names of the stations.<br><br>"This will be the first time that LTA is asking the general public for their views on the stations names. By offering the public an opportunity to pick the station names they like, we aim to create excitement and greater ownership for the Circle Line stations," says Mr Rajan Krishnan, Director of Projects.<br><br>"Moreover, the first three stages of CCL pass through the city centre and major housing estates. We would also like to invite the people staying and working around these areas to give us their views," adds Mr Krishnan.<br><br>About Circle Line<br><br>The CCL is an orbital line linking all radial RTS lines running into the city. It will run from Dhoby Ghaut in Orchard Road, and will pass through the civic district, some of the busiest corridors in the city, residential towns, industrial developments and R&amp;D institutes before terminating at the HarbourFront station at the southern tip of Singapore. When completed by 2010, the 33-km long CCL with 29 stations (three of the stations will be built later) will provide greater connectivity and convenience to public transport commuters.<br><br>The CCL will have interchange stations with the North South, East West and North East lines at Dhoby Ghaut, Paya Lebar, Serangoon, Bishan, Buona Vista and HarbourFront. It will offer inter-suburban linkages not provided by the current MRT system. Commuters going to other parts of Singapore will be able to bypass the city centre, thus cutting down on travel time.<br><br>CCL is being built in five stages. Construction for the first three stages of CCL is in various stages of progress. For Stage 1, construction of tunnels and station boxes is more than 50% completed. Excavation works are on going for Stage 2, while on Stage 3 of CCL piling works and construction of the underground retaining walls are ongoing. The first two stages are scheduled to complete by 2007, the third stage by 2008, and the last two stages later in 2010.<br><br>For more details on the feedback exercise, the public can visit the Feedback Unit<br>website (http://www.feedback.gov.sg) or LTA website (http://www.lta.gov.sg), or contact LTA at 1800-CALL LTA (1800-2255582).</span><br><br></div>
