Also outsiders who are not diners are not allowed to remove any items from the restaurant at all. By taking something without asking is as good as stealing.

Please get this right.<br><br>And he is not snatching from diners, merely asking for it.<br><br>So what happens to unused chilly sauce left on the plate. Knowing Singaporeans, everyone will started to complain if KFC collect them back. They will all be thrown into the bin. Waste, isn't it.<br><br>The poor guy is just trying to collect them back, knowing that unopened, they can still be used. Just because most ppl don't give a damn about these little packets of chilly doesn't mean it is wrong to save them from being wasted.<br><br>I think the poor fellow is just trying to use sign language to explain himself when the man got pissed.
