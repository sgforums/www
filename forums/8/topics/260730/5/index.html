We are talking about Singapore, not Malaysia leh. Foreigners can't just come and leave this country easily without proper visa and proper travelling tickets. How can a GENUINE foreign beggar land in Singapore? Only if:<br><br>1)He posed as a tourist, then turned into a beggar after he hit the streets. Wow! International beggar flying over the globe seeking money! Then I also want to quit my job and be like him.<br><br>or<br><br>2)If he is young, his father might be an expatriate here. He is just fooling singaporeans around by posing as a beggar and ripping off money.<br><br>Do you all know how much such keychains cost? Less than S$0.50, handmade or whatever. Can you imagine how much he is making each HOUR? Let's say he spends 5 minutes (actually only need 3 minutes) at each KFC/McD/BurgerKing/whatever restaurant, and let's say he only sells 1 keychain in each restaurant (not counting cases where a whole table of all too common stupid sg girls who ooze at the sight of male ang mohs and buy 4 keychains together).<br><br>That means he is easily making 12*1*S$4.5 = S$54 per HOUR!<br><br>I know many of us are kind hearted, but please be discreet and don't simply dish out your sympathys for no good reasons. Otherwise you are just being exploited.</div>
