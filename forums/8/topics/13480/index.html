            <div class='col-md body'><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Interesting how people in this thread have written of Christianity being atrocious and unreasonable for the crimes committed by the Crusaders in the Crusades. While it is undeniable that Christianity has had a smudge in its history caused by people who claimed to crusade in the name of Christ, and were actually crusading for their own sinful desires.<br>yet I find it amusing that the very same posters of such reasons, claim that Islam is a reasonable non-oppressive religion despite what happened on September 11!<br>Yes, you are right not to infer the Sept 11 nutcases to represent Islam, why then use the Crusades to represent Christianity?<br>Think about it.<br>It is because you hate Christianity so much that you will just blindly draw any reason in an attempt to discredit it, but actually do not realise that it is the sinfulness of your souls that are reacting to the holiness of Christ's true gospel!</div>

I believe not all non-believer is against christianitiy, I am one here. I think those ppl are fed-up, piss off by hard-core christians that is too rude to them. You can't blame them too, imagine everyday I called you and talk about my buddhism and said that your god is not real and you are going to hell for eternity, how would you feel? Sometimes, we have to put ourselves in their own shoes, and you will feel it.<br><br>Sometimes, there are better ways of approaching ppl, I guess some of the christians has to learn to approach ppl in a more gentle way. If you rush something, more often you will get a negative result.<br><br>Of course they are christians who respect ppl views, like some of my friends, they will tell me about the gospel and leave everything up to me and they won't pester me too much. They will show their greatness of their god through their behaviour and actions.<br><br>As for the crusades, everywhere there is example of bad sheep, so no need to kettle calling the pot black. It is not the fault of the religion itself, but ppl who yield it...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>He who knows others is wise;<br>He who know himself is enlightened.</div>
