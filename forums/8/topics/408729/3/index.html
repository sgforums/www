This also caused the earth to slip off it's axis causing a de-stabilization of Earth.<br><br>When the earth stabilized itself Antarctica and another reptilian controlled sector, N. Siberia, froze over.  These humans and infiltrators in Siberia froze <br>instantly. One  legend has it that some of the Reptilians were revived by Russian scientists from their frozen state .

And they were told that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but only the men who do not have the seal of <br>God on their foreheads. And they were not permitted to kill anyone, but to torment for five months; and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when <br>it stings a man. And in those days, men will seek death and death flees from them. And the appearance of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle; <br>and on their heads, as it were, crowns like gold, and their faces were the faces of men. And they had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were like <br>the teeth of lions. And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots, of many horses rushing to <br>battle. And they have tails like scorpions, and stings; and in their tails is the power to torment men for five months.

On Earth the Draconians are cowards, using their human shields and mind <br>slaves to fight their enemies while they hide in their underground lairs, making nocturnal visitations to the surface to abduct humans, including children, to <br>serve their purpose.<br><br><br>Richard Shaver implied that the Draconian manifests themselves through the  human spirit through emotions, thoughts and blood (plasma).  It seems this is <br>something also the bible implies as well, but refers to them as 'demons' . Here we can find the underlying reasons behind 'blood sacrifices' and torture. Fear , <br>hatred and anger gives them strength and the blood is the  life source.<br><br>Other systems that have been conquered or infiltrated by the Draconians (Reptilians) are Sirius, Arcturus,  Aldebaran, Procyon, Betelgeuse, Bernard's Star, <br>Bootes Centaurus and Sol. These systems [especially Sol] may conceivably go one way or the other depending on the future course of events,. The Final <br>Outcome of Earth may  determine the future course of the interstellar conflict itself.<br><br>Earth apparently possesses something that the reptilian Grays desperately need for the continuance of their interstellar activities. Something which is here <br>on Earth is in great abundance, but what it is we are not certain of.  It may be several things. ie. our human energies, minerals, water.<br><br>As for the Ashtar or "Astarte" collective, it is a massive electronic collective mind or intelligence with a nerve-center rumored to be based within a 20- mile <br>long computer - possibly space-based - into which numerous space cultures are tied via electrotelepathic implants. This collective has long since been <br>infiltrated and compromised by the Draconian collective at various levels and can no longer be trusted. (Be wary of so-called "Ascended Masters" speaking <br>through the Ashtar collective, as they are just as likely to be Draconian impostors as they are to be enlightened Federation beings.)<br><br><br></span></span><strong><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ffffff; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">THE BATTLEGROUND OR STAGING GROUN</span></span></strong><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ffffff; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">D<br><br>The battleground or staging ground between these three groups is a huge subterranean network known as</span></span><strong><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ffffff; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;"> DREAMLAND, here in theUNITED STATE</span></span></strong><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ffffff; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">S . <br>(Sound familiar?) <br><br></span></span><strong><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ffffff; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">The United States of America is the last obstacle standing in the way of the Joint Reptilian-Bavarian Illuminati's NEW WORLD ORDER</span></span></strong><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ffffff; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">.  The <br>NWO is based after the Reptilian collective-mind-control/annihilaton-of-consciousness sytem as opposed to what our Country originally was founded for.. <br>Individual Liberty and Free Thought.  Take the United States down and the rest of the world wll tumble like that of dominos.<br><br><br>"Dreamland" has been identified as an underground system of vast proportions consisting of natural cavernous networks connected via artificial tunnels and <br>installations. It reportedly has its main concentration below the Western front of the Rockies of Utah, stretches north into Idaho, east into Colorado, south into <br>Arizona, and west into Nevada. All four of these extensions reportedly contain joint-interaction bases below the following sites: Burley, Idaho; Creed, <br>Colorado; Page, Arizona;t he most notorious being Mt. Lassen, Clear Lake/Hopland, and Deep Springs near Bishop. But the major Federation base is in <br>California and the major Draconian base is in New Mexico.<br><br>WHAT DO WE FIND IN THESE ALIEN UNDERGROUND FACILITIES?<br><br>Over a million people in the United States annually disappear. Some of these people end up as abductees taken into the InnerWorld for gene manipulation <br>experiments and other monstrosities.  It is through this type of abductions we encounter a new species brought on by interaction bettween humans and <br>reptilians. Hybrid or humanoid  children are produced, which have human souls but are conceived with stolen human sperm and ova, then 'spliced' with <br>reptilian or cattle DNA.  Children born with no soul matrix, taking after their reptilian makers, are known as the 'Re-Brids'  The main distinction between the <br>two could be found in their pupils. It seems that the hubrids have round pupils and the rebrids show more of a slit vertical type pupil. So next time someone is <br>wearing sunglasses, have them take off their glasses so you can check out their pupils. Another thing to observe is five fingers vs. four, external <br>reproductive organs vs. internal and crimson blood vs. the greenish fluid used by the Grays.  Of course this "test" would not always apply to the <br>"Chameleons", which may require an entirely different method of identification.<br><br><br>Remember these captives are not always willing participants of the Reptilian Agenda. They along with the Nordics can be considered unwilling slaves . They <br>have exceptional psychic skills and are now  being forced to  engage in psychic warfare against humanity, etc. Given the chance, the Hubrids and the <br>Nordics who are slaves of the Reptilians will rebel).<br><br><br>In the 1940;s , a war took place below the Salt Flats in Utah, involving humans  within 'Dreamland' vs. human sorcerers working with Reptilian hominids. his <br>underground "Cult of the Serpent" had re-taken possession of the ancient subterranean systems that the antediluvian Atlanteans had established below the <br>east coast of the United States (New York, Washington DC, Boston, etc.), and then had apparently invaded the Dreamland system itself. It is possible that <br>these sorcerers were controlled by the Reptilioids and the Reptilian Infiltrators - like those "chameleons" that have been seen at the surface of the <br>DOUGWAY military installation  a military facility which sits atop the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah.<br><br>It is also alleged that in the late 1930's or early 1940's Reptilian forces began moving their centers of operation from Central and South America and into the <br>underground systems of the Southwest namely Mt. Archuleta/Dulce. The Dulce facility was apparently constructed originally (the lower levels, that is) by <br>humanoids, and later taken over by the reptilian grays over a period of time, until the mid 1940's when the U.S. government gained the ability to track UFO <br>flight paths and discovered the massive underground installations below the Dulce area. In order to remain hidden from the human public at large the Grays <br>opted to make a "treaty" with this hybrid (U.S. &amp; Secret) Government to buy time for them to take control of the minds of the human agents. They allowed the <br>CIA to possess a few of the upper levels and expand them, but the base workers literally "lost their minds" to the Alien controllers via implantation. Below <br>level-7 there were ancient tunnels that led to still deeper cavern systems - these the Reptilians retained for their own purposes. It is said that some of the <br>returning extraterrestrial "Grays" joined up with the taller native subterranean Reptilioids operating deep below the Four Corners region, which had given the <br>Grays access to the base network- These revelations lants by which an abductee's mind is influenced or "controlled" by the Reptilian collective, and turn it <br>back in their face, using it as a weapon against them.<br><br>The Reptilians may be  taking a chance by connecting humans into their collective via the implants. It may be possible to turn this into a weapon against <br>them, providing that we stay within the direction of Divine Grace.<br><br> R.W. of Salt Lake stated that he entered a cave up on the bench of the western Rockies northeast of Salt Lake several years ago with a friend. Deep inside <br>they saw an orange colored reptilian humanoid coming around a rock. They left in a hurry in absolute terror and never returned.<br><br><br>R.D., busted into a tunnel near the Crossroads Mall in downtown Salt Lake after pulling a locked manhole cover up with a chain tied to his truck, prompted by <br>rumors of reptilians stalking tunnels under Salt Lake, reports that the activity under Salt Lake City is tied-in with the Groom Lake scenario, and stories of <br>people who had disappeared after entering the tunnel labyrinth. Things he saw in the 3rd sub- basement level and below, during this and other explorations, <br>included: a long tunnel with an ancient wooden door at the end; a room from which a greenish luminescent glow emerged; men dressed in suits carrying Uzi <br>machine guns off in the distance who were walking through a large chamber; an apparently "bottomless" pit; and a large tunnel "big enough to drive a truck <br>through" that was strung with lights and led southwest (in the direction of Little Cottonwood Canyon). In this large tunnel he saw unusual tracks in the dust <br>made by some king of THREE-TOED biped creature (a reptilian?).<br><br>Other stories connected with the CROSSROADS area:<br><br>One man who worked in the tunnels was startled when he touched a tunnel wall and his arm went THROUGH the wall. Some time later he tried it again in the <br>same spot and the wall was SOLID.<br><br>A Spanish woman who worked nights on a cleaning crew in the Crossroads Mall quit her job after (what she could only describe as) a "demon" came around <br>a corner, hobbled up to her, snarled viciously and went past her down the hall.<br><br>A woman by the name of Barbara who worked as a hair stylist in Dougway, UT., stated that reptilians passing themselves off as human beings had infiltrated <br>the adjacent Dougway base. She had seen ONE OF THE BASE COMMANDERS transform temporarily before her eyes into a reptilian-like entity. These <br>"chameleons" have also been seen working in the surface installations of the underground bases near Dulce, N.M.; Groom Lake, NV; Deep Springs, CA; and <br>the Madigan facility south of Seattle.<br><br>Sources have indicated that much of the Groom Lake alien-interaction activity has been extended into the Dougway underground and similar underground <br>structures below Idaho<br><br>There are also repost of Crossroads, had broken into strange "catacombs" underground.<br><br><br>KS. of Salt Lake City reported an abduction near the Sugarhouse Mall district, southeast of Trolley Square, during which she recalls meeting with a man and <br>a short "gray" in a huge underground room, in which she saw several other people - possibly abductees. She remembers, even in her partially- conscious <br>state, becoming angry at the fact that this guy was giving her all kinds of instructions and recalls asking him who the hell he thought he was by ordering her <br>around like that... She said the man "may" have been human, but she was not sure.<br><br>KS. was also told by another friend of an abduction that had occurred to him near this same Mall, during which the aliens removed and later re-attached one <br>of his legs. Other friends of hers had told her of encountering para-humans [MIB types] up in the mountain canyons east of Salt Lake City, including the <br>Parley's Canyon area... these encounters taking place in areas where large underground caverns or bases were supposed to exist.<br><br><br>There have also been reported encounters with Nordic-like beings as well as with Reptilians in the canyons east of Salt Lake. In one case the Nordics politely <br>asked one man via a telepathic beam from a cigar-shaped craft - fully visible to him and hovering above Emigration Canyon - if he would like to come with <br>them...although the man refused the offer.<br><br>Another man by the name of "Dan" was forcibly abducted by tall green-skinned Reptilians with large black eyes just to the north in City Creek Canyon (these <br>canyons run from north to south beginning with City Creek, Emigration, Parleys, Big Cottonwood and Little Cottonwood). This indicates to me that there is a <br>conflict of sorts in this area, and KS. did in fact tell me of a very vivid "dream" wherein she encountered a blond man in a black "astronaut" uniform who <br>asked her if she recognized him. She looked intently into his eyes and then recognized him from "somewhere", and he commenced to show her a "Star Wars" <br>type battle that was in progress far above the Salt Lake valley (cloud cover?). She saw disks firing beam weapons at other incoming craft, the beams would <br>hit what appeared to be their shields and arc and crackle around them like one might see in a STAR TREK movie.<br></span></span><em><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ffffff; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">Brad and I also seen such a battle in the skies of the White Mountains, Arizona  in  1999. <br><br><br><br></span></span></em><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ffffff; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">Much alien activity has been reported as being located below Twin Peaks, SE of Salt Lake City. On the north slope of the Peaks is Big Cottonwood Canyon. <br>Reports suggest a huge base under the canyon was once controlled by "Blondes" tied-in with the Mt. Shasta system, but that this may have since been <br>infiltrated by Grays and human (mind-controlled) collaborators. Officially the Telosians are supposed to be at odds with the Grays. The crown princess of <br>Telos, Sharula, was reportedly told by Adama - the spiritual leader of the Melchizedek lodge there that the Grays are being asked to leave the planet, BY <br>FORCE if necessary. The last Gray stronghold that is to be taken care of is the one near Los Alamos, N.M., which is the eastern segment of the Dulce Hub <br>or Terminal which branches out for hundreds of miles in all directions (like the Panamint base, the Archuleta base is said to be approximately the size of <br>Manhattan this is not including the "extension" bases tied-in to Dulce). If there are still "Telosians" below the Twin Peaks area who are working WITH the <br>Grays, they are doing so in direct opposition to official Telosian policy.<br><br>WHY THE REPTILIAN CONCENTRATION IN UTAH?<br><br>Utah is a Morman run state. This church was created by a man named Joseph Smith, however the REAL power behind its growth was John C. Bennett, who <br>was apparently one of many Scottish Rite agents assigned to infiltrate the various religious movements of the world. If one does a thorough study of the <br>Masonic connections to major denominations they may discover some surprises (for instance Norman Vincent Peale was a 33rd degree mason, as were the <br>founders of the Jehovah's Witnesses, Theosophy, Scientology, Unitarianism, and so on). The Scottish Rite, incidentally, was created by Jesuits and Masons <br>at the Parisian college of Clermont.<br><br>Dr. John Coleman states that 13 Maltese Jesuits, 13 Wicca Masons and 13 Black Nobility members make up the 39 members of the Bildeberger group, <br>ultimately controlled by the BAVARIAN Illuminati through the Scottish Rite.<br><br><br>The Master Mason John C. Bennett convinced Smith to sell out to the Masonic lodge (Scottish Rite) and Bennett worked to establish an "Order of the <br>Illuminati" within Mormonism, according to Klaus Hansen's book "QUEST FOR EMPIRE".<br><br>Mormonism became a hybrid religion between Christianity (worship of the "Lamb") and gnostic Scottish Rite Masonry (worship of the "Serpent"). Even today <br>the Mormon masses in Utah believe that they are "Christians", and even the majority of the "Council of 12" - unknown to the most of its membership - are <br>actually controlled by the Scottish Rite "Council of 50" behind the scenes. These "Insiders" allow only the oldest members of the outer "Council of 12" to <br>become President of the Church. Apparently the older these council members are the less likely they will be to discern what is going on behind the scenes, <br>to make waves or make changes, or challenge the hidden Scottish Rite infiltrators and controllers.<br><br>One can see a similar power- play being carried out in the Vatican. For instance Pope John Paul I sought to make some heavy-duty changes in the Catholic <br>system, but the "powers that would be" had different ideas. After this Pope was assassinated in true Scottish Rite fashion only 33 days into his term, a former <br>Nazi sympathizer who had earlier in life sold cyanide gas to the Nazis for their gas chambers, was elected Pontiff... this new Emperor of the "Holy Roman <br>Empire" was the man who changed his name to "John Paul II".<br><br><br>The Scottish Rite has the power to control the media and therefore the influence to support or tear-down a religion through public opinion. In their desire to <br>be a "friend of the world" and escape criticism, many main-line religions must sell- out to the Masons or risk "persecution". Most Mormons outwardly profess <br>their hatred of "secret combinations", not realizing that they - along with most other mainline denominations throughout the world - have fallen victim to that <br>very force. They do not realize that they are one of the many "controlled" religions that the Illuminati plans to keep in check so that they do not interfere with <br>the "New World Order".<br><br><br>In recent years various fundamental Mormon factions began warning about the "New World Order", that is until those in the seat of power in the Mormon <br>Church were given instructions to rebuke these Patriots as being out of line with Church policy. If they kept up with their anti New World Order activities, they <br>could be excommunicated and their salvation would be on the line. Is there something wrong with this picture?<br><br><br>Ideologies cannot be controlled - this is why the Pentecostals who stress ideological lifestyle over organizational structure are frustrating s. If you don't <br>believe that the Scottish Rite is a gnostic (serpent) cult, just take a look at the designs inside the HOUSE OF THE TEMPLE, the Scottish Rite Headquarters in <br>Washington D.C. that sits atop the PENTAGRAM-LIKE street layout of the capitol city.   Let's also take into account the name 'The PENTA gon'. See the <br>connections?<br><br><br><br>Many (so-called) Protestant denominations such as the Methodists, Episcopalians, and Southern Baptists have fallen under the control of the Scottish Rite <br>as well, in that a large percentage of their congregations have dual membership in the Masonic Lodge and their denominational Church organizations.<br><br><br></span></span><strong><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ffffff; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">Below is a revelation from  Utah researcher who wishes to be. identified only as J.R.</span></span></strong><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ffffff; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">:<br><br>"...You most likely have heard of the Mormon Church, LDS, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, here in Utah, of which they control the total state in <br>all fields and phases of human endeavors. They have built temples in 100 countries. The missionaries in all these countries, including the USA, work with the <br>CIA.<br>"As the missionaries can get into countries where the CIA cannot, they collect information on the people and everything of any and all nature, the countries' <br>government and all their activities. All this world-wide information is shared with the CIA and it is fed into three of the largest computers in the world, <br>church-owned, here in Salt Lake City (these reportedly fill the entire top 2 or 3 floor-levels of the "Church Office Building" in Salt Lake City - Branton). This <br>church is one of the most powerful and rich organizations in the world today. It has one of the largest and secret police force[s] in the world. I have collected <br>this kind of information for 45 years.<br><br>"The above is not all they are into. A high official of this church was recently kicked out of the church as he got too snoopy and asked too many questions. <br>He came to me a few months ago and told me what happened. He said that HIS LIFE HAD BEEN THREATENED if he told anyone of what he had found out. <br>So he told me that if anything happened to him, to release the information he gave me. THIS INFORMATION CONCERNS A GIANT CAVERN BENEATH SALT <br>LAKE CITY AND THE WASATCH MOUNTAIN RANGE. IT GOES NORTH TO IDAHO AND SOUTH CLEAR DOWN PAST THE ARIZONA LINE, WITH <br>OFFSHOOTS WEST INTO NEVADA AND EAST INTO COLORADO.<br><br>"This cavern has been common knowledge for over 120 years. Many cases over the years have  appeared in the newspapers about  people and groups of <br>people going into the cavern, but never coming out. Several  who did find their way out, were hopelessly insane.<br><br>"At present the Archaeological Dept. of Utah are down in southeastern Utah looking for a certain entrance into this cavern, that John Brewer of Manti, Utah  <br>discovered around 30 years ago, around 1960.  He brought out of the cavern quite a few ancient plates of an unknown language. Some of the plates were <br>gold, some silver, brass, copper and clay. He also saw many strange things he won't talk about, such as what he thought were weapons of crystal.<br><br>"His son was TORTURED AND KILLED by some unknown person or persons trying to force the secrets out of him. The church wanted the plates in the worst <br>way - they still do.<br><br>"The information I was given by this former member of the Church IS VERY CLOSE TO BEING THE SAME AS [the information that has surfa and customs, <br>using research labs, some of the best in the United States. A lot of GENETIC EXPERIMENTS AND RESEARCH is also going on here in different laboratories <br>(Note: One source has stated that a Mr. "Fleisher", now deceased, took part in a training mission to acclimate humanoid aliens to human society in a fashion <br>similar to that which was performed by the well known contactee Howard Menger.<br><br>This project was initiated in Salt Lake City with nearly 200 alien personnel, and has since spread to Arizona and other parts of the world. One source who <br>studied at the Salt Lake Technical College, stated that a fellow student confided to him that he was actually from an underground city, and was working here <br>on the surface. There have also been other rumors of individuals living in this city who were from underground communities... but whether these arrived on <br>the surface by choice or were driven to the surface by the Reptilioid infestation of the North American substructure, is uncertain. Both scenarios may exist. <br>There are nevertheless suggestions that all three groups from the United Federation, the Draconian Empire, and the Bavarian Collaboration - are active in <br>this part of the country - Branton).<br><br><br>"THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN AND ADULTS HAVE VANISHED WITHOUT A TRACE OF MOST OF THEM,<br>HERE IN UTAH.<br><br>Branton reported that a gentleman gave him information that the Church  has been working on a vault-like repository in the mountains behind Salt Lake , <br>PART OF THE UPPER CAVERN, to put all records, secret documents, and other valuables for safe keeping. This is the aforementioned Vault in Granite <br>Mountain, up on the slope of Little Cottonwood Canyon .  He said for over a period of time he helped on this detail. SEVERAL TIMES HE SAID HE SPOTTED <br>SEVERAL SMALL HUMANOIDS WITH EXTRA-LARGE EYES WATCHING THEM FROM A DISTANCE.<br><br>"He said THERE WAS A LOT OF BUILDING GOING ON IN THE LOWER PORTION OF THE CAVERN. He heard motors, dynamos, the high whine of <br>generators and voices. All this he said has been going on for over 15 years that he knew of (or previous to 1975 - Branton). He said his curiosity got the best <br>of him one day, he slipped away from the work gang he was in and went down to a lower part of the cavern. He came to some BUILDINGS WITH LOTS OF <br>ROOMS. THERE WAS A LOT OF BUILDING AND OTHER ACTIVITY GOING ON. THERE WERE MANY MEN AND WOMEN WORKING ON WORK BENCHES <br>WITH COMPUTERS, AND BUILDING ELECTRONIC UNITS OF SOME KIND. AMONG THESE WORKERS WERE MORE OF THESE SMALL HUMANOIDS WITH <br>BIG BLACK EYES.<br><br>When he started back, two security officers caught him and escorted him back to the repository vault, where they reported his actions and wanderings into <br>the off-limits area, to his superiors. They in turn put him on a truck and sent him back to town. He was warned to keep his mouth shut about what he saw. <br>They told him what was going on down there was a U.S. government operation and was TOP SECRET (Note: actually it was a CIA operation. The CIA has an <br>inner-core who work for Bavarian Intelligence and an outer-core who are led to believe that they are working for the best interests of American Intelligence. <br>Russbacher  has stated that there are two factions that are presently fighting for control of the CIA itself - suggesting that the outer core of Patriots who have <br>fought Communism in the past are now waking up to the fact that the inner core of the CIA is actually being run by [National] SOCIALISTS. </span></span><em><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ffffff; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">I wonder what <br>factor runs our HOMELAND SECURITY</span></span></em><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ffffff; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">?  In this case the statement that this activity - taking place within the massive cavern-systems below the Wasatch <br>Front of the Western Rockies - is a "U.S. Governmed get 20 years in a federal prison or WORSE. He kept asking questions to different members he thought <br>were friends. Someone reported him. In turn he was apostated from the Church, WITH A DEATH THREAT.<br><br>"This is the 3rd time in the last 20 years I have heard about this activity, from different friends of mine who are members of this church. I didn't pay too much <br>attention to it until I received the info [on] Dulce, New Mexico... I think its high time to PUT THIS INFO OUT TO THE PUBLIC. Most people are so <br>BRAINWASHED by the church here, and the television, that most people won't believe any of it anyway. But I believe there are people in this land of ours <br>who will believe. Those are the ones who need all the information of this nature they can receive. At least they will be aware of the existence of the situation <br>and won't be so easily trapped. They in turn can help others... Sincerely, J.R."<br><br>Being that the term DREAMLAND has been given to the cavern systems below the Four Corners as well as to those below Nevada, I believe that it is fair to <br>assume that the massive underground system connecting the two can also be given the same appellation. It is possible that war has raged through the <br>DREAMLAND complex [spanning Utah, Nevada, Idaho, Colorado, Arizona, etc.,] for centuries.<br><br>Apache-Hopi activist Robert Morningsky has stated that his ancestors were driven to the surface by the "Two Hearts" or the "Children of the Lizard" who <br>invaded their underground world and forced them to take refuge in the outer world.<br><br>Another Hopi legend states that some of their numbers in that ancient time turned to practicing sorcery [and if we combine this legend with Morningsky's <br>statements, we can assume that these sorcerers also betrayed the rest of the Hopi to the Serpent Race in exchange for promises of power, etc.]. It seems <br>that some things never change. This warfare seems to compare with the Dero - Tero conflicts referred to by Richard Shaver. Is it possible that the DULCE <br>WARS (which began in 1979 after human scientists discovered thousands of abductees who were being held in cages and in cold storage deep below <br>Dulce) and the GROOM wars (which began around the same time after a human security guard was killed when he challenged an alien dictate that human <br>security personnel could not enter alien-controlled sections below Nevada with loaded weapons) were actually more outward manifestations of a "deeper <br>conflict that has raged through the centuries, one that we might refer to as the DREAMLAND Wars?
