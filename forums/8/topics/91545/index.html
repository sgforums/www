So much so that I got fedup and scolded one of the pimps then I realised what a stupid thing to do and I quickly ducked into a busy Macs till the pimp walked away!<br><br>Otherwise, its pretty nice... but Im bias cos I stay in nice hotel and work in nice offices.

Those outlying and remote areas are still very much below par.  And I guess those urbanites do not welcome those rural ppl migrating to their urban city to look for employment.<br><br>Maybe we should get feedback for those who have been to those remote areas for comments? But if he/she is indeed there I doubt they have internet access to post their experience in here.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Blueray:</div><div class="quote_body">I just came back from Shanghai and wow what a nice city.  The number of high rise buildings/office is unbelieveable. The Bund is fantastic and so is the stretch of housing along bouleyard. Subway is cheap compared to S'pore. They also have some kind of EZlink card like we do. Food mix varies from the ultra expensive to the simple RMB5 set lunch in small eating shops. A wonderful place for shoppers.<br><br>However one thing they got to keep an eye on is air pollution. Fortunately the situation is improving. Shanghai can now see more blue skies compared to 5 years ago.<br><br>Why am i so surprised? I once lived in china for a few years. Before I set foot in china, I thought it must be backwards compared to S'pore. Nowadays if u go to any major chinese city, don't be surprised if it is as good as S'pore.</div></blockquote>Shanghai still just another City. Nothing fanastic.<br>Shopping ? Branded stuff more expensive, a lot of stuff you will not even want.<br><br>Food ? A lot of different type, cheap but still is not as good other countries.<br><br>Polluted city, crowded roads !<br><br></div>
