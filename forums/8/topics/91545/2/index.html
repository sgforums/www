            <div class='col-md body'>china is big place, I went there sometime back also we travelled 3-4 cities shanghi being one of them.<br><br>I will just breifly describe shanghi here.<br><br>In China nothing is free, everywhere and everything needs money it's not for the genuine FZ super budget traveller.<br><br>Bring american currency for exchange, singapore currency not really accepted at many banks even in suzhou despite.<br><br>We went during winter season the tempreature was abt 2-3degrees quite cool. very grey &amp; smoggy, much like what you see in the old hong kong shanghi gangsters triad series reminescent of the golden era.<br><br>Believe it or not there is racism in china. As long as you are from a different province they regard you as a foreigner much like how we regard indian/china/bangla here but singaporean chinese will feel at home there because nobody really cares as everybody looks chinese anyways.<br><br>Food there is plentiful and very affordable but different from us. They like it salty and very oily there, we like ours sweet. Even their spicy stuff like chilli is most times chilli oil. Even their morning 'dou jiang' is preferred salted.<br><br>The women there are quite pretty but there are also not so pretty ones much like anywhere else in the world, in china you wont find them situated in one area. Those working in the city are quite affluent but I also saw a lot of poor people around, child beggars, old fuit vendors with push carts etc...<br><br>In shanghi, high number of the younger locals there speak english as compares by % to the rest of the country, xiamen is also another one. It's also very modern there, the infras is close to malaysia capital, the economy is a little bit like singapore, the stores you find there if you walk at night is a bit like what you'd find in the HDB heartlands. Their MRT interior decor is exactly singapore. We didn't have chance to visit the steamy underbelly night life as our whole trip was based on budget.<br><br>Shopping is like 'you pay $25 for a shirt here, there you pay RMB25' for the same product a great advantage for tourist. Branded stuff however are very expensive no bargains to be had. If you want to go shopping don't go december period, you can only find winter clothes at shopping sales which is useless for our climate. But of course there's other knick knack handicrafts souvenirs around to buy.<br><br>Bargaining however is a bittersweet experience, you always have to haggle for everything even in department stores and there are always tricksters nearby who will try to overcharge you or pass on fake currency or exchange fake currency with you.<br><br>To them taking advantage of their neighbour's expense is not a crime, it is a national pastime. Beware your belongings, if they even scent you are a foreign country chinese they will follow you around and pester you for hours. Beware of scams for a good deal even senior old folks during morning 'tai chi' exercise will try to pull a fast one.<br><br>To give an example, we visited an old ancient ruin site, as we approached the ticketing booth, a group of old folks approached us to sell us 'hugely discounted' tickets, being very suspicious we didn't go for it but was very tempted. We found out later when we exited the site and saw a dustbin full of 'used' tickets.<br><br>But of course if you're on holiday not asking you to be on heightened state of alert and suspicious of everyone you meet, relax but beware and don't let yourself be caught in a position you cannot get out of.</div>

If you unsure what I mean mebbe you shud talk to some of the China people working here in singapore, ask them how they feel abt our food here.<br><br>Oh yes... also be mindful of something called 'xiang rou pau' sold during winter period.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
