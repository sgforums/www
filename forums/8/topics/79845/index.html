            <div class='col-md body'>This is very true!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Last month, I received a call from a private collector.  I have been paying my bills on time, so it should not be due to my bills.  The private collector called me to asked for my sister.  I suspect that my sister (who has already moved to overseas) did not terminate her line before she left.  I queried the private collector how the hell she got my number. She said she got it from SxxxTxx.  I told her that I am not so&amp;so and not to call my line again.<br><br>The next day, I wrote a complaint to the service provider.  I gave them one week's time (incl weekends) to give me an acceptable answer to their action.  They did not bother to reply.  On the 7th day (which is the deadline) I called and talked to the customer service staff.  I said that SxxxTxx has not right to give my number away like this.  To my surprise, she said that they do have the right because my sister and I are sharing the same billing address.<br><br>I was furious and I called my friend who is working in the Credit Department in one of the ISPs.  He confirmed that this is not the practise.<br><br>About two days letter, I received the letter from the service provider.  The Credit Manager who wrote the letter tried to be smart by backdating the letter (so as to show that she is replying within the deadline I gave).  In the letter, she apologised for the unpleasant encounter that I had with the private collector.  She stressed that SxxxTxx does not disclose customers' information.<br><br>Note:<br>1) They have not addressed the main issue.  I have no problem with the private collector who called.  After all, private collectors are only carry out their customers' instructions.  In this case, the service provider must have specifically instructed them to call my number to track down my sister.<br><br>2) If the service provider did not disclose my number, and I never have any dealings with the private collectors before, how the hell will they have my number?<br><br>I intend to shoot a nasty complaint letter, together with my note to terminate the handphone line.  This time, I will not email.  Emailing will only help the credit manager hide this case under the carpet.<br>I will fax and send by post.  This way, more people will read it.  Before I do that, I need to get a new line probably with Starhub.<br><br>I left the reply letter in my office and I'm not at work today.  Otherwise, I will scan or type word for word what the Credit Manager said.</div>
