Is that going to stop banks from foreclosure? HDB is a govt-non profit org. Banks are not. They are already seizing private property. There was also an uproar when they first introduced $2 service charges for small accounts. It was the first time, caused much unhappiness, but still they did it.<br><br>5. Savings who don't want. But one cannot lose the forest for the trees and be so short sighted. You may save 100s in first few years, but what is stopping you from losing them in the later years? In financial planning, one must LOOK and Plan throughout the whole term of the loan.</div>
