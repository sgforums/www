              <p>hi, i read abt the posts here, so would like to share my views with fellow singaporeans. due to my job, i have to travel every month, i've been travelling around europe &amp; usa and now i live in china. i have been backpacking around provinces like beijing, si chuan, henan, hu bei, hu nan, guang dong, zhe jiang, jiangsu etc.</p>
              <p>personnally, i don't think they are being rude or whatever that had been mentioned here. it is their culture. i don't think many singaporeans can adapt to life overseas. we are very vulnerable and too dependant on the government. we complain about everything we can. and even the government. ppl like lky are being respected like gods, father of singapore by foreignors, whereas, some singaporeans are critisizing them.</p>
              <p>i'm really gald that the government gave me a passport that i can travel visa free. and i am really glad that i'm a singaporean. speak later. i have to something to do. bye.</p>

              <p>Dear TS,</p>
              <p>u r not alone in feeling this way. lets highlight a typical weekday morning when u head to work,</p>
              <p>1. u take bus, driver n almost 80% of commuters r tiongs<br>2. u go office, high chance u will c a tiong colleague in office, at least i did<br>3. lunch time! the kopitiam or mac staff is tiong, the cleaner oso tiong!<br>4. den u go home, plz refer to point 1<br>5. u on tv at home, news is mostly on the tiong nonsense, tv dramas oso got tiong actors n actresses!!<br>6. feeling disgusted, u go to bed, thanking the heavens ur spouse is not tiong (or is he/she?)</p>
              <p>try taking trains on weekend mornings. u feel like a Singaporean in foreign country instead of vice sersa. we r actually blending into the tiong culture n not the other way round. we r Singaporeans! i m proud to b 1, i like my country, but i c all our hard work being trashed by these parasites, how disheartening can that b? citizenship is so ez to get for them, its like s'porean citizenship is no longer as "exclusive" as it used to be. any tom, dick, harry can jus get it.</p>
              <p>there is no end to this. its a hole we can nv get ourselves out of. they spit on our lands, pee n vomit on our trains, disgrace our society, destroy our identity, assault our ppl. i really dunno wat kind of contributions these parasites can make to our country.</p>
              <p>worse thing is there is nth we can do. no thanks to our brilliant government.</p>

              <p>im just curious, wana get opinions from all my fellow singaporeans. Look around u, whereever u go, there's bound to be at least a quarter filled with China people.</p>
              <p>Firstly, they are irritating, rude, and have no moral values or principals at all. I guess i dont have to elaborate on why i dont like China ppl...and with so many coming here to Singapore, do any of u still feel that u're in Singapore?</p>
              <p>I dont know about the rest of u, but im feeling like this isnt Singapore anymore, these China ppl come here and taint our society,very soon, they'll get married to Singaporeans, etc, and when their babies come out...ta-da! automatic Singaporean already.</p>
              <p>Any of u feel that they're too many freaking China ppl here? the worst i've experienced was when i went on to service 62 one morning, almost the whole bus was filled with China ppl!! wth...i couldnt stand it, dropped off at the next stop and waited for the next one.</p>
              <p>What do u, as a Singaporean think and feel about this?</p>

              <p><br>Actually every countries also have their own fair share of rude and uncultured citizens. And the reason such people exists is because of dissatisfaction in their lives and environment. But of course there is no way any country/government/environment can provide absolute satisfaction to cater for so many different kinds of people in our world. So I think that's normal, and you shouldn't make such a big deal out of it.</p>
              <p>The good part is, at least with the increasing foreign population entering Singapore, most rude and uncultured and possibly poor citizens can miraculously united together as ONE and conveniently shift all the blame over to the foreigners.</p>
              <p>I don't know why Singaporean can do something like that and forget that they used to be as rude and uncultured as the foreigners.</p>
              <p>But it actually doesn't matter which countries you're from and represent, it is actually an individual issue. There are nice Singaporeans in Singapore too, how come nobody bothered to mention anything about them?</p>
              <p>I think I read the Straits Times and I read about foreigners complaining about uncultured, rude Singaporeans misbehaving in our public transports and I am amazed that the newspapers actually forgotten to filter out such bad comments and selectively chose to publish the bad comments from the foreigners to tear down the reputation of Singaporeans in Singapore.</p>
              <p>So where has the nationalism and stand as one united people gone to?</p>
              <p>Maybe it only exists in words but never in actions and is already forgotten in many Singaporean's minds. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p><br>fair?? are they being fair to us by coming here, destroying and polluting our country, and disgracing Singapore?? how many of them are not like that? have u forgotten China is a communist country? even so, i think only about 2% of their whole population are not like that, and how many of these 2% come to Singapore?</p>
              <p>The big idea is, where will that leave our singapore girls?(dont tell me singapore girls are demanding, etc, cos thats another topic already.) i feel that we were created from a mix of Chinese,Malays, etc, thats why we're Singaporeans, these China people are pure Chinese!! and they have no moral values and principals, guess what will they teach their children!! and their children are the future of this nation!! if they grow up with no principals and values, oh God, yes, the singapore ship is sinking.and they come here to con singapore ppl, especially the elderly, cos thats what they do in their country too.we'll fail in the tourism sector too, these China ppl come here and tourists who dont know count them as Singaporeans.can u imagine if they were to be rude/con/tout their goods to tourists? Singapore is going down..... </p>
              <p>yes, we cant do anything at all, government likes these China ppl. and yes, sg is a pot of gold to them, but how do they make a living when they cant even speak english??!! so, easiest way out :illegal prostituition. whats wrong? they're only trying to make a living wat...they just only destroy Singapore society, destroy tourism, and finally destroy all of Singapore, nothing wrong wat, they're just trying to make a living wat...</p>

              <p>TS: It's not like Singaporeans (not saying ALL, mind you) are that polite or courteous to begin with. so why arrow those China nationals?</p>
              <p>Our ancestors mostly come from China... unless you're not a Chinese, that is. So they more or less have the 'rights' to 'come in' anytime they want.</p>
              <p>I still feel Singapore-ish...especially with the singlish forever sticking around..</p>

              <p>aiya....... wad to do</p>
              <p>Everytime i board the train, i look around at my surrounding. No doubt, the Singaporean like chinese wearing tee shirt and jeans is indeed ah tiong. Feeling rather awkard, i try to scan my surroundings again. OH! i saw a teenage young man-looking rather sporty and fit-good enough to be our national player, but he was also another ah tiong. Sigh, it seems that i am the only Singaporean in the train carraige, perharps i should move on to the next, either to be relived, or to remain dissapointed<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>working in china, i come to see that tiongs are mostly just more outspoken than us singaporeans, if you come to china, u'll see that its perfectly normal, not even considered rude to others  if u speak loudly, cos that's the way it is all over the country.</p>
              <p>their society has been like this for thousands of years, frankly i don't see how its gonna change.</p>
              <p>try to learn more abt them and their culture, keep an open mind, instead of just condemning them (which i'm trying to do so myself over in China)  =)</p>
              <p>there're alot of good tiongs ard actually, and on a side-note, many tiongs are really damn smart n knowledgeable, sgreans oni win them now cos our english own them.. when the day comes when tiongs have english as good as ours.. i think we're fk.ed.</p>

              <p><br>Discrimination only occurs after migration when you have no money or you are super poor.</p>
              <p>There will be no discrimination for the rich, no matter which countries they have decided to migrate to.</p>
              <p>Even in your home country aka motherland, your own kind will discriminate against you if you're poor.</p>

              <p><br>No amount of money in your bank can prevent  rascists from discriminating you.What the local feel threatened most is when foreigners or immigrants take away their rice bowl rather than  mess up their culture and traditions that is a true fact.When I was in Singapore last month I saw chinese people working as cleaners at some Indian coffee shops in Little India,I expect them to be making world class nasi briyani and owning prata shops in just a few years to come.</p>

              Our country is now infested by these China nationals-on bus,street,shopping malls,hawker centers,etc everywhere U go U can spot them...not forgetting Geylang where their females parade their flesh there...
              
              S'pore shd be downgraded by the presence of such pple--wonder how many are actual foreign talent...many come in because their spouses,bros or sis have citizenships or PRs
              
              Majority take away jobs or compete with locals and the latter has to contend with low paying jobs...those brighter kids from China are topping over our local kids in sports and academic studies..indirectlt is good..let's look at the plus points then we don't really hate them
