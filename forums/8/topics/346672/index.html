              <p>duh. the 'westerners' who come to singapore are those who are in the 'higher income group' back in their conutry anyway and are of 'higher class' even  before they come to singapore. those who come from china are those who want to have a better life etc....</p>

              <p>First of all, I have to disagree that you are generalising of their bad behaviors..Please be fair to others, not all of them are that ways.</p>

              <p><br>fair?? are they being fair to us by coming here, destroying and polluting our country, and disgracing Singapore?? how many of them are not like that? have u forgotten China is a communist country? even so, i think only about 2% of their whole population are not like that, and how many of these 2% come to Singapore?</p>
              <p>The big idea is, where will that leave our singapore girls?(dont tell me singapore girls are demanding, etc, cos thats another topic already.) i feel that we were created from a mix of Chinese,Malays, etc, thats why we're Singaporeans, these China people are pure Chinese!! and they have no moral values and principals, guess what will they teach their children!! and their children are the future of this nation!! if they grow up with no principals and values, oh God, yes, the singapore ship is sinking.and they come here to con singapore ppl, especially the elderly, cos thats what they do in their country too.we'll fail in the tourism sector too, these China ppl come here and tourists who dont know count them as Singaporeans.can u imagine if they were to be rude/con/tout their goods to tourists? Singapore is going down..... </p>
              <p>yes, we cant do anything at all, government likes these China ppl. and yes, sg is a pot of gold to them, but how do they make a living when they cant even speak english??!! so, easiest way out :illegal prostituition. whats wrong? they're only trying to make a living wat...they just only destroy Singapore society, destroy tourism, and finally destroy all of Singapore, nothing wrong wat, they're just trying to make a living wat...</p>

              <p>But hey! I do sympatise them too, at the same time for being look down and sometime being bullied. They come here, not to annoy us, but to settle down in a better enviroment. Do they think they wanna be here in the first place? They have no choice</p>
              <p>How PRC talks is depends on where they come from. Not all PRC are like that. My neighbour is a PRC too, but they are nice you know. When my grandparents pass away, they sent money over. They are not rich, but generous enough.</p>
              <p>Sometime we (my family) are called over to have dinner with them. Man, their hometown dishes rocks. Is so simple yet delicious. Even CNY, we visited each other.</p>

              <p>yes, but its people that make up a country.tourists who dont know come here and have bad experiences with these China ppl, and ta-da! label us ugly Singaporeans again.how are we supposed to build up a graceful society like that?! some tourists even feel like China when coming to Singapore, cos they hear China accents all around, and China ppl are all around!! and these tourists were very apalled by their behaviour, cos they literally spit right infront of them, cant wait properly in line, must push people in the queue for buses, etc, act extremely proud, cant even be bothered to look at tourists when being asked for directions.(was told by my singaporean tour guide)</p>
              <p>and do u feel proud to be a singaporean anymore, with all these China ppl coming here to disgrace singapore?</p>
