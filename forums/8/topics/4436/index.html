            <div class='col-md body'>Not only they sensed, i also have this feeling that this is another scene of match-fixing. In my humble opinon, this world cup is full of match fixing. Comments?<br><br>============================================<br><br>Italy senses Korean conspiracy<br><br>Sean Ingle<br>Tuesday June 18, 2002<br><br>Italy's politicians and football officials have accused Ecuadorian referee Byron Moreno of "robbing" them of victory - and suggested that behind-the-scenes-powers worked to hand South Korea a place in the World Cup quarter-finals.<br><br>Italy had a man sent off and a goal disallowed for offside in extra time - both decisions denounced by Italian television commentators - before South Korea scored the winning golden goal.<br><br>"Frankly, that was complete robbery," Bruno Pizzul, Italy's most famous commentator told state television RAI immediately after the game.<br><br>Franco Frattini, Italy's minister for public offices, agreed: "The referee was a disgrace, absolutely scandalous. I've never seen a game like it. It seemed as if they just sat around a table and decided to throw us out."<br><br>Meanwhile Raffaele Ranucci, the head of the Italian football delegation to the World Cup, told Italy's RAI state television that a conspiracy had taken place.<br><br>"Korea is a powerful country. It's clear that they would have done something. I've never in my life seen refereeing that bad," he said. "The referee was a disgrace. It was like something out of a comedy film."<br><br>Asked if he had said anything to Moreno after the game, Ranucci replied: "We said something to the referee in the changing rooms. We are angry and disappointed. It's not fair that a country like Italy can be humiliated like this."<br><br>Italy's fans clearly agreed with the assessment. Hundreds of supporters, who had gathered in central Rome to watch the game on a giant television screen, shouted "death to the referee" after the game.<br><br>People watching the game across the country in squares, bars and offices, hugged and consoled each other in stunned silence.<br><br>Many cried openly, tears streaming down their cheeks in the boiling summer sun as the Italian players trailed off the field in Taejon, Korea.<br><br>"I expected a victory, the pain is enormous. There is no justice in this world, especially with these referees," said 26-year old Rosalba Petrone, sitting with friends in Rome's gigantic Piazza del Popolo.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Italians are sore losers with huge ego that just got deflated... and the coach and players would rather find a scapegoat (in this case the poor referee) than accept the fact that they were beaten fair and square.<br><br>True.. there may be a few controversial decisions.. but then again.. hey.. it's soccer... and referees and linesmen do not have the benefit of slow motion reply like we do... there will always be a few decisions that are dubious or highly debatable.<br><br>To be fair to the Koreans, they put up a brave fight... and let's admit it.. they did manage to pin the Italians back and restrict them to just a few occassional forays into their penalty box.<br><br>Besides.. did you see the way those Italian players fall to ground as if they've been struck by a train? Or how they put their hands on their faces when the koreans did not even hit them there?? Or how one of them even clutched his groin in pain when slow motion replays clearly show contact was on the thigh?<br><br>Of course it's not helped by people with impaired vision like Jeffrey Low who insisted that Cocu's cut above the eye was due to an elbow from a Korean striker.. I mean.. hello... did he watch the slow motion replay?? It was from the elbow of his team-mate (read ITALIAN).<br><br>Oh well.... for the bunch of sore losers with a high deficiency in sportsmanship.. wake up... admit the fact you lost to the better them... you had your chances but missed them (vieri blasting over an open goal from 5 yards out).... Italy have great players... but not a great team... the Koreans deserved the victory...<br><br>At least they were fitter... see how the Italians get sluggish in extra time... and how Maldini couldn't find the energy to jump and challenge Ahn.. choosing instead to back peddle...<br><br>Pity Ahn though.. there goes his career in Italy...<br><br>Hmm.. maybe some English club will sign him next season.. ha ha</div>
