I have many China friends in Singapore. After knowing them for 3 years plus, i personally feel tat they will strive hard to acheive something which they want to acheive, they r hardworking, motivated, very eager to learn n really smart. They can think really far n analyse thing very detail... Their society has force them to behave this way bcoz they know tat they cannot take things for granted in China esp during the less developed period of China... I'm not boot licking China ppl anyway, wat i'm saying is from my observation n personal point of views...</div>

Its used by a lot of english speaking singaporean as far as i know it. If i am not wrong, its tamil language. And chinese teen uses it to tok abt it instead of saying it as chinese or hua wen. The crux of it is the look on their faces when they say it. They seems so "proud".<br><br>Abt the education thingy, Its up to anyone to think how the education system is... Good or bad. Up to you. I was juz voicing out my comments.<br><br>And abt the China people issues, I do agree that most of them are hardworking. And they are really bright too. Esp in their maths and sciences. Its not abt being them smarter or wat. Singaporeans ( some ) says that singapore is a city full of talents and Sg rocks. I agree SG rocks. But if they had been to Shanghai or The IT hub of India, i think they would shut their mouth up abt having lots of talents in SG.</div>

The problems with some Singaporean is tat they dunno nuts abt what is going on in the other places of the globe and making stereotypes remark on those countries. They ought to read up n update their knowledge n thinking towards these countries.</div>
