            <div class='col-md body'>To be most accurate, select the answer that you can best identify with, not<br>one which you think would be right.<br><br>1. You're walking down a path. What do you see all around you?<br><br>A. A deep, dark forest. The trees are so thick that only a bit of sky shows<br>through.<br>B. A cornfield. It stretches as far as you can see, under a bright-blue<br>sky.<br>C. Green rolling hills, dotted with trees. Beyond them you can almost see<br>mountains.<br><br>2. You spot an object by your feet. What is it?<br><br>A. A mirror<br>B. A ring<br>C. A bottle.<br><br>3. Do you pick it up?<br><br>A. Yes.<br>B. No.<br><br>4. Continuing along the path, you come across some water. What form is the<br>water in?<br><br>A. A cool, clear, serene lake.<br>B. A crashing waterfall.<br>C. A babbling brook.<br><br>5. You see a key in the water and reach down to pick it up. What does it<br>look like?<br><br>A. A simple house key.<br>B. A fancy antique key.<br>C. A small padlock key.<br><br>6. As you walk farther along the path, you come to a house. What kind of<br>house is it?<br><br>A. Hollywood-style mansion.<br>B. A cottage with a well-tended lawn.<br>C. A beautiful castle in ruins.<br><br>7. What do you do?<br><br>A. Look in the window.<br>B. Go inside.<br>C. Walk on.<br><br>8. Suddenly, something jumps out and scares at you. What is it?<br><br>A. A bear<br>B. A wizard.<br>C. A troll.<br><br>9. You run down the path until you reach a wall with a door in it. You peek<br>through the keyhole. What's on the other side?<br><br>A. The lush gardens of an awesome house.<br>B. A pond in the middle of the desert.<br>C. A sandy beach with crashing waves.<br><br>&gt;Qestion 1 shows your attitude toward life<br>&gt;<br>&gt;A. If you chose the forest, you're deep, quiet.People find you incredibly<br>&gt;interesting because you don't how show your true self right away. Pals love<br>&gt;you because you're a good listener.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;B. If you chose the cornfield, you're bright, honest and likable. You make<br>&gt;friends easily and rarely get bummed. You've got a rep for being<br>&gt;entertaining and fun, and you're always the center of attention.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;C. If you chose the rolling hills, you're practical and down-to-earth, and<br>&gt;you attract people with your straightforward nature. A great problem solver,<br>&gt;you always listen to both points of view before taking a side.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Question 2 reveals what kind of boyfriend/girlfriend you're looking for<br>&gt;<br>&gt;A. If you chose the mirror, you're searching for a guy/gal who shares your<br>&gt;outlook on life. You've got a pretty good idea of what your ideal<br>&gt;boyfriend/girlfriend is like, but you keep an open mind - the perfect guy<br>&gt;may be someone you normally wouldn't look at twice!<br>&gt;<br>&gt;B. If you chose the ring, you are a true romantic.When in a relationship,you<br>&gt;work hard at keeping things mushy. You believe true love is forever, and<br>&gt;although you might not admit it, you want your guy/gal care about you.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;C. If you chose the bottle, you want someone who's not afraid to show his<br>&gt;intelligence. Ambitious, hard-working guys/gals turn you on drop-dead<br>&gt;gorgeous just isn't enough for you.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Question 3 tells how commitment-ready you are<br>&gt;<br>&gt;A. If you said yes, you're dying to pick the right person.<br>&gt;B. If you said no, you're into playing the field for now.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Question 4 symbolizes your passion potential<br>&gt;<br>&gt;A. If you chose the lake, you're not interested in having a superficial<br>&gt;relationship. Once you meet someone you're really into, your love runs<br>&gt;deep.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;B. If you chose the waterfall, opposite sex think you're ultrasexy. You're<br>&gt;good at turning on the charm, and loads of guys/gals lust after you.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;C. If you chose the brook, you're always crushing on someone new. You're an<br>&gt;expert flirt, and you're frequently on the move from one guy to the next.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Question 5 expresses your views on school<br>&gt;<br>&gt;A. If you saw the housekey, education is less important to you than the<br>&gt;world beyond. Secretly, you may be dying to start a career and a home of<br>&gt;your own.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;B. If you saw the antique key, you consider education to be crucial. You<br>&gt;want to work hard and want to absorb as much knowledge as you possibly can.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;C. If you saw the padlock key, you may not be too into school,but you still<br>&gt;have plenty of great ideas. You follow your intuition, so you may eventually<br>&gt;end up in an offbeat career.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Question 6 gives clues about your ambitions<br>&gt;<br>&gt;A. If you chose the mansion, you've got tons of goals. You strive to be the<br>&gt;best at whatever you do, and you're attracted to jobs that let you express<br>&gt;your energetic personality. Being successful makes you superpsyched.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;B. If you chose the cottage, you have a realistic attitude toward a future<br>&gt;profession. Because your feet are planted firmly on the ground, you'll<br>&gt;probably rock at whatever career you pick.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;C. If you chose the castle, your career dreams could be a little<br>&gt;unrealistic. Becoming a mega-star would be fab, but aim for something closer<br>&gt;to home first. Otherwise, you may wind up being a little disappointed.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Question 7 shows your attitude towards success<br>&gt;<br>&gt;A. If you looked through the window, you're a little afraid of failing.<br>&gt;Taking that first step toward reaching a goal is the most intimidating to<br>&gt;you, so don't give up before you've actually tried.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;B. If you went inside, you feel confident about success. Nothing's going to<br>&gt;stand in your way!<br>&gt;<br>&gt;C. If you kept walking, success isn't a big deal for you. You're content<br>&gt;with simple things and you'd rather be around people you love than spend<br>&gt;your life trying to get to the top.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Question 8 reveals your worst fears<br>&gt;<br>&gt;A. If you chose the bear, you worry about being able to stand on your own<br>&gt;two feet. Independence is totally key.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;B. If you chose the wizard, you're scared about things that are often beyond<br>&gt;your control. So, to make up for it, you sometimes go on a heavy-duty power<br>&gt;amperage.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;C. If you chose the troll, you tend to obsess over how others see you. It's<br>&gt;crucial that people like you - you're desperate to fit into the in crowd.<br>&gt;You need to learn to trust your own judgment.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Question 9 represents your innermost self<br>&gt;<br>&gt;A. If you chose the gardens, you're mature and honest. You believe in<br>&gt;speaking your mind, and people rely on you to provide a sensible viewpoint.<br>&gt;However, you may come across problems in the future that you'll have to<br>&gt;solve with your heart, not your head.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;B. If you chose the desert pond, you have a deep need for your own space.<br>&gt;You're always analyzing your thoughts, and you've been known to do a<br>&gt;disappearing act when things get tough. Sharing your feelings with someone<br>&gt;you trust can help you feel better.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;C. If you chose the beach, you are passionate about life and have strong<br>&gt;opinions that you aren't afraid to reveal. But you're unpredictable,and you<br>&gt;change those opinions often. Sometimes,<br>&gt;like the ocean, you'll show your calmer side-but usually not for long!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
