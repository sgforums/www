              <p>maybe too heaty and not enough sleep. i got it twice in december alone. Hmm basically i didnt do anything abt it and it goes away by itself eventually. if u cannot take the ringing feeling just listen to ur mp3 or sth,it will make u feel the blocking sensation is not thre anymore :D</p>

              <p>eyes? lol!! <br><br>I read some articles that said so ma.. the more i dig, it will actually push the wax to go in deeper, and hence, block the ear. It's a bad habit la to dig using the cotton sticks.. each day i must dig a few times. Quite shiok.</p>
              <p>I got listen to mp3, i couldnt really hear much on the right ear, and then i thought the earphone isnt workin. so i go check but no leh. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>i just want to ask. those ear drops you have, does it melt the wax? like after you put it, then let the drops stay in your ear for a while, then you clear it off right? if it make the wax softer, after a few days u will see the wax coming out piece by piece.</p>

              <p>The instruction is like asking me to place 2 drops into the ear with me lying in an acute position. Then awhile later, let the drops drip out itself. Hmm i didnt know must wait a few more days sia. LOL. I thought is instant. So does the olive oil works that way too?</p>

              <p>yeah because i have ear block problem sometimes but usually my case is that the ear wax is stuck there, and become hardened there so caused my ears very pain. so the doctor the other time also just give olive oil to make the ear wax softer.</p>

              <p>hmm.. i see.... so can i say that, if the ear is blocked, that is due to the hardened wax. So in order to soften it we can use olive oil to wet it and make it soft, but then we still have to get the wax out right? Dig again meh? I have not been digging it for the past days.</p>
              <p>will pain ar. aiyo. mine not pain de. is like very dry like that i think when i touch. not moist.</p>
