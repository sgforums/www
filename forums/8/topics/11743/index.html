an orange shirt today,Miho say to her as she watch through the binocular,he looked so handsome today,aa thought to herself.A woman suddenly appeared in his house,he hug her and kissed her.Suddenly,aa felt jealous,it could be her who is doing that and not the other person.Suddenly the phone rang,aa pick up the phone.Out came a familar voice,it tomomi,miho best friend.Hey I could see you right here,could you see me,tomomi said.A bit shocked,miho quickly put the binocular away for fear that her best friend might see it.Why are you coup up in the house,you need a boyfriend,why don't I introduce one to you tomorrow?tomomi remarked.miho is surprised and a bit relieved that her friend didn't realized what she is doing.She agreed to the meeting even though it really her best friend boyfriend that she loved.<br><br>Miho had not choice,the only way that she could be with him is through her dream,using a dreaming software simulation that could be as virtual as real life.A voice on tv caught her attention,a dream is created by a still conscious mind,it may be unreal but sometime the state of the mind could not establish what real and what not,thou making a dream looked real.<br><br>Miho heard that before,it two weeks ago that she bought the software from an underground hardware store,it illegal due to the fact that it never been fully tested out and could have side effect on the human mind.Miho didn't care,she wanted to be with him so much.<br><br>She put on the software,it looked like a headphone with a jack that link to a minidisc like machine,a disc is put in that could stimulate anything the mind desire,Miho took some sleeping pill and soon,she was in a deep trance.<br><br>She met up with tomomi the next day,she was shocked that her boyfriend is along with her,miho tried to hide the deep obsession that she might have with him.Here I bought you a handsome guy,you shouldn't be so lonely now,tomomi exclaimed.Miho tried to smile back but deep down she was in pain.<br><br>They went to a bar,Miho totally ignored the guy that tomomi introduced to her,all her eyes is fixed on how loving her best friend and her boyfriend is.Miho couldn't stand it any more she excused herself and went to the toilet,for no apparent reason,Miho took out her cosmetic and started dolling herself silly.She started to look like a vixen,she went back to the table and grab tomomi boyfriend by the hand and pull him away.Suddenly she flirting with him,hugging him and kissing him,much to the dismay of her best friend,Miho didn't care,finally she has done something that she alway wanted to do but never dared.<br><br>She woke up in a cold sweat,was it real,was it a dream,she had no idea.Soon,Miho is addicted to the the software,in the real world,she would alway be tomomi best friend and that she would never take her boyfriend away from her,but in her dream,miho was toally difference,she didn't give a damn how her friend felt,even when she said that she would kill her if she dare take her boyfriend away from her.miho didn't mind,as long as she could be with him,she didn't mind dieing.<br><br>One day,tomomi asked miho out,it seem that her boyfriend just got a job as security officer in a factory.Since the factory is closed that day,he asked the both of them out to play there.They play football there and enjoyed themselves totally.After that,they were all hot and thirsy so they played sissor paper stone,miho lost so she went to buy the drinks.After she came back,she looked for them but couldn't.She thought they might be playing a prank on her,suddenly there is a giggling sound coming out from a corner.Miho went to check out the sound.To her surprise,she found the both of them embracing and kissing each other.Miho is shook,she couldn't stand to see what is happening.Immediately she put on her dream software hoping it could ease her pain.<br><br>Tomomi bought back the drink and saw to her horror,miho is cubbling and kissing with her boyfriend.I love you,I love you so much,aa say to him,totally aware that tomomi is around just to spite her.What are you dreaming about,tomomi ask her.Miho woke up from her dream.I curious,what are you dreaming about,tomomi asked.Miho knew she couldn't tell her,she didn't want to lose her friendship.<br><br>That night,Miho used the dream software again,the factory scene was toally different,Miho was up at the rooftop top kissing and hugging tomomi's boyfriend,tomomi in a fit of rage,pushed her down the roof,miho woke up from the dream,shooked,tomomi was beside her.What happened.Tomomi exclaimed,Miho couldn't contain herself any more and told tomomi the whole truth.I would never do that to you,tomomi assured her,we are the best of friends.Miho was reliefed and the both of them hugged each other.<br><br>Tomomi took the headphone off miho head.Thank you,thank you for giving me my last good dream,Miho said to tomomi.Laying on a pool of blood.Miho in her last breath,wished the two forever happiness and then slowly closed her eyes.......<br>-------------------------<br><strong>Late Night story teller?</strong></div>
