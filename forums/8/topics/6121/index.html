            <div class='col-md body'>Not too sure abt the definitions. But somehow to me, seems like cute is often used on good looking girls that either look a bit chubby or on the shorter and more petite side whereas pretty tends to be used to tall, slim girls. I could be wrong. Anyway even being sure of the definitions will not save guys from being "kabish" cos it is up to the girl that we are saying in to and how they interprete not how we ourselves think it is. Maybe elegant and gorgeous is less open to debate.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes Dakar, we all know what kind of maniac you are.<br><br>Actually, I tend to agree with what Alex said. A doctor once told us that beauty (of the face anyway) is nothing but symmetry of the face.<br><br>Maybe cute refers to someone looking like a cartoon, where the features are more rounded and simplified, like a baby's. Whereas true beauty, you get more angles. Just compare things you see in comics and illustrations. A pig drawn in a cartoon way looks cute, but one drawn as an illustration looks uh, not pretty, but more elegant.<br><br>Not sure of my point anymore...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cute would probably mean (to me anyway) a face which is generally not so pretty(but still can see) but still has a certain amt of attractive qualities(big eyes, nice smile, round face, etc) that catches my eye. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think cuteness is sorta like an attitude, a way a girl carries herself.<br><br>Some girls may not be too good looking, but they sure can be pretty cute! (not in the phsyical aspect)<br><br>As for pretty, well I guess we all know wad that means juz simply chio. Of course we can have a girl who is both pretty and cute which would ultimately be the heavenly combination. Hmmmmm I think a good example would be a pretty jap girl in those jap school uniforms... pretty and cute!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Why?

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I cannot speak for the rest of the world, but here's my definition of looks in my own tiny, perverted universe. Kekekek  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Pretty : Saccharine sweet, gentle, demure<br><br>Beautiful : Babelicious, well carried, sophisticated<br><br>Gorgeous : Somewhere along the lines of beautiful, but with X-factor<br><br>Cute : Not really a look by itself, pretty gal can look cute and beautiful gal can look cute too. But generally make u go "SO CUUUTE" mean cute.<br><br>It's just the way the word sounds.. like I find it weird to call a gorgeous, flamboyant babe 'pretty'. More like beautiful.<br><br>But by dictionary standards, all the words prob mean the same thing???  :p<br><br>------------------<br>Is it cold in here, or is it just me?<br></div>
