It could be an attachment or a part-time IT field, it does not matter. Just get a feel of the industry, job scope and see whether it tallys with your interest and don't let some rumors or comments from your peers dictate what you really want to do with your life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Business is very general lor. U get engineering degree also can go into business sector. IT can also cross over to business easily.<br><br>In fact, everything other degree can cross into business easily. But it's a NO-NO for business degree to work engineering, IT cos it is not specialised mah.<br><br>Some of the bank hire engineering graduates to for their business posts cos their engineer technical background serves as a very good foundation for critical problem solving.</div>
