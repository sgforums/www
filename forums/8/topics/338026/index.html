              <p><br>sorry to hear that.    I know of this recipe which works effectively for many who are in your shoes.  That is:</p>
              <p>==&gt;  Black beans soaked with liquior (johnny walker and so on)</p>
              <p>Rinse the black beans and put it under the sun to dry it.    After that soak the black beans for as long as you can.   </p>
              <p>AFter when it is ready, just apply to your scalp.  </p>
              <p>So far this method works for those who try, I am not sure about your case, you can consider to give it a try.</p>

              <p>I'm 21 this year and I've been using Minoxidil which is available in pharmacies for a month now. It costs about $60 a bottle and the first bottle I bought has last me nearly one and a half months.</p>
              <p>I'm going through the first phase atm which is the shedding of hair on the affected areas, but it is a sign that the medicine is working.</p>
              <p>Anyways, the initial first two or three months will be the shedding of hair, which will make your balding worst but you need to keep using it.</p>
              <p>After the shedding phase, new baby hair will grow out of your scalp</p>
              <p>I hope this info was what you needed and maybe you'll proceed with the same treatment as I am, with the same good results, good luck :)</p>
