[quote]<br><br>Satan made himself fall. the term "fall" is being banished to earth. He rebelled against God and wanted to take the place of God, therefore he was banished to earth. In scripture, Satan is the chief of the fallen angels (Matthew 12:24). It is a singular concept, Satan leading a whole army of devils. These are fallen angels (2 Peter 2:4; Jude 6), therefore, like man, they were created beings. The killing part ...im not sure about crusades.<br><br>[quote]<br><strong>god isnt all good and benevolent cause god, like us, is human, seeing as how we can make mistakes, we can only assume he can make mistakes cause he made us in his image. which is kinda sick.</strong></div></blockquote><strong>Im more sick to see that you feel sick. It's your human point of view of God. He is holy and no one can deny that. He made us in His image. (strictly my point of view, im not sure if im wrong or not) I think that human beings were not sinful at all and did not make mistakes until Eve fell for the trap that satan had set. Why you link human beings' mistakes to God? Its human being that has sinned.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">and god is supposed to be all forgiving but...well...he loves you, but he'll send you to hell anyway if you disobey him. regardless of whether or not you've repented.</div></blockquote>God IS forgiving.<br>Romans 9:14-15<br>What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all! For he says to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion."<br><br>Repent sincerely and God will forgive you. Obey him if you do not want to go to hell then! Since you know that the consequences of disobedience is hell, obey Him then. It's like a teenager rebelling against his parents, knowing that the parents would be upset and angry, yet purposely do something wrong.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">  if killing is a bad thing, den do the ppl who kill in god's name [which ever alias he's using ] do they go to hell to?</div></blockquote>I cant answer your question, because i don't know, im not God. He's forever fair and justified in judging human beings. Those who repented sincerely to Him and believed in Him... i think they will be saved. God will judge them.</strong></div>
