              <p>John Titor: a Time Traveller From The Year 2036? <br> <br> <br> <br> For some worldly-wise Internet users, the story of John Titor is
              nothing new, although there are still numerous people who have yet to
              come across this online curiosity which is steadily gaining status as
              an urban legend. In the five years since his absence John Titor has
              spawned a book, a theatre performance and rumours of a movie, as well
              as plenty of webpages attempting to prove or disprove his claims to be
              a time-traveller visiting us from the near future.<br> <br> Starting on 2 November, 2000 and continuing for a period of about five
              months, someone calling themselves Timetravel_0 began posting to a
              number of online time travel-related message boards claiming to be a
              time-traveller from the year 2036. The first websites Timetravel_0
              posted to include the Art Bell site1 and the Time Travel Institute
              site. After a while Timetravel_0 changed his name to John Titor,
              although this apparently was not his real name.<br> <br> Why Was He Here?<br> <br> Titor said he had travelled back in time because he was a soldier from
              the year 2036 who was recruited to a government time travel project. He
              had initially been sent back to 1975 to retrieve an IBM 5100 portable
              computer which was needed to translate between some legacy IBM systems
              and UNIX. He claimed the IBM 5100 was able to do this due to certain
              in-built functions that were not documented when it was manufactured.
              When Titor left our timeline, some IBM engineers apparently came
              forward to verify his claims about the IBM 5100. After collecting the
              IBM 5100 Titor then travelled to the year 2000 because, he said, he
              wanted to visit his family and his younger self, and to see the effects
              of the Millennium Bug. There is a story that Titor sent faxes to the
              Art Bell site in 1998 saying the Millennium Bug would cause chaos, but
              when asked on the bulletin boards why this had not happened he said he
              had intervened to prevent it.<br> <br> During his stay in 2000/2001 Titor made it clear his objective was not
              to convince anyone he was a genuine time-traveller, rather he was
              simply posting messages to gauge people's responses to meeting someone
              from their future. He was very willing to hold question and answer
              sessions as well as give information on his time machine, share his
              perspective on our present world, and to make a number of predictions
              about the future, including how our present society will end in 2015 in
              a brief but devastating global nuclear war. He also posted a number of
              pictures of his time machine and scans from a technical manual showing
              its schematics. Possibly one of the most notable (if poorer quality)
              pictures he posted showed the time machine warping the light from a
              laser pen due to its 'gravity displacement'. For these reasons, as well
              as any lack of gain or profit he could make from his assertions, some
              people have been willing to accept Titor as a genuine time-traveller.<br> <br> On 24th March, 2001 Titor said he was going to return to his own time
              and, in spite of a number of obvious hoaxers, has not been heard of
              since. It is claimed there is a video showing Titor returning to his
              own time although it has not yet made its way onto the Internet.<br> <br> Titor's time machine<br> <br> Titor described his time machine as a 'C204 time distortion gravity
              displacement machine' built by General Electrics in 2034. It weighed
              approximately 500 pounds and was transported in a 1966 Chevrolet
              Corvette Convertible, which also acted as Titor's vessel as he
              travelled through time. The vehicle did not move through space but
              remained stationary with the engine switched off. Some time later the
              time machine was removed from the Corvette and placed in a 1987 four
              wheel drive truck and the Corvette was sold, which has led to
              speculation about where it may now be and who bought it.<br> <br> According to Titor there were six main components to his time machine:<br> <br> Two magnetic housing units for dual micro singularities<br> An electron injection manifold to alter mass and gravity micro singularities<br> A cooling and X-ray venting system<br> Gravity sensors, or a variable gravity lock (VGL)<br> Four main caesium clocks<br> Three main computer units<br> In his descriptions Titor explained that his time machine was a
              stationary mass, temporal displacement unit powered by 'two top-spin,
              dual positive singularities', producing a 'standard off-set Tipler
              sinusoid2'. Essentially, the time machine was based on two rotating
              micro singularities operating similarly to a single ring singularity
              spinning at high speed. The mass and gravitational pull of this micro
              singularity was manipulated by injecting electrons onto its surface,
              replicating the effects of a Kerr-Newman black hole, thus (it would
              seem) enabling time travel.<br> <br> After Titor fed coordinates into his time machine there would be a
              'ramp up' period while an audible alarm sounded as well as a flashing
              light, followed by a countdown. Titor would then feel the pull of up to
              2Gs due to the gravity generated by the machine, and the vehicle would
              appear to speed up as light was bent around it. Except for supplies of
              compressed air, the only source of oxygen would be an air pocket
              trapped around the vehicle. Titor estimated the speed of travel at
              around ten years per hour, and the time machine's accuracy of travel at
              up to sixty years, although he said this was expected to be improved
              upon by researchers in his own time.<br> <br> According to Titor the nature of time travel and what can be expected
              is explained through the Everett-Wheeler model of quantum physics, or
              as it is sometimes called, the Many Worlds Theory3, which Titor stated
              had been proved to be correct. Simplistically, this means that every
              event that can have more than one outcome will result in every possible
              outcome, and each possibility is the origin point of a new parallel
              universe, or world line. The relevance of this for time travel Titor
              explained, is that the traveller does not enter their own past because
              their presence would cause changes which in turn would create an
              ever-expanding set of world lines. Instead the time traveller enters a
              closely related world line where their presence would not cause this
              incalculable level of world lines.<br> <br> Titor's predictions<br> <br> Most of what Titor has said of events between 2000 and 2036 centre on a
              third World War followed by two decades of ongoing recuperation.
              According to Titor, the period of conflict begins at the time of the
              American Presidential elections of 2004/5 when the seeds for a second
              American civil war are germinated. The nature of the conflict is
              described as civil unrest brought on by intrusive police-state tactics,
              which leads to an increasing number of Waco or Ruby Ridge-type events,
              peaking at approximately one per week. Eventually urban and rural areas
              are openly pitched against each other. Titor claimed that at the age of
              thirteen he had joined a shotgun militia to fight on the side of the
              rural army. By 2008 it is popularly realised the pre-civil war
              conditions that existed within America are lost for good.<br> <br> By 2015 the civil war is effectively ended when Russia begins a series
              of nuclear strikes on most major American cities therefore eliminating
              the federal government. Most major urban areas worldwide are also badly
              affected through a tit-for-tat series of nuclear strikes, with a death
              count of approximately three billion people. The areas worst affected
              are Europe, Africa and Australia.<br> <br> By 2036 the world has changed considerably. America is now made up of
              five states with Nebraska as the capital and consists of decentralised,
              tightly-knit rural communities. There is a greater emphasis on
              religion, personal interaction (as opposed to mass media), as well as
              self-sufficiency with people expected to work for part of the day in
              the fields to produce food. Water is still contaminated with
              radioactivity and needs to be filtered. In spite of the war and the
              efforts to construct this new society from the remains of the old,
              technology does not seem to be too badly affected. Titor mentioned a
              system of rapid rail travel between cities, space travel, genetic
              engineering and of course time travel.<br> <br> Besides the American civil conflict and a third World War Titor made a number of other significant predictions:<br> <br> America will wage war on Iraq, claiming Iraq has nuclear weapons. Titor
              made this statement years before a war with Iraq was considered. He
              also claimed no weapons of mass destruction would be found.<br> <br> War will erupt between Israel and its Arab neighbours, and weapons of mass destruction will be used.<br> <br> Korea, Taiwan and Japan will be annexed by China as the West becomes unstable.<br> <br> In the early 2000's CERN will lay the foundations for time travel. In
              the autumn of 2001 after Titor had left, CERN released a statement
              indicating the creation of mini black holes was possible.<br> <br> Mad cow disease will be a health issue in America but it will be under-played.<br> <br> Genetically modified food will be used to produce hybrid seeds that will have detrimental effects on the population's health.<br> <br> Titor made a number of statements about constitutional and civil rights
              in America. He also said the American government will assume its
              citizens will prefer security over certain personal freedoms.<br> <br> The future will judge the present harshly.<br> <br> Since the Many Worlds Theory is, according to Titor, accurate, this has
              implications for Titor's claim to be a time-traveller and how his
              predictions for our future can be evaluated. If Titor is to be believed
              we need to accept he is visiting from another closely-related time line
              with its subtle differences from our own. Consequently we can expect
              some of his predictions for the future to be false for us, but since
              according to Titor there is only a two per cent discrepancy between the
              two timelines, there is a good possibility some of his predictions will
              be fulfilled. Therefore, as the time approaches for each of his
              predictions to occur, eventually the probability of Titor’s claim that
              he is a time traveller will increase either towards being true or
              towards being false, depending on whether the prediction is fulfilled.<br> <br> The story of John Titor has been circulating on the Internet for almost
              five years, with some people attempting to provide proof this is simply
              a prolonged hoax, while others put forward arguments and evidence to
              support Titor's claim to be a time-traveller from the year 2036. The
              arguments against Titor are, however, quite damning. For instance, it
              has been demonstrated that the picture showing the laser light being
              bent was faked, and Titor's explanation of using mini black holes to
              time travel is scientifically impossible. Also, if Titor had intervened
              as he said to prevent the disasters caused by the Millennium Bug, then
              by his own explanation of the Many Worlds Theory of quantum mechanics,
              our world line would have diverged radically from his own4. This would
              mean his predictions would be all but irrelevant for our world line5.
              More fundamentally, it is a given of time travel theory6 that a time
              machine cannot travel beyond the date it was built. Therefore, if Titor
              began time-travelling in 2036 he could not have travelled any further
              back than 2034, since according to him the time machine was first
              constructed on this date.<br> <br> For those who want to discover the truth for themselves there are a
              number of websites with archives of Titor's messageboard postings.
              Perhaps one of the best of these archives is the Abovetopsecret
              website. If you scratch around the Internet you will come across more
              and more bits of information about John Titor and you will quickly be
              able to decide for yourself whether there is any substance to his
              claims to be a time-traveller. In the final analysis, however, perhaps
              the most fascinating aspect of the story of John Titor is the fact that
              this phenomenon, which could so easily have been ignored, has engaged
              so many people for so long. The story is recounted and discussed on
              many websites and people have expended a lot of time and energy in
              support for or against Titor's claims. It is also remarkable for a
              story of this nature to span so many media forms, ranging from a book
              to a ballet!<br> <br> <br> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br> 1 The Art Bell website is no longer available.<br> 2 A Tipler Sinusoid is basically a localised Kerr Field, or put more
              simply a mini black hole. Cutting through the rhetoric, Titor's time
              machine operates by manipulating a mini black hole. Whether this is
              possible has been open to debate.<br> 3 The Many Worlds Theory has become integrated into what is known as
              M-theory, although this is no clear indication that Titor's statement
              that the Many Worlds Theory is correct can be relied upon. Since
              Titor's visit theories other than the Many Worlds Theory have been
              proposed to avoid such things as the grandfather paradox of time travel.<br> 4 The only way Titor could know the Millennium Bug would cause chaos
              would be if he had experienced it in his own timeline. Therefore, by
              preventing this disaster from occurring in our timeline means events
              here have altered considerably from his own timeline. The two world
              lines have thereby become significantly different.<br> 5 Our world line would also have diverged more than the two per cent
              Titor said was acceptable for him to time travel reliably between it
              and his own world line.<br> 6 Respected scientists do study the subject since Einstein's Theory of Relativity allows for time travel.</p>
