            <div class='col-md body'>ataraxia, you sure sounds like a hot babe.. but you are kinda too young for me.. hee.<br>Anyway, there is a philosophy about difference in age of a couple. When a guy is in his mid 20s, a girl who is about 15 to 18 seems too young for him (age gap is about 7 or 8 years kinda thing).. but when the girl is 22 to 24 and the guy is in his early 30s, it's conceived to be acceptable. Perhaps it just apply to me. Cheers!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oooooh! The board is finally up and running again! am i one of the first to realise it's back up? talk abt not having a life! All right now.....hands up all of you who suffered  withdrawal symptoms when the board was down!<br><br>How many of you wondered when it'd be working again? How many of you started getting sweaty palms and stared blankly at the screen, wondering what to do with your life? Come on now....you can tell me....<br>hmmmmm?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>As for me, I was so traumatized I had to go see my family GP. He told me I was displaying classic signs of<br>postus interruptus. Said I should take 2 panadols and log-on again in the morning....<br><br>Anywayz, thot this might be a good indication of how we're all addicted to this board!<br><br>Top 10 signs you're addicted to this bulletin board:<br><br>10. You think about this bulletin board ALL the time.<br><br>9. When you log-on to the internet, this is the first place you head to.<br><br>8. You absolutely have to, MUST, regardless of exams, assignments, bf/gf, work deadlines or sufficient sleep, log-on to this bulletin board at LEAST 2 times a day.<br><br>7. When you realised the board was under maintenance you were edgy, impatient, irritable, scolded your dog and now have shorter fingernails.<br><br>6. You have more friends here than you do in real life.<br><br>5. You are actually beginning to know the personalities and characters of some of the board members, even tho you've never met them before.<br><br>4. You actually care about what people on this bulletin board think about you as a person.<br><br>3. You listen more to the advice of the people here than you do to your own parents.<br><br>2. Between your last posting and your next one, life has had no meaning.<br><br>And the number #1 sign you're addicted to this bulletin board.......<br>(*drum-roll please*)..........<br><br>1. You're now a senior member! Yay!<br><br>Haha! If any of you recognised yourselves in more than 5 of the categories listed above, congratulations! You've qualified for the prestigious annual "Get-a-Life" Awards to be handed out year-end. The prize includes, amongst other things, a one-year suspension of your internet account, applicable world-wide. What's that? How do I win myself one of those GAL Awards? Well, just keep doing more of the same man! More of the same!<br><br>Do you think maybe there should be a surgeon-general's warning about the effects of this forum? How, pray tell me, is this addiction any different from nicotine, alcohol or drug dependence? Hehe!<br><br>Well go ahead and feed your addiction then you forum buffs you! post away! Haha!<br><br>Ataraxia - yeah, I'd like to be there too on the 20th, but I really can't. anywayz, you wouldn't be missing much. I'm nothing at all to behold. Maybe it's better sometimes just to keep the intrigue and the mystique....<br>you think? Reality is often soooo sobering! Haha! But you go ahead and have fun okay?<br>maybe you could tell me abt how it went<br>and abt all the new frens you've made.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>p.s: actually the changes to the board have taken some of the sting out of the punch-line. notice u senior members are now simply known as "members". while we're still considerd "junior members". wonder what comes after "member"? "senior member"? "forum guru"? "bulletin board stalker"?<br><br></div>
