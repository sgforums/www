            <div class='col-md body'>I don't really blame Spy for feeling the way he felt. I too feels Ataraxia is extremely attractive based on her replies in all the forum. She seems to be the gal of every guy's dreams irregardless of her age. I guess every guys wants a gf who is understanding and independent with her thoughts. Wouldn't you?? I know I would but that doesn't mean that I should go running after her. I believe in getting to know each other as friends first and find out if we are compatiable. I think this was Spy intention. Unless Spy himself say he wants to woo Ataraxia and not wanting to know her as a friend only......then it is up to Ataraxia to decide whether she still wants to be his friend or not. I understand the protective nature of guys but this is her choice and I believe that she knows more than alot of guys about relationship and what she wants based on her replies. Ataraxia, correct me if I am wrong.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>eh spy - not making fun of your name lah!<br>in fact i think it's a good name. but since ur so bold and daring as to ask ataraxia out in front of all of us, why not change ur name instead to dare-rick? get it?<br>dare-rick...okay, okay i noe it's corny but i just couldn't help myself....<br><br>but what i do want to make fun of tho is ur nick - spy.<br>why?<br><br>for the following reasons:<br><br>A real spy (like 007, the suave and cool james bond) would never:<br><br>1. leave traces of his real identity the way you have<br><br>2. hit on a girl on a bulletin board<br><br>3. hit on a girl on a bulletin board and then get rejected.<br><br>4. even if he did get rejected, he wouldn't say "Wha sian. No hope for me? :-(<br>sniff sniff..."<br><br>5. he wouldn't be suan-ed by everyone for getting rejected because we all know bond can always get another girl<br><br>6. and most importantly, a real spy does not announce to the whole world that he is actually a spy, like you have. notice that when james bond pulls the damsel-in-distress to safety under a hail of bullets and gunfire from international terrorists, and the grateful girl asks, "who are you?", the reply is NEVER "I'm a spy".<br><br>Rather, it is the cool, "i'm bond, james bond". So you should really take your cue from brosnan (and even roger moore and sean connery before him....they never say "I'm a spy! nice to meet you!".)<br><br>okay, okay, i'm thru making fun....hehe!<br>it really is a pity ur not going on the 20th tho. cuz the ppl will prob be mobbing ataraxia and that is precisely when we need a hero like you....u can grab the distressed ataraxia from the adoring crowd of mobsters and run with her across the shopping mall and down the streets with the mobsters in hot pursuit.....taking pictures and all....and when u finally pull her behind that angsana tree along orchard road to hide her from the trigger-happy mobsters, and bond girl ataraxia asks, "who are you?", you can proudly, if somewhat nonchalantly, reply, "My name is Rick. Dare-rick!"<br><br>maybe then she'll finally agree to be your gf. hehe!<br><br>cheers man!<br><br>[This message has been edited by fadingstar (edited 14 November 1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmmm.....actually it's quite true, ataraxia. humour at the expense of others isn't really the best kind of humour.<br>but i was just practising my a.s.s. (art of sustained suan-ning). quite glad that you actually liked my a.s.s. (oooh....in poor taste! haha! but i hope you wouldn't mind! it's all in good fun anywayz, no?). i think tho that spy has handled all this in a rather good spirit!<br>kudos to you, bond boy!<br><br>and, erm, spy - i see ur at it again....<br>i like your never-say-die attitude man!<br>whatever it is, i don't think your number is 007.<br><br>as for the compliments, ataraxia, i'm quite sure i'll still feel the same way after the 20th, cuz i can't make it on the 20th. so i'll always remember you the way i do now. what can i say? you're a cool babe in the making, ataraxia! ("what?", screams ataraxia, "in the making only? you mean i'm not cool now?" well, of course you are, dear. but you know what they say about fine wine. it can only get better with time....)<br><br>but then see what you've done, ataraxia? you've made all your hot-blooded male admirers go green with envy cuz you've actually named your preferred forum mates - 4 of them to be precise, like maybe....<br>the 4 musketeers? ataraxia has spoken. (DOH! DOH! DOH! DOH! - that's the reaction from all the guys in the forum who read each of the 4 nicks in turn, and realised it was not theirs.)<br><br>i think you may just have broken their hearts....awwwww!!! but then cool babes do break hearts. that's just what they do....so u see? you're rite on course for babedom!<br>hmmmm.....but i see they're not too affected by it tho....in the great tradition of s'pore-style civic-mindedness, i see that a queue is forming. haha! so i guess they're okay!<br><br>so there we have it. your fairy-tale story....your 4 musketeers. with you as lady ataraxia! they'll be offering you good protection on the 20th. so you have nothing at all to fear! i mean who needs Bond when you have the 4 musketeers, rite?<br>haha!<br><br>take care!<br><br>afterthought: have you ever considered starting your own fan club? or maybe run for politics? ataraxia - s'pore's youngest female MP! with all the support you're getting, i think you'll prob get more votes than some opposition party members here do!<br>hehe! as you can see, this is appropriately termed an "afterthought" - meaning it came about after all real thinking had ceased! haha!<br><br></div>
