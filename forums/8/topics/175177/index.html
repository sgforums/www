            <div class='col-md body'>ORLANDO, Fla. -- A Sanford mother says she will never be able to hold her newborn because an Orlando hospital performed a life-altering surgery and, she claims, the hospital refuses to explain why they left her as a multiple amputee.<br><br>The woman filed a complaint against Orlando Regional Healthcare Systems, she said, because they won't tell her exactly what happened. The hospital maintains the woman wants to know information that would violate other patients' rights.<br><br>Claudia Mejia gave birth eight and a half months ago at Orlando Regional South Seminole. She was transported to Orlando Regional Medical Center in Orlando where her arms and legs were amputated. She was told she had streptococcus, a flesh eating bacteria, and toxic shock syndrome, but no further explanation was given.<br><br>The hospital, in a letter, wrote that if she wanted to find out exactly what happened, she would have to sue them.<br><br>"I want to know what happened. I went to deliver my baby and I came out like this," Mejia said.<br><br>Mejia said after she gave birth to Mathew last spring, she was kept in the hospital with complications. Twelve days after giving birth at Orlando Regional South Seminole hospital, she was transported to Orlando Regional Medical Center where she became a quadruple amputee. Now she can not care for or hold her baby.<br><br>"Yeah, I want to pick him up. He wants me to pick him up. I can't. I want to, but I can't," she said. "Woke up from surgery and I had no arms and no legs. No one told me anything. My arms and legs were just gone."

            <div class='col-md body'>Streptococcous... hmm, one group of harmful bacteria, but not all are bad.<br><br>I really suspect that they operated on the wrong woman. That's because streptococcus bacteria infections are serious, and usually there are symptoms if you have a streptoccous infection. From what I know, they don't amputate people who have streptococcous infection, rather antibiotics are given to them.<br><br>Toxic shock syndrome... read it somewhere, can't remember it liao. But I remember that book never says about amputation.... which really shows they probably operated on the wrong woman. If I never remember wrongly, related to streptococcous infections also.<br><br>Anyway, what's done cannot be undone. The woman is plain unlucky....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

But the hospital should have disclosed what happened.<br>Or maybe the hospital already explained what happened (informed that she had had streptococcus), but it is difficult for her to accept.</div>
