            <div class='col-md body'>In my observations of the opposite sex at work, I have come to the conclusion that most girl's lives revolve around their own physicality and the physicality of those around them<br><br>Some examples of their behavior:<br><br>-All of these girls, whether attractive or not, consistently look for less attractive girls to talk to while they are working. The average looking ones bad-mouth the really hot ones. The average looking girls look for less-attractive girls to surround themselves with so that they can feel like the hottest in the bunch. Often the average looking ones don't want to work with the hot ones, either. The super hot ones don't care, because they know they are hotter than anyone else anyway. They talk to the less than average ones in a condescending way, like they were slow-witted or something. They always say, "She's a nice girl" with a fake smile or something to that extent. It's all a superficial game.<br><br>-They constantly look at girls passing by. If she's hotter than her, she's automatically a "s}ut," "trying too hard," or "wearing too much makeup." If a really hot girl approaches , the girls give her dirty looks. God forbid if a girl has large br3asts and is showing off her cleavage. The daggers come immediately out. "Oh, she's just drawing attention from her ugly face," they'll say. Of course the girl isn't ugly at all. It seems they can't stand to bear it when an attractive girl is anywhere near them in the same vicinity.<br><br>-Finally, most of these girls  Often the people they likes are a$$-backward morons. I just don't get it.<br><br>Girls (average or hot) are all consumed by the superficial, and if this is true we are all consequently f#cked. It's sad, really.They usually are in this phase from the age of 18-25.That's life, fellas. Don't kid yourselves with romance, thoughts of higher understanding, and a girl who loves you for you. It's all bullsh1t fed to us by the creators of false hope- the religions and losers. Love is defined by "how much do you earn per year and will you be able to finance my shopping addiction?" If you want a hot girl to settle down with and you've no looks , get money. That's that. If you don't, you have no chance of happiness with a woman. Sure, you can be happy on your own, but what fun is that in the long run?</div>
