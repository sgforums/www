            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><br>I had a salesman who tried to cheat me into buying a digital camera for $100 more than what other shops offer. He showed me a brochure which was dated August 25, 2004 which of course had the prize even higher then compared to now which is already in the year 2005. I bought that camera and then went to other shops asking for their prize of the model and to my shock and horror, they all sell more than a hundred bucks cheaper! I stomped back to the shop and demand an explanation and he got defensive by showing a plastic display of their <strong>"Star Retailer" award cert</strong> and daring me to go to a small claims court or complain to the tourism board (?!!). I refused to leave until I feel my money was well justified and he finally settled for an exchange to the original dgcam which I had wanted, the Panasonic Lumix FX7. The overprized camera was Casio Exilim Z40. Other shops sell Z40 for $550 incl of GST. That salesman sold z40 for $650 and Pana for $661 inclusive of GST. So I had to top up $11 which I gladly pay. Unfortunately, I was restless and couldn't wait to get out of the shop that I didn't notice that he packed the camera which was on the display into my box! How do I know? Coz the one on display has got a sticker on the bottom, a new set doesn't. I notice traces of the sticky side of the sticker at the bottom when I got home. I also realised that the standard packaged 16mb SD card wasn't included! I am still fuming over this. When I buy a 1st hand camera, I expect a new set, not one which has been touched and held by many hands!<br><br>When I was about to go with my FX7 camera, there were 2 indian guys who were there after me when I bought the Casio camera. They came back soon after and I asked them why, is it because they're also unhappy with their newly bought camera. They said they wanted to buy another camera and even asked me if the salesman agreed to lower the prize. I shook my head and asked them if they've asked other shop coz who knows they sell it cheaper and then suddenly that salesman raised his voice telling not to disturb his customers or else he'd sue me! A customer has his own right at deriving his own judgement. The two indian guys knew my "case" with the shop since they were still there when I went back to the shop and left and thencame back shortly after. I was not even badmouthing the shop! The salesman didn't even give me my receipt till my friend who was with me pestered him for it and wouldn't leave till we get it. He printed the receipt, signed it and shove it at us! So rude. Come to think of it, I don't think the "Star Retailer" cert is real. It was way too simple and unimpressive for a certificate. It might be there to mislead consumers instead. And they use backdated brochures when the prices are more expensive then compared to now.<br><br>Anyway, I've already sent a complaint email to CASE and STB. I searched for a website giving out the "Star Retailer" award but there's none and I saw this forum page instead whose member also had the same prob as me. I think I<br>m gona send a complain to the Sim Lim management as well.</div>
