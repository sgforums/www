My search culminated with Nila, who not just resembles Simran but also has enough acting credentials," he says.<br>On asked what the movie is all about. Suryah without elaborating says, "it is an account of events that youngsters come across in their daily life. It has been narrated in an entertaining way with enough commercial mix".<br><br>The movie is all set for a release this August 15.</div>

The composer ARR always is ahead of what the current India music directors are. They are only recently beginning to catch up with what ARR did did 7-8 years ago. When his music first appeared somewher ein 1991, some comments<br>were passed, the songs are too techy and its noisy and<br>etc but now most of the India music directors are begining to follow that trend.</div>

I am in the music field and based on Malaysia and let me tell u , this famous Indian composer does stuff which is ahead of time and  gets applauses even from the non-indian people involved in music work and DJ stuff.<br><br>I was doing a course on music production, some time ago<br>and all of us had to take one of their favorite songs for dissection<br>and rest of the class would analyse the song and we would have a<br>discussion on the production elements. Needless to say, my choice was<br>"Chandralekha" ( a 1994 AR composed film soundtrack, many consider it his best film work to date).<br><br>After discussing the plausible techniques, every one<br>wanted to know who the composer was, and the year of composition. It<br>was kind of difficult for my classmates (none of them are familiar<br>with Indian film industry and its modern evolution) to believe that this song was done in early 90's, just when fusion electronic dance production was just beginning to take<br>shape. It was interesting to see how the overall texture of the song<br>was enhanced by clever use of panning and sound scheme, even on percussion tracks to make up for the limits of technology at the time.  Now AR has a state of the art studio and one the best of its kind in Asia.<br>Ofc ourse now, few of them have almost all ARR CD's and follow his<br>albums more closely even though they don't understand a word (other<br>than the english words added to the soup for rythmic purposes).<br><br>Cheers</div>
