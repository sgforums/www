            <div class='col-md body'>hi Administrators again,<br><br>i thought what remained would contain most of the earlier posts, however, i was wrong. i am selfish and i hope that one of you can fix the bug and bring the earlier posts back or if not, please extend an explanation as to why it was deleted from the main menu and that it lost 6 of its pages, most of it containing my posts to pacman, Revey and others. they may not mean anything to you but those were records of my life and my flirting, it has special signifiance for me. i don't know about the rest but i believe that whoever contributed to this thread would be distressed that it's just gone like that. and for your information, this is the second time that it has happened.<br><br>would really appreciate an explanation but better still, just revive those missing pages for me.<br><br>thank you very much.</div>
