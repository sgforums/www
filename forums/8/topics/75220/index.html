It will not be long before this becomes a global issue, and by then, will Singapore be ready to stand by their decision?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>Already many groups in Singapore are distaning themselves from each other because of these. (for example; the Government's point of view on accepting these people (homosexuals) as a very real part of Singaporeans, and the religious factions like Christianity, Catholism and Islam.)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>If this matter is not dealt with quickly, I believe, this can be a very major civil problem.</span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Sources : The Straits Times, The GLB Network : www.Fridae.com</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi<br>i dun think that this issue is going to pose as grave a problem as u put it... however i do believe that whatever stand Spore takes, it is going to affect our society drastically.<br>Personally i feel that it is likely that Spore would become more and more open regarding such issues. The government had done their part in encouraging people to not duscriminate against these people ( although there's more room for improvement) and i think that more people are aware that these homosexuals /bisexuals are not much different from us and they have every freedom and right to decide their own gender. In the past alomost everyone discriminate against these group of people, but now i think the trend is changing, albeit gradually.</div>
