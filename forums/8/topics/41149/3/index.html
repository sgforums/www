            <div class='col-md body'>God Almighty is wise and He knows above all things that MONEY will be one area of temptation that humans will fall to. Thats the reason why He gave so many warnings on MONEY in His Words. Heed His words and the Truth will set us free.<br><br>Matthew 6:24<br>"No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money.<br><br>Acts 5:3-4<br>Then Peter said, "Ananias, how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land?  Didn't it belong to you before it was sold? And after it was sold, wasn't the money at your disposal? What made you think of doing such a thing? You have not lied to men but to God."<br><br>Acts 8:20<br>Peter answered: "May your money perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money!<br><br>Hebrews 13:5<br>Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, "Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.<br><br>1 Peter 5:2<br>Be shepherds of God's flock that is under your care, serving as overseersÂ–not because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not greedy for money, but eager to serve;<br><br>Especially the last verse on 1 Peter 5:2, it is written especially for leaders in churches and praise to our God that He is so wise to know that leaders will be tempted in this area.

Whatever he has done, the priest has somehow one way or another helped people in the past. Not all person can say that he is 'clean'. Just because his dirty linen is being washed in public, you guys are ready to question.<br><br>Why not just leave him alone? You think he is feeling any good? think for his family too. The most important values is to forgive and let it rest and be ready to accept him again to show the poor guy some love. Life don't end because of poor judgement or mistakes. Just show him care and concern and he will learn his mistakes and not do it again.  </span></div>

However, as the matter is sub judice we cannot comment on the charges. We let the law take its course.<br>We do not know the circumstances under which the transfers of funds were made or the reasons why Fr Kang made those transfers. Until investigations are completed and the full details made known, we are unable to comment on how he was able to transfer large amounts of money.<br><br>The current measures in place are that all parishes have to submit monthly statements of receipts and payments, bank statements and bank reconciliation to the Finance Department for checking. Discrepancies are taken up with the parishes concerned immediately.<br><br>However, we will be making a review of our accounting system with the assistance of consultants. Should there be any weaknesses in the present system, corrective measures will be taken.<br><br>If Fr Kang is convicted, he cannot hold a post of responsibility such as Parish Priest. Meanwhile, he will be told to take leave of absence until the conclusion of his trial.<br><br>Archbishop Nicholas Chia<br><br></div>
