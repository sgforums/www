            <div class='col-md body'>Men always fall into temptation. Whether you are pastors, priests, a teacher, a lawyer, politician, student, father or mother. Everyone does.<br><br>It is sad to see a priest who preaches about God falling into sin but lets not be quick to condemn him. I  guess if through this incident, he is able to repent and able to see the Truth, the Truth will set him free. "Let the one without sin cast the first stone" as what Jesus said in John 8:7.<br><br>Even people close to Jesus sin. Judas betrayed Jesus for money. Peter denied Jesus 3 times. But thdifference between Peter and Judas is that after Judas sin, he felt so ashame that he committed suicide but Peter was so ashamed that wept  and repented. Everyone sin but the greatness of God is that He always is gracious. He disciplines His children like a Father would but  as a Father, He also longs for His children to return to Him again. And I am sure like in 1 John 1:9 that if the priest is truly repentant, God will forgive Him and though he may not escape imprisionment, the forgiveness of God will bring forth peace to Him.</div>

Their families do.<br><br>I believe when the people said that "He's only human", you take it into context that they are saying "Oh come on, lay off him, he is only human." But i think what they are really saying is a resignation to the fact that whoever and wherever you are, you are really just a flesh and blood human.<br><br>It is all fair. When such news come out, there would probably be 2 kinds of people. One kind would say "Oh give the pastor a chance. He's a good man, let him go." Another would say "Hey, this guy is a respected pastor. GIve it to him man! How dare he do such a thing!" As I can see, you belong to the 2nd kind. Dun get me wrong, there is nothing with these 2 groups of people. Except that the views are taken to the extreme. Think about it, the news became so big because he is a well-respected pastor, thats why he is open to either extreme condemnations or extreme sympathy. Think again, there are many other criminals cheating money which are not reported. These criminals do not get any widespread sympathy but at the same time, he did not get any widespread comdemnation too. It is all fair. Both are humans, pastor or not, thief or not, low class or not, rich or not. Cheating pple of $10 or cheating pple of $100,000 is still cheating, more people may be harmed, but it is still cheating.<br><br>We cant go to a cheater and say "Hey you are better because you are only a road sweeper but that pastor cheater is a beast because he is a respected pastor." But neither can you say, "Hey road sweeper cheater, you are less human than that pastor because you are a road sweeper."  It just does not work that way.<br><br>I am saying we do not take things to the extreme.

Their families do.<br><br>I believe when the people said that "He's only human", you take it into context that they are saying "Oh come on, lay off him, he is only human." But i think what they are really saying is a resignation to the fact that whoever and wherever you are, you are really just a flesh and blood human.<br><br>It is all fair. When such news come out, there would probably be 2 kinds of people. One kind would say "Oh give the pastor a chance. He's a good man, let him go." Another would say "Hey, this guy is a respected pastor. GIve it to him man! How dare he do such a thing!" As I can see, you belong to the 2nd kind. Dun get me wrong, there is nothing with these 2 groups of people. Except that the views are taken to the extreme. Think about it, the news became so big because he is a well-respected pastor, thats why he is open to either extreme condemnations or extreme sympathy. Think again, there are many other criminals cheating money which are not reported. These criminals do not get any widespread sympathy but at the same time, he did not get any widespread comdemnation too. It is all fair. Both are humans, pastor or not, thief or not, low class or not, rich or not. Cheating pple of $10 or cheating pple of $100,000 is still cheating, more people may be harmed, but it is still cheating.<br><br>We cant go to a cheater and say "Hey you are better because you are only a road sweeper but that pastor cheater is a beast because he is a respected pastor."

True, it is still cheating no matter what.  So... if one of our esteemed ministers in the governement were caught for the same act, should he receive a bigger punishment?  I guess when I said triple whammy it meant a bigger punishment for having misled people, for breaking people's trust in them.  No one ever trusted a thief right from the beginning.  For example, let's say our Finance Minister was caught siphoning funds to his personal accounts, should he get a bigger punishment?  Hope you know what I'm driving at.  It's just like how military officers should get higher levels of punishment for ordering their men for commiting military crimes.  The higher you are in any hierarchy, the higher the responsibility.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>

Not disagreeing with you because I'm a Buddhist, and we do teach about compassion and stuff.  Literally the same things as you said.  But you know me (after having debated with me before), I'm always questioning.<br><br>I agree with you that all wrong-doers should be treated the same  -that they should be punished.  Guess 'cause I was raised in the uniform that gave me the view that you must pay a higher price the higher you go.  Forgiveness and compassion are definitely forthcoming but a person must do the time to show his penance.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>

Y'know, as in 'I put my faith in you for this project'?  We defined it as the same.  Just highlighting that so that we don't misunderstand eah other.  So would this breach in trust between one pastor and many of his followers have a domino effect on other pastors?  I think that was my query.<br><br>I agree with you that we're all equal.  You bleed red, so do I.  I gues if you've read my reply to gasband, you'll understand why I'm more harsh (?) towards people with a high social standing.  and I wouldnt want to repeat myself, but a leader must always bear a higher price for his mistakes.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>
