Being 4 years with her, you should know and understand her fully. But ask youself, do you really know her? Do you really know what she wants? Is it because the fact that you are already with her for 4 years, yet you don't seem to do things that please her, that made her so mad and irritated?<br><br>Try to analyse the whole situation, write down points if necessary, and be observant, remember what kind of stuffs, conversations, actions that irritates her. All this while, you may be doing the wrong things at the wrong time, but yet you think you are right.

            <div class='col-md body'>I still have a feeling that there must be something bothering her and you really need to know it fast. There are times that your partner, esp from a girl, won't tell you what exactly is the whole point, because you are supposed to know what's bothering her.<br><br>I know you tried hard, but if you love her, you have to find out. She is not "sick", she just needs something from you and her family, but she couldn't get it. It could be attention, but I may be wrong.<br><br>Afterall, a woman's heart is as ocean deep, a verse from Titanic. You have to find out the answer.<br></div>

As i read through your replies, constant emphasis on 'her temper' made me want to label her as a rageaholic.  As i see it, you are trying so hard to keep the harmony of the relationship and yet your efforts are not being appreciated at all.<br><br>Let me share some excerpts ......<br><br>IS YOUR PARTNER A RAGEHOLIC?<br><br>Here are some warning signs that your partner may have a serious problem with anger:<br><br>-  Your partner gets very angry when little things donÂ’t go his way, and takes it out on the people around him.<br><br>-    When you disagree with your partner, he responds with shouting, name-calling, threats, or other over-reactive behavior.<br><br>-    Your partner has very little patience, and becomes extremely annoyed if he has to wait for service, drive behind a slow vehicle, get put on hold on the phone, listen to you explain things, etc.<br><br>-    When you ask your partner to do a simple task, he becomes defensive and rebellious.<br><br>-    When you give your partner any feedback whatsoever about how his behavior affects you, he interprets it as an attack and viciously attacks back.<br><br>-    Your partner acts out his anger by slamming doors, hanging up on you on the phone, storming out of rooms, leaving the house, sleeping on the cough at night, etc.<br><br>-    Your partner can switch from seemingly loving and warm mood to an angry mood within seconds.<br><br>-    You partner is quick to yell at you or put you down if you arenÂ’t doing what he wants you to do, of if he feels you made a mistake.<br><br>-    Your partner often raises his voice or becomes angry in public places Â– restaurants, shopping malls, friendsÂ’ homes, etc.<br><br>-    Your partner expresses his anger physically, hitting or throwing objects, or shoving or striking you or your children.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">If <strong>a few</strong> of these statements fit your partner,</span> you need to take action immediately to confront the problem and insist your partner gets help.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">If <strong>many</strong> of these statements fit your partner,</span> you are in a very dysfunctional relationship and should give your partner an ultimatum to stop the abusive behavior immediately, or you will leave.  You need to face the fact that youÂ’ve been playing the victim in the relationship, and need to get counseling for yourself as well.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">If <strong>most</strong> of these statements fit your partner,</span> get out of this relationship now!  Even if your partner is willing to get help, itÂ’s going to take him a long time to work through his rage, and you shouldnÂ’t have to be mistreated one day longer.  Take care of yourself first, and work with a professional on recovering your self-esteem and self-respect.<br><br>Answer the following questions:-<br>'Why am i putting up with this behavior?  What am I going to do about it?"<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">But often, partners of rageaholics focus more one helping their angry mate more than they do on dealing with their own feelings about being treated so badly.</span><br><br>I sincerely hope that the above is helpful and is able to share some insights.  I feel for you when you mentioned you loved your girlfriend very much.  Wish you all the best!<br></span><span class="large"></span><span class="normal"></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">boii,<br><br>Staring at your reply to Â“IS YOUR PARTNER A RAGEAHOLIC?Â”, I was wondering how to write a responseÂ….<br><br>I hope you have ever think that you are in a dysfunctional relationship.  It takes 2 to start a relationship, it also takes 2 to solve the problems (if any).  What you are trying to do now may keep the relationship intact (until you have reached your limit of tolerance).  There is absolutely no doubt that you love your girlfriend (in fact, much more than you love yourself) and you will do everything in your means to maintain the relationship (it has been 4 years).  Ask yourself, is this the kind of relationship you want?  A relationship where you keep the harmony but canÂ’t move forward? </span><br><br><span style="color: DarkBlue;"><strong>For Him:</strong>  You are an abused victim.  You are trying to keep harmony at the expense of your relationship by condoning your girlfriendÂ’s behavior.  (this statement is direct as there isnÂ’t a pleasant way to say this).  Each time, by tolerating, you are subconsciously conditioning your girlfriend, telling her behavior is acceptable.  You protesting at this statement?  If something is unacceptable, you would not have allow it to happen to you again, isnÂ’t it?<br><br>Do you tip-toe around your relationship when you are with your girlfriend?  When you are not with her, you think of her, missed her much and want to be near her.  However, when you by your girlfriend, you are always in constant Â‘fearÂ’, always being wary that something is going to trigger an Â‘eruption of rageÂ’ anything.  You heave a sign of belief only when she is in a good mood.<br><br>If you feel that way, love yourself enough find back the balance in yourself.  You are feeling confused and unclear because you are only suppressing your emotions inside you.  It is a battle of brain vs heart.  ThatÂ’s what you are struggling about. </span><br><br><span style="color: DarkRed;"><strong>For Her:</strong>Does your girlfriend have difficulty expressing/managing her emotions?  If she has, maybe she is releasing those emotions through her anger.  After the lashing out, she would feel better and sooner or later, it becomes a habit.  By then, she herself would find it I-canÂ’t-help-but-get-angry situations all the time.<br><br>Being angry is actually very bad for health.  Flaring up each time, the body would release toxins into the body, and over a prolonged period of time it would develop into some kind of illnesses.<br><br>Do you feel resentment, anger, frustration to your girlfriend sometimes?  If you do, your girlfriend may be expressing your anger on your behalf.  Huh? How can that be?.  For example, ever share your encounters with some and then while you are alright, your friend gets upset and starting cursing/swearing?  There you have it, you are expressing your anger through your friend.</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">Find the peace/serenity in yourself.  With peace/serenity, you would feel empowered to face your challenges.  You <strong>CAN</strong> do it! </span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi boii... i just read your problem and a couple of replies which were posted by other people... on one hand i do admire and respect the fact that you are giving your best shot to maintain the relationship and really shower your love and concern towards her... especially since both of you have been together for 4 whole years... surely you would like things to go on blissfully... on the other hand... well... i've got some pretty harsh thoughts which may not be the nicest sounding words to you... but i guess i shall say anyways.<br><br>Here's juz my two cents worth...<br><br>I think you need to sit down and seriously sort out PERSONALLY (so this has got nothing to do with your gf... well.. sort of) what exactly do you see in the future of this relationship.... is she really the one for you? 4 years and you are hmmm... 21 now? so you guys started going out at 17... do you REALLY think you'll be with the same person you've been going out with since 17 for the rest of your life???????? Are you sticking with her now becos you TRULY love her or because you've already been together for 4 years and it doesn't feel quite right if you guys werent together anymore? Men are habitual creatures... if its been working for so many years already... why spoil it right? Well... it seems like it isnt working as well as it should be.... or you wouldnt have posted your hurt and your pains on this forum in the first place.... Sorry to sound harsh.. but from what i read about what you said... it almost seems you're just resigned to this kinda lifestyle.... afterall its already 4 years....<br><br>You are only 21 this year.... still VERY young.. You're not married to her.. and I dont think you have an extremely intertwined relationship with her like joint bank accounts or a booking for a HDB flat to cause any major complications in the relationship.. its just pure simple young love. Something which i feel isnt quite enough nowadays... especially if you are the one suffering..<br><br>Perhaps its about time to really think about what you really want... If you think she's all the worth it for you.. she's SOOOO good.... then why are you suffering like that for her? Issit all that worth is to be suffering for her? You are her boyfriend... not her punching bag.. Do you really want to be a punching bag for the rest of your life?<br><br>Of cos.. if she is really all that good and worth it.. then u really shouldn't change her.. and accept her for who she is... No matter what advice people can give you.. the fact is, you CAN'T change her.. (i read in one of the replies earlier about something along the lines of sending your girlfriend to see a shrink.... tat's freaking load of bullshit kinda advice if u ask me) honestly, you don't have the right to.. And if you REALLY think she's the one for you... i can only say... suffer in silence matey... cos you asked it. You're the one who is finding painful bliss in this relationship... Don't complain. You asked for our opinions on this forum and all you can get is just a few words of encouragement... the true answer lies within yourself... What exactly do you want now..?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh yeah.. before you start thinking who the hell am i to critize your relationship.. here's a little something about me....<br><br>I had to let go a 5 year relationship .... I had to let go of someone whom i truly loved deeply.... But i still did it cos the pains and the hurt are just way too much to bear. He ain't worth it for me if he has to give me so much hurt in my life.<br><br>Sometimes... it is better to just move on with life....</div>
