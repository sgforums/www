            <div class='col-md body'>wah first of all stonned u sound damn pro siah.. machiam u aunt agony or even a psychiatrist or something anyway<br>boii my advice is.. if u really really really really love her.. then u must try very hard to help her out of her situation (anger).. coz from like stonned says.. she's really gotten out of control probably too accustomed to using that one familiar response she knows and somehow get things done.. by being angry and it doesn't take a genius to know that anger is the worst state of mind anyone can be in.. it makes ppl do silly things.. so its either u work hard at helping her curb with her problem rather than just going with the flow everytime give in to her.. or else u would end up getting very lost.. then become both of.. u influence each other.. negatively..  really best is u get some expert advice like some counselor or something..<br>and one thing for everybody else actually pls dun be mistaken that seeing a psychiatrist means u've lost it up there.. they are just mental doctors.. when u have flu u go clinic does that make u a weakling??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi there,<br>i guess somehow ur case is rather similar to mine...i guess my bf is also kindof losing his cool after 3 yrs of giving in? and somehow, he's like u...feeling very tired after all that effort...but now...i finally c that i really do have a pro w/ my emotions and demandingness...that's y now im trying to change for the better...tell her abt it....tell her that if she's not going to change, she will be bringing that problem into EVERY relationship...i think in this world, i can say NO guys will be able to tolerate so much (unless she is darm lucky to find an extinct dino lah), its a give and take in a relationship...try to help her (not giving in to her) but at times...support and show encouragement...we need tat in order to head towards the correct direction...hope tat helps...in any case, if u 1 to, we can share some ideas along the way...maybe i can give u some views abt wat ur gf is thinking and u can give me some ideas as to wat my bf is thinking too? u can always drop me a mail at stars_sg@yahoo.com lets hope that both of our relationships can work out in the end</div>
