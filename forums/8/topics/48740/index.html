            <div class='col-md body'>What are "friends" really.? Are they merely people whom we go out wif n just haf fun, at the end of the day its "bye n seeya" n each to his or her own? Im still trying to understand what makes people who are so full of themselves, arrogant, egocentric ...etc... still able to be so popular among others. Its what i've seen in a few cases. They seem to have the world n everything going for them. You might say maybe they are sociable n makes things happen. But ask urself again...dun u get put off by their attitudes? i dun seem to understand how they haf all the friends in the world n stuff going for them. Jealous?envious? i wun deny the fact. Yes. I feel let down n put off by my so called "friends" around me. Im not hitting on anyone in particular. Just the experiences i had. Many are just plain insensitive or dumb at times. No common sense in the way they act or behave. For instance, not sure if u ever had this experience, when ur "friends" wanna go sumwhere or do something, out of courtesy n obligation of ur friendship u follow him/her/them. But when its ur turn, they nv gif a sec of tot or 2 hoots n just say "go urself" or"dun wan lar".<br>Other instances such as their casual indifferences. They can say whatever they like n sumtimes hit ur sensitive spot, however, to gif them face, u relac. When u do likewise, WHAM BAM! they get pissed off n avoid u. I wonder where do friendships really stand these days. There are people whu are so full of themselves out there yet others wanna be wif them....is there a certain formula? or rather how the world workS?....hmm.....<br>A loner i may call myself. I haf "friends".Sure i do. Classmates, outside friends....but when times of need...i dun haf any to turn to. An occasional game of pool we haf, once in a blue moon outings. Other than that, no one gives a F*** if u die or wat. Sad isnt it? N each waits fer the other to initiate or make the 1st move b4 acting. I think tht's childish. What's ur take on all these? i hope u guys roughly get wat im driving to, if not, its ok....just tht these things haf been bugging me fer qutie a while. just wanted ur opinions, suggestions....Thanxs. Haf a gd Day~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi<br>May I know how old r u?<br><br>I do agree with u tt some ppl r like tt coz I hv a fair share of your type of "friends" but I also hv real great friends whom I seldom meet due to work committments nowadays. However, I am sure tt they will always be there for me in times of need, vice versa.<br><br>I don't think u wanna be a "loner" since this is bothering u enuf 4 u to stard a thread here. rite? Perhapz a "loner" coz of circumstances. I'm sure I dun need to teach u how to make friends.<br><br>Maybe wat I can share is bout wat I blif.<br>I blif it takes time to make the type of friends u want or rather it takes time and perhaps situations for u to judge if they r the types of friends u want and value. If all turn out to be "ideal" friends, then u must be damn fortunate or lucky.<br><br>I blif in taking the 1st step, even if I hv to fall during the process.<br>I blif tt if u'r always kind and considerate to ur friends, overtime, they will appreciate u and do the same. Of coz there r those tt nvr will, then u shd noe where to place them, don't u?<br><br>I blif u will find ur "true friends" in time to come. Just take the 1st step. There r so many journeys in life and not all will be smooth. Go ahead and fall and feel the pain and I'm sure it'll make the next journey smoother.<br><br>Cheerz~~~</div>
