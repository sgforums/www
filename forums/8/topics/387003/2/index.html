              <p>any notice found stuck outside in public areas are classed as unregistered notification and the notice owner could be fined for that by police.they dont own the land and area outside their flat.its considerd as public and not private property.</p>
              <p>advertisement that are distributed in mailboxes are considered ok as its not found in public areas and are not offensive in nature.thus flyers advertising shirts and tuition services are legal advertisement.</p>

              <p>personal cabinets on public areas are also not permited.since the land is not  theirs to mess with in first place!</p>
              <p>the pathways should be clear of personal objects which will make it messy.if they can place a cabinet...why not paint the entire area outside their home with a different coloured paint then?</p>
              <p>by right there should not be any personal objects outside home...which is used as public pathway.it should be clear of traffic and not create a danger or enviroment issues from smell to biological hazard.</p>
