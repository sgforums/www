MRT only bring you to specific locations at the shortest route and time so u can plan or continue your journey ahead. buses are different. area coverage of buses are wider and they tends to go around in circles to pick up all the pessengers in the vicinity. if buses operates like train then less pessengers will be winthin reach.<br><br>MRT- u go to them<br>buses - they come to u<br>taxis - they come to u even better, but at a higher price<br>own transport? - if u can afford it then use it and don't grumble <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>experiences are crucial, but learning the right things and not wasting time learning the wrong things should be in the working mindset.<br><br>my advices to people who can be out of a job for a while is be patient and continue seeking. a longer wait and pain now is better than when yr un related and inexperience results in the inability to secure a job later</div>
