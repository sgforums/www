            <div class='col-md body'>actually I think court's stuff are overpriced and its after-sales service...like lots of retailers out there...are virtually non-existent.<br><br>but to be fair...it also depends on the kind of people U get lor...some are really #$@#$ but some are quite OK...<br><br>U need to source around for service and price...its a balance between the 2....like...if U buy a phone from Nokia shop...U have a problem with it the next day...they tell U to go to service centre and repair...<br><br>U buy from singtelshop...U have 7 days one-to-one exchange...not sure about the ah-beng shops out there...so the key is...shop around. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

I told her that i already pay till to date, so what is the outstanding amount and why.<br>The person who chase for payments just told me that the amount and she don know why is it outstanding and advise me to call her HQ to check myself, so i said ok. She wanted to give me the number to call but as I was in the room preparing to bathe so i don have a pen, half naked, having hard time searching for pen, i scold bad word. She thou i scolded her, and asked me what did i say, to make it fast i asked if she want to tell me the outstanding amount or not. She keep asking what i said just now until i fed up i hang up.<br><br>you know what happen......She called my house phone, i answered the phone in the room and she keep asking again and again what i said just now, i fed up i said do i need to seek your permission to scold bad word, she said the conversation is recorded. I really so fed up i hang up again. She called at least 4 times and my kids answer cos i was in the room and i am bathing. I was wet when i answer the 4th time, i scold her if she still called regarding the bad word issue i am going to complain about her and hang my phone for 30 min.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  worse part 2 here is :<br>her colleague called today, and asked when i want to pay. i said this week or next. She said cannot must be tomorrow. i said no problem, tomorrow lor.<br>out of no where she said do u know simple english. I asked what u mean by that. She said she heard from her colleague that i don know simple english and i scold her colleague bad word which she claimed she has played the tape. I told her go and listen carefully what happen before she anyhow insult me of not understanding simple english. Beside listening to her colleague do find out herself is the customer really don understand simple english. Beside i have already agreed to pay tomorrow so what does she mean that i don know simple english.<br><br>She then mentioned about I scold her colleague bad words. I fed up i explained the whole things and she keep quiet after that.<br><br>I am so fed up about this kind of insult. And this is really an insult meh.<br><br>Scolding bad word cos i cant find a pen also cannot, have to get permission is it? I still have to explain why i scold bad word. very sickening.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br></div></blockquote>Actually, if you're buying anything under hire purchase, I'd strongly suggest you DON'T ever do so with COURTS. Their payment collection method is one punch shy to that of loan sharks.<br><br>Their interests are so damn high. Now a days, you can get interest free instalments at Harvey Normans.<br><br>You don't need this kind of stress and hassle.<br><br></div>

Also, before repairing a laptop, you have to bypass some password protection, like BIOS boot, which Courts has no way to access.<br><br>Also, even if Courts suggest a partner-ship repair service with lets say HP. HP will never agree. No companies will agree. They will never authorise anyone to  gain access to their computer's built legally.<br><br>As for the mp3 your company sells, it is easy for you to send for repair because if a mp3 is broken, then it is borken. For laptops, problems can be caused by lots of different reasons, and thus the repair fee is at different price, even if under a warranty. Also, if the fee HP offered is too high, the customer might choose to repair his computer else where, and thus you cannot just mail a laptop for service. You have to bring it over since lots of decisions are to be made.<br><br>Enough bullshit from me, I think Courts service really sucks. I usually avoid it. If i want a notebook or mp3, i usually go to Apple shop instead. As for furnitures, i prefer Ikea</div>
