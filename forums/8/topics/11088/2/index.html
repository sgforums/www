            <div class='col-md body'>A temptation agency with intellectual tests?<br>Wouldn't it be easier to just come up with<br>one comprehensive psychological test? Because, if at the end of the day there's not<br>going to be anything physical.. the results<br>may not be that accurate right?<br><br>I feel that the concept of Temptation Island is a novel one, but a tad bit prone to sensationalism in order to achieve higher ratings.<br><br>Going to the island seems to be a lose-lose situation. Reason being that no one is that steadfast in his/her resolve such that temptation will not be able to seduce him/her. Even if the couple DOES survive, what will it prove? That their bond is exceptionally strong? or perhaps that they have chosen to shut themselves away from the influences of others?<br><br>------------------<br>Don't like what I'm saying?

            <div class='col-md body'>Since it is TV programme, obviously they want to have high ratings right? Anyway lotsa ppl are just enjoying the show and see which couples get tempted and so on ..we are going to make criticism since they are all on National TV...<br><br>Psychological tests are different from experiments...experiments can be manipulated and we can see the variables in what cause what...For e.g "Does exposure to temptation cause lack of faith in a relationship" it is only thru an experiment where one can see if there is a causation....<br><br>Like I have said, I am not going to go against evolution and to test if Darwin is right about the 'survival of the fittest' theory...that man is attracted to the females esp, the more attractive ones, reason is to have a wide-spread of offsprings to continue its generation and what not...<br><br>Yah ..I am a humanitarian and not an evolutionist.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh yes, one other thing about why survivor and temptation island is so popular... it's because everyone is interested in somebody else's business. It's what makes some people turn into voyeurs.<br><br>There's this other british series called "The Villa" not too sure if you folks have heard of it. It's a villa on the coast of the mediterrainian where they install cameras all over the place and they send a bunch of singles there to watch and see how they live together or pair up after a week.<br><br>It's basically an all-expense paid holiday crossed with a dating agency.

            <div class='col-md body'>IÂ’ve havenÂ’t really been reading through all the postings cuz IÂ’m at work but I gather that the gist of it is talking about DarwinÂ’s Â‘Survival of the FittestÂ’ theory and temptation, right? Well, I think if given a choice, I wouldnÂ’t want to give it a go on Temptation Island.<br><br>Part of it has to do whether my partner and I can resist the temptation but I think besides that, a constant air of suspicion, anxiety and insecurity will emerge. And I donÂ’t think itÂ’ll be healthy for any relationship, regardless of its strength. Anyway, even if the relationship did survive the 2 weeks of Â‘paradiseÂ’, the stay might have permanent and repercussive effects on it.<br><br>No one is perfect and I donÂ’t think my partner is perfect. Neither am I. So if the next guy comes along and have that something which my partner lacks, I might not be unfaithful to him but I might start comparing unrealistically. And I guess when youÂ’re comparing, you tend to be blind to the strengths of your partner.<br><br>So I guess Temptation Island is out for me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

If you<br>think  something will make you happy, go for it. Remember that we pass this way only  once.<br>Bottomline :<br>Time don't wait. If you think you might have found the  right one, treasure him/her. Don't let he/she go away. Don't let fear hold you  back.<br>Give it a try else you might regret later... No one other than  yourself<br>knows what can truly make you  happy.</div>
