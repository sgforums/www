            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Legal brawl over changes made to condo apartment </strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Condo MC and couple feud over changes made to apartment, with multiple lawsuits following </span><br><br>By Tanya Fong<br><br>WHAT began as a dispute over aluminium roofs and windows installed by a couple who live in the Kentish Lodge condominium has escalated into a full-scale legal brawl of multiple lawsuits.<br><br>Mr Choo Kok Lin, a businessman in his 60s, and his wife, Irene, are battling the condominium's management corporation (MC) which claim the couple had no permission to put in these structures on common property.<br><br>The couple, who own two units on the ground floor, had roofs installed over the open terrace in 1999, after they moved in, and windows installed in the terrace wall.<br><br>Roofs and windows (top) enclosing what was originally an open condo terrace (above) have sparked off the feud. -- LAU FOOK KONG<br>This effectively enclosed a 540 sq ft space, which then became part of their living room.<br><br>The MC claims the Choos are encroaching on common property, since the roof structures 'take support from the overhanging common parapet wall'.<br><br>It also said that the windows they installed were on common property and affected the facade of the condominium in Oxford Road, near the KK Women's and Children's Hospital.<br><br>The condominium last made headlines in January when, in heavy rain, a cabby drove his taxi into its swimming pool.<br><br>In court documents, the condominium's MC, represented by Mr Andrew Tan Tiong Gee, alleges that the 'unauthorised construction' breached by-laws of the Land Titles (Strata) Act. This states that home owners cannot make alterations or additions to their lots without approval from the management corporation.<br><br>The MC's position is that the Choos had adopted an 'install first and talk later' attitude, as they had not consulted the developer or the MC beforehand.<br><br>By sealing up what is supposed to be an open area, it would be impossible for any scaffolding or gondola structures to be constructed if the common walls were to be painted, it said.<br><br>The Choos, represented by Mr Adrian Tan, maintain that they were given permission to do so.<br><br>They refer to a letter from the managing agent dated Dec 20, 2001, which stated that 'the council has no objections to your additional installation... as long as there is no breach of regulations of the Urban Redevelopment Authority'.<br><br>The MC also takes issue with an aluminium roof installed in an air well, which the Choos say they put in to protect themselves from 'killer litter'.<br><br>A knife, a pot, cigarette butts and several panties have landed on their patio, the couple claim.<br><br>In court documents, they allege that the management gave its consent, but later changed its position because of 'personal animosity'.<br><br>On the sidelines of this fight are three defamation suits. Two of them are between Mr Choo and the MC's chairman, Dr William Wan, a lawyer.<br><br>Dr Wan filed the suits in 2002 and they have yet to be heard.<br><br>The same year, Mr Choo took out a defamation suit against the MC's deputy chairman, Mr Thiruchelvan Nagamuthu.<br><br>In the court documents, the Choos allege that Dr Wan and Mr Thiruchelvan were using the management council to 'punish' Mr Choo 'for having the temerity to question them', and 'performed a shameless turnaround and objected to the roof coverings'.<br><br>The seven-day trial ended in court last week. Their lawyers are to make their submissions, and district judge Kathryn Low is due to deliver her judgment on July 23.<br><br>That is unlikely to be the end of the matter, however.<br><br>The feuding has made a few residents so fed up that they plan to take the MC to task at the annual general meeting to be held on June 27.<br><br>They want the MC to refer the matter of the Choos' roof structures to the Urban Redevelopment Authority for it to decide, and for the MC to stop its legal action against the Choos. They also want a resolution passed to say that the MC 'shall not be responsible for all legal costs incurred in any legal suits'.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>U think taxi driver earn how much? You go try to be relief driver lah. Drive at night see how many people want to take cab after peak hours? Taxi driver can earn $3600 per month is tou xiao liao loh. Rental is around $40+ for relief drivers to pay to their hirers. Then plus the diesel all these charges. Government say not enough taxis, you go see how many taxis don't have passengers lah. Other than peak hours I seldom see people taking taxis.<br><br>And also taxi drivers are  not street directory, they may know the roads better than you or me but that doesn't mean they know ALL the roads.<br><br>One night can earn around $$80-90 dollars after paying all the costs already good liao loh. They don't have CPF, no leaves, no MCs, no nothing. Relief driver go hospital stay in hospital only got money for the bed. Other than that all other expenses you fork out yourself. Accident you pay your company $1000 as deposits because the company take away your previous fixed deposit when you apply for the licence. You think taxi driver really earn so much meh? My father drives 7 or 8 hours a day also never earn more than $2000 per month.<br></div>
