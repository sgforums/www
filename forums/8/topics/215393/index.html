            <div class='col-md body'>I want to focus attention on the sudden increase in the electricity charges in the last two months for my five-room flat.<br>My office colleagues and relatives are also affected by the sudden large increase in their utility bills.<br><br>In the last 12 months, my PUB bills were quite consistent. But during the past two months, there was a sudden increase of about 30% in the bill even though there was no reason for it.<br><br>Even with the recent rate increase, the bill shouldn't be so big.<br><br>I called Singapore Power's customer service department to tell them I was over-charged.<br><br>But I was told that the bills were based on the meter readings. I was told to check my meter by switching off the main power supply and see whether the meter was running.<br><br>If it kept running, it indicated a power leakage in my house because of defective home appliances.<br><br>The customer service department insisted that their bills were correct.<br><br>Their response did not clear my doubts. Nor did they answer my queries satisfactorily.<br><br>The frustrating thing was the impolite and impatient attitude in answering my enquires.<br><br>Shouldn't the customer service be trained to have the correct mindset and respond to queries and provide solutions instead of giving customers a cold shoulder?<br><br>I think the customer service staff should do better.<br><br>Florence Chia Seok Cheng (Mrs)<br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asiaone.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?vgnextoid=f832758920e39010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=vgnartid:b4ceee1e8714e010VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asiaone.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?vgnextoid=f832758920e39010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=vgnartid:b4ceee1e8714e010VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD</a></div>
