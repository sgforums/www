However, the initial stage of putting on RGPs is very uncomfortable as you will feel pricky.<br><br>RGPs unlike soft lenses (disposables), must be cleansed on a regular basis or daily with due care (coz could be broken if u exert to much pressure and could be lost easily coz of small size.)<br><br>Lately,there's also a technique called Orthokeratology using RGP to control and reduce myopia for a short period; the patient must put on the RGP to sleep and could do wthout his/her lenses the next day. This is however, on a case by case basis depending on ur corrective power and suitability of curvature. You could enquire more with ur optometrists next time when you visit them.<br><br>Hope my 2 cents worth of comments are useful to u..<br><br>Cheers <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

I don't know for others but I'm afraid of being at a windy place for long...it feels like the RGP lenses are gona pop out or mislocate in the eyes? Quite terrible.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>if you switch to wear soft lenses, you'll find it most comfortable as it's so soft that you can't feel anything! However, if you've dry eyes like mine, the optician will not encourage you to wear soft lenses. Reason being that soft lenses doesn't quite allow oxygen to go thru like the RGP lenses do. For a person with dry eyes like me, my eyes will look blood shot after within 1-2 hrs of wearing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Soft lenses are much more comfortable to wear than RGP lenses.<br>Normally, a person will get used to wearing soft lenses within 3 days. It is easier to wear, but the only problem is that it builds up deposits easily. And if not clean properly, eye infections may arise from there. Thus, daily disposables are quite popular nowadays.<br><br>RGP lenses are much uncomfortable to wear than soft lenses.<br>It takes about 1 week to 2 weeks to adapt to RGP lenses. Normally, on the 1st day, you can only wear about 2 hours, the purpose of that is to let the eye get used to the feeling of the lenses as it is quite hard as compared to soft lenses. The next day, increased the wearing time to 4 hrs and so on, until a maxi of 14 hrs a day.<br>It is easier to care for RGP lenses, coz of the material that is used to make it. You can rinse the RGP lenses with tap water in Singapore! (Even though Saline is a better choice)<br>Risk of infection in rare in RGP lenses. RGP lenses risk the chances of dislodging.<br><br>Orthokeratology lenses are not RGP lenses. It uses the same concept but, you can't put on the RGP lenses for night use (wearing to sleep).<br>OK lenses have 3 to 4 tiny holes in it, the purpose of it, is to allow the cornea to take in oxygen, so that the next day, the cornea won't swell up so much.<br>The theory behind the OK lenses is basically to flatten the cornea during the sleeping time. However, you have to wear the OK lenses for a period of time to flatten the cornea before you can cease wear in the morning. Thus, its more of a cosmetic reason to wear OK lenses and not to control myopia.</div>
