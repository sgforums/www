            <div class='col-md body'>In terms of ethnics from my own experience...<br><br>Ethnics<br>1.  Govt doctors are paid a fix salary, therefore there is less conflict of interest.  Private doctors salary depends on how much money they can make out of the patient + number of patients.  Therefore they may try to spend as little time as possible to diagnose your condition (higher chance of misdiagnosis) to maximise the number of patients seen per day.  i.e give wrong medicine/treatment due to misdiagnosis and ask patient to come back if condition doesn't get better.  Another possible trick to make more money is to give less medicine and ask the patient to come back for another visit if the condition doesn't get better.<br><br>2.  I think that govt doctors are more accountable because they have to report to their superiors for those junior doctors and follow standard procedure.  Private doctors that run their own clinic mostly do what they want?<br><br>Note:  These are just my own observations from my personal experience that i wish to share with everyone.  They may or may not be true.<br><br>If anyone has a bad experience with private or govt doctors please share your experience here.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I had an accident and went to one of my ex-company doctor.<br>He didn't bother to wash the abrasion wounds on my feet. Neither did he wash my knee abrasion wounds properly. When i asked him if i needed a jab, he replied,"No u can go." I asked again,"Nothing else?" He did not look at me and said,"U can go." It was at night and when I went hm, I sort of felt sick and vomitted. May be due to shock but anyway I went to see another doc the next day in case. That doc looked at my knee wound and told me it is very dirty and show signs of infections. He then cleaned it up very nicely. My mom asked him if I needed a jab, he replied,"Usually we'd give jabs for rd accidents as rds are very dirty."<br><br>The first doctor gave me an impression that he was in a huge hurry to go home.</div>

Misdiagnosis = bad reputation, which is everything for a doctor in private practice. It is the doctors in the hospitals who can hide behind each other and get their superiors to cover up for them when they screw up.<br><br>The only bad experience i have with doctors are with the army MOs.. somehow their medicines never seem to work and they don't do a proper physical exam or take a proper history. But again, can't really blame them lah, can see they are very stressed also by the high workload.</div>
