            <div class='col-md body'>My only experience with hospital is when I needed 8 stitches for my left shin due to a flowerpot cut when I was between 8 to 10 years old. That's the only time I was in the hospital. One advice - try not to get sick at all.<br><br>My nightmare backs to 2000 when my company doctor at Orchard area misdiagnosed my symptoms that got me rushing to A&amp;E of SGH. To avoid embarrassment here, suffice to say that you must try to be knowledgable about medical stuff, like diseases, symptoms, treatment methods and so forth. If you fail do so, you would end up paying unnecessary fees, undergoing unnecessary testing with no results discussed, missing one of your limb, and accepting wrong decision by the doctors (including the supervisor of junior/senior doctors) and probably losing your life. Even Malaysia's private hospital that I had my second opinion shared the same wrong judgment call.<br><br>The moral of the story is sometimes you know yourself best than any doctors. They are simply facilitators to your health and it is your responsibility to ensure your well being.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Me got one super bad experience with one of my company appointed doctors in the eastern part (last station on the EW MRT line, at the shopping centre next to it on level 5), me went to see the doctor as me was feeling hot and cold intermittently and running a temperature with a bad bout of flu. The doctor who saw me just asked me was from XX company and a lot of people from the XX company had seen him over the past few days. He just made few simple diagnosis by using his stethoscope to hear and asked me what were my symptoms and problems. He concluded that me was down with common flu and before he gave me medication, he asked if me had any drug allergy, me told him me allergic to ampicillin. Guessed what, he asked me how to spell the drug! Then he prescribed me antibiotics and panadols as medication. And he reassured that me would be fine a few days later.<br><br>A few days had passed and me was getting from bad to worse even after taking the medication, and developed rashes over parts of my body. Me went to a nearby clinic and saw the doctor. The doctor saw me with rashes and quickly asked if me had taken any drug that me was allergic to. Me said no, only the medications prescribed by the previous doctor. He had a look and told me that the antibiotics contained ampicillin! Me was shocked! He measured my temperature and it registered 39.2 degrees! He listened to his stethoscope and found that me was suffering from acute influenza! He gave me two jabs, one for the rashes and another was TamiFlu for the acute influenza. Me recovered for the better after two days.</div>
