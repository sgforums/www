              <p>Well, you may say that... but that is not entirely true.. We feel that we have not done anything wrong as we have not tried to pass off as anything to do with Sun Microsystems, we have not used the name in bad faith and people can tell the difference between our company and theirs... Besides our clientele doesn't even know what is Glassfish from Sun Microsystems...</p>
              <p>In fact when I asked around, some people even guessed that Sun Microsystems was part of Microsoft... and some others said it manufactured SD Cards... What else can I say...</p>

              <p>It depends on who you ask. The general public probably has no idea who/what Sun Microsystems is and what Sun does.</p>

              <p>Anyway I don't con clients... They tell me what they need, I just provide them the solutions to their problems.. Simple as that...</p>
              <p>Honestly an old business man that owns an sme for 10 years doing ironworks won't care even if you told him what on earth Glassfish by Sun's is all about.. He just wants the end results... A working website, nice design and a website that people can go and see his ironworks.. Thats all... Singaporeans are very practical people... No results, no pay.. And I'm happy living with that... Because we have been delivering as far as we are concerned...</p>

              <p>i just furious and curious why you think sun is on the fault

              <p>Hi *****************,</p>
              <p>Honestly I'm not saying who's fault is it or
                  whatever. Sun may choose to do whatever they feel is right. However we
                  are also entitled to do what we feel is right. We are not pushing the
                  blame to anybody and it is unfortunate that we (Us and Sun
                  Microsystems) is caught in this situation. Neither of us wanted to be
                  here but here we are in this predicament.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I honestly
                  thank you for your feedback, and I will ensure that my future posts
                  will not be based on my opinions but on facts from now on. Would love
                  to update you on what is happening. I have actually spoken to my
                  lawyers from Drew and Napier, one of the best law firms in town, and
                  they have advised me that we have a case if we can find out when Sun's
                  Glassfish was launched in Singapore. We are still in the midst of
                  working something amicable between both parties and I hope you do not
                  misunderstand me by playing the bullied...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We honestly
                  just want to settle this issue fairly and get on with life. I hope you
                  understand where we are coming from as well. We are a small company, we
                  have worked hard to build a business, now we have lost clients and
                  business is suffering. We all need to earn money for our families and
                  this is not how we want things to be. We don't mind changing our
                  business name and allowing them the exclusive right to having the name
                  but we need to cover our overheads.</p>
              <p>It costs money building a
                  reputation for a company and branding is extremely important. Now that
                  we need to change the company's name, it hurts our business. We have to
                  give them our domain for free, even though we paid for it and
                  maintained it for the past few months. We pumped in money to make sure
                  it had a good search hit with all the search engines, now we feel that
                  even if they feel that we may be infringing their trademark that isn't
                  even registered in Singapore, they should at least be fair and pay for
                  what they want. Afterall, we are not the ones making millions in the
                  market...</p>
              <p>You are free to feel angry with our predicament or
                  our stand on this issue, but I just sincerely hope you understand that
                  we truly want to get this settled amicably in order to continue our
                  business and bring home money during this hard time.</p>
              <p>Thanks for the time you just took to read this long message.</p>
              <p>Kindest Regards</p>

              <p>you say it is hard to built a trademark.. what about GlassFish? it has been a free opensource server since many years ago.</p>
              <p>have you even binged or googled glassfish before even thinking of using it as a company name? i cant believe you even put <span style="color: #993366;">© 2009 GlassFish</span> in your website.</p>
              <p>come on.. it would be fantastic if you put  <span style="color: #993366;">© 2009 Glassfish Design</span> or get a domain name <span style="color: #993366;">glassfish-design.com.sg.</span></p>

              <p>So TS, based on what you've been saying, I would like to share an analogy with you.</p>
              <p>So one fine day you're driving your car down the road, your phone drops on the car mat and you look down, tried to pick it up while you were still driving. In the midst of not looking, you knock down somebody at a traffic junction. You can't argue in court and say that "I wasn't looking, I don't even know that person was there".</p>
              <p>The fact that you (or anyone else) doesn't know about Sun Microsystem's GlassFish doesn't mean that you can go ahead with your actions. Ignorance is never an excuse for anything.That's why there is such thing as intellectual property.</p>
              <p>Think deeply about this ok? You don't have to reply me if you don't wish to, coz' I don't want your ego to get in the way and have you start replying with things that doesn't make sense just to defend your own ego. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Thanks for your feedback... Superlibra, I think there are also certain things that I shouldn't say here.. So hope you understand.</p>
              <p>All in all, we as a small company just hope we can have a small token for settlement so we can get on with business... We are not saying we are right or wrong... We just want to move on from here, so we can continue business and earn money.</p>
              <p>You are right, ignorance is not an excuse. However unfortunate as it may be, we are already in this situation. So our lawyers together with Sun Microsystems and our company are working together to the best possible course of amicable action. Thanks once again Superlibra...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And bananaCoke, Thanks for the suggestions! =) I'm actually looking into everybody's suggestion to improve ourselves and business as well!</p>
              <p>Cheers Guys!</p>

              <p><br>Superlibra, there is a loophole here.</p>
              <p>So does it mean, as long as let's say Microsoft have some products then those domains are automatically theirs???</p>
              <p>Even if let's say you register the domain First? And then they come out with their products that clashes with your name/brand??</p>
              <p>There is the "First come first serve way".</p>
              <p>TS just needs to show that he has registered the name before Sun's is good enough.</p>
              <p>If let's say, all the way I have a product call "Mohave!", and its very famous, but I never intend to set up a separate domain/website, does it mean that I automatically is entitled to it, and if anybody happens to own it, they are wrong and but give it to me??</p>
              <p>Hmm....TS go ahead and input your lawyers with the POVs given in the forum, it might help you.</p>
