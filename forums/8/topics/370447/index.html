              <p>At the beginning of this year a partner and I registered a
              company called Glass Fish Designs LLP. We have been running our
              small little business doing web deisgning, maintainence and
              designing basically. </p>
              <p>After 4 months, a big giant known as Sun Microsystems have sent
              us a C&amp;D letter AKA as Cease and Desist telling us that we were
              infringing on their trademark and wanted us to take off our domain
              (www.glassfish.com.sg) and give it to them FOC...</p>
              <p>Thats besides the point, but further more when our company did
              some checks with Intellectual Property Office of Singapore.. They
              had only filed a trademark application for GlassFish on the 3rd of
              July 2009... It hasn't been approved and it is still in pending...
              So what on earth are they trying to do?</p>

              <p>Coincidental? I dont know... We checked trademarks that they had
              filed overseas and all of them were using the same keywords however
              they conveniently added the underlined words to IPOS Trademark
              Registration...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I really dont have an idea.. Take a look</p>

                                      ".</p>
              <p>2) Press the tree-like icon all the way to the left and on the
                                      same row as the 'Bold', 'Italic' and 'Underline', which is just
                                      above the space you are posting in.</p>
              <p>3) Paste the link which you have copied into Image Url, and

              <p>I think once they have filed the Trademark, they already have it. Furthermore, if they have already subscribed to the US probably, you have no case here. You will lose it.</p>

              <p>Besides why only file a trademark after four months in Singapore if the US one applies in Singapore as well.. And why only send us a C &amp; D letter only after 4 months... You gotta be kidding me...</p>

              <p>to my understanding, if you pay money for something, that thing belongs to you. if you trademarked it, thats even better.</p>
              <p>TS trademarked that "glassfish" in singapore. he also bought over the domain "www.glassfish.com.sg". all these cost money. i don't see why TS must give it to them foc.</p>

              <p>I think the major issue right now is that there should be a fairer method to settling such disputes.. We all feel that even though you are a big company and have the money.. you still have to be ethical in handling matters like that... at least give a settlement fee for crying out loud...</p>
              <p>A small company had to create a brand for ourselves from scratch and now we have to rebrand and give you our domain for free? You gotta be kidding us.. We rather cancel the domain and let them pay for it again...</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>GlassFish started off as a project in 2005. Its stable release was only achieved this year in January and Sun started IPO takeover just only. So you need to mention that Glassfish in your company name is coincidental and you have no prior knowledge of the project and its name. Of course, your also need to provide evidence of your company's business dealings and speciality. You might need to explain how your company name came about and the period of it being registered as a company. So get your lawyer to contact Sun's lawyer and state a willingness to settle the matter admicably and in camera. Just get ready for a name change for your company and a new website. Please remember to ask for some money to cover the cost of the name change and new webby but please do not go over the line. GlassFish started in 2005 but did not register itself as an IP entity until much later.</p></div>

              <p>come on.. why did you name your domain glassfish.com.sg and your company name glass fish design llp. you are a web developing company you should know what is glassfish what.</p>
              <p>it is like naming your company micro soft design llp or apple design llp. i suggest you create a new name and if eventually your company becomes big you sure what to collaborate with sun given a chance?</p>
              <p>new name other than glassfish also good. people see your company name glassfish abit like wannabe. since you are design company, you would prefer a creative image right? using glassfish as a name suggest you copy instead of create.</p>

              <p>Your company is new, name is new, brand is new, so there's less damages to change it as compared to Sun. But do not give up for free... You have to list down the time and cost taken to build up your brand name and websites, etc... They have to compensate that... Lastly.... I would suggest that you request Sun to credit you somewhere for passing over the website name and company name as well somewhere on the website for at least a year.... This way, you still get re-direction to your new site if people searched for your previuos company's name...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The above is if you decide to settle amicably and give the name up with certain conditions.</p>
