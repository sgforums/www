            <div class='col-md body'>1995,  I was hiking with some friends in Big Bend Nat'l Park in Texas next to Mexico.  We hiked the trial for about 4 days.  The landscape was so amazing &amp; beautiful. U know the wildersness photos of Ansel Adams? or those potraits of the New Mexico desert by Georgia O'Keefe ?   the scenary of Big Bend was something like that.  At night u could read your book without torchlight or straining yer eyes cos the stars were crowding the heavens !  yep, every inch of the night sky was shining with stars.  that was my most memorable experience &amp; one of those rare moments I felt exhilarated &amp; truly alive</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>some of the nicest places are off the beaten track.  While backpacking in Mexico, we spent  3 days in a nice fishing village called Puerto Angel (Port Angel). It is mentioned in Lonely Planet guides. A backpacker's heaven actually. A fisherman living in a wooden shack on the beach rented us his "frontporch" &amp; hammocks for US$2 per day. (Most of the village engaged in this trade or fishing.  usually both)  It faced the pacific ocean.  so each day we saw a breathtaking  sunrise &amp; sunset.  for dinner freshly caught seafood was cooked at his bro-in-law &amp; french wife's restaurant (also facing the ocean). very cheap, to our delight.  every night we fell asleep to the sound of waves.  in the morning, play in the surf.  afternoons were spent exploring cliffs in the vicinity or simply lazing around on our hammocks, catching up on reading or playing with the family's brood of children. one of the best vacation I ever had. easily better than packaged tours.<br><br>Anyone here has a dream vacation you have been saving up for months ? years ?  where wd you go ?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I am not as well travelled as the many of you here. *smiles* But since being penniless does not help, I have learnt to appreciate what I have here in Singapore ... it ain't really that but you just got to look out for it hard.<br><br>Well and for a buaya like me, I'm always on the look out for romantic places. And here are a few that I have in my little black book. *laffs* They aren't exactly Exotic but to me, they are some of the few in Singapore that are good.<br><br>1) Benjamin Shears Bridge(is that how you spell it?)<br><br>I took a friend from USA there and she told me that it is one of the most beautiful cityscape she ever saw, and I can tell that she is not lying, her eyes brighten up that moment. After that we walked to the big grasspatch beside Singapore River where it is just before you go into Marina south tunnel. We have had a great time admiring the sky and the cityscape lying down while having our champange. Next time when you are on a bus or vehicle, and passing by there ,enjoy the view and you will learn to appreciate.<br><br>2) Alkaff Mansion<br>It is a very romantic place to go to, especially at night, you can take your date there for one magically evenning, I took mine when I had some money and the experience was wonderful. As you walk in there are torches along the sidewalk which gives goes a warm and natural feeling, going to the big open space you will see a beautiful fountain, then as you hold the hands of your date while walking up the steps to the resturant, the feeling is just so magically, like in a fairy tale of a prince(an ugly one in my case) and a princess going to a palace. WOW! It's just unforgetable.<br><br>3) Top floor of OUB/UOB building<br><br>From there you can see the city bustling with life, and it is as though they will never stop. You can only go there in the day though for the building is very tight with security at night. But I manage to stay there until 8.00 p.m once. hehehe We went at 4.30 p.m bought sandwiches and had our dinner there. we admired the view until she is tired and wanted to go home.<br><br>4) National Art muesum<br><br>Go there in the day, and you can enjoy the beautiful art pieces, after that a great photo taking session outside in the garden. That's what I call cheap thrills but hey we had fun with the fountain and all that.<br><br>5) Raffles Hotel<br><br>It is a great plae to be at, the class and the posh feelings envelope you. Took a cab there the other time for a D&amp;D, was wearing my tux, the valet opened the door and greeted me with a well practice smile, drop a $2.00 tip in his hands*LOL* My do I feel like a king. The interiors are great too, an overall Colonial feelings falls around you. You will feel that you are walking in history.<br><br>Hmm.. these are the more impressive ones, if I can recall any more I'll tell you all. Hope you all dun find it boring for I think they are some of the more romantic places in Singapore.<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 + $0.03(from Lex) worth</span></strong><br><br>[This message has been edited by Callan (edited 24 February 2000).]</div>
