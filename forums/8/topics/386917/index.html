              <p>well, been looking at an old site with an all 80s list... wonders if anyone still remember them...  </p>
              <ul>
              <li>You grew up brushing your teeth with a mug in primary school during
              recess time. You would squat by a drain with all your classmates beside
              you, and brush your teeth with a coloured mug.<br> <br></li>
              <li>You hated or loved the school nurse (she was either pretty or mean).<br> <br></li>
              <li>You know what SBC stands for.<br> <br></li>
              <li>You paid 40 cents for cartons of chocolate or strawberry milk every week in class.<br> <br></li>
              <li>Everyone's wallet used to be the velcro type<br> <br></li>
              <li>It was cool to have pagers in primary school</li>
              </ul>
              <p><img style="float: left;" src="http://tw.bid.yimg.com/users/4/3/4/7/yt30152000-img600x450-1237781411513468____0188-3.jpg" alt="pager" width="283" height="212"></p>

              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>The bus seats are made of
              wood and the cushion were red. The big red bell gave a loud BEEP! when
              pressed.<br> <br></li>
              <li>There were still bus tickets and bus conductors would come up to check them.<br> <br></li>

              <li>You were there when they first introduced the MRT here. You went

              MGS), and mamee (30 cents), that had a different sticker in it every
              time.<br> <br></li>

              <li>KFC used to be a high class restaurant that served food in plates and had metal forks and knives.<br> <br></li>
              <li>The most vulgar thing you said was a55hole and idiot and THE MOST

              hokkien translation.<br> <br></li>
              <li>Catching and pepsi-cola was the IN thing, and twist was the magic word.<br> <br></li>

              important plants of our lives, guppies and swordtail being the most
              important fishes.<br> <br></li>

              <li>Every Children's day and National day you either got pins or pens

              your dry and warm socks and shoes.<br> <br></li>
              <li>There would be spelling tests and mental sums to do almost everyday (you hated them).<br> <br></li>
