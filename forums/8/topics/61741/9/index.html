Ninja Turtles is the threshold for me.. after that don't really like cartoons liao.. My brother just went to get this macross valkerie toy from this clarke quay mini shopping mall.. Now all become vintage toys liao.. Used to have a Metroplex.. but lost it.. Saw its price tag.. wished I have kept it cos nw cost much much more.. Also remembered we collect and exchange stickers.. from toys to world cup teams now losing favour among younger generations liao.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Think i was abt 10 when me and my neighbour went to the nearby playground and collected a red plasticbag full of fine sand. Then we went on top of an overhead bridge and throw the packet of sand down on one of the cars. My friend and me were laughing like mad while going down the bridge when I suddenly realised my friend stop laughing. Below the bridge was a police van waiting for us. Kanna scolded like mad but when they left we started laughing again.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>We also went to the pool by ourselves without my parents knowing. Was walking at the edge of the pool when i was knock into it by someone. Nearly drown but my friend manage to get hold of me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>Was stealing stickers to complete my sticker books. I remember there was this lego one which i was missing a number 3 piece. One day after i came back from malaysia with my parents i wnet to the store and told myself that this will be my last time. So surprise that it contain the missing piece, then i sent the reply card at the back of the book to take part in the lucky draw and I won a prize. but i never go and claim.</div>

I have one very rugged teacher in Malaysia, face like Lee GuoHuang, but is middle aged and overweight. He looks more like ruffian than teachers, but lucky no angkong, Surprisingly, he can teach. Not bad.<br><br>Funny, every morning on way to school on bus pass by his house. He will be watering his plants, and his kids all ready to go sch. The scene looks ok at that time, but now thinking of it, it looks funny.<br><br>I remember my kindergarten, which has cater for 4 to 6 years old. Each level is one big class, so total only three classes, but many people. Basically one buiding. From outside looks like house, but amazingly big inside.K1 or 4 years old,  will be in an area facing the door main door, like living room to main door. One desk stand next to door ,and I remember my dad paying school fees at that desk, which sits a teacher.<br><br>Second year, is next room which is damn big, and hold lots of people. Somehow, there is no door between rooms, just openings. Third year, surprisingly is small room (dont know where some of the second year disappear to?). This kindergarten is Chinese, English medium, surprisingly for me I progress to National or Malay medium school.<br><br>Canteen break is fun, coz the whole of of the kindergarten line up from the main door round a rather small field to a desk by side of the building, where they serve biscuits and hot milo. Man, always looking out for what biscuits they serving next, followed by play in playground. In the ground of the school stand a church, rather large one, but we never pry in there, although I believe they do allow anyone to come in to pray.<br><br>Hehe, I still got photos of my school days..in colour..coz me young kid still now mah LOL. Transport home was fun, coz my town isnt just brick and mortar. Got villages, so we will stop by to drop people off, as well as enjoying the scenery with cows and goats on the pastures. Surprisingly, its not hot even on midday as Sg. But hot is good, can get tanned hehe. BTW, my transport during kindergarten is van, not bus, sometimes the van driver, we call her auntie, pass by petrol kiosk or her house, and brought some (sorry i forgot what is it called, chinese pancake with peanuts on them). Her van is not new and not old either, lucky not musty and rusty.Well kept. Rem those vehicles with gear lever by side of steering wheel?<br><br>She usually buy when parents request, so on way to school she stop by petrol kiosk to buy for the particular kids. Sometimes, she stops by my grandaunt place or my grandma house, and my grandmother pass me vegetables, newspaper wrapped, fresh. Tell you about my grandma farm next time.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
