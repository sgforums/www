            <div class='col-md body'>My school very different from SG ones. only four main buldings. First one is P1 and P2, and no 1A, 1B, only one level, one class. Its one storey too, with wooden chairs and tables, and cat droppings early in the morning.<br><br>Second bulding are nothing but principal's storeroom. Mind you, my Cikgu Besar a Chinese, is not onli a principal, but a bookstorekeeper and Moral Education class teacher. The storeroom consist of tables positioned against the walls, piled with bookstore stuff and his own books to mark. You want eraser, exercise books, he got. Our own textbooks are always second hand from older students, and our principal always be the one going into the next town, 40 km away, to buy books if we want new ones.<br><br>While the Malay go for their religious class, the rest have Moral Ed class with the principal. He is always with cane to check our fingernails. Fierce? Totally opposite. He only lightly tap your fingernails if he found them to be long, and is always smiling.<br><br>On the other side of the school ground is the P3, P4. Three storey building. The ground floor is occupied by P3 and P4, while the second and third storey are empty ,and dusty. Imagine a big high ceilinged dusty room, occupied by onli a table, sits my loony Malay teacher. He is nice guy, and lives behind me. He is there, happily marking homework away. We visit him there and talk cock with him.<br><br>Main bulding are first storey with P5 and P6. Second floor are office and library. I rarely step into the office, but visits the library alot. Sad to say, unlike SG, Malaysia at that time prides themselves on literature, so the library is not only well used, we have deep interaction with our teachers on Malay literature, as well as having poem presentation by the pond side.<br><br>Did I mentioned pond? I dont know what to call it, coz its a big concrete pond with no water and a shelter in the middle. Dry during hot weather, and filled up during rainy season, along with frogs and tadpoles.<br><br>Canteen? Just one stall, with very long counter. You want mee rebus, go one corner, you want nasi lemak, go another. Centre are drinks and snacks. My grandma always gave me 20 sens on Friday. By Sunday, I would have spend it on nasi lemak. Mind u, real nasi lemak, not the nasi padang we have in SG, plus its a lot....<br><br>Field. One humongous field, shared with the Tamil school next door. In Malaysia, we have Chinese, Malay, and Tamil medium school. My mum and I were from Malay medium, so called National School, while my father was from Chinese school.
