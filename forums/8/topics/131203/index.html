He loves, marries, and abuses his wife, Sashi Biswas; Michael Mukherjee is a student leader, who wants politicians like Prosonjeet Bhattacharya, to keep away from college elections; and then there is Arjun, carefree and spoilt, in love with Mira, who he just met, and who at one time wanted to relocate to the U.S., but then after meeting Michael, changes his mind and wants to be a politician. The paths of these three young men cross each others', resulting in violent changes in all their lives.<br><br>Strong Cast - Ajay Devgan, Vivek Oberoi, Abhishek Bachchan ,Esha, Kareena Kapoor, Rani Mukherjee<br><br>Jogger's Park<br>15 May<br><br>A retired Judge starts going for a morning walk in Jogger's park where he falls for a young vibrant girl who has set many a heart aflutter. Mukta Art's Jogger's Park' is a mature love story that defies the Bollywood stereotype.<br><br>Late director Anant Balani-directed Jogger's Park' takes a fresh look at the complexities of the emotion called love. The relationship between an aged man and a young girl might seem odd to a few orthodox minds, but it is a reality of life<br><br>The movie starts off at a slow pace showing the gradual development of relation between Jenny and the Judge, as the retired man's adoration for the young girl changes to desire and later on into love. On the whole, ‘Jogger's Park' is interesting and captures your attention until the very end. The movie will appeal to both youngsters and elderly.<br><br>Strong Cast - Perizaad Zorabian, Victor Banerji<br><br><img src="http://artscentral.mediacorptv.com/Whats_Showing/Screen%20Asia/imgs/kuchnakaho.jpg"><br>Kuch Na Kaho (Don't Say Anything)<br>22 May<br><br>Raj [Abhishek Bachchan] lives in New York with his mother, Dr. Malhotra [Suhasini Mulay]. They are very close and share a great rapport. But there is one issue they can't see eye to eye on: his mother wants him to settle down… Raj won't hear of an arranged marriage.<br><br>When Raj visits India for his cousin's wedding, his maternal uncle [Satish Shah] emotionally blackmails him into agreeing to arrange meetings with eligible girls. To make matters worse, the person his uncle chooses as the matchmaker and go-between for these meetings is the one person Raj has already antagonized in his 24 hours in Mumbai.<br><br>That person is Namrata [Aishwarya Rai], Raj's uncle's favourite employee at his design studio. She is only too happy to put Raj through this torture.<br><br>Strong Cast - Aishwarya Rai, Abhishek Bachchan<br><br><img src="http://artscentral.mediacorptv.com/Whats_Showing/Screen%20Asia/imgs/munnabhai.jpg"><br><br>Munna Bhai MBBS (Mr Munna - The Doctor)<br>22 May<br><br>Munnabhai [Sanjay Dutt] lives with his gang in the bylanes of a dhobi ghat in Mumbai, takes pride in being a 'social worker' [they actually settle 'financial disputes' through dadagiri ] and enjoys his booze, babes, brawls…<br><br>Munna's father, Hari Prasad Sharma [Sunil Dutt], an upright, moralistic man, believes that his son is actually a doctor running a charity hospital. Every year, when his parents arrive, Munna and his gang bathe, shave, don white coats and stethoscopes and pretend to be diligent doctors.<br><br>But the clever charade falls apart. Hari Prasad Sharma runs into an old friend, Dr. Asthana [Boman Irani], who has a daughter called Suman [Gracy Singh]. The two decide that their children, both doctors, would make a perfect match. Munna tries hard to save the situation, but his father discovers the truth. And all hell breaks loose.<br>Hari Prasad Sharma, now broken by the truth, removes his white spotless pagdi and cries. Munnabhai then takes a decision that would change many lives<br></div>
