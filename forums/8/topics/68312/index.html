            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry I have not expressed myself clearly, i was surfing some net and came across this: from  http://www.womanht.com/love/how_to_tell_if_a_girl_likes_you.htm<br><br><blockquote>How to tell if a girl likes you?<br>"how can i tell if the girl i like, likes me too?","united states of america","15"<br><br>I learnt this trick from a friend years ago. Look into her eyes.<br><br>If her pupils are dilated while she is talking to you, it could mean<br><br>She is interested in you<br>She is interested in the topic you are discussing.<br>There is not enough light in the room. A person's pupils dilate in a dark room to let in enough light in order to see clearly.<br><br>Check that out.<br><br>If you have access to her friends, they may hint to you if she is interested in you. You could ask them directly if you dare. Bear in mind that they may tell her that you asked and the girls would speculate your intentions.<br><br>Good luck</blockquote>So i was asking if anyone here can support this claim of dilating pupils?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For both sexes...<br><br>There are no fixed rules.... to tell. Different ppl respond differently.<br>The most evident for women (does not work for all) will be agreement to a one to one date.<br><br>If he/she does not agree, doesnt mean no chance also..<br><br>like I mentioned before.. it's different for different ppl. Some ppl intentionally help you in every way, some ppl intentionally create trouble for you in every way.<br><br>Well, the easiest way is to ask. (but doesnt mean u get 100% honest answers)<br><br>Human are mostly fickle-minded and most people take a longer time to make a decision, so the longer you understand one another, the better you understand the person.<br><br>Well, don't jump to conclusions or you'll regret.</div>

However according to CloUdiSm remix III; Art of body language - it states that the overall package of the woman must be considered instead of relying on a tool to delude yourself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Some woman are skilled in the art of seduction which makes pupil dilating easy to be done. Body language is to be read and personality is to be analyized - A complicating process.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Know why is it so difficult if someone truely likes you? Because how you're feeling, is only your preception towards her attitude unless the girl/guy tells you directly. And in fact, you could be entering into his/her friendly seduction that has no condition attached or worst - she is just being herself, you mistook her intention.<br><br>Cheers</div>
