            <div class='col-md body'>Saw this article from some website<br><br><blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5 signs say it all</span><br>Here are the top five signs that you can look for to know if a woman is attracted to you when you first begin spending time with her:<br><br>1- She touches you. This is one of the most telling signs. In many instances you will find that the woman you're out on a first date with will not touch you at all. Why not? Because she's not attracted to you. But when you're out on a date with a woman who likes you, you will notice that, in most cases, she will find an excuse to physically touch you in some way during the date.<br><br>Often it won't be a clearly obvious move like holding your hand or taking your arm as you both walk down the street together. That can happen, however, and it's a great sign when it does. More often though, the kind of touching I'm talking about will be something as seemingly insignificant as a tap on the shoulder from her or her knee "accidentally" bumping yours and lingering for an extra second before she withdraws it.<br><br>If you end a first date with a woman, and she hasn't touched you in any way whatsoever during your entire time together, then chances are you're dead in the water. But if she even just tapped your shoulder once that night while laughing at one of your jokes,for instance, then you're in play.<br><br>If she tapped your shoulder three times during the evening and then grabbed your arm for a couple of seconds to guide you over to a book she wanted you to see while the two of you were browsing a bookstore -- then you're in the money! The more she touches you and the more often she touches you, the higher her Interest Level in you.<br><br>2- She compliments you. A woman who has high interest in you, even after only knowing you for an hour or two, will often give you one or more sincere compliments. And if there is a sparkle in her eye when she delivers the compliment, then you've got yourself a bona fide high Interest Level sign.<br><br>3- She exhibits genuine curiosity about you. A woman who has no romantic interest in you whatsoever will still ask you polite questions about yourself. "So where did you grow up? Where do your parents live? What kind of work do you do?"<br><br>But a woman who really likes you will show a genuine, warm, curious interest in you. She'll want to know what makes you tick. She'll want to know what's important and meaningful in your life. As you look into her eyes, you'll be able to see the wheels turning as she's trying to figure you out. That's high interest.<br><br>4- She makes reference(s) to future activities together. You tell her that you're an avid rollerblader and in response she says, "I love to rollerblade! Maybe we could go rollerblading together sometime."<br><br>5- She gives you a nice kiss at the end of the date. At the end of your first date with a woman, you should always make a move for a lovely kiss. No big deal, just a kiss. The way that she responds to you as your lips move toward hers will give you crucial feedback.<br><br>If she turns her head and gives you "The Cheek" before your lips can touch hers, then it's hasta la vista, baby. But if she responds warmly and enthusiastically kisses you back, then, dude, you've got a live one.<br><br>Remember guys; you gotta hit at least four out of five.</blockquote>Although i think point 5 doesnt realy apply to more conservative asian people like us.<br></div>
