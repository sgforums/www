            <div class='col-md body'>I ran a software development firm during my NS days. Took a hell of a lot of energy out of me, I was running on 2 or 3 hrs sleep a night. Aged me a lot. Not to mention the fact that you need very cooperative superiors and social engineering to get "off" when you need to.<br><br>If you can, don't do it until ORD. The interruptions (have to go for exercises, mobilisations, etc.) are really annoying, especially when you have to meet clients or rushing for a deadline. After you ORD, you can concentrate fully on the business. For me, business performance picked up nearly 2 or 3 fold after I ORDed. So you may find it not worth your while to run your company during NS, especially if when you see your friends book out to have real fun while you go home to work. Then again, this will really test if you are passionate about your line of work.<br><br>All the best</div>

That is why Singapore is not reknown for its entrepreneurs. However, drive and passion is half the battle won. It also depends on what you do with that passion. NS will definetely change your perspective. It will help you establish contacts, learn people skills, getting out of a sticky situation. In that way it is beneficial to you as a budding entrepreneur. Besides technical skills, people skills are very, very important especially in high product customization industries like mine where there is very high consumer participation.<br><br>Having business skills is very important too. I recommend you take the time and save money so that you can go for an MBA somewhere down the line. It really helped me to strategize and think hard about the business. Also helps to deal with customers and negotiate with them. I would say that without a business degree, I would not be able to manage the business as well or close as many sales. The paper qualification was a bonus but for me it was the actual business skills that are really worth something.</div>
