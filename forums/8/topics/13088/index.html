From a neutral by-stander's viewpoint, when someone is able to preach others to study their religion, why can't a free thinker ask him back to study his own religious book? When that someone has the time to preach others to follow their faith, why can't a freethinker advise him to spent more time in studying his own faith.<br><br>When judgement day is coming, and you think you are still sinful, it is wrong that i advise you to concentrate in your bible study? So such an advice to you is sarcasm and taunts hence being wrong when your preach for the rest to study bible is not wrong? What has the world become?? When we think we are not sinful, we are being forced to feel sinful. When they themselve are sinful, instead of accepting the advice to get more holy by spending more time studying the bible and praying in the church so that they can go heaven on that judgement day, they find it a sarcasm and taunts.<br><br>If this is so, guess i have no comments and hence i will offer my apology for giving such an advice in the first place.<br><br>I too hope peace to all. And hope that all those religious pple will end their religious war. We suffer enuff e.g. crusades, 911, what's more? a forums religious war? Come on, religious pple give non-religious pple a break.</div>
