            <div class='col-md body'>I feel like a loser complaining abt this problem but I can't take it anymore.<br><br>I'm 20, an NUS student &amp; my parents are so IRRITATINGLY conservative tt they hate it when any one of their daughters go out &amp; return home late. Late to them is anything from 11 plus at night onwards.<br><br>I return home at 11 plus &amp; they start nagging &amp; telling me off. Usually I just seethe &amp; keep quiet but it has its limits-lah. I'm a trouble-free kid...not involved in drugs &amp; whatever else. I don't even drink &amp; I don't even have a boyfriend &amp; my parents know that. They know I'm a good kid but they just get pissed off when i return home 'late' frm harmless activities like shoppg &amp; watching movies. I tell them a MILLION times tt I'm meetg friends &amp; they still have qualms abt me coming home late &amp; I'm bloody twenty years old.<br><br>It is getting to me...it really is. Does anyone know how I can handle this situatn? Don't ask me to talk to them coz they are bossy &amp; think they are always right. I'll move out but tt can only happen in 2 years time.<br><br>I might just lash out at them one day and I don't want that to happen. But it's freaking RIDICULOUS to keep reaching home by 11 plus when my friends are still out having fun.<br><br>Any suggestions?</div>
