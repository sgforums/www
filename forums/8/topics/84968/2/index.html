Once we define/ decided to work on a specific problem, we have to read and understand existing literature or publications to know the current state-of-the-art technology. This will then be a performance bench-mark for our work.<br><br>Thereafter we have to do proper research...finding novel ways to solve the problem and to improve the state-of-the-art technology. This may involve in sitting in-front-of the PC everyday coding and running simulations. It also means we have to read widely so that we can generate novel ideas. If we successfully produce good results, we publish our work.<br><br>To graduate, we have to show that we are capable to do independent research. The more publications we generate for our university, the better the uni will be ranked (of course there are other factors-not just publications). And of course more publications will look better on CV...to get better job.<br><br>Well its good that u have a plan...I'm sure you can realise your dream.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

It just depends on whether you think its the right time for yourself. Some prefer gaining work experience first. While this can be good, some people might feel that they have established themselves in a cooroprate world...why bother to do a PhD?....Some do get hournary PhDs...not a lot though.<br><br>Also, doing a PhD requires a lot of time, patience and effort. Your brain has to be constantly working and be creative so as to generate new ideas. Researchers generally work long hours (~12 to 14 hours).<br><br>Thus if he/she is doing a PhD once he/she has started a family (assuming with child/children), then he/she will have to balance properly.....one also has to consider the loss of potential earnings in terms of salary. Thus doing a PhD while young might not a bad idea as well.<br><br>Regarding the fact about doing a PhD is for academic position, it might not be always true. A lot of big multi-national companies (MNCs) have research facilities. Some examples are Microsoft, BBC, IBM....These companies have been active in their research activities.<br><br>Moreover, some companies prefer to employ PhDs (e.g. Google, Consulting firms). This is so because PhD training requires lots of perserverance, patience, creativity...(just to name a few). These companies look for abovementioned qualities from their perspective employees.<br><br>Hope that encourages more people to pursue their dreams...</div>
