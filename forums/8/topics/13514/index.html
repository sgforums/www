It showed that he loved God above all else. And God who was loving, stopped him from doing it, and provided a lamb instead for the sacrifice!<br><br>third, God wiped out the firstborn sons of egypt. why? becos the egyptians worshipped their own idols, and ignored turning to God, even after He had proven Himself to them by His 10 Plagues, and miracles of turning the waters into blood and such.<br>As a result, God who is JUDGE of all mankind, sentenced them to death.<br>I know God is loving.<br>but this doesnt mean that any1 can climb unto His head and play a fool!<br>God is also a Judge who has the right to decide sentences for the evil.<br>Since all of us are evil, we should turn to the sacrifice made for us in Christ, or face the JUDGEMENT of God Almighty.<br>if God had no right to end human life, who has? you? i dont think so.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>why did God ask the country of Israel to go into war in the Old Testament?<br>God is JUDGE, remember I said that.<br>He pronounced His Judgement upon the nations around Israel, who did not turn to the righteous path, and continued to live pagan lives.<br>As a result, they were condemned to death, and God commanded the nation of Israel to carry out the sentence.<br>The war in this account, is justified, becos God commanded it.<br>no war that mankind commands is righteous.<br>but if God speaks and commands it, it has to be so.<br>WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE WITH OSAMA THEN?<br>thing is, Christians have no cause to go into war, even if some fella claims that God is speaking to him now to get all Christians into war.<br>Why? Becos Jesus has already specified, that the end of all evil will come, when He returns in the Second Coming of Christ.<br>All will be judged and all evil will be wiped out then.<br>Its wat u call Judgement Day.<br>so He is holding back until that day.<br>And on that Day, HE will do the work.<br>we arent supposed to participate.<br>read Revelation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You know...sometimes I find it really coincidental that Christians and Jews of Israel are always the first to get whacked in a conflict.<br><br>I agree with sohguanh in the sense that if God destroys all that do not believe in Him, he is a tyrant, exactly like Saddam Hussein. But tyrants and assholes have their uses. For example Saddam Hussein's existence is used to keep the Iranians at bay and put the fear of war into the minds of the Middle Eastern people so they won't get funny ideas.<br><br>Is there a God so people like you fisherprice, are too occupied with him to do anything except post in forums trying to prove your point?<br><br>------------------<br>Honesty is the Worst policy when taking an exam in CME</div>

I feel that there is nothing debatable about vehement emotional opinions, which as a general reader of the Bible, you are entitled to have.<br><br>This analogy is probably way out of line, but in his times, D. H. Lawrence's books were considered taboo..yet today, they are considered as classics. The content has not changed, but the readership has. This is just to bring accross the point not to take your perceptions as the absolute black and white.<br><br>As for your supposed parallels between Christianity and atheism, afer sieving through your flowery, bombastic words, I can only supposed that you drew that conclusion because of the incarnation of God on earth.<br><br>Again, I won't quote from the Bible why Christians would believe that Jesus is God. Because the underlying presupposition to your words that Christianity is akin to athesim means that you must have thought that Christians are heavily deluded into mistakening a mere human for a higher being.<br><br>Sad isn't it, this "mass delusion" going round the world. Perhaps it is just the propagation of supersitition after all.<br><br>While we are on the subject of athesim, having tried to muddle through Bertrand Russell's "Of God and Religion", I still don't why understand why anybody would  athesim as a viable option.<br><br>Let's take the spotlight off Christianity for the time being?<br></div>
