            <div class='col-md body'>Hihi, recently I m quite troubled. I m currently working and now, I would like to study to upgrade myself or if possible, change career path.<br><br>But, the prob is I want to further my studies in S'pore and I couldn't get into the local university as my poly grades are poor. Going overseas is a prob too as I will feel lonely studying there all by myself. I m also not a very independent gal.<br><br>I hv make enquiries abt studying at SIM for the Open University programme. But the prob is they only offer part-time programme and the programme can only be completed in a minimum duration of 4 yrs. By that time, I will be in my mid-twenties liao.... so wat should I do??? Anyone got suggestions to help me??<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What do you want to do? Going overseas will allow you to experience another culture, and force you to get out of your comfort zone.<br><br>Also, I believe you will not be dependent on others forever. There will come a time when others will be dependent on you too, will u be able to manage?<br><br>If you have managed to get through kindy, primary school, secondary school as well as poly, I don't see why overseas uni will prove to be difficult. Just bear in mind that there are others out there who feel equally lonely too, and would enjoy your presence as you share your life with them. Don't feel shy, though there may be some that may be hiding behind a mask of an outgoing personality, they may be painfully lonely too.<br><br>As you have a poly education, most unis in Australia offer exemptions, so you can finish in 1.5 to 2 yrs.<br><br>Also,.... even if you don't further your education, you'll still be in your mid twenties in 4 yrs time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Cheers!<br><br>------------------<br>Speak when you are angry and you will make the best speech you will ever regret. -- A.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... so what's wrong with starting out again in your mid-twenties? All guys who go through NS and university start out in their mid-twenties too...<br><br>Anyway, nobody can really tell you what to do, you've already stated the two avenues which are available to you, namely doing a local course/degree or an overseas one.<br><br>Australia is a good destination, mainly because it's cheaper to go there, and yup, as Ixion has pointed out, you'll probably get at least 1 yr exemption for the course.<br><br>Take the opportunity to learn to be independent. In any case, there are quite a lot of singaporeans studying in australia, especially in melbourne.<br><br>Take your time to decide... i'm sure you'll make the right choice when the time comes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heylo autumn.. although you may think you are not an independent girl, I belive that once you go overseas, you would have no choice but to be independent cos mummy and daddy's not gonna be there to help you out.<br>If you really wanna upgrade yourself, it's worth it.<br><br>Going overseas to study ain't that bad. There usually are some like groups for foreign students to join etc.<br><br>Gd Luck!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That will have to depend on what you really want to do with your life.  What are your interests, eg maths, languages, etc.<br>Don't make the same mistake I made, that is, I chose a course at U I didn't like, but which was a very prestigious and highly-regarded one.  I ended up having a highly paid and respected job but I was miserable all the time (refer to my thread on "Worst Job I Ever Had").  In the end, I quit and found a new job which allowed me to explore my interests.  So to me, personal interest is the most importance criteria when choosing a career path.  Don't worry about age, I graduated at the ripe old age of 25!Good luck!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>AGE doesn't stands in ones way of personnel upgrading. I think Autumn is a homely pampered gal in here. Well take this as an oppurtunity to be on your own. Mid twenties, should be the prime time of maturity. You should be able to take decisions on your own.<br><br>As you can find that most the forumates in here have the same opinion.. Make decisions which you would never regret.<br><br>GOOD LUCK.............<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
