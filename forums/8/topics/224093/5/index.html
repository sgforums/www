To date, Hwa Chong Institution has produced the highest number of President's scholars among all junior colleges in Singapore. The President's scholarship is Singapore's most prestigious undergraduate award offered by the Public Service Commission. Hwa Chong students also take an impressive share of government and private organisation undergraduate scholarships every year. HCI admits pre-university students who are within the top 5% of the cohort. HCI has the distinction of being the top college for two elective programmes: namely, the Humanities Programme and the Chinese Language Elective Programme. HCI has the highest percentage of students awarded government scholarships for these two programmes.</div>
