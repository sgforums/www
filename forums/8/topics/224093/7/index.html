It has a rich Chinese legacy which reflects the strong heritage of Chinese culture in Singapore. <strong>"Ai Wo Hua Zhong" is not commie-like.</strong> It represents the strong sense of togetherness of the Chinese settlers prior to Singapore's independence and the strong sense of coherence among fellow students.<br><br>Today, as a leading educational institution in Southeast Asia, it has been hailed as "Eton of the East". It is the epitome of success in education in Singapore, funded by private donors who are interested in the well-being of Singapore's society. You never hear of Chinese High or Hwachong Alumnus who enters Singapore politics and supports GST hike, provides unapologetic comments if his kid made a hash insensitive comments on their blogs.<br><br>One noted alumni of Hwachong Institution is Ong Teng Cheong. He cared for the well-being of our nation. He was the first elected President of Singapore who wanted to check the health of national reserves. He requested access for records of transaction, only to be thwarted by you-know-who. His concern for the nation was also reflected in his role as the Secretary-General of NTUC. He sanctioned a strike for the Shipping Industry in January 1986 without approval from the cabinet, knowing well what their response would be. He was also instrumental in striking a deal between the workers and employers in the Shipping Industry that was in favour of the workers' welfare.<br><br>You don't hear such political endeavours and triumphs in social justice carried out by an ex-Rafflesian, do you? Clearly, Chinese High or Hwachong Institution does a better job in imparting values to smart people. Join Hwachong, not Raffles.</div>
