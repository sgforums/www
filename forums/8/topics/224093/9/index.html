            <div class='col-md body'>I would advise you not to take anecdotal evidences too seriously cos it is very unfair to generalise a school just based on interactions with a small minority and that is my opinion for all schools, not only mine.<br><br>At the end of the day, it all boils down to what you want to achieve in your 2 yrs of jc life. Ask yourself those questions and write it down. Check up what each school has to offer and the choice of your jc will become more obvious.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow.<br><br>You've just completed Secondary 3 and you're already <span style="font-style: italic;">planning ahead. </span><br><br>Regarding the statement that you made about RJ being the top school, I'm sorry to burst your bubble but HC's standard is going up. It allows the students to have a better balance of both the Chinese AND English languages as opposed to RJ which seems to focus more on English.<br><br>Well please do not judge a book by it's cover and say that you don't want to go to NJ just because of it's grey uniform. There's a reason for it being grey.<br><br>Don't just merely ask for people's opinions on the school because I'm very sure that everyone has a different opinion and one man's meat may be another man's poison, innit.<br><br>Some may say that "Oh, everyone in RJ is a nerd etcetc", but I'd say this is a sweeping statement. To what extent do would you actually think that this is true if you stepped into RJ? So if I can find one Rafflesian that isn't a "nerd", would this actually topple the whole thing about Rafflesians being nerds?<br><br>Come to think of it, you didn't bother doing any background check about Hwa Chong at all? Not even knowing the location of such a premier institute?<br>IF and only IF you do get into RJ, I'd like to tell you that often, it isn't always  intelligence that comes into play. To me, the location of HC should be common knowledge to many, taking into account the fact that there aren't many tertiary institutes in Singapore. {Correct me if I may be wrong, I'm open to suggestions}<br><br>Eventually, it is the school that chooses you and not you choosing the school.<br>All the best in your future endeavours. Though I'd suggest that you keep an open mind and heart and be ready to accept other alternatives, not only the one that you've set eyes on.</div>

It has a rich Chinese legacy which reflects the strong heritage of Chinese culture in Singapore. [b]"Ai Wo Hua Zhong" is not commie-like.</strong> It represents the strong sense of togetherness of the Chinese settlers prior to Singapore's independence and the strong sense of coherence among fellow students.<br><br>Today, as a leading educational institution in Southeast Asia, it has been hailed as "Eton of the East". It is the epitome of success in education in Singapore, funded by private donors who are interested in the well-being of Singapore's society. You never hear of Chinese High or Hwachong Alumnus who enters Singapore politics and supports GST hike, provides unapologetic comments if his kid made a hash insensitive comments on their blogs.<br><br>One noted alumni of Hwachong Institution is Ong Teng Cheong. He cared for the well-being of our nation. He was the first elected President of Singapore who wanted to check the health of national reserves. He requested access for records of transaction, only to be thwarted by you-know-who. His concern for the nation was also reflected in his role as the Secretary-General of NTUC. He sanctioned a strike for the Shipping Industry in January 1986 without approval from the cabinet, knowing well what their response would be. He was also instrumental in striking a deal between the workers and employers in the Shipping Industry that was in favour of the workers' welfare.<br><br>You don't hear such political endeavours and triumphs in social justice carried out by an ex-Rafflesian, do you? Clearly, Chinese High or Hwachong Institution does a better job in imparting values to smart people. Join Hwachong, not Raffles.[/b]</blockquote>yay yay! well said!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In my own honest opinion, it doesn't really matter which jc you enroll into. Ultimately, it is whether you can make the mark to a good university that matters. The harsh reality is "So what you've enrolled yourself amongst the most well-reputable jc?" At the end of the day, if u fail on your part to obtain an entry to university, your A level cert would be equal to useless and in most cases, inferior to that of a poly diploma. For me, all jcs are the same! Its the hardwork that matters really. And for your info, having enrolled into the most reputable jc doesn't really guarantee you'll be able to make most out of it! In fact, if you're talking about value-added learning etc, rjc is nowhere close to emerging junior colleges such as meridian jc and yishun jc, which both respectively ranked 1st and 2nd in value-addedness !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>.. Jcs are not for everybody.. some people do better in Poly.. ultimately is what type of training u want to have.. nowadays, poly might be a better option as it has become easier for them to get to uni n some of them do better than JC to uni graduates... if u are like me who cannot decide what to do at 16, JC might delay 2 more years of decision making..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  n on RJC, i heard u had to have physic tuition because the teacher don teach so going there means u are either really intelligent/ Einstein's quality or u have money to pay for tuition classes.</div>

Surprisingly NONE of my friends are going Hwa Chong even though they got 2 points too! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> Dont know if i would be very very very lonely there. I heard that Hwa Chong people are very friendly but I have no idea if its entirely true. The open house which I attended was quite okay, people are very hospitable and cheery. [b]Frankly, I never had a good impression of Raffles since young. Their arrogance is really detestable. I dont deny the fact that there are nice people in Raffles but currently, those people that I know of are really horrid.</strong> Speaking of a "English" vs. "Chinese" environment, I am okay with both, with a slight inclination to the English environment. And yes, I hope there arent too many China Scholars in Hwa Chong, even if there are, i hope they are those which I had encountered. lol. I hope it is not a wrong decision. If anyone can tell me more abt Hwa Chong, kindly PM me. I would be delighted.[/b]</blockquote>Hahaha, since I'm not in JC and I dont know if I'll ever have to make a choice about JCs ('cause I'm not currently in Singapore), I'll just tell you that regardless of where you go, there are going to be nice people and there are going to be some not-so-nice people. I currently have a very high opinion of Rafflesians, not 'cause they made it into those schools (unlike what some people believe), but 'cause I went to RGS for immersion. Maybe it's 'cause I was lucky and met only those nice people, but I actually found them quite welcoming and friendly. I saw somewhere that you're in Sec3? If that's true, then maybe you should also try to find others who are thinking about entering RJC? Though the people in RJC currently may not be very nice, your batch may be quite kind, and vice versa. (If you're not in Sec3, then I apologize xD) Mmm. Even if people are quite horrid, there are bound to be nice people. You should be fine if you find friends who have the same character and values as you. In such a big school, that shouldnt be too hard.<br>There are a few Rafflesians that I know (even though they're still in sec sch), but they know people in JC. If you're interested, just message me or smt.</div>
