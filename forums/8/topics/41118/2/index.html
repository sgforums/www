            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Master -_-:</div><div class="quote_body">My friend told me at school that he broke up after 8 months. Nothing unusual? He broke up last Sunday after the first time he met with his gf. You see, he has been in this relationship for about 8 months since knowing her through irc. Well, he is a quite fat and not so good looking guy while she, according to him, looks like a model and would be any trophy girlfriend for any guy. When they met up for the first time at Somerset, he told me that after identifying each other, she went straight to my friend's fae and told him that she doesn't like the way he looks and immediately told him to part off.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>My question to the floor is..<br><br>If you have an online relationship and if ur expectations are not met when you meet... would you break off? By the way, he is not the only one i know.. i got other friends like that..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> </div></blockquote>To me i dun believe in online relationship... Sometimes ppl inside are jus having fun.. Often those un-chio girls will tend to act chio online.. or acting as handsome guy which in fact they are not..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>In reality these people are not what they seems like in their real-life.. They have no confidence and feel inferior or maybe they are jus out for fun! And yes.. there are still a number of good people online.. And those are the people who really wanna make friends online.. and not jus playing fool around...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Online relationship how long can it ever last? I'm not saying those have already met with each other n then went into a relationship.. But i'm referring to those who even don;t know how the other party looks like and they can be in a relationship thru online?? I can guarantee most guys/gals (i say most not ALL) will tend to go for looks when chosing their partner.. Moreover is an online.. If you describe yourself as so good.. so handsome.. but in the end turn out to be like not what you have mention.. Of cos there will be disappointment.. But to continue this relations is up to individual..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>For your friend case.. I feel sorry for him.. That girl is out to look for handsome guy and nOTHING ELSE!! No matter what happen in those 8 months.. Jus one day or jus one sentence from her.. everything goes down the drain.. Jus be cos she doesn't like his looks or he's too fat?? What about all the time they spend talkin to each other.. ALL the efforts, caring and loving that your friend has give and put in?? If your friend were to turn out to be some macho guy tall and handsome, do you think the situation will still be same?? NO! Is it all worthwhile ?? She also dun say such things to your friend.. IS very hurting to him!! Well, I don't know how they lasted for 8 months... and they never even meet up before considering into a relation..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>In a cyber r/s its hard to find true love in it... They can meet better woman offline.. who is willing to accept for who they are and what they are... Why wanna chose to go online and look for a decent gf?? After such an incident.. i guess your friend has learned his lessons.. Even if he were to find someone really click with him.. Come out n meet first.. Dun straight away go into a relationship without even knowing her EXACTLY! YOu only know her by online.. But what about offline?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Many ppl do act differently in online and offline.. certain things you may not take notice of.. But others can tell the difference for you.. Sometimes offline you dun dare to show your another side of you.. but when comes online.. you will show it out.. cos ITS ONLINE.. noone knows who you are, how you look like.. One in online can be so arrogant and speak whatever that comes to their mind without considering... BUt when he's offline.. You get to see him.. he may not be what he seems in online.. Unreasonable or aggressive type..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>If one were to show exactly what they are online and offline the same... i'm very impressed.. Even myself.. i think i'm somehow different online and offline bah.. Not sure too! If in my case.. i would not go into a relationship online.. SOmehow i dun trust or believe in cyber relations...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Remind your friends that not only online you can find girls.. There are lots of them out there.. Make more friends first.. Then later slowly consider whether should you or should you not go into a relations where both has feelings for both.. AND provided they have already know each other and met up with one another!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
