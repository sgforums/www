Well, he is a quite fat and not so good looking guy while she, according to him, looks like a model and would be any trophy girlfriend for any guy. When they met up for the first time at Somerset, he told me that after identifying each other, she went straight to my friend's fae and told him that she doesn't like the way he looks and immediately told him to part off.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>My question to the floor is..<br><br>If you have an online relationship and if ur expectations are not met when you meet... would you break off?
