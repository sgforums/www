            <div class='col-md body'>1. My life is likely to last 10 to 15 years. Any separation from you will be very painful.<br><br>2. Give me time to understand what you want from me. So not break my spirit with your temper though I will always forgive you. Your patience will teach me more effectively.<br><br>3. Please have me spayed or neutered if you don't want puppies from me.<br><br>4. Treat me kindly, my beloved friend, for no heart in all the world is more grateful for your kindness than mind. Don't be angry with me for long and don't lock me up as punishment. After all, you have your job, your friends, your entertainment. I have only you.<br><br>5. Speak to me often. Even if I don't understand your words, I understand your voice when it's speaking to me. Your voice is the sweetest sound I ever hear, as you must know by my enthusiasm whenever I hear your footsteps.<br><br>6. Take me in when it's cold and wet. I'm a domestic animal and am no longer accustomed to the bitter elements. I ask for little more than your gentle hands petting me. Keep my bowl filled with water. Feed me good food so that I may stay well to romp and play and do your bidding. By your side, I stand ready, willing and able to share my life with you, for that is what I live for. I'll never forget how well you've treated me.<br><br>7. Don't hit me. Remember, I have teeth that could easily crush the bones in your hand, but I choose not to bite you.<br><br>8. Before you scold me for being lazy or uncooperative, ask yourself if something might be bothering me. Perhaps I'm not getting the right food, I've been out in the sun too long, or my heart may be getting weak.<br><br>9. Take care of me when I get old for you will grow old, too.<br><br><strong>10. When I am old or when I no longer enjoy good health, please do not make heroic efforts to keep me going. I am not having fun. Just see to it that my trusting life is taken gently and be with me on that difficult journey when it's time to say goodbye. Never say, "I just can't bear to watch." Everything is easier for me when you are there. I will leave this earth knowing with my last breath that my fate was always safest in your hands.<br><br>I know that number 10 on my list will be very hard for you and I may not at that time be able to say anything to you, but with my eyes. So when that day comes, I would like you to remember the words of my little poem I wrote just for you my loving owner!(Read below)</strong></div>

When the time comes, please, let me go.<br><br>Take me to where to my needs they'll tend, only, stay with me till the end And hold me firm and speak to me, until my eyes no longer see.<br><br>I know in time you will agree, it is a kindness you do to me. Although my tail its last has waved, from pain and suffering I have been saved. Don't grieve that it must be you, who has to decide this thing to do; We've been so close -- we two -- these years, don't let your heart hold any tears<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From Yr Doggy:<br>Sometimes it is hard for me to be good. I really try, but you humans can be really confusing. I made a list of what I need to be a good Shih Tzu. Please read it and don't get mad at me. I'm not perfect but I love you.<br><br>I need consistent rules. I really don't mind rules, in fact, knowing the rules and that you will be consistent and fair makes me feel more secure.<br><br>I need to know what you want me to do. I get so discouraged when all I hear is "NO!" from you. Please train me so I know what to do to stay out of trouble.<br><br>I need lots of exercise. You might think I am exercising when you put me out in the yard, but sometimes I just lay there and get bored. Please take me for a walk or throw my ball for me. Sometimes I need to run and play with other dogs. I like to use my nose to find things too.<br><br>I need to be with you. Please let me be in the house with you. I get so lonely that I dig or bark or jump the fence when I am outside alone too long.<br><br>My ancestors had a job to do to keep them busy. Maybe it was herding, or bringing back ducks, or killing rats. What is my job now? Everyone says they want a smart dog, but us smart dogs get bored! When I find things to amuse me and keep me busy, sometimes it makes you mad. Please find something for me to do.<br><br>If I growl, please take the time to figure out why. I might be hurting somewhere, or maybe the kids are playing too rough with me and I have to warn them.<br><br>I need a quiet place that is mine. Sometimes I just want to rest.<br><br>I need a way to release tensions and amuse myself. Chewing is one of my favorite activities, even after I'm grown up. Please give me safe chewtoys so I don't make a mistake and make you mad.<br><br>Please take me places with you and let me meet different people. If I stay at home all the time, the world seems like a scary place. And when I'm scared I might have to growl to make people go away.<br><br>I need to know where I stand. I really want you to be the boss, so I don't have to make all the decisions. I am happy to follow your rules, but please don't yell at me. Just be consistent so I can learn what to do.<br><br>Pay attention to me when I am being good, and praise me. If you ignore me too much, I will find ways to get your attention, even if it means you get upset!<br><br></div>

We've got dogs with us."
