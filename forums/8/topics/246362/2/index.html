            <div class='col-md body'>From a Puppy and Her Vacuum Cleaner <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>"My name is Athena of Terridon, I am a Shih Tzu and I am the leader of the pack at Terridon. As the leader it was up to me and me alone to destroy the Suck-U-Up! Here is my true story as I lived it.................."<br><br>I finally did it! I killed the Suck-U-Up! The humans call it a vacuum cleaner, but being dogs, we call it like it is. That thing is really a predator! It sucks the unwary dog up into its bowels NEVER TO BE SEEN OR HEARD AGAIN! That's why every dog I've ever known either tries to kill it or runs and hides when the Suck-U-Up comes out to eat. The humans act like they're controlling it, but I don't think so. They sure have a lot of trouble getting it to stop eating! Almost never does until it's sated, then it goes back into its den. That's why, for my entire 2 years, whenever I've gotten the chance, I've tried to kill the Suck-U-Up living at our house. Now that I've finally succeeded in killing one, I want every dog to know IT CAN BE DONE!<br><br>You know how Suck-U-Ups hunt. They come out from behind a wall somewhere and search the house, scavenging whatever they can reach. Most adults are fairly safe from Suck-U-Ups. If you reach adulthood in a house where one lives, you've learned how to survive, either by fleeing or defending yourself. I'm sure they eat puppies regularly. If you have a Suck-U-Up at your house and members of your pack ever have pups, you've seen the proof. Think how often puppies disappear after a Suck-U-Up's been out hunting.<br><br>I'll tell you how I killed the one at my house. It may help you do in the one at yours. The Suck-U-Up came out to hunt one evening. My mistress grabbed it and held on-humans are generally good providers, but they've really forgotten how to defend their pack against predators! I ran into the room and began my attack. I concentrated on its head and neck. That usually scares it away, but today I got lucky. (Persistence really does pay off!) Suddenly it stopped snarling! It continued to make those sucking sounds, but no more snarling. I'd weakened it considerably! The mistress was then able to make it stop sucking.She checked it over thoroughly. She found great masses of shredded paper and hair that it couldn't swallow. Helen of Troy, Adonis and Aterrius of Terridon all say it probably choked to death rather than dying from injuries from my attack, but they are just mad because I, not them, was the one who killed it. And, anyway, I helped the puppies spread the shredded paper it choked on. The mistress cleared that stuff away from its throat. It tried to eat again, but without growling at us. Fortunately, it was very weak and near death. The mistress silenced it again and began to tear it open (with one of those fancy teeth, from their special boxes, that they use rather than their very poor planteater teeth.) It just lay there. It didn't growl or try to hunt anymore, didn't even slink back into the wall. I overheard the mistress telling others the Suck-U-Up was indeed dead.<br><br>Unfortunately, there are lots of Suck-U-Ups, at least one per house. Less than a week after I killed the one (I was certain their was only one) living in our house, I discovered the mistress trying to restrain another one! You can kill them, with perseverance attacks-and some shredded paper; but you'll get no rest. Another will move right in to take over the dead one's territory, and you'll have to start fighting, all over again, against this new one!<br><br></div>

Where are their priorities?<br><br>Dear God, When we get to Heaven, can we sit on your couch? Or is it the same old story?<br><br>Dear God, Excuse me, but why are there cars named after the jaguar, the cougar, the mustang, the colt, the stingray, and the rabbit, but not one named for a Shih Tzu? How often do you see a cougar riding around? We Shih Tzus love a nice ride! I know every breed cannot have its own model, but it would be easy to rename the Chrysler Eagle the Chrysler Shih Tzu!<br><br>Dear God, If a Shih Tzu barks his head off in the forest and no human hears him, is he still a bad Shih Tzu?<br><br>Dear God, Is it true that in Heaven, dining room tables have on-ramps?<br><br>Dear God, If we come back as humans, is that good or bad?<br><br>Dear God, More meatballs, less spaghetti, please.<br><br>Dear God, When we get to the Pearly Gates, do we have to shake hands to get in?<br><br>Dear God, We Shih Tzus can understand human verbal instructions, hand signals, whistles, horns, clickers, beepers, scent IDs, electromagnetic energy fields, and Frisbee flight paths. What do humans understand?<br><br>Dear God, Are there Shih Tzus on other planets or are we alone? I have been howling at the moon and stars for a long time, but all I ever hear back is that Retriever across the street!<br><br>Dear God, Are there mailmen in Heaven? If there are, will my bull dog friend have to apologize?<br><br>Dear God, Is it true that Shih Tzus are not allowed in restaurants because we can't make up our minds what NOT to order?

            <div class='col-md body'>kinda lengthy. read only if interested. sad story. got it from my email years ago.<br><br>When I was a puppy, I entertained you with my antics and made you laugh. You called me your child, and despite a number of chewed shoes and a couple of murdered throw pillows, I became your best friend.<br><br>Whenever I was "bad," you'd shake your finger at me and ask "How could you?" -- but then you'd relent and roll me over for a bellyrub. My housebreaking took a little longer than expected, because you were terribly busy, but we worked on that together.<br><br>I remember those nights of nuzzling you in bed and listening to your confidences and secret dreams, and I believed that life could not be any more perfect. We went for long walks and runs in the park, car rides, stops for ice cream (I only got the cone because "ice cream is bad for dogs" you said), and I took long naps in the sun waiting for you to come home at the end of the day.<br><br>Gradually, you began spending more time at work and on your career, and more time searching for a human mate. I waited for you patiently, comforted you through heartbreaks and disappointments, never chided you about bad decisions, and romped with glee at your homecomings, and when you fell in love.<br><br>She, now your wife, is not a "dog person" -- still I welcomed her into our home, tried to show her affection, and obeyed her. I was happy because you were happy.<br><br>Then the human babies came along and I shared your excitement. I was fascinated by their pinkness, how they smelled, and I wanted to mother them, too. Only she and you worried that I might hurt them, and I spent most of my time banished to another room, or to a dog crate. Oh, how I wanted to love them, but I became a "prisoner of love."<br><br>As they began to grow, I became their friend. They clung to my fur and pulled themselves up on wobbly legs, poked fingers in my eyes, investigated my ears, and gave me kisses on my nose. I loved everything about them and their touch -- because your touch was now so infrequent -- and I would've defended them with my life if need be. I would sneak into their beds and listen to their worries and secret dreams, and together we waited for the sound of your car in the driveway.<br><br>There had been a time, when others asked you if you had a dog, that you produced a photo of me from your wallet and told them stories about me. These past few years, you just answered "yes" and changed the subject. I had gone from being "your dog" to "just a dog," and you resented every expenditure on my behalf.<br><br>Now, you have a new career opportunity in another city, and you and they will be moving to an apartment that does not allow pets. You've made the right decision for your "family," but there was a time when I was your only family.<br><br>I was excited about the car ride until we arrived at the animal shelter. It smelled of dogs and cats, of fear, of hopelessness. You filled out the paperwork and said "I know you will find a good home for her." They shrugged and gave you a pained look. They understand the realities facing a middle-aged dog, even one with "papers."<br><br>You had to pry your son's fingers loose from my collar as he screamed "No, Daddy! Please don't let them take my dog!" And I worried for him, and what lessons you had just taught him about friendship and loyalty, about love and responsibility, and about respect for all life.<br><br>You gave me a good-bye pat on the head, avoided my eyes, and politely refused to take my collar and leash with you. You had a deadline to meet and now I have one, too. After you left, the two nice ladies said you probably knew about your upcoming move months ago and made no attempt to find me another good home. They shook their heads and asked "How could you?"<br><br>They are as attentive to us here in the shelter as their busy schedules allow. They feed us, of course, but I lost my appetite days ago. At first, whenever anyone passed my pen, I rushed to the front, hoping it was you that you had changed your mind -- that this was all a bad dream... or I hoped it would at least be someone who cared, anyone who might save me.<br><br>When I realized I could not compete with the frolicking for attention of happy puppies, oblivious to their own fate, I retreated to a far corner and waited. I heard her footsteps as she came for me at the end of the day, and I padded along the aisle after her to a separate room.<br><br>A blissfully quiet room. She placed me on the table and rubbed my ears, and told me not to worry. My heart pounded in anticipation of what was to come, but there was also a sense of relief. The prisoner of love had run out of days. As is my nature, I was more concerned about her. The burden which she bears weighs heavily on her, and I know that, the same way I knew your every mood.<br><br>She gently placed a tourniquet around my foreleg as a tear ran down her cheek. I licked her hand in the same way I used to comfort you so many years ago. She expertly slid the hypodermic needle into my vein. As I felt the sting and the cool liquid coursing through my body, I lay down sleepily, looked into her kind eyes and murmured "How could you?"<br><br>Perhaps because she understood my dog speak, she said "I'm so sorry." She hugged me, and hurriedly explained it was her job to make sure I went to a better place, where I wouldn't be ignored or abused or abandoned, or have to fend for myself -- a place of love and light so very different from this earthly place.<br><br>And with my last bit of energy, I tried to convey to her with a thump of my tail that my "How could you?" was not directed at her. It was directed at you, My Beloved Master, I was thinking of you. I will think of you and wait for you forever. May everyone in your life continue to show you so much loyalty.</div>
