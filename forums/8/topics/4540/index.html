            <div class='col-md body'>I found this article on slashdot.org and for those who dun read slashdot... do it now... But trivialities aside... here's the whole watever...<br><br>"How do I find a woman like her?" I often get asked this question by young computer dudes who meet my<br>lovely wife, Debbie, and wonder how an old ugly guy like me managed to get hold of such a wonderful<br>woman while smarter, studlier young guys (like them) seem to strike out with every female they meet.<br>These lonely youngsters all seem to think I must have a set of magic rules for attracting females. And guess what? I do.<br>Click "Read More" and I'll share them with you.<br><br>Don't Waste Your Time on Geek Girls<br>Here you are, an obsessed coder and all that, spending 2/3 of your waking time online and clicking on Slashdot five times a<br>day. Wouldn't it be nice if you could find a woman who shares your interests?<br><br>No!<br><br>A woman just like you wouldn't be there for you when you wanted a hug. She'd be obsessively coding or posting on<br>Slashdot herself, and would brush you off when you needed her. What you really want is a woman who will be there for you<br>when you get tired of staring at your monitor and need some loving, but will leave you alone and not demand your attention<br>when you're busy. You don't want a Geek Girl. You want a woman who is willing and able to meet a geek's needs, which is<br>not the same thing at all.<br><br>Men involved in activities that demand long periods of intense concentration (programmers, artists, writers, musicians, etc.)<br>need women who will respect what they do and help them do it well, not women who compete with them.<br><br>We need what are now called "old fashioned girls" who don't mind cooking our meals, rubbing our sore shoulders, and<br>running our bath water for us. There are plenty of these women out there. They're as eager to find you as you are to find<br>them. The trick is sorting through the 6 billion people on this planet to find the woman who is right for you instead of wasting<br>your time on women with whom you cannot possibly build a long-term, mutually beneficial relationship.<br><br>Forget the Girls in Playboy<br>The silicone-enhanced babes you see posing in skin mags and on porn Web sites aren't interested in you. Neither are the<br>blondies you see hanging on football players' arms, and even if one of them suddenly decides you'd be a nice change after<br>the other men she's had in her life, you'll probably be disappointed with her.<br><br>I've gone out with more than a few "hot babes" in my time (I wasn't always married) and I generally found them to be more<br>trouble than they were worth. Women who look great aren't necessarily good in bed, and those who have learned how to<br>use their looks as a tool to manipulate men will almost always make your life miserable in the long run. If nothing else,<br>they're expensive. Do you have any idea how much someone like Pamela Anderson spends on clothes, makeup, and<br>cosmetic surgery every year? Trust me: it's more than you can afford unless you're a rock star or the CEO of Oracle (Hi,<br>Larry!), and even then it's more than she's probably worth.<br><br>When you take off their clothes and their makeup, many "hot" women are really rather plain. The trick is to find a woman<br>who doesn't spend a lot of time and money cuting herself up, but is pleasant to hold once all the packaging is removed. She'll<br>be more likely to want some cuddling than the vain ones, and, unlike them, will concentrate on loving you instead of<br>worrying about getting her hair messed up.<br><br>Practical hint: ever notice how, at a dance or in a bar, 90% of the men try to glom on to 10% of the women? Be smarter than<br>those guys! Pay attention to the women who look nice but unspectacular and are being ignored because they aren't<br>perfectly dressed or made up. The best software usually doesn't come in the fanciest box, right? The same goes for girls.<br><br>It's Okay to be Tongue-Tied<br>Don't worry about other men being "smooth talkers" while you're not. Many, possibly most, of your male ancestors were<br>even less verbal than you, but they still managed to reproduce. (See your mirror for evidence.) Women don't always choose<br>men based on slick opening lines. Indeed, many women tend to be put off by prepared "seduction" speeches, and prefer an<br>honest, if slightly tongue-tied, guy to one who who comes across as having practiced pickup lines for hours on end.<br><br>And your clothes don't make all that much difference to women as long as they're appropriate for the time and place. Be<br>clean and neat. That's all you need.<br><br>A woman who is only interested in your designer outfits is not only likely to be too shallow for you, but may also be<br>interested in seeing you only in your fancy clothes, not out of them. This is not the right woman for you!<br><br>There's More to Life Than Computing<br>The biggest mistake I see computer-obsessed men make when getting to know women is to talk about nothing but<br>computer stuff all the time. My wife uses her computer all day long as a working tool, but neither knows nor cares what kind<br>of NIC (a 3Com) or how much RAM (64 MB) it has inside. If I want to discuss PC hardware I do it with male friends, not<br>with my wife.<br><br>The best way to handle a conversation with a woman, especially one you've just met, is to find out what interests her. Ask<br>her questions! Not whether she likes to be tied to the bed with ribbons and have her tummy tongue-tickled (at least not on a<br>first date) but about her hopes and dreams in life, favorite TV shows, and other general interest things like that. Work and<br>school are usually safe conversational starting points.<br><br>You've heard this before, but body language is more important than your words. So look at the girl! I mean her eyes, not<br>her breasts. Don't cross your arms and legs as though you're trying to protect yourself from her. If you want to touch her<br>arm, and she's close, go ahead. Maybe she'll touch you back. If your touch wasn't overly intrusive, returning it will be a<br>natural, almost instinctive, reaction on her part.<br><br>You're a little shy and awkward? No big deal. She may be just as shy as you are. Don't push her. If she finds you at all<br>attractive, she'll find subtle ways to be close to you without making it look as if she's being pushy.<br><br>And if the girl finds you unattractive, she'll let you know that, too (so you can dump her before you get too serious). Paying<br>attention is the key to picking up the signals either way. If you're having trouble understanding the lady's vibes, ask<br>questions! All females come with HOWTOs. Verbal ones. Ask them questions like, "Does this feel good?" and they'll<br>answer. They also like honest compliments, so if you touch the back of her hand and it makes you feel all warm inside, go<br>ahead and say, "Touching the back of your hand makes me feel all warm inside."<br><br>That's certainly a lot classier than, "You got nice boobs," which is a statement virtually guaranteed to put off almost any<br>woman who isn't selling her body for drug money.<br><br>In other words, you don't have to be slick with women, but being stupid or crude with them gets you nowhere. (Unless you<br>like stupid, crude women.)<br><br>Teenagers Take Heart: It Gets Better<br>All teenage boys are idiots when it comes to girls. And teenage girls are idiots when it comes to boys. The girls who laugh at<br>you in high school laugh because they're nervous and, if you're exceptionally bright, posibly because they're a little bit<br>scared of you. Sooner or later those same girls will get over their stupid crushes on Ricky Martin (in my time it was Ringo<br>Starr), and other unreachable figures, and decide to look seriously at guys like you. This change generally comes between<br>the ages of 18 and 25. Meanwhile, you may have matured a bit yourself by then, so that when the ditzy girls of today turn<br>into tomorrow's adult women, you will no longer look or act like the dork they thought you were in high school<br><br>One warning: be gracious, not obnoxious, to girls you find ugly at the age of 15 or 16. There was a girl named Jessica who<br>had a slight crush on me in high school for some unkown reason. She had horrible acne, bad posture, braces, ugly glasses,<br>and wore tacky, faded dresses. She was also a straight-A student -- and slightly arrogant about it. I was not nice to this<br>girl. Hardly anyone was -- except a very ordinary, slightly geeky guy named Mike.<br><br>At 18, Jessica suddenly changed. It was like a movie makeover. She got new glasses and the braces came off. She got a<br>better wardrobe, her acne cleared up, and she stopped being stuck-up about her academic achievements. And she grew ...<br>breasts. She took longer than most to develop in the chest department, but the results were worth waiting for. You know the<br>rest of the story. It was Mike all the way. I'd blown my chance by being a jerk. I still have a flat spot on my forehead from<br>banging it against the wall over Jessica.<br><br>Women Are More Complicated than Computers<br>I think this is why so many guys hide their heads in their monitors instead of going out and meeting women. Understanding<br>women is harder than figuring out the hardest computer game, harder even than setting up a secure 200-client network<br>running *BSD. But women can offer more satisfaction than even an overclocked, dual-Celeron workstation, so learning<br>how to deal with them is worth the extra effort.<br><br>I believe the greatest frustration about women for men who are used to dealing with Open Source software is that you<br>cannot fix flaws you find in them. You pretty much have no choice but to take them the way they are. For example, my wife<br>likes to redecorate frequently, which sometimes annoys me, but I've learned to shrug my shoulders and call this part of her<br>personality a feature, not a bug, and to accept it with the same good grace with which I accept a certain respected<br>coworker's unique approach to the English language.<br><br>But I take pride in the fact that I am just as much of a mystery to my wife as she is to me, and that she can't change my<br>source code any more than I can change hers.<br><br>Perhaps this is the true secret of finding a woman to love: knowing that there is no such thing as a perfect female, but that a<br>woman worth loving is worth loving in spite of her imperfections, just as you are worth loving in spite of your imperfections<br>-- to at least one woman in this world, who is probably sitting alone right now, wishing she could find a fine, brilliant (if  slightly shy) man like you to fill that big, empty spot in her life.<br><br>-- Posted by Roblimo on Sunday October 24, @12:00PM EDT<br><br>Check out the comments after that article.... Let's start some discussion here about this article as applied to Singapore context...<br><br>How??<br><br>Ciao<br>ST Lim</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ur information was really informative and quite insightful.  A lot of it, I think, people already know deep down inside...but sometimes it gets buried underneath ...whatever it is we use to bury our insticts.<br><br>It is a long essay and I would only be starting to break the surface of it on this post as I was supposed to sleep just now.  Damn!!!!I'm addicted...ahhhhhhh!!!!<br><br>U r one lucky guy to have found such a patient woman.  From my experience, most women usually are quite impatient.  Although they do try and understand, it doesn't make them feel any less bad or lonely when u can't spend time with them.  Ur situation is that she also has her own life and doesn't depend on u for everything to happen...which is fantastic...excatly what it should be about, but a lot of times it's that one will be busy and the other not.  More times than not.  U seem like u have a really healthy relationship, but most relationships aren't like this.  It is the ideal relationship.  I think that we have come to somewhat of a conclusion that ideal situations don't happen often.  Maybe too much of a rarity that it makes people lose hope when they haven't found it or experienced something less than ideal.<br><br>I mean that's not to say that their relationships aren't good.  Maybe they are, but ucan't stop people from comparing.<br><br>Oh sure, everyone does it whether they want to admit it or not.  It's another one of those things that people don't want to admit because it can be seen as shallow, and we here are pretty much against the whole idea of being shallow...although sometimes we do suffer from the same shallowness.  My God, sometimes I'm so shallow that the water doesn't even reach my ankles, but we try. :-)<br><br>Ur message about the ugly duckling syndrome hits me on the spot.  I can feel what u mean because I "sprouted" quite late.  I was really lame until I hit 19 yrs old or somewhere there.  Then I got better looking and my body suddenly got stockier.<br><br>To all u girls here, my ass used to be flat as the HDB walls before then, now I actually got something!!!!  Looks more like a volkswagon now...:-)  hah hah.:-)<br><br>all kinding aside, there was a quote from the movie 'How to make an American Quilt',<br><br>"You can always find a perfect lover...but u will never find the perfect husband"<br><br>I would like to add wife into that equation there....<br><br>It's absolutely true.  If I'm not wrong, that's where u were aiming at also.<br><br>I will write more when I get back from lectures tomorrow (and had a little zzzz), but the thing that begs to be said here is:<br><br>Most people here have problems even meeting women...just a guess on my part.<br><br>This writing also comes from someone who is on the other side.  It's always easy to say this, but I'm sure that everyone reading this is saying the same thing as me...<br><br>...hmm, interesting.  Sounds plausible, but I don't think it's gonna happen here...and to me...<br><br>I think I should mention something that just came to my head...I feel that a lot of women, especially the pretty ones, have  feelings of inadequacies, if I may use that word for lack of a better one.  They make themsleves beautiful but a lot find that they aren't.  The confident beauties are actually not common when u think about it.<br><br>I mean, why spend so much time making urslef look good when u aren't advertising urslef for commitments?  To make others notice u right?  Then that says that it's an ego booster that they need quite frequently.  I'm guilty of the same thing.  That's why I go to Orchard so much.  That's why I always dress up when I go there.  When people look, u feel good.  It's an ego /confidence booster...maybe I'm wrong.  There's more to it than that, but I'll leave this part here for someone else to pick up.<br><br>Ur wife, here is the confident type.  She can handle u not paying attention to her for periods at a time.  Most girls cannot, you know.  Yes there are some out there, we can't spend our whole lives searching for the one like that.  It would be ludicrous.  We would put off this relationship in fears that the one special one will come along so we end up with nothing.<br><br>All of my female friends vary from very temperamental to mildly temperamental...and they ALL require a lot of attention whether from friends or what...especially from their boyfriends.  Why do u think that it's always the girl that is constantly haunting the guys to call them, and when they call one minute late...that's it for him...he can forget trying to action jackson.  It's really rare for guys to be like this, although I do know one or two.  It's a constant upkeep battle and it's always uphills.  Unless u end up lucky and somehow are in the right place at the right time to meet that rare one, u will have to keep rolling that boulder up the hill...and occassionally it falls back and rolls u over when u don't try hard enough to keep it going.<br><br>Like I said earlier somewhere, Most girls see the job of the upkeep of the relationship as the guys responsibility...Although they have some, it's seen that the guy should do this and do that...It's an expectation that most cannot escape...<br><br>I hope I haven't bored anyone yet.<br><br>Ok, Ok. ---I'll end it by saying that I would prefer someone who isn't so ideal.  Mainly because I like having to take care of the woman and having her depend on me...a bit mind u...not totally.  It's not an ego thing, but rather a need to protect that person I love from being too lonely, or too hurt...etc...etc...  But then again, a lot like independent women....<br><br>We have to be careful about looking for ideal situations or else we risk becoming like Alley McBeal.  Totally neurotic and utterly uncapable of not having a relationship because she spends all her time waiting for the perfect one.  She never ever tries....Right when she starts, she ends it...<br><br>For those who've ever watched that series, u'll know what I'm saying.<br><br>until tomorrow.....<br><br>zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>as wierd as it sounds i like bochup guys. i fall for guys who wont give me the time of their day, who cant be bothered to go cheer you up when you have PMS, who wont bother to make up after some petty lil quarrel you had. wierd rite?<br>i've had guys who chased me before, totally sweet, lovable, even rich. not say vvvvv gd looking lah, but above average. but being the stupid girl i was, my standard reply to all was:"i'm sorry, i like you, but i dont thk i'm ready for a bf". sigh. but i really meant it... i guess. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> or perhaps it was just a nicer way to reject them. they were very sweet, always offering to treat me to stuff, accompany me when i had to run errands at wierd ulu places at 3pm on sats when everyone's in town, put up with my depression/PMS/tantrums..... one even treated all my frens to lunch cos he wanted to treat me.<br>okok, i guess after reading for so long you wanna know what my pt is rite? basically, after much self-analysis, i thk the reason why i "cldnt" love those guys was because they were too nice. "bad boys" pose a challenge. they're hard to get and even harder to maintain. and furthermore, i love being indept. i hate the unspoken obligation of having to pg a guy 24-7 wherever you are just because you're spposed to be in love. in short, i just love challenges, getting the one thg tt's out of your reach. hahaa... what do you guys thk?<br></div>
