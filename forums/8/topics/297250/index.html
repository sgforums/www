Let me give your my 2 cents worth of nothing <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>3D animation/programming ain't as simple as it looks, unless you are really fervent 'bout it and dead hardworking... you will find yourself struggling with it halfway in the course..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>It's really not an easy road to take - from storyboarding, character design, logic planning etc to modeling, animating and coding... it can really drain a person <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>You are right to say that there isn't any option to further your studies in Singapore yet; and overseas education do cost some money even if you're on a scholarship..<br><br>I, however, will advise you to go for the diploma if you're truly interested. But be warned, that many poly students went into their course with so much passion and all... yet lost it all halfway through it...<br><br>It's not just about interest sometimes... It's about discipline...<br><br>Good luck <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hardwarzone.com has very contrasting opinions about courses dealing with multimedia.<br><br><a href="http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/showthread.php?t=1638213" rel="nofollow">http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/showthread.php?t=1638213</a><br><br>Just a quote:<br><blockquote>"The course, from the looks of it, has pretty shallow future. Because digital media is a wide variety of medium, it also serves as a weakness as students learn everything but at the end of the day they realise that they are not specialised in any. The course forces students to learn so many different modules that half will be discarded upon entering the second year. I honestly regretted joining this course upon realising the time IÂ’d be wasting studying the useless modules.<br><br>last time i was doing html then my maid ask me wad i doing, i say html then she replied wif a "learn 4 wad? can earn $$ meh?" i wasnt angry, mayb cuz i hear such things too much le until no big deal. realli the truth mah, DDM, or shld i say media, has NO FUTURE in spore or anywhr else. i seriouslly dun noe y SP takes in so many media students when there is no demand 4 it. maybe cuz e previous generation so stupid go take media den they're jobless so govt pity them n set up more media courses so they can b teachers.<br><br>gd thing is more courses = more students = more sch fees so media teachers oso get job n e economy will look better then. in the end they benefit, sch benefit, govt benefit, spore economy benefit but WE lose out.<br><br>so ddm learn le can do wad?<br><br>3D Animation nxt time can do wad? make "Zodiac: the race continues" or "Legend Of The Sea 2"ah?<br><br>Video Production leh? even lecturer herself say b4, wan to take video shld go NP. NP now has HD cameras while SP still using pathetic DV camcorders. oso evrytime got wad event on tv, NP name is always above SP de whether is sponsoring or partnering. so pathetic hor? worse is NP's film and media studies is supported by mediacorp.<br><br>HTML learn le nxt time can make websites, yay! but for who leh? nowadays who dunno how to create website? its more of a freelance job and have no stable income. which company redesigns their website everyday?<br><br>JAVA worse, learn le oso dunno can do wad nxt time. ya, lecturer say can be programmer, program my ass la<br><br>other than ddm, audio technology, which happens to b my 3rd choice, has even lesser future. whr to work aftertat? hype records? tats all. local singing market so small onli got joi chua, stefani sun, tanya chau etc, so dun need so much audio editors.<br><br>worse is games design course. spore can dream of making US hit games like maple leave or little fighter, at the most they'll work for Nestle to design pathetic children games distributed to kids for free wif evry purchase of Nestle.<br><br>although im interested in vid, interest and reality got difference. its cuz of interest that i joined this course n i was damm wrong. if onli i were more realistic and practical then cuz media in singapore is like so small and we have hundreds and hundreds of pple fighting for a spot in mediacorp.<br><br>forget the crap tat the govt pumping millions into media in the future la cuz wun happen de. its juz a pity tat i dint see this while picking sp courses. now regret oso no use le, too late le. its not i like to complain without trying hard or like to rundown media and im an ass for saying all these but its juz the sad truth unless u r extremely extremely extremely extremely super talented or rich. </blockquote></div>
