But I was rejected by NYP and ended up in Singapore Polytechnic(SP) studying electronics, computer and communications (major in computer system technology).<br><br>Five years later, after completing the diploma in SP and my Full-time National Service. In year 2005, while I was working in a company as an IT Support. I happen to see one of the job application for a receptionist position... I was surprised that applicant has exactly the same diploma that I wanted to get 5 years ago... a diploma in ... ... applying for a receptionist position... and she did not manage to get the job ... another girl with "O" level qualifications got the job  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>But that is year 2005, by the time you graduate in year 2010, the demand for multimedia designer may have increased.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

In this course, you need to be doing work constantly, if not, you will suffer at the end of the semester.<br><br>Regarding what future you have,<br>first, what lecturers have told us is that, you can't start straight as a Games Designer. You have to slowly make your way up.<br><br>If u're curious about what positions they have in the games industry.<br>Check this out:<br><a href="http://jobberwokky.com/news/lucasfilm_animation_singapore_at_tokyo_game_show_2007" rel="nofollow">http://jobberwokky.com/news/lucasfilm_animation_singapore_at_tokyo_game_show_2007</a><br><br>This is another industry which has expanded to singapore.<br><a href="http://www.conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=87318" rel="nofollow">http://www.conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=87318</a><br><br>To add on, lecturers have said that the Game Industries are in need of Game Designers rather than programmers because there're already alot of programmers out there. From SMIT(sp), TP(Games Entertainment).... and other sources lahx. I can't state one by one out.<br>Animators as well, can be found easily because all polytechnics haves courses related to animation.<br><br>Oh yar, to get a job in Games Industry, you will need a good Portfolio. There's this person who interviewed to be a lecturer in our course. His portfolio is 5kg heavy. Imagine that -_- .<br><br>This GOOD portfolio requires all of the work you did throughout your lifetime. For example, if you wanna be a 3D modeller, make sure you have samples of your 3D artwork, as many as possible. It's always good to have a sketchbook with you when you're going for an interview. It helps.<br><br>I think that's all...unless u wanna know more.  Ja.</div>

Warning, big file 161MB. You need Windows Media Player to see the video.<br><br>Since you are talking about feasibility... If you can do something like the above... game/movie developers will definitely employ you.

It is not really because Singapore lack the talents to develop good games, its mainly because there is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no union</span> or forming of a large dedicated team to develop a good game. In other words, quantity -&gt; quality (Number of People implies Quality of Product). The more people you have, the better the quality of the product you can produce.<br><br>For example. a game like "Guild Wars", developed by Arenanet,<br><br>Employs at least (Quantity):<br><br>03 Executive Producers<br>04 Producers<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>26 Designers</strong></span><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>40 Artists</strong></span><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>12 Environment Artists</strong></span><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>28 Programmers</strong></span><br>06 Writers<br>04 Cinematics<br>03 Business Team<br>03 Coummunity<br>04 IT<br>03 Localization (language translation)<br>02 Marketing<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>10 Quality Assurance</strong></span><br>03 Web<br>01 Screenshots &amp; Trailers<br><br>Total: 152 Staff<br><br>Audio and Sound (Outsourced)<br>Music (Outsourced)<br><br>(Information above obtained from Guild Wars, Eye of the North manual)<br><br>So if there is a local game development company that wants to develop a good computer game with for example 20 or less people.....<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">...can take forever or most probably given up halfway. Developing a good computer game is like building a big ship that requires at least hundred over people. And even with hundred over people, it will still need at least a few years to develop and build the ship. If a ship is launched before it is ready, it is likely to sink before it can generate any income/compensation for all the effort put into the project.<br><br>In Singapore, who is willing to invest in a multi-million game development project which is likely to fail?</div>

I'm really really interested in it.</blockquote>if you die-die must take this course, then u must be prepared to find work in the US or other western countries and apply for US green card to work there.<br><br>if you're talking about the PC / PS2 / xBox games industry, it doesn't even exist.<br>if you're talking about those small-time, Java-based little games for mobile phones, we do have a small but slowly-growing market here.<br>the industry for mainstream gaming (PC / console) won't be established in the next couple of decades.<br><br>in fact, don't talk about games even....singapore's technological culture is more based on Business-to-Business software systems, like engineering software or those neuro-surgery systems to help doctors etc.<br><br>can you seriously find a software company in SG that sells PC applications for consumers? like Microsoft Office equivalent? or Photoshop equivalent?<br>there's a lot of small-timers in the West who do these things cos' there's a market. in SG, there's none.<br><br>also, "Game design and development" is too general.<br>is the course training you to become a games programmer? or a game artist? or a game storyline writer?<br><br>if it's the combination of all three that the course is teaching you, then u better stay away more, because games development is a very huge discipline of it's own, unlike other programming genres (database, graphics, security etc.), and a course that promises to teach you all of these is definitely an introductory crap course. you'll be wasting your parents' hard-earned money.<br><br>FYI, if you're looking to become a games programmer, you don't need to learn graphics design.<br>u can suck at art but it won't matter, because in a real-world setting, the programmer won't be the one creating the 2D/3D artwork, only the artists.<br><br>the project manager will plan the thing, the writers will plot the game's storyline, the programmer will be doing all the coding and integrate the graphics with the artists department, the marketing people will decide how to market the game and the sales people will push the product out.<br><br>also, speaking from experience, i can GUARANTEE you that u won't find a good or proper job with his kind of "Game design and d..." diploma, because it's really too general liao, and add the singapore climate to it,....well, doom.<br><br>worse still, if you're thinking of going overseas (USA, UK etc.) to find jobs, you'll  find yourself competing with the Eastern Europeans or Indians, you'll be screwed also because this kinda diploma will become dust when compared to their expertise, and their expected salaries is rather low too.<br><br>i understand this is your interest, but strongly advise you to pick up a general computing diploma and then advance from there.<br>just to let you know, if your computer programming foundation is very strong, u can always pick up games development via the online forums or take up an eLearning / distance learning course.<br><br>by taking up general computing, you're giving yourself a whole lot more options.<br>besides, the computing industry overall isn't doing very well in SG since several years and now also.<br>the ST classifieds only has a handful of IT jobs everyday compared to other sections and for one, my cousin, a recent NUS graduate with Bachelor in Computer Science (with Honours somemore) had to search 3 months before finding a job which underpays him + sick over-time hours.<br><br>lastly, a common misconception is that games development is easy and fun, like what we see in WarCraft, Halo......fancy graphics, Hollywood-styled storylines, state of the art sound effects....<br><br>the truth is that among the different genres of software development, gaming is among the most difficult.<br>your science (especially physics), needs to be extremely good or you'll be struggling to even understand the basic AI theories.<br>also, not sure if you've looked at the programming code for even those 1980s 2D simple games like Paintball....they will make even those university mathematics class look like ABC.</div>

              <p>Take a basic IT diploma that trains you well in programming, and some multimedia aspects.  Complete your IT education in Uni.  Then go into the games industry, or whichever you like.  Don't specialise so early in terms of education certification.  IT is already specialised enuff as it is. </p>
              <p>Leave yourself the option of going into other IT sectors in future.</p>
