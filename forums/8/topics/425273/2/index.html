              <p>hey, you gotta go for a course that you really like, do something you will enjoy in future as a career. I graduated from NAFA 3 years ago (totally different course from you though, i was from visual communications), and i see so many of my friends now changing their careers cos they don't enjoy working in the design industry at all, the long-hours, the cut throat art directors. it's because they didn't choose something they really like and really enjoy.</p>
              <p>so if you've got a passion for music, then go for it, because chances are, when you get a job that's music related in future, you're going to enjoy your work, since it becomes less like a chore. a job that doesn't feel like a job, you know? can't stress that enough. hahah</p>

              Yup , I submited my application form for NAFA le , but I still have time to decide , since the contract wouldn't arrive till mid april , haha.
              Since your from NAFA , can you tell me how's it's like there? I heard there's alot of foreigners , and how old are those people there on an average scale? I'm only 16 , and I'm sure there would be people older than me but , are there many people around this age range?

              <p>yes not too worry. LOL there's a good mix of people from different age groups. when i went to nafa (1st year) I was 18, and I had friends who were 16, and others even 27 or 30 years old. yeap there're foreign students too but the number doesn't override the local population of students. in a school like nafa there's bound to be plenty of foreigners la, hahaha, plus you'll be in performing arts so the same applies.</p>
              <p>Not sure what you mean by how's it like there, but I don't think the culture has changed much, everyone gets along well with each other. when you get the chance, please go be an orientation leader either when you're 1st or 2nd year, can mix with the fashion/visual comms people too. since the 3 campuses are seperated, this is probably the best and only time the entire school gets together. </p>
              <p>add me on msn if u want la, can tell you more there :D vanessa.ksy@hotmail.com</p>

              4 Hours a day , is that in a row , or splitted into different halves?
              4 hours straight to me is very very long , usually for me it's just an hour +
