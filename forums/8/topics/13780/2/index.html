            <div class='col-md body'><strong>18. MEETING THE FIVE FRIENDS</strong><br><br>Now Buddha wanted to tell other people how to become wise, good and do service for others. He thought, "Now Asita, Alara and Uddaka are dead but my friends Kondanna, Bhaddiya, Wappa, Mahanama and Assaji are in Benares. I must go there and talk to them."<br><br>Then he set out to Benares till at last he came to a grove where his five friends were. This grove was called "Deer Park". They saw him coming towards them and one said to another, "Look yonder! There is Gotama - the luxury-loving fellow who gave up fasting and fell back into a life of ease and comfort. DonÂ’t speak to him or show him any respect. Let nobody go and offer to take his bowl or his robe. WeÂ’ll just leave a mat there for him to sit on if he wants to and if he doesnÂ’t he can stand. Who is going to attend on a good-for-nothing ascetic like him."<br><br>However, as the Buddha came nearer and nearer, they began to notice that he had changed. There was something about him, something noble and majestic such as they had never seen before. And in spite of themselves, before they knew what they were doing, they forgot all they had agreed on. One hastened forward to meet him, and respectfully took his bowl and robe, another busily prepared a seat for him, while a third hurried off and brought him water to wash his feet.<br><br>After he had taken a seat Buddha spoke to them and said: "Listen, ascetics, I have the way to deathlessness. Let me tell you, let me teach you. And if you listen and learn and practise as I tell you, very soon you will know for yourselves not in some future life but here and now in this present lifetime that what I say is true. You will realise for yourself the state that is beyond all life and death."<br><br>Naturally the five ascetics were very astonished to hear their old master and teacher talking like this. They had seen him give up the hard life of fasting and consequently believed that he had given up all efforts to find the truth. So initially they simply did not believe him and they told him so.<br><br>But Buddha replied, " You are mistaken, Ascetics. I have not given up all effort. I am not living a life of self-indulgence, idle comfort and ease. Listen to me. I really have attained supreme knowledge and insight. And I can teach it to you so you may attain it for yourselves."<br><br>Finally the five were willing to listen to him and he delivered his first sermon where he advised his followers to avoid the two extremes of self-indulgence and self-torture. He also spoke about the four Noble Truths and how to practise the Noble Path that would lead to freedom from suffering and enlightenment.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>19. YASA AND HIS FIFTY-FOUR FRIENDS</strong><br><br>While Buddha stayed at the Deer Park in Benares, a rich man young man called Yasa came to see him. Yasa listened to the BuddhaÂ’s teachings and was so enthralled by them that he became a Bhikkhu (monk).<br><br>Towards evening, an elderly man came to Buddha and told him that his son had left home that morning saying he was going to visit Buddha, but he had not returned. Both he and his wife were worried thinking robbers must have killed him. Buddha told the father not to worry and that his son had become a bhikkhu. Then he started to explain his teachings to YasaÂ’s father and soon he too became a follower.<br><br>Yasa had fifty-four friends who were presented to Buddha to hear his teachings. They too became monks. In this way in a short time there were sixty followers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>20. THE KASSAPA BROTHERS</strong><br><br>As soon as he had sixty disciples Buddha sent them away to teach people everywhere . He left the Deer Park and turned southwards towards the Magadha country.<br><br>On the banks of a river there lived three brothers whose names were Uruvela Kassapa, Nadi Kassapa and Gaya Kassapa. Each lived with 500, 300 and 200 followers respectively.<br><br>One evening Buddha visited Uruvela KassapaÂ’s hut and asked, "If it is not an inconvenience, may I spend a night in your kitchen?"<br><br>"I donÂ’t mind, Great Gotama but there is a fierce serpent king in the kitchen. I am afraid it will harm you," said Uruvela Kassapa.<br><br>"O I donÂ’t mind, so if you have no objection I will spent the night there," answered Buddha.<br><br>Buddha went into the kitchen, spread some grass on the floor for bedding, and sat down. The fierce serpent-king hearing him came slithering out opening his mouth to bite Buddha.<br><br>"I will not harm this serpent-king. I will subdue him by my love and kindness," thought Buddha. Thus the more angry the serpent-king became the more kindly and loving was Buddha. The serpent-king could not do him any harm.<br><br>Early next morning Uruvela Kassapa went to Buddha and found him sitting in deep meditation. The ascetic was surprised and asked Buddha whether the serpent-king had harmed him. "Here see for yourself," said Buddha and uncovered his begging bowl. Out came the fierce serpent-king and the ascetic started to run away in fright. But Buddha stopped him, saying that he had a way to tame any fierce serpent.<br><br>"Can I learn?" asked the ascetic. Buddha then preached his teachings and Uruvela Kassapa, his brothers and all their followers became devotees of the Buddha Dhamma.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>21. RETURNING HOME</strong><br><br>When King Suddhodana came to know that Buddha was preaching in Rajagaha he sent nine messengers, one after the other, inviting him to come to Kapilavatthu. All the messengers became monks. They listened to BuddhaÂ’s teachings, which they found so appealing that they forgot to convey the kingÂ’s message.<br><br>Meanwhile, the king also made arrangements for the Buddha to stay in a park called Nigrodha. But when the Buddha did not come, the king sent Kaludayi, a playmate of BuddhaÂ’s, to invite him back to Kapilavatthu.<br><br>When the people of Kapilavatthu came to know that the Buddha had come to their city they flocked to see him. Prince SiddharthaÂ’s own relatives came as well and said, "He is our younger brother, our nephew, our grandson."<br><br>Then the Buddha realised that some people even then, did not understand that he was already enlightened but felt they were his elders. He showed them a miracle called the "Twin miracle". The king seeing this miracle worshipped him.<br><br>The next day Buddha took his begging bowl and went from door to door begging for food. The king seeing this was very annoyed. "Why do you disgrace me, my son? Why do you ruin me like this? Why donÂ’t you take food in the palace? Is it proper for you to beg for food in this very city where you used to travel in golden sedan chairs? Why do you put me to shame my dear son?"<br><br>"I am not putting you to shame, O Great King. This is our custom," replied the Buddha calmly.<br><br>"How can this be? Nobody in our family has ever begged like this? How can you say Â‘it is our customÂ’?"<br><br>"O Great King, this is not the custom of the Royal family, but of the Buddhas. All the former Buddhas have lived by receiving food this way."<br><br>However, when the king begged Buddha to take food in the palace Buddha kindly did so.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>22. PRINCESS YASODHARA</strong><br><br>When Buddha had taken his meal all who knew him as Prince Siddhartha except Princess Yasodhara, came to talk to him. All of them were surprised but happy to see their prince dressed like a monk.<br><br>Yasodhara stayed in her room thinking, "Prince Siddhartha is now the Enlightened One - the Buddha. He now belongs to the line of Buddhas. Is it right for me to go to him? He does not and cannot need me. I think it is better to wait and see."<br><br>After awhile Buddha asked " Where is Yasodhara?"<br><br>"She is in her room" said his father.<br><br>" Come, let us go there," said Buddha and giving his bowl to the king they went to her room. As he entered he said "Let her pay me respect as she likes. Say nothing."<br><br>As Buddha entered her room, and before he took his seat, Yasodhara quickly came to him and holding his ankles, placed her head on his feet and cried and cried until his feet were wet with her tears. The Buddha kept quiet and nobody stopped her until she was tired of crying.<br><br>King Suddhodana then said, "Lord, when my daughter-in-law heard that you were wearing yellow robes, she also robed herself in yellow; when she heard you were taking one meal a day, she also did the same; when she heard that you had given up lofty couches, she lay on a low couch; when she heard that you had given up garland and scents she too gave them up. So virtuous is my daughter-in-law."<br><br>Buddha nodded and said, "Not only in this last birth O king, but in a previous birth too, Yasodhara was devoted and faithful to me."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>23. PRINCE NANDA</strong><br><br>On the third day after the BuddhaÂ’s return to Kapilatthu he was invited to attend the wedding of Prince Nanda, his youngest stepbrother, to Princess Janapada Kalyani. Buddha attended the wedding and celebrations, blessed them all, left his begging bowl with Nanda and went away.<br><br>Nanda thought, "I will go to the temple and return the bowl." When he did this Buddha talked to him for awhile then said, "Nanda would you like to be a monk?"<br><br>"Yes Sir," said Nanda and Buddha ordained him.<br><br>Afterwards Nanda thinking of his beautiful bride became very sad and unhappy. "Why are you so sad Nanda?" asked the monks.<br><br>"Brothers, I am disappointed. I do not like this life. I want to leave it and go home."<br><br>Buddha then came to talk to Nanda. First Buddha showed him a she-monkey whose nose and tail were burnt and fur singed and bloodied. "Do you see this monkey Nanda?. Then take good note of her." said Buddha.<br><br>Then Buddha showed Nanda 500 celestial nymphs.<br><br>"Nanda, do you see these nymphs?"<br><br>"Yes", answered Nanda.<br><br>"Who is prettier the nymphs or Janapada Kalyani?"<br><br>"Sir, as my bride is prettier than the burnt monkey, so are the nymphs compared to Janapada Kalyani."<br><br>"Well Nanda what then?"<br><br>"Reverend Sir, how does one obtain the celestial beings?"<br><br>"By performing the duties of a monk."<br><br>"In that case I shall take the greatest pleasure in living the monkÂ’s life," said Nanda and began to follow the BuddhaÂ’s teaching very carefully.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>24. PRINCE RAHULA</strong><br><br>On the seventh day after BuddhaÂ’s homecoming Princess Yasodhara dressed up young Rahula. He had been brought up by his mother and grandfather and was now seven years old. She pointed to the Buddha and said, "That is your father Rahula, go and ask him for your inheritance."<br><br>Innocent Rahula went to the Buddha and looking up into his face told him what his mother had asked him to say, adding, "Father, even your shadow is pleasing to me."<br><br>As Buddha left the palace Rahula followed him saying "Give me my inheritance." Coming to the park Buddha thought, "He desires his fatherÂ’s wealth, but this goes with the worldly life and is full of trouble and suffering. I shall instead give him what I know and thus give him an excellent inheritance." Buddha then asked Sariputta, one of his disciples to ordain Rahula.<br><br>When King Suddhodana heard that his beloved grandson had become a monk he was deeply grieved. The king said, "When you left home it made me sad. When Nanda left home my heart ached. I concentrated my love on my grandson and again the one I love has left me. Please do not ordain anyone without their parentÂ’s permission." To this Buddha agreed and never ordained anybody after that without their parentÂ’s permission.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>25. THE TWO CHIEF DISCIPLES</strong><br><br>Near Rajagaha there were two villages called Upatissa and Kolita. The headmen of these two villages were also known by these two names. Both families were very close friends.<br><br>One day UpatissaÂ’s wife, Sari, gave birth to a son called Sariputta. On the same day KolitaÂ’s wife, Moggali, also gave birth to a son called Moggallana. Both sons became best friends.<br><br>When they grew up both of them used to watch dramas. One day while watching one called Giragga Samapujja (The Mountain Festival) the young boys decided to leave home in order to seek greater happiness and understanding of life than could be had watching plays.<br><br>Now at this time there was staying near Rajagaha a famous religious teacher called Sanjaya. The two friends went to learn from him but after awhile they found his teachings unsatisfactory and left. They promised each other they would both continue searching, studying and meditating in an effort to find the truth about life, and whoever found it first would let the other know.<br><br>One morning, in the main street of Rajagaha, Sariputta saw the ascetic Assaji begging for alms. He radiated modesty and calmness as he went from house to house. As Sariputta came closer he saw on AssajiÂ’s face a look of perfect peace, like a smooth undisturbed lake under a calm clear sky. Finally Sariputta went up to him, and humbly said, "Your face friend is serene; your eyes so clear and bright. Who is your teacher and what does he teach Sir?"<br><br>"I can soon tell you that, brother," replied Assaji. "There is a great ascetic of the Sakya race who has left his home and country behind in order to follow the homeless life. He is my teacher and it is his teaching that I follow and practise."<br><br>"Please tell me more."<br><br>"I am only a newcomer to the way of Buddha," replied the ascetic modestly, "I do not know very much yet. But I will give you a brief description."<br><br>"That is all I want, brother," said Sariputta quickly, "Tell me the meaning of the teachings. Why make a lot of words about it?"<br><br>"Very well then, " said the ascetic, "Listen! The Buddha teaches that there is a cause for everything, and also how things cease to be."<br><br>After the Venerable Assaji spoke these lines, Sariputta was so clever that he understood their meaning. He realised the truth that everything that ever has come into existence, or will come into existence, must pass away. He said, "If this is what Buddha teaches you have found the state that is free from sorrow and suffering and full of peace and happiness." After thanking Assaji, Sariputta and took leave of him and went to find his friend Moggallana to bring him the great news.<br><br>Before he spoke a word Moggallana cried, "Why brother how clear and shining your face is. Can it be that at last you have found what we have been seeking?"<br><br>"It is so brother it is so," was SariputtaÂ’s glad reply and he explained BuddhaÂ’s teachings to him.<br><br>Thus, Sariputta and Moggallana joined Buddha and in a short time became two of his chief disciples. Sariputta became known for his wisdom and Moggallana for his miraculous power.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>26. THE BUDDHAÂ’S DAILY ROUTINE</strong><br><br>The BuddhaÂ’s daily routine was divided into five parts: 1. the morning session, 2. the afternoon session, 3. the first watch, 4. the middle watch and 5. the last watch.<br><br>The Morning Session (4.00 a.m. to 12.00 noon)<br><br>The Buddha would get up at 4.00 a.m. and as soon as he had had a wash would sit down to meditate for an hour. From 5.00 to 6.00 a.m. he would look around the world with his mental eye to see if anybody needed help. At 6.00 a.m. he would put on his robe and either go out and help the needy or beg for food.<br><br>When begging Buddha would go from house to house, eyes fixed to the ground, receiving in silence any food that was put into his bowl. Sometimes he would go begging with his disciples who would walk behind him in a single file. Often people would invite him to their houses for lunch and he would preach to them and his followers.<br><br>The Afternoon (12.00 noon to 6.00 p.m.)<br><br>In the afternoon the monks would usually go to Buddha to ask questions and be taught and advised. Buddha would then retire to his room and look around the world with his mental eye to see if anyone is looking for his help. He would then go and meet people who were waiting for him. He would preach to them in such a way that everybody felt that the Buddha was preaching to each one of them separately, " giving joy to the wise, promoting the intelligence of the average people and dispelling the darkness of the dull-witted."<br><br>First Watch (6.00 p.m. to 10.00 p.m.)<br><br>During this time the followers would come again to Buddha to either listen or ask questions to clarify their doubts.<br><br>The Middle Watch (10.00 p.m. - 2.00 am)<br><br>During this period the devas would seize the opportunity to go to see Buddha and learn the truth of life. Buddha, on answering their questions, would complete the middle watch of the night.<br><br>The Last Watch ( 2.00 p.m. - 4.00 a.m.)<br><br>For the first hour Buddha would walk up and down meditating and freeing himself from the discomfort of sitting all day. He then would sleep for an hour.<br><br>Thus we can see the Buddha was busy the whole day. In fact he only slept one hour each day during this 45 years of teaching. During the early hours of the day he saw the whole universe, blessed it with his boundless love and brought happiness to millions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>27. POOR SOPAKA</strong><br><br>There once was a boy by the name of Sopaka belonging to a very poor family. When this boy was only seven his father passed away and his mother married another man who was very cruel, wicked and unkind. He always beat and scolded small Sopaka who was very kind, innocent and good.<br><br>The stepfather thought, "This boy is a nuisance, a good-for-nothing but I cannot do anything to him because his mother loves him so much. What shall I do about him?"<br><br>One evening he said, "Dear son, let us go for a walk."<br><br>The boy was surprised and thought, "My step-father has never talked to me so kindly. Perhaps my mother has asked him to be kind to me." So he happily went with his stepfather.<br><br>They walked to a cemetery where there were many rotting bodies and the step-father tied Sopaka to one of them, leaving him alone and crying.<br><br>As the night became darker and darker SopakaÂ’s fear increased. He was alone in the cemetery and so frightened that his hair stood on end and drops of sweat rolled down his body. The noises of the jackals, tigers, leopards and other wild animals made him even more frightened. Then when he was almost paralysed with fear he saw a shining noble looking person with a bright light coming towards him saying, "Sopaka, donÂ’t cry. I am here to help you so donÂ’t fear." And at that moment Sopaka broke his bonds and stood before Buddha in the Jetawana Temple. Buddha bathed him, gave him food to eat, cloths to wear and consoled and comforted him.<br><br>Meanwhile, the wicked stepfather on returning home was questioned by SopakaÂ’s mother. "Where is my son?" she asked. "I donÂ’t know," he replied, "he came home before me." But the mother could not sleep the whole night for worrying about her son.<br><br>So early next day she went to see Buddha for help. "Why are you crying sister?" asked Buddha.<br><br>"O Lord," replied the lady, "I have only one son and since last night he has been missing. My husband took Sopaka for a walk and he never returned home."<br><br>"DonÂ’t worry sister. Your son is safe. Here he is," and so saying Buddha showed her Sopaka who had become a monk. The mother was overjoyed to see her son again and after listening to Buddha teaching she too became a follower.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>28. LADY PATACARA</strong><br><br>During BuddhaÂ’s lifetime there was a rich man who had a charming daughter called Patacara. Her parents loved her so much that they kept her in the seventh storey of their mansion and did not let her go anywhere.<br><br>When she was sixteen her parents made arrangements for her to marry the son of another wealthy man. But Patacara had already fallen in love with her pageboy and wanted to be with him.<br><br>So just before the wedding, early in the morning, she dressed up like a servant and slipped out of the mansion. She met her pageboy at an arranged place and they ran away to a far away place.<br><br>The two married and after sometime Patacara was ready to give birth to their child. "Here I have no one to help me. But a mother and father always have a soft spot in their heart for their child. Please take me to their house so I may give birth to our child."<br><br>But her husband said, "My darling what are you saying. If your mother and father were to see me they will torture me to death. It is out of the question for me to go." She begged him over and over again and each time he refused to go.<br><br>One day when her husband was away she went to her neighbours and told them, "If my husband asks you where I have gone tell him that I have gone home to my parents."<br><br>When he came home to find Patacara missing, her husband ran after her and overtaking her begged her to return home. She began to refuse as her birth pains started and she soon gave birth to a son. She thought, "There is no point in going to my parent place now," and returned home with her husband.<br><br>After some time she was ready to give birth to her second child and left for her parents home again when her husband was at work. Again her husband came after her and begged her to return with him but she refused.<br><br>While this was happening a fearful storm arose. Patacara told her husband, "Dear, my birth pains have come upon me. I cannot stand it please find me a place to shelter from this storm."<br><br>Her husband taking his axe went here and there in the heavy rain looking for branches and leaves to make a shelter. Seeing a bush growing on an anthill he went to chop it down. As he did so a poisonous snake slithered out and bit him killing him immediately.<br><br>As Patacara waited for her husband, her pains became more and more severe and soon she gave birth to another son. Weak, cold and wet she could not do much except put the children to her bosom and spend the whole night sheltering as best she could.<br><br>Early the next morning, with the newborn on her hip and holding the hand of the other child, she went along the path her husband had taken and eventually saw him lying dead. "All because of me my husband died on the road," she cried.<br><br>After awhile she continued walking along the path until she came to the river Acirawati that was flooded from the storm. Since she felt weak from the previous night she could not carry both children together. Patacara placed the older boy on the bank and carried the younger one across the river. She then put the baby on a bed of leaves and returned for the older child.<br><br>Hardly had she come to mid-stream when a hawk came down from the sky and swooped off with the young child. The mother seeing the hawk screamed in a loud voice, "Su!, Su!". "Mother is calling me" thought the older boy and in a hurry to get to her slipped down the bank and was swept away by the river.<br><br>Now Patacara became very sad and cried and cried saying, "One of my sons has been carried away by a hawk, the other swept away by the river, and by the roadside my husband lies dead."<br><br>She went off weeping until she met a man and asked him, "Sir, where do you live?"<br><br>"In Savatthi," he replied.<br><br>"In the city of Savatthi in such and such a street lives such and such a family. Do you know them Sir?"<br><br>"Yes my good Lady, but donÂ’t ask me about that family. Ask me about another family you know."<br><br>"Good Sir I know only that family. Please tell me about them," said she.<br><br>"Since you insist I cannot hide the truth," said the man. "In the heavy rains last night, the familyÂ’s house collapsed killing all of them."<br><br>"Oh no!," cried Patacara.<br><br>"Yes, can you see that fire over there?" he asked pointing to some flames, "That is their funeral fire."<br><br>No sooner had Paracara heard this than she fell on the ground rolling to and fro with grief. Some villagers came and took her to the Jetawana Temple where Buddha was teaching. The Buddha asked some ladies to wash her, clothe her and give her food and then he consoled her in a most sweet and wonderful voice. When she recovered her senses Patacara begged Buddha to ordain her. Thus Patacara became a Bhikkuni (nun).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>29. ANGULIMALA, THE BANDIT</strong><br><br>The King of Kosala had an adviser called Bhaggawa. Bhaggawa had a wife called Mantani and a son called Ahinsaka.<br><br>When Ahinsaka was born, all the weapons in the country shone brightly. The king was disturbed by this and the next morning he called his adviser to find out the reason why the weapons were shiny . The adviser said, "My wife has given birth to a son your majesty."<br><br>"Then why do the weapons shine in such a manner?" asked the king.<br>"Your majesty, my son will be a bandit."<br>"Will he rob alone or with a gang?" asked the king.<br>"He will be single-handed your majesty," replied Bhaggawa.<br>"We should kill him now," said the king.<br>"No!" exclaimed Bhaggawa, "As he will be alone we shall be able to catch him easily."<br><br>When Ahinsaka was old enough his father sent him to a school in Takka Sila. Ahinsaka was the strongest, brightest and the most obedient child of all the children in the whole school. Other children became envious of him and behind his back made the teacher hate him. Thus, when he had finished his education the teacher said, "Now you must pay me my tuition fee."<br><br>"How much should I pay Sir?" asked Ahinsaka.<br><br>"I donÂ’t want cash but one thousand right-hand human fingers. And remember not to bring two right hand human fingers from the same person."<br><br>Although it was a most difficult thing for him to do Ahinsaka promised to pay his teacher. Taking a sword off he went until he reached Kosala.<br><br>Hiding near a jungle highway, he waited for passers by. He would rush out and kill them, cutting off a right hand finger and hanging their corpses on a tree for the vultures and crows. He made a garland out of the finger bones and soon became know as "Angulimala" (anguli=fingers, mala=garland).<br><br>Angulimala went to another district and began to kill again. Because he was murdering so many people, the king of Kosala decided to go with his strong army and capture the bandit. When Mantani heard this she went to her husband to try to get him to save their son.<br><br>"Darling he is very fierce now," said Bhaggawa, "He may have changed completely and if I go there he may even kill me." But the mother was very soft hearted and loved her son more than she loved herself. She thought, "I must go to the jungle myself and save him."<br><br>Now Angulimala had killed 999 people. He had spent months and months in the jungle without proper food, sleep or comfort, so he was impatient to pay off his debt and live a decent life. He thought, "Today even if my own mother comes I will kill her and cut off a finger to make one thousand fingers."<br><br>Now that day while Buddha looked round the world to see if anybody that needed help, he saw Angulimala and his mother. "I must save them," he thought as he set out towards the jungle.<br><br>The villagers seeing Buddha cried out, "Teacher, donÂ’t go that way it is too dangerous. Return home quickly." Three times they warned him but Buddha continued, thanking them for their concern.<br><br>Now AngulimalaÂ’s mother entered the jungle. Angulimala saw her coming and thought, "Poor lady. She comes alone. I pity her but it cannot be helped . I must keep my word and kill her." All of a sudden, Buddha appeared between them. Angulimala thought, "It is very good that this ascetic comes before my mother. Why should I kill her. I will leave her alone and kill this stranger". And with his sword he ran toward Buddha. The Buddha walked slowly before him thinking, "Let this young man see me running." So Angulimala ran and ran towards Buddha but he could not catch up with him. He became so weak that he could not run any further. Then he shouted at Buddha, "Stop! Stand still!"<br><br>"I stand still Angulimala! Do you also stand still?" said the Buddha.<br><br>Angulimala could not understand the meaning of the BuddhaÂ’s words so he asked him, "How can you say you stand still while running faster than me?"<br><br>"I stand still Angulimala evermore;<br>For I am merciful to all living beings<br>But you are merciless to living beings<br>Therefore I stand still and you stand not still."<br><br>Angulimala was very pleased with what Buddha said and throwing away his sword knelt before him. Buddha blessed him and took him to the temple and he became a monk.<br><br>The king before leaving to go to the jungle wanted to obtain BuddhaÂ‘s blessings. So he went to the temple with five hundred horses and soldiers. Buddha asked him "What is it that troubles you mighty king?"<br><br>"There is a most fierce killer called Angulimala and I am going to catch him."<br><br>"But mighty king suppose you see Angulimala head shaven, wearing yellow robes. What would you do to him?"<br><br>"I would worship him," answered the king.<br><br>Then Buddha called Angulimala and the frightened soldiers started to run away. But Buddha stopped them, and preached the Dhamma to them all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>30. WAKKALI - THE MONK WHO ADMIRED THE BEAUTY OF BUDDHA</strong><br><br>In Savatthi there was a young man called Wakkali who admired the BuddhaÂ’s beauty. One day he thought, "So long as I am living at home I cannot see Buddha, but if I become a monk I would see him daily." So he went to the temple and was ordained by Buddha.<br><br>Now he had the opportunity to always admire BuddhaÂ‘s appearance. He did nothing all day and followed Buddha like a shadow. Buddha waited for his wisdom to ripen and said not a word. But instead of reading, learning and meditating Wakkali admired Buddha. Buddha thought, "Unless this monk gets a shock he will never come to understand."<br><br>So one day Buddha had an invitation from a man to spent three months in Rajagaha and he left Wakkali behind.<br><br>Wakkali was very disappointed and began to think, "Three months is a long time. What a miserable period I will have to spend. What is the use of living any longer. IÂ’II throw myself off Mount Vulture Peak.<br><br>Now Buddha staying in Rajagaha, saw with his mindÂ’s eye Wakkali about to jump off Vulture Peak. "If this monk gets no comfort or consolation from me he will kill himself," he thought. Buddha immediately sent forth a radiant image of himself and Wakkali seeing Buddha before him felt his sorrow vanish. WakkaliÂ’s mind was filled with joy and he thought, "The person who has perfect faith in Buddha will be full of joy and satisfaction and reach the place of peace and happiness."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>31. SUNITA, THE SCAVENGER</strong><br><br>In Savatthi there was a scavenger named Sunita. As a road-sweeper he received barely enough to support himself. He slept on the roadside for he did not have a house to go to. He saw other people enjoying themselves but he could not mix with them because these people called him an outcaste. Whenever a higher caste person went on the road Sunita had to run and hide so his shadow did not fall on them. If he was not quick enough he would be scolded and beaten. Poor Sunita lived a miserable life.<br><br>One day as he was sweeping a dirty dusty road, Sunita saw the Buddha with thousands of followers coming towards him. His heart was filled with joy and fear and finding no place to hide he stood, joining his palms in respect. The Buddha stopped and spoke to him in a sweet gentle voice saying, "My dear friend, would you like to leave this work and follow me?"<br><br>Nobody had ever spoken to Sunita like this before. His heart was filled with joy and his eyes with tears. "O most venerable Sir, I have always received orders but never a kind word. If you accept a dirty and miserable scavenger like me I will follow you."<br><br>So the Buddha ordained Sunita and took him along with the other monks. And from that day forth no one knew what his caste was and everybody - kings, ministers commanders - respected him.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>33.  THE BUDDHA'S PAEAN OF JOY</strong><br><br>The Buddha had withstood the worst attacks of Mara. Finally, the Evil One retreated and the terrible storm he had raised died away. Now the mind of the Blessed One relaxed into peace. The great darkness faded away and the full moon and stars reappeared again.<br><br>The Lord passed into a deep meditation, passing beyond the limits of ordinary human understanding, seeing the world as it is, and not as it appears to be. Like an eagle soaring effortlessly toward the sun. His mind moved swiftly onward and upward.<br><br>He saw his past lives and all his former births, with their good and evil deeds, with their gains and losses. As his mind soared upwards he saw the round of birth and death of all mankind. He saw beings born repeatedly and die according to their Karma.<br><br>Those who do good actions have heavenly births. Though these lives last longer than those on earth, they also ended in death, as they are also subject to the 'law of    impermanence'. Those who were suffering in the hell realms would also continue in the round of rebirths. So all beings (except Buddhas) are caught in the same 'round of existence' due to ignorance.<br><br>As his vision became even clearer, he saw the so-called soul of man which man claims as his own, broken up into parts and laid before him like the unwoven threads of a garment. He saw the cause of the chain of existence - Ignorance. For the ignorant person, clinging to things that are worthless and transient, creates in himself or herself more and more dangerous illusions. But when desire dies, illusions end, and Ignorance vanishes like the night, as the sun of Enlightenment shines.<br><br>And having understood the world as it is, the Buddha  was perfected in wisdom, never to be born again. Craving and destructive desire had been completely eradicated - as a fire goes out for lack of fuel.<br><br>Bathed in the brilliant light of all Wisdom and Truth sat the Buddha, the Perfect One. And all about Him the world lay calm and bright and a soft breeze lifted the leaves of the Bodhi Tree.<br><br>Filled with compassion. The Lord sat beneath the Tree in deep contemplation of the Dhamma. He was lost in bliss, the perfect peace of Nibbana. At the dawn after His Enlightenment the Buddha uttered this paean of joy:<br><br>"Thro' many a birth in Samsara wandered I<br>Seeking, but not finding, the builder of this house.<br>Sorrowful is repeated birth.<br>House builder, thou art seen.<br>Thou shalt build no house again.<br>All thy rafters are broken; thy ridgepole is shattered.<br>The mind attains the unconditioned.<br>Achieved is the end of craving."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>34. THE BUDDHA'S FIRST SERMON</strong><br><br>The Turning of the Wheel of Truth<br><br>The Buddha's first sermon was called the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta which means the establishment of wisdom, or the Turning of the Wheel of Truth. It was preached on the full-moon day of July, called Asalha.<br><br>This sermon was preached to the five ascetics who were his former companions at the Deer Park in Isipatana (now called Sarnath), near Benares, India. Many devas and Brahmas (angels and gods) were present to listen to the discourse.<br><br>The Buddha started the discourse by advising them to give up two extremes. These were the enjoyment of sensual pleasures and the tormenting of the body (self-indulgence and self-mortification).<br><br>He advises against too much sensual pleasures because they were base, worldly, not noble and unhelpful in spiritual development. On the other hand, tormenting the body was painful, not noble and also unhelpful in spiritual development. He advised them to follow the Middle path called Majjhima Patipada which is helpful to see things clearly as they are, to attain knowledge, higher wisdom, peace, enlightenment and Nibbana.<br><br>The Buddha then taught the Four Noble Truths in His first sermon. They are the Noble Truth of Suffering, its Cause, its End, and the Way to its end. Everything in this world is full of Suffering and the cause of suffering is craving. The end of Suffering is Nibbana. The way to the end of Suffering is the Noble Eightfold Path.<br><br>The Buddha said that he was enlightened only after he understood these Four Noble Truths. The Eightfold Path has eight parts or factors: Right Understanding, Right Thought, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration.<br><br>1. Right Understanding means to know and understand the Four Noble Truths.<br>2. Right Thought means to think three kinds of thoughts.<br><br>(i) Thoughts of renunciation or thoughts which do not have lustful desires.<br>(ii) Thoughts of goodwill to other which are opposed to ill will.<br>(iii) Thoughts of harmlessness as opposed to cruelty.<br><br>3. Right Speech deals with refraining from falsehood such as telling lies or not telling the truth, slandering or saying bad things about other people; harsh words and frivolous talks such as gossiping.<br><br>4. Right Action deals with refraining from killing, stealing and sexual misconduct.<br><br>5. Right Livelihood deals with the five kinds of trade which should be avoided in order to lead a noble life. They are trading in arms (weapons), living beings (breeding animals for slaughter), intoxicating drinks and poison.<br><br>6. Right Effort has four parts using meditation:<br><br>(i) To try to stop evil thoughts that have arisen<br>(ii) To prevent evil thoughts from arising.<br>(iii) To try to develop good thoughts<br>(iv) To try to continue good thoughts that have arisen<br><br>7. Right mindfulness is also fourfold. It is mindfulness of the body, mindfulness of feelings/sensations, mindfulness of thoughts passing through the mind and mindfulness of Dhamma.<br><br>8. Right Concentration is one-pointedness of mind as developed in meditation.<br><br>The eight factors can be grouped into three smaller groups as follows:<br><br>SILA (Morality)<br><br>Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood.<br><br>SAMADHI (Concentrated mind in meditation)<br><br>Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, Right Concentration.<br><br>PANNA (Wisdom)<br><br>Right Thoughts, Right Understanding.<br><br>Sila, Samadhi and Panna are the three stages on the Path to mental purity whose object is Nibbana. These stages are described in a beautiful verse:<br><br>To cease from evil,<br>To do what is good.<br>To cleanse one's mind:<br>This is the advice of all the Buddhas.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>35. KING BIMBISARA</strong><br><br>The BuddhaÂ’s First Royal Patron<br><br>King Bimbisara had earlier offered half his kingdom to the ascetic Gotama which he turned down because he wanted to search for Enlightenment. King Bimbisara had asked him to return to Rajagaha to enlighten him should the ascetic find what he was looking for.<br><br>When Gotama became the Buddha, The Enlightened One, he did not forget his promise to come back. He decided to revisit Rajagaha followed by a large number of his disciples. His fame as a religious teacher was spreading in the city and it eventually reached the ears of King Bimbisara.<br><br>On hearing that the Buddha had arrived in the city's gateway, the King went out with a large number of his subjects to welcome the Buddha and his disciples. He approached the Buddha and paid his respects, but some of his subjects did not know to whom they should pay their respects - the Buddha or Venerable Kassapa. They wondered whether the Buddha was leading a holy life under Venerable Kassapa or the reverse as both were highly respected religious teachers.<br><br>The Buddha read their thoughts and asked Venerable Kassapa why he had given up his fire sacrifice. Understanding the motive behind the question Venerable Kassapa explained that he preferred the peaceful state of Nibbana to useless sensual pleasures. After this he fell at the feet of the Buddha and said "My teacher, Lord, is the Exalted One: I am the disciple."<br><br>The devout people were very glad to hear of the conversion. The Buddha then preached the Dhamma, and King Bimbisara attained the first stage of Sainthood. After realising the doctrine, King Bimbisara addressed the Buddha. " Formerly, O Reverend Sir, when I was a prince, I had five wishes. They are now fulfilled. My first wish was to become king. My second wish was that a Fully Enlightened One should visit my country. My third wish was that I should associate with such an Enlightened One. My fourth wish was that He should preach to me the doctrine. My fifth wish was that I should understand that doctrine. Now all these five wishes are fulfilled."<br><br>Out of gratitude for this spiritual gift from the Buddha, King Bimbisara gave a park with a quiet bamboo grove for the use of the Buddha and his disciples. This park was named the Bamboo Grove. The Buddha spent three successive rainy seasons there and three other rainy seasons later.<br><br>After listening to the Dhamma, the King became a good and pious ruler but due to his past bad Kamma, he had to face an untimely and miserable death caused by his son's wickedness.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>36. VISAKHA</strong><br><br>The Greatest Female Supporter of the Buddha<br><br>Visakha was the devout and generous daughter of a millionaire. When she was only seven years old, the Buddha visited her birthplace. Her grandfather, hearing of the Buddha's visit advised her to go out and welcome the Buddha. Though she was so young, she was religious and virtuous. As such, immediately after hearing the Dhamma from the Buddha, she attained the first stage of Sainthood.<br><br>When she was fifteen years old, some Brahmins who saw her thought she would be an ideal wife for their master Punnavaddhana, the son of a millionaire named Migara. Visakha possessed the five kinds of feminine beauty - beautiful hair, a beautiful figure, beautiful bone structure, beautiful skin which was smooth and golden in colour, and youthfulness. Accordingly, they made arrangements for Visakha to be married to Punnavaddhana.<br><br>On her wedding day, her wise father gave her some advice under ten headings as follows:<br><br>1. A wife should not criticise her husband and parents-in-law in front of other people. Neither should their weaknesses or household quarrels be reported elsewhere.<br><br>2. A wife should not listen to the stories or reports of other households.<br>3. Things should be lent to those who do return them.<br>4. Things should not be lent to those who do not return them.<br>5. Poor relatives and friends should be helped even if they do not repay.<br>6. A wife should sit gracefully. On seeing her parents-law or her husband, she should respect them by rising from her seat.<br>7. Before taking her food, a wife should first see that her parents-in-law and husband are husband are served. She should also make sure that his servants are well cared for.<br>8. Before going to sleep, a wife should see that all doors are closed, furniture is safe, servants have performed their duties, and that parents-in-law have retired. As a rule a wife should rise early in the morning and unless she is sick, she should not sleep during the day.<br>9. Parents-in-law and husband should be treated very carefully like fire.<br>10. Parents-in-law and husband should be given the respect due to Devas.<br><br>From the day Visakha arrived in Savatthi, the city of her husband, she was kind and generous to everyone in the city and everyone loved her.<br><br>One day, her father-in-law was eating some sweet rice porridge from a golden bowl when a Bhikkhu entered the house for alms. Although her father-in-law saw the Bhikkhu, he continued to eat as if he had not seen the Bhikkhu. Visakha politely told the Bhikkhu, "Pass on, Venerable Sir, my father-in-law is eating stale food."<br><br>For a long time Visakha's father-in-law had been unhappy at her because she was a devout follower and supporter of the Buddha while he was not. He was looking for a chance to break off the marriage between his son and Visakha, but her conduct was faultless. Now he had got his chance. Misunderstanding Visakha's words, he thought she had brought disgrace to his family.<br><br>He ordered Visakha to be expelled from the house, but she reminded him of her father's request to eight clansmen. Her father told them, "If there be any fault in my daughter investigate it."<br><br>The millionaire agreed to her request and summoned those eight clansmen to come and investigate whether Visakha was guilty of rudeness. When they arrived he told them, "Find her guilty of this fault and expel her from the house."<br><br>Vissakha proved her innocence by explaining, "Sirs, when my father-in-law ignored the Bhikkhu and continued to eat his milk-rice-porridge he was not making merit in his present life. He was only enjoying the merits of his past actions. Was this not like eating stale food?"<br><br>Her father-in-law had to admit that she was not guilty of being rude.<br><br>There were other misunderstandings after this, but Visakha was able to explain to his satisfaction. After this, her father-in-law had realised his error and the great wisdom of Visakha. At her suggestion, he invited the Buddha to their house to give a sermon. On hearing the sermon he became a Sotapanna.<br><br>With wisdom and patience, she succeeded in converting her husband's household to a happy Buddhist home.<br><br>Visakha was also very generous and helpful to the monks. She built the Pubbarama monastery at a great cost for the use of monks. Great was her joy when the Buddha spent six rainy seasons there.<br><br>In one of the discourses that the Buddha delivered to Visakha, he spoke of the eight qualities in a woman that bring her welfare and happiness in this world and the next:<br><br>"Herein, Visakha, a woman does her work well, she manages the servants, she respects her husband, and she guards his wealth. Herein, Visakha, a woman has confidence (Saddha) in the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha, Virtue (Sila), charity (Caga), and Wisdom (Panna)."<br><br>Being a woman who had many talents, she played an important role in various activities amongst the Buddha and his followers. At times, she was given the authority by the Buddha to settle disputes that arose amongst the Bhikkhunis (nuns). Some Vinaya rules of discipline were also laid down for the Bhikkhunis when she was called in to settle their disputes.<br><br>She died at the ripe age of one hundred and twenty.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>37. DEVADATTA</strong><br><br>The Buddha's Greatest Personal Enemy<br><br>Devadatta was the son of King Suppabuddha and Pamita, an aunt of the Buddha. His sister was Yasodhara. He was thus a cousin and brother-in-law of the Buddha. Together with Ananda and other Sakyan princes, he entered the Order of monks in the early part of the Buddha's ministry. Unable to attain any stage of Sainthood, he worked hard for the worldly psychic powers.<br><br>In his early days, he was a good monk known for his grace and psychic powers. Later he became conceited with worldly gain and fame. As his ill-will and jealousy towards the Buddha increased, he became the greatest personal enemy of the Buddha.<br><br>One day in a large assembly which included kings and princes, Devadatta approached the Buddha and requested Him to make him the leader of the Sangha. Since he was not capable and worthy enough, the Buddha turned down his request. He became very angry as a result and vowed to take revenge on the Buddha.<br><br>Although Devadatta was an evil monk, he had many admirers and followers. One of his chief supporters was King Ajatasattu with whom he planned to kill King Bimbisara and the Buddha. Ajatasattu succeeded in killing his father, but Devadatta failed to kill the Buddha.<br><br>His first attempt to kill the Buddha was to hire a man to kill the Blessed One. That man would be killed by two other men who would in turn be killed by four other men. Finally the four men would be killed by eight other men. But when the first man came close to the Buddha, he became frightened. He put aside his weapons and took refuge in the Buddha. Eventually all the men who were hired to kill one another became the disciples of the Buddha. As a result, the first plot to kill the Buddha failed.<br><br>Then Devadatta himself tried to kill the Buddha. When the Buddha was walking on the Vultures' Rock, Devadatta climbed to the peak and hurled a huge rock at the Buddha. On its way down, the rock struck another rock and a splinter flew and wounded the Buddha's foot, causing blood to flow. The Buddha looked up and seeing Devadatta, he remarked with pity, "Foolish man, you have done many unwholesome deeds for harming the Buddha."<br><br>Devedatta's third attempt to kill the Blessed One was to make the fierce man-killer elephant, Nalagiri, drunk with liquor. When Nalagiri saw the Buddha coming at a distance, it raised its ears, tail and trunk and charged at the Buddha. As the elephant came close, the Buddha radiated his loving-kindness (Metta) towards the elephant. So vast and deep was the Buddha's love that as the elephant reached the Buddha, it stopped, became quiet and stood before the Master. The Buddha then stroked Nalagiri on the trunk and spoke softly to it. Respectfully, the elephant removed the dust at the master's feet with its trunk, and scattered the dust over its head. Then it retreated, with its head facing the Buddha, as far as the stable, and remained fully tamed. Usually elephants are tamed with whips and weapons, but the Blessed One tamed the elephant with the power of his loving-kindness.<br><br>Still trying to be the leader of the Sangha, Devadatta tried yet another plan - a deceitful one. With the help of five hundred misled monks, he planned to split the Sangha community.<br><br>He requested the Buddha to make it compulsory for monks to follow five extra rules:<br><br>(i) Dwell all their lives in the forest<br>(ii) Live only on alms obtained by begging<br>(iii) Wear robes made from rags collected from the dust heaps and cemeteries<br>(iv) Live at the foot of trees<br>(v) Refrain from eating fish or meat throughout their lives.<br><br>Devadatta made this request knowing fully well that the Buddha would refuse them. Devadatta was happy that the Buddha did not approve of the five rules, and he used these issues to gain supporters and followers. Newly ordained monks who did not know the Dhamma well left the Buddha and accepted Devadatta as their leader. Eventually after Venerable Sariputta and Venerable Moggallana had explained the Dhamma to them, they went back to the Buddha.<br><br>After this, evil days fell on Devadatta. He fell very ill at the failure of his plans, and before his death he sincerely regretted his actions, and wanted to see the Buddha before he died. But the fruits of his evil Kamma had begun to ripen and prevented him from doing so. He died on the way to see the Buddha, near the gate of Jetavana monastery. But before he died he took refuge in the Buddha.<br><br>Although he has to suffer in a woeful state because of his crimes, yet as a result of his holy life that he led in the early part of his career, it is stated that he would become a Pacceka Buddha named Atthissara in the distant future. As a Pacceka Buddha he would be able to achieve Enlightenment by his own efforts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>38. KHEMA</strong><br><br>The Beautiful Queen Who Became the Chief Disciple of the Buddha.<br><br>Just as the Buddha had appointed two chief disciples, Venerable Sariputta and Venerable Moggallana, for the order of monks, he appointed two chief female disciples for the order of nuns. They were Venerable Khema and Venerable Uppalavanna.<br><br>Khema was one of the beautiful queens of King Bimbisara. The conversion of Khema was one of the rare cases where the Buddha used his psychic powers to make a change in the heart of another. The Buddha never used his powers to control another person's emotions, but merely to create understanding and make wisdom arise.<br><br>Khema was beautiful like a full moon reflected on a still lake at midnight. Her cheeks were smooth as lotus petals and her eyes sparkled like gems. As she had heard that the Buddha did not speak well of physical beauty, she had no wish to see him.<br><br>One cool, breezy morning, Khema decided to visit the monastery which King Bimbisara had built for the Buddha in the Bamboo Grove. Squirrels were scampering in the fruit trees that threw long shadows on the grass. The ponds were covered with water lilies and a light scent of jasmine was in the air.<br><br>Then Khema was drawn to a deep, clear voice coming from the preaching hall. It was unlike anything she had heard before. It sounded more beautiful than the singing of birds at the break of dawn. The voice was warm, relaxed and full of love and concern. Its words were words of wisdom.<br><br>Like a bee being attracted to a flower, Khema moved to the hall where the Buddha was preaching. As she did not want the Buddha to recognise her she pulled her scarf down over her face and sat at the back of the hall. What she did not know was that the Buddha knew who she was and what she was thinking.<br><br>With his psychic powers, the Buddha created the image of a most beautiful young lady about the age of sixteen standing by his side and fanning him. Khema gasped in wonder at her beauty and rolled her eyes in admiration for her.<br><br>"Oh look at her finely shaped nose, her mouth, her arms and fingers," thought Khema. "With her perfect complexion, she looks like a fully bloomed flower in spring. She is far more beautiful than anyone I have ever seen, and is far, far more beautiful than I."<br><br>Just for the moment Khema thought her eyes were playing tricks on her. Did she see this young girl growing older? Oh yes. And the beauty was fading from this lovely creature. Some wrinkles appeared on her face and the smile on her lotus-like lips changed into a toothless grin. Her hair turned grey, then white. The limbs that were slender and strong became thin and feeble, and she fell on the floor. From a young lady, this image had changed into an eighty-year-old woman.<br><br>Khema saw this old woman die and rot until her bones turned to dust. She then realised that just like the lovely image, one day she too would grow old and die. All vanity of external beauty fell from her and she instantly understood the impermanence of the physical body and life.<br><br>She attained Arahantship, and entered into the order of nuns after getting King Bimbisara's consent. She became renowned for her Insight Knowledge amongst the order of nuns.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>39. ANATHAPINDIKA</strong><br><br>The Millionaire Supporter of the Buddha<br><br>The millionaire Anathapindika was born as Sadaria. As a result of his great generosity, he was given the name Anathapindika which meant "Feeder of the Helpless"<br><br>By buying a park from Prince Jeta at a huge cost, Anathapindika built the famous Jetavana Monastery for the Buddha to spend the rainy season. A layer of gold coins covering the grounds of the park measured the price of the park. As the Buddha spent the major part of his life in the quiet surroundings, most of his sermons were delivered there. Altogether the Buddha spent twenty-four rainy seasons at Jetavana Monastery.<br><br>Several of the Buddha's sermons delivered to Anathapindika were intended for lay people. Two of them were on generosity and the Four Kinds of Bliss. In the discourse on generosity, the Buddha advised that the first stage of the Buddhist life is to practice generosity such as giving alms to monks and building monasteries. More important than being generous is to take refuge in the Triple Gem and to observe the Five Precepts, the five rules that help us discipline our words and deeds. More important than observation of the five precepts is the regular practice of meditation on loving-kindness (Metta-bhavana), but the most meritorious act is to develop Insight into the fleeting nature of things.<br><br>In the discourse on the four kinds of bliss a layman can enjoy, the Buddha mentioned the bliss of ownership, the bliss of wealth, the bliss of being debtless and the bliss of blamelessness.<br><br>The bliss of ownership means the satisfaction in gaining wealth by honest means and hard work. The bliss of wealth is the satisfaction of enjoying a person's wealth while fulfilling all his duties. The bliss of being debtless is the satisfaction that a layman enjoys whenever he knows that he does not incur a debt, great or small to anyone. The bliss of blamelessness is the satisfaction derived by a person whose actions of the body, speech and thought do not cause harm to others and free from any blame.<br><br>When Anathapindika first met the Buddha at the Sitavana forest near Rajagaha, his confidence was so strong that an aura glowed from his body. On hearing the Dhamma for the first time Anathapindika became a Sotapanna (first stage of sainthood).</div>
