            <div class='col-md body'><strong>40. THE BUDDHA &amp; THE FARMER KASIBHARADVAJA</strong><br><br>Once the Buddha was in the village of Ekanala in Magadha. The rain had fallen and it was planting time. In the early morning when the leaves were still wet with dew, the Buddha went to the field where Kasibharadvaja, a Brahmin and farmer, had five hundred ploughs at work. When the Blessed One arrived, it was the time for the Brahmin to distribute food to the workers. The Buddha waited there for his alms food, but when the Brahmin saw him he sneered and said:<br><br>"I plough and sow, and having ploughed and sown. I eat, O ascetic, you also should plough and sow, and having ploughed and sown, you should eat."<br><br>"O Brahmin, I too plough and sow. And having ploughed and sown, I eat," replied the Buddha.<br><br>The puzzled Brahmin asked, "You claim that you plough and sow, but I do not see you ploughing?"<br><br>The Buddha replied:<br><br>"I sow faith as the seeds. My discipline is the rain. My wisdom is my yoke and plough. My modesty is the plough-head. The mind is the rope. Mindfulness is the ploughshare and the goad."<br><br>"I am restrained in deeds, words and food. I do my weeding with truthfulness. The bliss I get is my freedom from suffering. With perseverance I bear my yoke until I come to Nibbana. Thus I have done my ploughing. It brings the fruit of immortality. By ploughing like this, one escapes all suffering."<br><br>After this explanation, the Brahmin realised his error, and said, "May the Venerable Gotama eat the milk-rice! The Venerable Gotama is a farmer since his crops bear the fruit of Deathlessness!" So saying, the Brahmin filled a large bowl with milk-rice and offered it to the Buddha.<br><br>The Buddha refused the food saying that He could not accept food in return for His preaching.<br><br>The Brahmin fell at the feet of the Buddha and asked to be ordained into the Order of monks. And not long after, Kasibharadvaja became an Arahant.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>41. MAGANDIYA</strong><br><br>The beautiful maiden who harboured a grudge against the Buddha<br><br>Magandiya was such a beautiful girl that many wealthy men wanted to marry her. Her parents always turned down the suitors whom they thought were not good enough for her. Even when her parents found a suitable man for her, she refused to marry anyone less than a king. She was determined to use her beauty to marry well.<br><br>One day as the Buddha was surveying the world, He noticed that Magandiya's parents were spiritually developed. All it needed was one statement from Him to open their eyes to Truth. The Buddha went to the place where the Brahmin was making his fire sacrifice outside his village.<br><br>When Magandiya's father saw the Buddha coming, he was moved with wonder by His physical beauty, calmness and noble manner. There could not be a better person to give his daughter in marriage, the Brahmin thought. "Don't go away O monk," he said, "wait here until I bring my daughter to see you. You are an ideal partner for her, and she for you."<br><br>The Buddha did not speak and remained silent. Instead He stamped His footprint on the ground and went away. Very excitedly the Brahmin carried the news to his wife. "Dress her up quickly, dear. I have seen a man worthy of our daughter." When the three of them came back to the spot, the Buddha was nowhere to be seen. They only saw the footprint.<br><br>The wife who was familiar with signs read the print, and said, "I don't think this is the print of one who would marry our daughter. It belongs to a person who has given up worldly pleasures."<br><br>"You and your signs again. You see crocodiles in a water pot, and robbers in the middle of the house. Look, there he is sitting under the tree. Have you seen, my dear, anyone so marvellous in form! Come along, daughter. This time your suitor is so perfect that you cannot complain."<br><br>"Monk, I'm giving my daughter in marriage to you," said the Brahmin to the Buddha. The Buddha turned down the offer, explaining that He had overcome all His worldly pleasures. He related how He had given up household life with all its enjoyment, and how He could not be tempted by even the beautiful daughters of Mara. He said that however beautiful the body may be, it is still full of impurities.<br><br>Hearing this, the Brahmin and his wife understood immediately that the worldly life is miserable and not something to be attached to, no matter how nice it may appear. Both of them attained Anagami, the third stage of sainthood.<br><br>Unfortunately, proud Magandiya, who was not spiritually developed, could not understand the real meaning of these words. She thought the Buddha was insulting her beauty. "How could this monk insult me when so many men have fallen for my beauty at first sight. Even if he doesn't want to marry me, he shouldn't declare that my body is full of dirt." Clenching her fists, she whispered under her breath, "You just wait, O monk. When I marry a husband who is powerful, I shall teach you a lesson."<br><br>Later, she was married to the King of Udena. When she heard that the Buddha had entered the city, her hatred of the Buddha rose again and she bribed and instigated the people to insult the Buddha so as to drive Him away.<br><br>Ananda, who was with the Buddha, did not want to stay on and endure the insults, but the Buddha advised him to practice tolerance and patience. The Buddha said, "As an elephant in the battle-field withstand the arrows shot from a bow, even so will I endure abuse of irreligious people. "The Buddha said that the abusive talk would not last long, for such is the power of the Buddha. They stayed on in Udena, and all the abuse ended shortly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>42. ALAVAKA, THE DEMON</strong><br><br>Alavaka, living near the city of Alavi, feasted on human flesh. So fierce, powerful and crafty was he that he was known as the 'Demon.'<br><br>One day, the King of Alavi went hunting for deer in the jungle when Alavaka caught him. The king begged to be released, but in return for his freedom he had to send one person everyday into the jungle as offering for Alavaka.<br><br>Everyday a prisoner would be sent into the forest with a plate of rice. He was told that to gain freedom he had to go to a certain tree, leave the plate there and he could go free. At first many prisoners volunteered to go on that 'simple' mission. But as the days went by and no one returned to tell the other prisoners what had happened, the prisoners were forced each day to go into the forest.<br><br>Soon the prison became empty. How was the king to fulfil his promise of sending a person each day to be eaten by the Demon? His ministers advised him to drop packets of gold in the streets. Those found picking the packets would be caught as thieves and sent to Alavaka. When the word got around, nobody dared to pick the packets. As a last resort, the king started catching children for offering. The terrified subjects fled the city, leaving it deserted. There was only one more boy left - and he was the king's son. With much reluctance, the king ordered that the prince should be sent to Alavaka the following morning.<br><br>That day, the Buddha happened to be near the city. When he surveyed the world with His Divine Eye that morning, He saw what was going to happen. Out of compassion for the king, the prince and Alavaka, the Buddha travelled the whole day to the Demon's cave and in the evening He arrived at the entrance of the cave.<br><br>The Demon was away in the mountains, and the Buddha asked the gatekeeper if He could spend a night at the cave. When the gatekeeper had gone to inform his master about the request, the Buddha went into the cave, sat on the seat of the Demon and preached the Dhamma to his wives.<br><br>When the Demon heard what had happened from his servant, he hurried home, very angry. With his extraordinary power, he created a terrifying thunderstorm which shook and lighted up the forest with thunder, lightening, wind and rain. But the Buddha was unafraid.<br><br>Alavaka then attacked the Buddha by throwing his spear and club at Him, but before the weapons could touch Him, they fell at the feet of the Blessed One.<br><br>Unable to frighten the Buddha, Alavaka asked: "Is it right that you, a holy man, should enter and sit amongst his wives when the owner of the house is away?" At this, the Buddha got up to leave the cave.<br><br>Alavaka thought, "What a fool I am to have wasted my energy trying to frighten this ascetic." So he asked the Buddha to enter the cave again. The Demon ordered the Buddha three times to get out and three times to enter the cave with the hope that he could kill the Buddha with fatigue. Each time the Buddha did as He was ordered. But when the Demon asked the Buddha to leave for the fourth time, the Buddha refused to do so, and said, "I'm not going to obey you, Alavaka. Do whatever you can but I'm going to remain here."<br><br>Unable to force the Buddha to do what he wanted, Alavaka changed his tactics and said, "I will ask you some questions. If you can't answer I'll split your heart, kill you and throw you over to the other side of the river."<br><br>The Buddha told him calmly, "There is no one, Alavaka, whether man or deva, ascetic, brahma or brahmin who can do such things to me. But if you want to ask anything, you may do so."<br><br>Alavaka asked some questions, which he learned from his parents who had, in turn, learned them from their parents. He had forgotten the answers, but he had preserved the questions by writing them on gold leaves. The questions were:<br><br>"What is the greatest wealth for a man? What brings the highest bliss when well mastered? What is the sweetest of all tastes? Which is the best way of life?"<br><br>The Buddha answered:<br><br>"The greatest wealth for a man is confidence. The true doctrine when well mastered brings the highest bliss. The sweetest taste is truth. Wise living is the decent way of life."<br><br>Alavaka asked many more questions all of which the Buddha answered. The final question was:<br><br>"Passing from this world to the next, how does one not grieve?"<br><br>The Buddha's reply was:<br><br>'He who possesses these four virtues - truthfulness, good morals, courage and generosity - grieves not after passing away.'<br><br>Understanding the meaning of the Buddha's words, Alavaka said, "Now I know what is the secret of my future welfare. It is for my own welfare and good that the Buddha came to Alavi." Alavaka prostrated before the Buddha and begged to be accepted as a disciple.<br><br>The next morning when the officers of Alavi came with the king's young son, they were surprised at the sight of the Buddha preaching to Alavaka who was listening attentively to the sermon. When the boy was handed to Alavaka, he was ashamed of himself to receive the boy as an offering. Instead he stroked the boy on the head, kissed him and handed him over to the officers. After that the Buddha blessed the child and Alavaka.<br><br>Indeed, the conversion of Alavaka the cannibal showed how the Buddha, with his great wisdom and compassion, could tame a savage and change him into a gentle disciple.<br><br>[This message has been edited by obiwan (edited 25 February 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>43. SUJATA AND THE DISCOURSE ON THE SEVEN TYPES OF WIVES</strong><br><br>Sujata came from a wealthy family and was married to the son of Anathapindaka. She was arrogant, did not respect others and did not like to listen to the instructions of her husband and his parents. Consequently, discord arose in the family everyday.<br><br>One day when the Buddha visited the house of Anathapindaka, He heard an unusual uproar in the house and inquired what it was about.<br><br>Anathapindaka replied, "Lord, it is Sujata, my daughter in law. She does not listen to her mother in law, her father in law or to her husband. She does not even honour nor pay respect to the Exalted One."<br><br>The Buddha called Sujata to His presence and spoke kindly to her, "Sujata, there are seven types of wives a man may have. Which of them are you."<br><br>"What are the seven types of wives, Venerable Sir?" asked Sujata.<br><br>"Sujata, there are bad and undesirable wives. There is a wife who is troublesome. She is wicked, bad tempered, pitiless, and not faithful to her husband.<br><br>"There is a wife who is like a thief. She wastes the money earned by her husband."<br><br>"There is a wife who is like a master. She is lazy, and thinks only about herself. She is cruel and lacking in compassion, always scolding her husband or gossiping."<br><br>"Sujata, there are the good and praiseworthy wives. There is a wife who is like a mother. She is kind and compassionate and treats her husband like her son and is careful with his money."<br><br>"There is a wife who is like a sister. She respectful towards her husband, just as a younger sister to her brother, modest, and is obedient to her husband's wishes."<br><br>"There is a wife who is like a friend. She rejoices at the sight of her husband just like a friend who has not seen her friend for a long time. She is of noble birth, virtuous and faithful."<br><br>"There is a wife who is like a handmaid. She behaves as an understanding wife when her shortcomings are pointed out. She remains calm and does not show any anger although her husband uses some harsh words. She is obedient to her husband's wishes."<br><br>The Blessed one asked, "Sujata, which type of wife are you like, or you would wish to be like?"<br><br>Hearing these words of the Blessed One, Sujata was ashamed of her past conduct and said, "From today onwards, let the Exalted One think of me as the one in the last example for I'll be a good and understanding wife." She changed her behaviour and became her husband's helper, and together they worked towards Enlightenment.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>44. ANANDA</strong><br><br>The Buddha had no regular attendant during the first twenty years of His ministry. Several monks used to attend on the Buddha, accompany Him on alms rounds and carry His extra robes and bowl. The monks who served Him were Nagasamala, Nagita, Upavana, Sunakhatta, Cunda, Sagata, Radha and Meghiya.<br><br>These monks did not always obey His instructions. For example, one day when the Buddha and Venerable Nagasamala came up to a junction, the Venerable Nagasamala decided to go one way although the Buddha suggested that they should go the other way. The monk went along the road of his choice where he was robbed and beaten by highway robbers. He came back to the Buddha to be reminded of his disobedience and be consoled.<br><br>On another day, as the Buddha was on His way to the village of Jantu, Venerable Meghiya who accompanied Him wanted to stop by a mango grove and practise asceticism. Thrice the Buddha advised him against this, but he went his way. Eventually he returned to the Buddha and confessed that he had failed in his practice because almost all the time he was in the grove, three kinds of evil thoughts disturbed his mind: thoughts of sensual desires, ill-will and thoughts of cruelty.<br><br>When the Buddha came to the Jetavana Monastery in Savatthi, He said, "Now I am old, Bhikkhus. When I say, 'Let us go this way,' some go the other way; some drop my bowl and robe on the ground. Choose out one disciple to attend always on me." The Buddha was fifty five years of age at that time.<br><br>The Venerable Sariputta and Moggallana both volunteered their services, but the Buddha did not accept as they had other valuable services to perform to the world. The offers of other disciples were also turned down. As Venerable Ananda was silent, waiting to be nominated by the Buddha Himself, other monks advised him to offer his services.<br><br>The Buddha said, "It is not necessary for Ananda to be induced by others. He will serve me on his own accord."<br><br>Venerable Ananda agreed to serve the Buddha regularly subject to eight conditions:<br><br>1. He should not be given the robes received by the Buddha.<br>2. He should not be given the food received by the Buddha.<br>3. He should not sleep in the Fragrant Chamber of the Buddha.<br>4. He should not be asked to go with the Buddha to accept alms on invitation.<br>5. The Buddha should consent to invitations received by him.<br>6. The Buddha should give him permission to introduce visitors that come from afar to see the Buddha.<br>7. He should be allowed to consult the Buddha whenever he had any doubts to clarify.<br>8. The Buddha should repeat to him the discourses preached in his absence.<br><br>After the Buddha consented to these eight conditions, Venerable Ananda became the regular attendant of the Buddha for twenty-five years.<br><br>Venerable Ananda was the son of King Suddhodana's younger brother, and therefore a cousin of the Buddha. He entered the Order of monks during the second year of the Buddha's ministry. Not long after, he attained the first stage of Sainthood (Sotapatti) on hearing the sermon given by Venerable Punna Mantaniputta.<br><br>From the time he became the Buddha's personal attendant, he served the Buddha with devotion and care up to the Master's last moments. Day and night, he served the Master. At night he would go round the place where the Buddha was resting to prevent His sleep from being disturbed.<br><br>At the time of the awarding of ranks on the disciples, the Buddha recognised the Venerable Ananda as first among monks who are learned, mindful, well behaved and determined. He was greatly responsible for the establishment of the Order of nuns (Bhikkhunis) and the planting of the Ananda Bodhi tree which still survives today near the Jetavana Monastery.<br><br>Although Venerable Ananda had the rare privilege to listen to every sermon of the Buddha, he did not attain his Arahantship until after the Buddha had passed away.<br><br>Venerable Ananda lived to one hundred and twenty years of age before he passed away.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>45. KING AJATASATTU</strong><br><br>A Young King Who Was Misled by a Wicked Friend<br><br>King Bimbisara had a son, Prince Ajatasattu, who was a good friend of Devadatta. By frequent contact with him, Ajatasattu was influenced to kill his father.<br><br>One silent and dark night, he crept into the king's room with a knife tied to his thigh, but the guards caught him. The kind king thought to himself. "Ah, I have remained king for too long. It is time that I step down and make Ajatasattu the king so that he can rule in peace, and I can retire into a religious life." So instead of punishing Ajatasattu for his evil intentions, King Bimbisara made him the King.<br><br>After Ajatasattu was made the new king, he surprised everyone, including his father. Swift like a viper caught by its tail, he sprang round and threw his father into the dark and cold dungeon.<br><br>"Let him have no visitors other than my mother," ordered Ajatasattu, "and give him no food so that he will starve to death."<br><br>But the King Bimbisara did not die. His loyal wife secretly brought him food hidden in her clothes. When Ajatasattu found out and stopped this, she carried food in her hair knot. Again Ajatasattu found out. Finally, the queen had to bathe her body and cover it with a mixture of honey, butter, ghee and sugar. By licking this food off her body, he survived. At last Ajatasattu found this out and he forbade his mother from visiting his father. Now the king had no food to sustain him and would surely die.<br><br>But Ajatasattu lost his patience and demanded, "call the barber." When the barber came, he ordered, "I command you to go to Bimbisara's cell, cut open the soles of his feet with your razor, tear the skin away and put salt and oil on the raw flesh. Then I command you to force him to walk on burning charcoal until he dies."<br><br>When King Bimbisara saw the barber approaching, tears of joy watered his cheeks as he thought, "At last my son has realised his folly. Now he sends a barber to trim my beard and cut my hair before releasing me from prison." Instead, with the help of two soldiers, the barber carried on the orders and the good king died in great pain.<br><br>On that very day, Ajatasattu received news that his wife had given birth to a son. Great was his joy at being a father and thought came to his mind. He hurried to his mother and asked, "Tell me mother, did my father love me as much as I love my son?"<br><br>His mother turned around, stared at him in silence with her sorrowful eyes and then murmured in disbelief, "What did you say, Ajatasattu? You asked if your father loved you?"<br><br>"Ajatasattu, when you were in my womb, I wanted to drink blood from your father's hand. When he found this out, happily he cut his wrist for me to drink his blood for you. When the fortune-tellers predicted that you would be your father's enemy, I tried to have a miscarriage but he prevented me. Again I tried to kill you when you were born; he stopped me even though he knew that one-day you would kill him. Is that not love?"<br><br>"Do you see that scar on your thumb? That was a boil you had when you were small. You were crying from so much pain that nobody could put you to sleep. When your father heard this, he stopped from his royal duty and came running to see you. Gently he took you in his lap and sucked the boil until it burst open in his mouth. O my son, your father swallowed it out of love for you - that pus and blood. In what way did he not love you, Ajatasattu? Tell me, Ajatasattu, would you do for your son what your father had done for your? And you want him dead."<br><br>When he heard this, Ajatasattu was choked with tears. He ordered his guards, "Run, run and release my father before he dies." But none of them moved. "Go, I command you. Release my father before he dies," Ajatasattu shouted.<br><br>The his adviser stepped forward and said slowly, "Great king, your father has just died this morning." Ajatasattu fell on his knees and cried until his body jerked violently, uttering, "Forgive me, father. Please forgive me."<br><br>Ajatasattu realised what was the love of a father only when he became a father himself. As for King Bimbisara, he was reborn as a deva in the Catummaharajika Heaven.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>46. KING PASENADI OF KOSALA  (1)</strong><br><br>A Royal Supporter of the Buddha<br><br>King Pasenadi Kosala was the king of Kosala, which was north of Magadha ruled by King Bimbisara. The capital of the kingdom of Kosala was Savatthi. One of his sisters was the chief queen of King Bimbisara, and hence he was the brother-in-law of King Bimbisara.<br><br>King Pasenadi Kosala became a follower of the Buddha very early in the Buddha's ministry, and had remained a loyal supporter ever since. His chief queen was Mallika, a wise and religious queen who was well versed in the Dhamma and acted as his religious guide on several occasions.<br><br>The first time the King met the Buddha, he asked, "How is it that Master Gotama claimed that He has gained Full Enlightenment? Master Gotama is both young in years and young as a monk."<br><br>The Buddha replied, "Great king, there are four things that should not be looked down upon and despised because they are young. They are a noble warrior, a serpent, a fire and a Bhikkhu (holy man). An enraged young warrior may ruthlessly cause harm to others. The bite of even a small snake may kill. A little fire may become a huge fire that destroys building and forests. Even a young monk may be a saint."<br><br>Hearing this King Pasenadi Kosala understood that the Buddha was indeed a wise teacher and decided to become his follower.<br><br>King Pasenadi liked going to the Buddha for advice. Even during his official duties, he found time to speak to the Buddha. When talking to the Buddha one day, he received news that his wife, Queen Mallika, had given birth to a daughter. The king was not pleased with the news because he wanted a son.<br><br>The Buddha, unlike any other religious teacher, spoke well of women. He said, "Some women are better than men, O king. There are women who are wise, good, who regard their mothers-in-law as goddesses, and who are pure in word, thought and deed. They may one day give birth to brave sons who would rule a country."<br><br>Once, the king came to hear that the Buddha had said, "Dear ones whom we love bring sorrow and lamentation, pain, grief and despair." The king asked Queen Mallika whether she agreed with the Buddha. She said that if the Buddha had said so, it must be true. But the king was not satisfied. "How can a loved one bring sorrow?" wondered the king.<br><br>Queen Mallika approached a Brahmin to ask the Buddha to explain this. After hearing many stories to explain this, the Brahmin related them to the queen. She then asked the king, "Sire, what is your opinion, is Princess Vajira, your daughter, dear to you?"<br><br>"Yes, Mallika, she is very dear to me," said the King.<br><br>"If some misfortune were to happen to Princess Vajira, would that bring sorrow and lamentation, pain, grief and despair?"<br><br>"Yes," said the King.<br><br>"Sire, it was with reference to this that the Blessed One said that dear ones whom we love, bring sorrow and lamentation, pain, grief and despair."<br><br>"Mallika," said the King, "it is wonderful, it is marvellous, how far the Blessed One sees with understanding."<br><br>When King Kosala lost to his nephew and had to retreat to his capital at Savatthi, the Buddha commented to his disciples that neither the victor nor the defeated would experience peace:<br><br>"Victory breeds hatred.<br>The defeated lives in pain.<br>Happily the peaceful live,<br>Giving up victory and defeat."<br><br>In a later battle, the two kings fought and King Kosala not only won, but he also captured King Ajatasattu alive with all his elephants, chariots, horses and soldiers. King Kosala thought that he would release his nephew, but not his horses, elephants and others. He wanted the satisfaction of keeping these material possessions as the prizes of victory.<br><br>On hearing about this, the Buddha told his disciples that it would have been wiser for King Kosala not to have kept anything for himself. The truth of this statement still applies to this modern war-weary world:<br><br>'A man may plunder, as he will. When others plunder in return, he who is plundered will plunder in return. The Wheel of Deeds turns round and makes the ones who are plundered plunderers.'<br><br>King Pasenadi Kosala passed away in his eightieth year when his son Vidudabha revolted against him.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>47. KING PASENADI OF KOSALA (2)</strong><br><br>One evening, when King Kosala was talking to the Buddha, there passed by on the road a band of ascetics with knotted hair, hairy bodies and long nails. They walked past slowly, with heads bent low. At once the king got up and knelt down to worship them, uttering his own name three times.<br><br>The king came back to the Buddha and said, "Sir, there were saints among those ascetics. Just see how calmly they walked with heads bent down." With His divine eyes the Buddha saw that those men were not saints but spies who were sent out to gather information.<br><br>"Your majesty," said the Buddha, "by mere appearances alone it is not possible for one who leads a life of comfort to know the real nature of another. If we want to understand a person's real nature, his good and bad qualities, we must associate with him for some time. We must be wise and have sharpness of mind."<br><br>"We can know a person's purity by conversing with him, observe his courage in the face of misfortune and understand his wisdom during discussions. The bad people, O king, sometimes pretend to be good and it is difficult for you to judge their state of morality."<br><br>King Pasenadi Kosala fought many wars with his nephew King Ajatasattu. He was defeated once and at another time he was victorious.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>48. SUNDARI WHO ATTEMPTED TO DISCREDIT THE BUDDHA</strong><br><br>In the 20th year of the Buddha's ministry, two important events took place. The first event was the conversion of the bandit Angulimala. The other event happened at Savatthi where some jealous ascetics tried to discredit him.<br><br>The Buddha and His disciples were famous and respected religious teachers at Savatthi. Large numbers of the citizens there came regularly to listen to their sermons and to offer them alms.<br><br>However, not all the people of Savatthi were followers of the Buddha. There were many ascetics who believed that their teachings were superior. They were very jealous to see more and more people going to the Buddha and His disciples to offer them alms and gifts of robes and medicine. Soon, overcome by jealousy, they decided to do something about it.<br><br>In Savatthi there was a female wandering ascetic by the name of Sundari. She was young in age and bad in character. The ascetics planned to attack the character and reputation of the Buddha and the monks through this female ascetic.<br><br>"Sister, you must try to help us do something about the Buddha," they told her. "He is attracting the supporters away from us."<br><br>"What can I do for you?" Sundari asked.<br><br>"You can help us by visiting the Jeta's Grove regularly, and find out as much as you can about the Buddha. With this information we may try to win the people back to support us."<br><br>So Sundari visited the Jeta's Grove regularly to spy on the Buddha. She did not know the real purpose - an evil one - why the ascetics had asked her to go there. When the ascetics knew that many people had seen Sundari going regularly to the Jeta's Grove, they killed her and buried her in a hole dug in a ditch nearby. They then went to King Pasenadi Kosala and reported that after Sundari had gone to listen to the Buddha preaching, she was missing.<br><br>"Where do you suspect she is?" asked the King.<br><br>" She may still be in the Jeta's Grove, great king," they replied. "We are worried because she has never been known to remain very long after the Buddha has finished giving his sermon."<br><br>The King said, "Then you must go immediately to search for her there."<br><br>The ascetics pretended to search for Sundari in the Jeta's Grove. After searching for some time, they went to the spot where they had buried her and dug up her body. Placing the corpse on a stretcher, they carried it back to Savatthi. All the way they shouted angrily at the top of their voices, "See, Lords, see the work of these monks who call themselves holy people. They are shameless and wicked liars. See what they have done. They have committed sexual misconduct with poor Sundari and then they have killed her to hide their crimes."<br><br>The Buddha's disciples became frightened by these accusations and did not know what to do, but the Buddha calmly told them to control their fears. There was nothing to be frightened about, since they were innocent of the crime.<br><br>The Buddha advised them, "the people will accuse you and scold you, but you will do nothing except to recite: Those who lie and those who deny what they have done are equal in their evil deeds and suffer. Just be patient. The people will see how calm you are and they will get tired of scolding you. Within seven days, the shouting and accusations will subside."<br><br>The people soon started to ask each other why the Buddha and his disciples were so calm. Then they remembered that the Buddha and His disciples were virtuous and they had never been known to commit any evil crime. Someone else had murdered Sundari. It was impossible that such compassionate religious teachers could have done it. In the end, the shouting stopped and the Buddha used this incident to give some advice to His disciples on how to endure abuse with patience: "When harsh words are spoken to a bhikkhu, let him endure with an unruffled mind."<br><br>After some time, the king discovered that those ascetics committed the crime. When they were brought before the king, they confessed their crimes in public and they were punished accordingly. After the incident the Buddha and His disciples became more honoured and respected in Savatthi.</div>

SIGALA WHO WORSHIPPED EVERY DIRECTION</strong><br><br>The Discourse on a Layperson's Duties<br><br>One morning, the Buddha left the Bamboo Grove to go into Rajagaha. On His alms round, He saw a young man called Sigala, dripping wet as though he had just taken a bath. This man was bowing down in each of the four directions - East, South, West and North, to the sky above and to the ground beneath his feet. The Buddha stopped and asked the young man what he was doing.<br><br>"This was my father's last wish just before he died. My father advised me to do this to keep away evil from the four directions, from above and below."<br><br>"It is the right thing to do, to keep your father's advice which he gave you as his last wish, but you must not take your father's words literally," said the Buddha. "Your father did not intend that you should actually bow down in this way." Then the Buddha explained the real meaning of worshipping the directions:<br><br>"To worship the East really means to respect and honour your parents.<br><br>To worship the south means to respect and be obedient to your teachers.<br><br>To worship the West means to be faithful and devoted to your wife.<br><br>To worship the North means to be pleasant and charitable to your friends, relatives and neighbours.<br><br>To worship the sky means to look after the material needs of the religious persons such as the monks and ascetics.<br><br>To worship the earth means to be fair to your servants, giving them work according to their abilities, paying them fair wages, and providing them with medical care when they are sick.<br><br>It is by doing these that one can keep away from evil."<br><br>The Buddha also advised Sigala of another four evils to avoid. There are four evils of conduct which should be avoided: Killing, stealing, sexual misconduct and telling lies.<br><br>Then there are four evil motives which make people perform evil actions: partiality or being biased and prejudiced, enmity, foolishness and fear.<br><br>Finally, avoid the six ways of wasting one's wealth: drinking intoxicating drinks, roaming about the streets until late at night, spending too much time at fairs and thinking too much about entertainment, gambling, associating with evil friends, and being lazy.<br><br>Young Sigala listened with respect to this advice and he suddenly remembered that when his father was alive, he had often told him what a good teacher the Buddha was. Although he tried to get Sigala to go and listen to the Buddha, Sigala had always given excuses that it was too troublesome, he had no time, he was tired, or he had no money to spend on the monks.<br><br>He confessed this to the Buddha and asked Him to accept him as His follower. He promised that from now on, he would keep his father's dying wish, but in the correct way as was taught to him by the Buddha.<br>17.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>50. AMBAPALI</strong><br><br>The Immoral Woman Who Later Became an Arahant<br><br>Persons of all castes, high and low, women as well as men sought the teachings of the Buddha - and He gladly received them. To Him, there was no caste in blood and tears. When the Buddha and His disciples stopped at Vesali, a lady named Ambapali offered Him the use of her Garden of Mangoes outside the city so that He might rest in the cool shade of her trees.<br><br>Ambapali was as lovely as the golden sun rising from the ocean, but was immoral in character. She did not intend to see him, but her servant said to her, "Lady, all the nobles and people went on foot to the Garden of Mangoes yesterday. When I asked them why they had gone there, they said that it was because of the man who is resting there. There was none like him. And he was the son of a king and had given up his kingdom that he might find the Truth."<br><br>Always ready for some new sight, she leapt to her feet, and got into one of her coaches and rode toward the garden, casting proud glances about her. When she arrived at the gate, she descended from the coach and walked through the palm trees and mango trees. It was very quiet, and even the leaves did not stir. Beneath the deep shade of trees, the Buddha was seated with folded hands and feet and behind His head an aura glowed like the midnight moon.<br><br>Ambapali stood there amazed, forgetting her beauty, forgetting herself, forgetting all but only the Blessed One. And her heart melted and flowed away in a river of tears. Very slowly, she approached the Buddha and fell before His feet and laid her face on the earth.<br><br>The Buddha asked her to rise and be seated, and spoke the Dhamma to her. She listened to these great words with ears that drank them as the dry earth longs for the rain. After she had received the Dhamma, she bowed at His feet and invited the Buddha and His disciples to a meal the following day. The Buddha accepted her invitation.<br><br>Now the nobles of Vesali had also come out to meet the Blessed One. On the way they met Ambapali who told them that the Buddha had accepted her invitation for a meal the following day.<br><br>They said to her, "Sell us the honour of His company for great weights of gold."<br><br>And she, glowing with joy, said, "Sirs, even if your were to give me Vesali and all its territories yet I would not give up the honourable meal."<br><br>In anger, the nobles went to the Buddha and requested the honour of offering the meal, but the Buddha informed them that He had accepted Ambapali's invitation.<br><br>The following day, Ambapali set sweet milk rice and cake before the Buddha and His followers, and she herself attended upon them in great humility. After the Buddha had eaten Ambapali sat on one side, with folded palms and said, "Holy one, I present this garden to the Order. Accept it, if it be your will."<br><br>The Buddha accepted the gift, seeing the purity of heart that made it. He then gladdened her with the Dhamma. This was the turning point of Ambapali's life: she understood the Dhamma and became a virtuous woman. Some time later she entered the Order of Nuns and with the heart of Wisdom strengthened in her, she became an Arahant. Just as the lotus does not grow on dry land but springs from black and watery mud, Ambapali, despite her immoral past, managed to achieve the height of spiritual development.<br><br>After this incident, the Buddha and His disciples moved to a little village nearby called Beluva. As the rainy season was about to begin, the Buddha decided to spend the last rainy season at this village.</div>

Immediately after his birth, Jivaka was placed in a wooden box and thrown away by his mother, a courtesan, on a rubbish heap beside the road.<br><br>That morning, Prince Abhaya, a son of King Bimbisara happened to pass that way as he was going to the palace. When the prince discovered that the baby was alive, he was moved by compassion and ordered it to be brought up as his adopted son.<br><br>When he grew up, Jivaka studied medicine for seven years under a famous teacher. Soon his unusual skill as a physician and a surgeon became known. He was called upon to treat kings and princes, including King Bimbisara himself. But of all the distinguished people Jivaka attended to, his greatest pleasure was to attend to the Buddha which he did three times a day. When a splinter from a rock thrown by Devadatta wounded the BuddhaÂ’s foot, it was Jivaka who healed Him.<br><br>Realising the advantages of having a monastery close to his house, Jivaka built one in his mango garden. He invited the Buddha and His disciples to the monastery, offered alms and donated the monastery to the Buddha and the monks. After the blessing ceremony of this monastery, he attained the first stage of Sainthood (Sotapanna).<br><br>Later, when King Ajatasattu asked him where he could go for religious discussions, Jivaka brought him to see the Buddha. Although the king had killed his father under the evil advice of Devadatta, King Ajatasattu became a distinguished lay follower of the Buddha and took a leading role in the First Buddhist Council.</div>

THE QUARREL AT KOSAMBI</strong><br>Better to Live Alone If We Cannot Find Good Friends<br><br>In the 9th year of his ministry, the Buddha was residing at Kosambi. While He was there, a quarrel arose between two parties of Bhikkhus. One party consisted of experts in the Disciplinary code or the Vinaya rules; the other group consisted of experts in the Dhamma or the Teachings.<br><br>The Buddha tried various ways to settle the quarrel peacefully, but finally when His efforts had failed, He left them without a word, taking with Him only His bowl and robes, and retired to the Paileyyaka Forest.<br><br>During His stay in the forest, an elephant ministered to the needs of the Buddha. The elephant cleared a portion of the forest in the midst of which stood a stone cave. Daily the elephant brought fruits as offerings to the Buddha. One day a monkey, who had watched the elephant making his offerings, brought a honeycomb as an offering too.<br><br>Meanwhile, the people of Kosambi found out that the Buddha had gone alone to the Paileyyaka Forest because of the quarreling amongst the monks. They stopped offering alms to the monks. News of this reached Ananda at Savatthi. At the end of the rainy season Ananda decided to visit the Buddha and told him that the people everywhere were eager to hear the Dhamma from Him, especially the people at Savatthi. In this way the Buddha was persuaded to return to Savatthi and some time after this, the quarrelling monks came to seek the Buddha's forgiveness. It was because of the quarrel at Kosambi that the Buddha gave a sermon in which he said: "One should associate with the wise, not the foolish. It would be better to live alone if we cannot find good friends. There is no companionship with the foolish."</div>

UPALI *</strong><br><br>The Buddha's Attitude Towards Other Religious Teachers<br><br>Upali, a millionaire, was one of the best pupils of another religious teacher, Nigantha Nathaputta, whose teaching differed from that of the Buddha. Being very good at debating, Upali was requested by his religious teacher to approach the Buddha and defeat Him on certain points on the Law of Cause and Effect (Kamma). After a long discussion, the Buddha was able to convince Upali that his religious teacher's views were wrong.<br><br>Upali was so impressed with the Buddha's teaching that he immediately asked to become His follower. He was surprised when the Buddha advised him, "Upali, you are a famous person. Be sure that you are not changing your religion just because you are pleased with me or that you are under the influence of your emotions. Thoroughly investigate my teaching with an open mind before you decide to become my follower."<br><br>At the Buddha's spirit of free inquiry, Upali was even more pleased and he said, "Lord, it is wonderful that you have asked me to think over carefully. If it were other teachers, they would have accepted me without hesitation, taken me round the streets in a procession and proclaimed that such and such a millionaire had renounced his former religion and embraced theirs. Yes, indeed, Lord please accept me as your follower."<br><br>The Buddha agreed to accept Upali as His lay follower but further advised him, "Although you have now become my follower, Upali, you should practise tolerance and compassion. Continue to give alms to your former religious teachers as they still depend very much on your support. You cannot just ignore them and withdraw the support you used to give them."<br><br>The Buddha's advice of tolerance, free inquiry and not accepting his teachings for emotional reasons has given a clean record in the spread of Buddhism. There has never been any Buddhist religious fanatic who forced people to accept the religion by torture or the fear of punishment. Buddhism was able to spread through peaceful means mainly because of its beauty and goodwill.<br><br>* This is not the Venerable Upali, a barber before he became a monk, who answered questions on the Vinaya rules at the First Buddhist Council.</div>

Once he was brought before King Bimbisara who wanted to see the unusual feet he had heard so much about.<br><br>Sona lived near the Vulture's Peak Rock in Rajagaha where the Buddha stayed during some rainy seasons. One day, Sona went to the Vulture's Peak Rock to listen to the Buddha's sermons about the happiness experienced from non-attachment of worldly desires. As he wanted to experience this happiness, Sona asked to be ordained as a monk.<br><br>After becoming a monk, he was taught to be constantly mindful, even when walking. Sona was very enthusiastic. Everyday he walked to and fro in the monastery until one day his feet developed blisters and bled.<br><br>Even after trying so hard, yet he did not experience happiness, only pain and disappointment. Thoughts of craving for worldly things still came to his mind. "It is no use," Sona said to himself, "I have tried so very hard, but have still not achieved what I wished for. It is better for me to return to lay life and enjoy the happiness I used to experience by performing charity."<br><br>When the Buddha heard about this he went to see Sona. "Sona," He said, "I have heard that you are not getting good results from your practice of mindfulness and want to return to the lay life. Suppose I explain why you did not get good results, would you stay on as a monk and try again?"<br><br>"Yes, I would, Lord." replied Sona.<br><br>"Sona, you were a musician and you used to play the lute. Tell me, Sona, did you produce good music when the lute string was well tuned, neither too tight nor too loose?"<br><br>"I was able to produce good music, Lord." replied Sona.<br>"What happened when the strings were too tightly wound up?"<br>"I could not produce any music, Lord," said Sona.<br>"What happened when the strings were too slack?"<br>"I could not produce any music at all, Lord." replied Sona.<br><br>"Sona, do you now see why you did not experience the happiness of renouncing worldly craving? You have been strained too hard in your meditation. Do it in a relaxed way, but without being slack. Try it again and you will experience the good result."<br><br>Sona understood and stayed on in the monastery as a monk and soon he attained sainthood.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>55. MAHA PAJAPATI GOTAMI</strong><br><br>The Establishment of the Order of Bhikkhunis (Nuns)<br><br>In the 5th year of His ministry, the Buddha was staying at Vesali when he heard that his father, King Suddhodana, was ill. He decided to visit him again at Kapilavatthu to preach to him the Dhamma. After hearing the Dhamma, the King immediately attained Arahantship and passed away peacefully seven days later. It was in this year that the Order of Nuns was founded at the request of Maha Pajapati Gotami, the aunt and foster mother of the Buddha.<br><br>Three times she approached the Buddha and asked Him to ordain her into the Sangha, but each time the Buddha refused, without giving any reason. After the Buddha had stayed at Kapilavatthu as long as He liked, He journeyed back to Vesali.<br><br>Pajapati Gotami was quite a determined lady, and was not so easily discouraged. She got her hair cut and put on yellow garments and surrounded by a large number of Sakyan ladies, she walked the distance of about 150 miles from Kapilavatthu to Vesali. When she arrived at Vesali, her feet were swollen and her body was covered with dust. She stood outside the Hall where the Buddha was staying, with tears on her face, still hoping that the Buddha would ordain her as a nun.<br><br>Ananda was surprised to see her in this condition. "Gotami, why are you standing here like this?" he asked.<br><br>"Venerable Ananda, it is because the Blessed One does not give permission for women to become nuns," she replied.<br><br>'Wait here, Gotami, I'll ask the Blessed One about this," Ananda told her. When Ananda asked the Buddha to admit Maha Pajapati Gotami as a nun, the Buddha refused. Ananda asked three times and three times the Buddha refused.<br><br>So Ananda put the request in a different way. Respectfully he questioned the Buddha, "Lord, are women capable of realising the various stages of Sainthood as nuns?"<br><br>"They are, Ananda," said the Buddha.<br><br>"If that is so, Lord, then it would be good if women could be ordained as nuns," said Ananda, encouraged by the Buddha's reply.<br><br>"If, Ananda, Maha Pajapati Gotami would accept the Eight Conditions* it would be regarded that she has been ordained already as a nun."<br><br>When Ananda mentioned the conditions to Maha Pajapati Gotami, she gladly agreed to abide by those conditions and automatically became a nun. Before long, she attained Arahantship. The other Sakyan ladies who were ordained together with her also attained Arahantship.<br><br>The establishment of an Order of Nuns with rules and regulations was something, which the Buddha did for the first time in the world. No other religious leader had given such a high religious position for women in his religion.<br><br>* These rules are related to certain Vinaya Disciplines.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>56. THE BUDDHA AND THE CASTE SYSTEM</strong><br><br>At the time of the Buddha, the caste system was firmly established in India. According to the caste system, a person's position in society was determined from the time he was born. There were four castes or classes of people in society:<br><br>The Brahmins or priests, who claimed to be the highest caste and the purest of peoples; the warriors ; the merchants and traders; the untouchables considered the lowest class of workers and servants who did all the menial jobs, and were treated as slaves.<br><br>The Buddha condemned the caste system, which he considered unjust. He pointed out that there existed wicked and cruel people as well as virtuous and kind people in every caste. Any person who had committed a crime would be punished accordingly by his kamma no matter what caste he belonged to. A person may be considered to have come from a high or low caste according to his good and bad deeds. Therefore, according to the Buddha it is the good and bad actions of a person and not his birth that should determine a person's caste.<br><br>The Buddha introduced the idea of placing a higher value on morality and the equality of man instead of into which family or caste a person is born. It was also the first attempt to abolish discrimination and slavery in the history of mankind.<br><br>The Buddha said:<br><br>"By birth one is not an outcaste,<br>By birth one is not a brahmin;<br>By deeds alone one is an outcaste,<br>By deeds alone one is a brahmin."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>57. THE MIRROR OF THE DHAMMA</strong><br><br>From the Rajagaha the Buddha, accompanied by Venerable Ananda and a large number of His disciples started the journey to the north. They would stop a while at every city and village, and the Buddha would preach the Dhamma.<br><br>They stopped at a place called the Brick Hall in a little village called Nadika. It happened that some monks and lay devotees had passed away at this village, and Venerable Ananda wanted to know the future states of those who had passed away.<br><br>The Buddha revealed that as they had been practicing what He had taught, all of them had attained one of the stages of Sainthood. He continued, "Now, it is natural for human beings to die; but if you ask this question each time a person dies, it wearies me. So, I will give you a sermon called 'The Mirror of Truth or The Mirror of the Dhamma." With this, a noble disciple can predict for himself, 'There is no more hell for me, no more sorrowful, evil and low states. I am a Sotapanna and I am not subject to fall back to the lower states. I shall be assured of final Enlightenment."<br><br>"What, O Ananda, is the Mirror or Truth? Herein a noble disciple has absolute confidence in the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha. Because of his confidence, he spends much time to reflect or think about the great qualities of the Triple Gem. These reflections will help him develop the great qualities within himself and the power to concentrate the mind. These results will help him attain the first stage of Sainthood (Sotapanna).<br><br>"Possessing this Mirror of Truth, a noble disciple shall be able to predict for himself that he shall not fall back to lower states like hell, the animal world, the ghost world and other sorrowful and unhappy states."<br><br>After delivering this sermon at Nadika, the Buddha and His disciples then proceeded to Vesali.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>58. THE BUDDHA'S ATTITUDE TO MIRACLES</strong><br><br>When the Buddha was once living at Nalanda in the Pavarika Grove, a man by the name of Kevaddha went up to the Buddha, paid homage to Him and said, "Lord, Nalanda is a successful city. The people living in Nalanda are prosperous, and they have confidence in the Blessed One. Lord, it would be good if the Blessed One appointed a Bhikkhu to work a marvel of supernormal power, so that the people of Nalanda might become much more confident in the Blessed One."<br><br>The Buddha replied, "Kevaddha, I do not teach the Law to Bhikkhus in that way." The Buddha gave the same reply when the question was put to Him the second and third time. After the third question, the Buddha replied that there were three kinds of supernormal levels:<br><br>1. The marvel of supernormal power to appear as many persons, to pass through walls, to fly through the air, walk on water. All these are physical actions the ordinary people cannot perform.<br><br>2. The supernormal power to read other people's minds.<br><br>3. The supernormal power to be able to guide people according to their mental development, for their own good, using suitable methods to fit these people.<br><br>The first two supernormal powers if displayed for their own sake in order to impress people, are no different from the performance of magicians. A Bhikkhu who practices such worldly miracles is a source of shame, humiliation and disgust. Such actions may impress and win converts and followers, but they do not bring Enlightenment to help them put an end to suffering.<br><br>The third kind of supernormal power though which may be called a 'miracle' helps people to get rid of suffering. This is the only supernormal power that is fit to be practiced.<br><br>The only miracles that should be performed are these: when you see a man full of passion, craving and greed and you teach him to free himself from passion, craving and greed; when you see a man is a slave to hatred and anger, you use your powers to help him control his hatred and anger; when you come across a man who is ignorant and who cannot see the true nature of the world (everything in this world is impermanent, sorrowful and egoless) and you use your powers to help him overcome his ignorance. These are worthy 'miracles' you can perform.<br><br>This advice to Kevaddha was also extended to the Vinaya rules that forbid monks from performing miracles to impress people and gain converts, without helping them to be enlightened. This was clear in the case of Pindola.<br><br>Arahant Pindola Bharadwaja was famous for miraculous psychic powers. A rich man wanting this monk to prove his psychic powers placed a beautiful bowl at the top of a high place and challenged any holy man to get the bowl down. If he could do it, he could keep the bowl.<br><br>Pindola Bharadwaja flew up and took the bowl down easily. This was also done to prove to the rich man that there are saints in the world, a fact that the rich man did not believe. When the Buddha came to know about this incident, He called Pindola Bharadwaja to bring his bowl. He broke the bowl into pieces in front of a large gathering of Bhikkhus, saying, "I am displeased about the demonstration of your psychic powers. You must never show off your powers just to impress simple ignorant people."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>59. THE BUDDHA'S ILLNESS AND ANNOUNCEMENT</strong><br><br>The Buddha had not been staying very long at Beluva during the rainy season when He became sick. The severe sickness attacked Him with violent and deadly pains. But mindful and self possessed He bore them without complaint. And this thought came into His mind: "it would not be right for me to pass away without addressing the disciples, without taking leave of the Order. Let me now by a strong effort of the will suppress this sickness." He suppressed the sickness and it abated.<br><br>And when He began to recover, He went out of the monastery, and sat down behind it on a seat spread out for Him. The Venerable Ananda went where the Buddha was, and sat respectfully beside Him, and said, "I have seen how the Blessed One suffered, and at that sight my body became weak as a creeper. Yet I had some little comfort in thinking that the Blessed one would not pass away until He had left some instructions for the Order."<br><br>"What then, Ananda? Does the Order expect that from me?" said the Buddha. "Now, a perfect One does not think that it is He who shall lead the Order or that it is dependent upon him. I too, Ananda, am now grown old and full of years. My journey is drawing to its close. Therefore, Ananda, each of you should make himself his island, himself and no other his refuge. Each of you should make the Law his island, the Law and no other his refuge. And whoever after I am dead shall be an island onto themselves, who make the Law their island, the Law as their refuge, they will be the foremost among my bhikkhus."<br><br>Though old and feeble, the Buddha continued to use every opportunity to speak the Dhamma to His disciples. He also went on alms rounds when there were no private invitations from the villagers at Beluva.<br><br>One morning the Buddha robed himself early in the morning and taking His bowl went into Vesali for alms. When he returned from his alms round, He spoke to the Venerable Ananda: "Take a mat, Ananda, let us go to the Capala Shrine to pass the day."<br><br>They sat down on a mat and the Buddha spoke about the pleasant surroundings in all the shrines in Vesali, and then addressed Venerable Ananda thus:<br><br>"When anyone has practiced and developed the Four Means of Accomplishment, he could, if he wished, live for a longer period. I have completely mastered the Four Means of Accomplishment, and if I so wish, I could live longer."<br><br>Even though the Buddha was giving such a clear suggestion, Venerable Ananda could not understand its meaning to ask the Buddha to live longer for the good, benefit, and happiness of the many, out of compassion for the world. At that time Venerable Ananda could not understand because his mind was confused.<br><br>The Buddha addressed him; "You may leave me, Ananda, for a while." So Ananda went and sat under a nearby tree.<br><br>The Buddha had appeared on earth to teach the seekers of Truth how to see things are they truly are and to show the path for deliverance from all the ills of life. The Buddha reflected about the long years of teaching He had performed to fulfil His purpose. He felt that He had given all the necessary instructions to His followers, both monks and the lay followers. Not only were they following His teaching, they were also able to teach the teachings to others. He therefore decided not to live up to His full life span and announced to Venerable Ananda that He would pass away in three month's time.<br><br>Only then Venerable Ananda remembered what the Buddha had said earlier and begged Him to live for a longer period for the good and happiness for all.<br><br>"Enough, Ananda, do not beg me. The time for making such a request is now past. Let us now go to the Hall with the Pointed Roof in the Great Wood, Ananda," said the Buddha.<br><br>When they arrived at the Great Hall, He said, "Ananda, go and summon all the monks living in Vesali. Ask them to meet at the service hall." When the monks had all come, He spoke to them, "Whatever truths I have taught you, study them and put them into practice, so that the Holy life may last long for the good and benefit of the many.<br><br>"All component things must grow old and pass away. Work out your salvation with diligence. At the end of three months from this time, the Blessed One will pass away. My age is now full ripe; my life draws to its close. I leave you, I depart, relying on myself alone. Be diligent, mindful and virtuous. Keep watch over your own hearts. Who lives out diligently this Law and Discipline will leave the round of rebirths and make an end of suffering."<br><br>All the Buddha's disciples were grieved to hear the sad announcement of His death in such a short time to come. All of them came forward to pay their last respects except one monk named Dhammarama. They did not know why he did not come and suspected him of not being loyal and dutiful to the Buddha.<br><br>This matter was reported to the Buddha who summoned Dhammarama to His presence to explain his absence to all the other monks. He then replied that since the Buddha would be passing away in three month's time, he thought that the best way of honouring the Teacher was by attaining Arahantship before His death.<br><br>"Excellent, excellent! He who loves me should follow the example of Dhammarama. He honours me most who practises my teaching best," said the Buddha in praise of this monk.<br><br>The Buddha decided to continue His last journey the next morning. His next destination was the little village of Pava.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>60. THE LAST DAYS OF THE BUDDHA</strong><br><br>Many incidents in the life of the Buddha occurring after His 55th year were recorded without an exact indication of the year in which they happened. However, the incidents occurring in His eightieth year were placed in that year because they were recorded in the Maha Parinibbana Sutta.<br><br>When the Buddha reached His eightieth year, He felt that His days in this world were coming to an end. Although He had suffered the sicknesses and effects of old age like any other man, He was different from an ordinary man. With His mental powers developed through advanced mental training, He was able to overcome certain painful feelings of the body. His mind was always sparkling like a radiant diamond, even though His body was beginning to weaken.<br><br>In this last year of His life, he decided to spend His last days in the peaceful and simple surroundings of Kusinaga, a small village in northern India. He preferred to leave behind Him the large and prosperous cities such as Rajagaha and Savatthi and their crowds, their merchants and kings.<br><br>The starting point of His journey was Rajagaha, the capital of Magadha. He journeyed on foot, accompanied by Venerable Ananda and many disciples, going through many cities and villages. By this time, Venerable Rahula and Yasodhara had already passed away, and so had the Buddha's two chief disciples, Venerable Moggallana and Venerable Sariputta.<br><br>During the travels, the Buddha's thoughts turned to the welfare of the Order of monks. Many of His sermons were concerned with advising on how the monks should behave to ensure that the Order would carry on after His death. He reminded His disciples to practice all the truths that He had taught them.<br><br>One sermon reminded the disciples to practise the seven factors of Enlightenment. Another sermon was on the four ways to check whether a teaching was the teaching of the Buddha or not, by comparing them with the Vinaya (the disciplinary rules for the Order) and the Suttas (sermons of the Buddha).<br><br>There was one sermon, which the Buddha gave again and again during the many stops in His last journey. It was a sermon on the fruits following the three divisions of the Noble Eightfold Path: morality, concentration and wisdom, which would help His disciples to put an end to all sufferings.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>61. THE BUDDHA'S LAST MEAL</strong><br><br>On their arrival at Pava, the son of the village goldsmith, whose name was Cunda,   invited the Buddha and His disciples, to a meal called Sukaramaddava or boar's delight. Some scholars believe it was a special delicious dish of mushrooms with that name, while others believe it to be a dish of wild boar's flesh.<br><br>The Buddha advised Cunda to serve Him only with the Sukaramaddava that he had prepared. The other food that Cunda had prepared could be served to the other monks. Then the Buddha told him, "Cunda, if any Sukaramaddava is left over, bury it in a hole. I do not see anyone in the world other than the Blessed One who could digest the food if he ate it."<br><br>"Even so, Lord" Cunda replied, and buried the left over in the ground. He went to the Buddha, and after paying homage to him, he sat down at one side. Then the Buddha taught him the Dhamma. The Buddha also praised Cunda for the meal that had refreshed and strengthened Him after His journey. But soon after this, the Buddha suffered from an attack of dysentery, which he had earlier and sharp pains came upon Him. By an effort of will He was able to bear the pain. Though extremely weak the Buddha decided to continue on immediately to Kusinaga, a little more than six miles away. After a painful struggle, He reached a grove of Sala trees just outside the town.<br><br>The Buddha took his last bath in the Kakuttha river. After resting a while, He said, "Now it may happen that some people may make Cunda regret having given me the meal that made me sick. Ananda if this should happen, you should tell Cunda that you have heard directly from the Buddha that it was a gain for him. Tell him that two offerings to the Buddha are of equal gain: the offering of food just before His supreme Enlightenment and the offering of food just before He passes away. This is the final birth of the Buddha."<br><br>Then He said, "Ananda, please make a couch ready for me with its head to the North between two big Sala trees. I am tired and I want to lie down."<br><br>Now, on that occasion, those two Sala trees were covered with blossoms through the influence of the Devas, though it was not the season. They scattered and sprinkled the Buddha with the falling blossoms, as though out of respect for Him. Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ananda, "Ananda, the two big Sala trees are scattering flowers on me as though they are paying their respects to me. But this is not how I should be respected and honoured. Rather, it is the monks or nuns, or the men or woman lay followers, who lives according to my teaching that respects and honour me."<br><br>There are four places for faithful followers to see which would be their inspiration. These are four holy places made sacred by their association with the Buddha. They are:<br><br>1. The Buddha's birth place (Lumbini);<br><br>2. The place where the Buddha attained Enlightenment (Bodh Gaya);<br><br>3. The place where the Buddha gave His first sermon and set in motion the Wheel of the Dhamma or Truth (Sarnath);<br><br>4 The place where the Buddha attained Parinibbana or final liberation (Kusinaga).<br><br>A little while later it was noticed that Venerable Ananda was nowhere to be seen. He had gone into the hut, stood leaning against the door bar and was weeping. He thought: "Alas! I remain still but a learner, one who has yet to work out his own perfection. And the Master is about to pass away from me - He who is so kind!"<br><br>And, the Buddha sending for Ananda, said to him, "Enough now, Ananda! Do not sorrow and cry. Have I not already repeatedly told you that there is separation and parting from all that is dear and beloved? How is it possible that anything that has been born, had had a beginning should not again die? Such a thing is not possible.<br><br>"Ananda, you have served me with your acts of loving-kindness, helpfully, gladly, sincerely, and so too in your words and your thoughts. You have gained merit, Ananda. Keep on trying and you will soon be free of all your human weaknesses. In a very short time you too will become an Arahant.<br><br>"Now you can go, Ananda. But go into Kusinaga and tell all the people that tonight, in the last watch of the night, the Buddha will pass away into Nibbana. Come and see the Buddha before He passes away."<br><br>So Venerable Ananda, taking with him another monk, did as the Buddha bid him and went to Kusinaga to tell the people. When they heard the news, they were much grieved. And all the people of Kusinaga, men, women and children came to the two big Sala trees to bid a last farewell to the Buddha. Family by family, they bowed low down before Him and so bade Him farewell.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>62. SUBHADDA</strong><br><br>The Last Disciple of the Buddha<br><br>Now it happened that a certain wandering ascetic called Subhadda was staying near Kusinaga at that time and when he heard that the Buddha was about to pass away, he resolved to go and see Him about a certain matter before He passed away. He was sure that the Buddha could answer his question and clear up his doubts.<br><br>So Subhadda went to the Sala tree grove, and asked Venerable Ananda whether he could see the Buddha. But Venerable Ananda said, 'Enough, friend Subhadda, the Buddha is very weary. Do not trouble Him."<br><br>For the second and third time, Subhadda made this request and for the second and third time, Venerable Ananda replied in the same manner.<br><br>However, the Buddha caught a word or two of the conversation between Venerable Ananda and Subhadda, and He called Venerable Ananda to Him and said, "Come, Ananda. Do not keep Subhadda from seeing me. Let him come and see me. Whatever Subhadda may ask of me, he will ask from a desire for knowledge and not to annoy me. And whatever I may say in answer to his questions, that he will quickly understand."<br><br>Permission granted, Subhadda approached the Buddha, and after greeting Him, said, "O Gotama, there are many famous religious teachers who teach other teachings which are different from yours. Have they all, as they claim, discovered the Truth? Or have some of them discovered the Truth and others have not?"<br><br>"Enough, O Subhadda," said the Buddha, "you should not worry about their teachings. Listen to me and pay close attention to what I say, and I will make known to you the Truth."<br><br>"In whatever doctrine or Teaching in which the Noble Eightfold Path is not found, there also are not to be found those who have become Sotapanna, Sakadagami, Anagami or Arahant. But in those teachings where the Noble Eightfold Path is found, there also is found the Sotapanna, the Sakadagami, the Anagami and the Arahant. And in this Teaching of mine, O Subhadda, is to be found the Noble Eightfold Path, and in it alone the Sotapanna, the Sakadagami, the Anagami, and the Arahant are found. In no other schools of religious teachers are such Aryan (saints) to be found. And if only my disciples live rightly and follow my precepts or training rules, the world will never be without genuine Arahants."<br><br>Then Subhadda asked to be admitted to the Order of monks, and the Buddha granted his request. In this way Subhadda became the very last convert and disciple of the Buddha, just as Kondanna in the deer park at Benares was the first convert and disciple forty-five years earlier.<br><br>And by earnest and diligent effort in following the Teaching, Subhadda very shortly became an Arahant.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>63. THE BUDDHA'S FINAL WORDS OF ADVICE</strong><br><br>After the conversion of Subhadda, the Buddha spoke again to Venerable Ananda: "It may be, Ananda, that some of you will say, without the Buddha, the Sublime Teacher, there is no Teacher for us. No, Ananda, you should not think in this way. Whatever Doctrine and Discipline taught and made known by me will be your Teacher when I am gone."<br><br>Then the Buddha, addressing the other monks said, "If any amongst you has any doubts as to the Buddha, the Teaching or the Order of monks, ask me now so that afterwards, you may have cause to regret that you did not ask me while I am still with you."<br><br>But at these words, none of the monks said anything. None had any questions, and all of them were silent. For the second and third time the Buddha addressed the monks in this way. And for the second and third time, all the monks were silent.<br><br>The Buddha said, "Perhaps it may be out of respect for the Teacher, that you do not question me. Let a friend, O disciples, tell it to another friend." Still the disciples remained silent.<br><br>Then Venerable Ananda spoke to the Buddha, "It is wonderful. It is marvellous, Lord! I do believe that in all this great company of monks there is not a single one who has doubts or questions about the Buddha, the Teaching or the Order of monks, or the Path and the method of training and conduct."<br><br>"With you, Ananda," said the Buddha, "this may be a matter of faith and belief. But, Ananda, I know that not one single monk gathered here has any doubt or question about these things. Of all the 500 monks here, Ananda, he who is the most backward is a Sotapanna, not subject to fall back to a lower state of existence, but is certain and destined for Enlightenment."<br><br>Then the Buddha addressed all the monks once more, and these were the very last words He spoke:<br><br>"Behold, O monks, this is my last advice to you. All component things in the world are changeable. They are not lasting. Work hard to gain your own salvation."<br><br>Then the Buddha lapsed into the Jhana stages or meditative absorption. Going from level to level, one after the other, ever deeper and deeper. Then He came out of the meditative absorption for the last time. Then He passed into Jhana a little way; and from this Jhana He passed into Nibbana leaving nothing whatever behind that can cause rebirth again in this or any other world.<br><br>The passing away of the Buddha occurred in 543 B.C. on a full-moon day in the month of May, known in the Indian calendar as Vesak.</div>
