When he returned, he asked the master if he had ever read the Christian Bible. "No," Gasan replied, "Please read some of it to me." The monk opened the Bible to the Sermon on the Mount in St. Matthew, and began reading. After reading Christ's words about the lilies in the field, he paused. Master Gasan was silent for a long time. "Yes," he finally said, "Whoever uttered these words is an enlightened being. What you have read to me is the essence of everything I have been trying to teach you here!"<br></blockquote>In fact, there are so much similarity in both jesus and prince gautama although their background and life is totally different. If you read carefully about the life of the 2 person, what they are saying in fact is very same, although words are different and the crowd are different.<br><br>As for the question you asked, i am not sure about the answer, but I believed christians will said god is sinless and therefore a virgin.<br><br>From my point of view, gautama is here to tell us that salvation is thru ourselves as a man. He has gone thru what a man will go thru and what he did is what a normal man will do also, like eating, sleeping. He has also gone thru the events that an average man will go thru, marriage, fatherhood... he is telling ask that "god" is within ourselves, and if we can preceive it, we can end our own sufferings. In fact the buddha did not deny the path of other faith at all, he just said that he is the correct way...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>He who knows others is wise;<br>He who know himself is enlightened.</div>

[/B]</blockquote>yes, i am sorry, the way i put it is wrong. yup, buddha did not said he is the correct way, but show us the way like a guiding light. He did not put down other faiths and like you said, question it, and experience it. thanks...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>true, but that is their faith, what can they do, rite? they can't doubt about their faith, and must follow what the bible said. If the bible said A, they will do A. I find it sort of forcing sometimes.<br><br>remember I once told my pastor about eating "prayed" food because I come from a taoist family, the pastor ask me not to eat even if my family ask me to and not to hold joss stick at all or kneel down... I was young that time and i did what he said, and then my dad got so angry with me and said me I am unfilial to the bones, why i didnt even kneel to my mum. I remember clearly seeing his tears and saddness...<br><br>When I go back to church and told my mates and pastor, they are so happy and praise god and said god have given me powers to stand against my perscution. I remember how happy they were and said I did the right thing...<br><br>when i go back that day, i kept thinking why? and ask myself what i did is correct? and of course i ask god. god didnt answer, bible did not aswer... so i read up buddhism by chance and finally i conclude that i should tried it and see if it is correct.<br><br>In the end, i decided left church and imagine what the pastor and christians said to me, backsliders, you will go to hell blah blah blah, they are the ones who persecuted me too... and all their faces changed, at that time, i was thinking what the buddha said is correct... and i really made up my mind and leave.<br><br>After that, I went to my dad and said i am sorry and also I went to my mum grave and kneel and said i am sorry. kneeling in buddhism is very important, and it means respect, either to gods, people, dead.<br><br>------------------<br>He who knows others is wise;<br>He who know himself is enlightened.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>obiwan,<br>help me a little, i looking for something. years ago i was chatting wif a christian fren and a budhist fren bout religion. i was relating the story of the Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w)how when the Archangel Gabriel first came to him in a cave the Prophet was commanded by the Archangel to read the writings on the wall, but the Prophet was illiterate. the first word written on the wall was 'read' and miraculously by the grace of God the Prophet was able to read the writings.<br>my budhist fren said this story was remarkably similar to a story in budhism. do you know of this story? or was it already in your earlier post? if so, could you tell me which one? sorry did not read all your posts. i just curious bout this story coz that was a long time ago and i already forgotten wat my fren told me.<br>thanx in advance.<br><br>------------------<br>RockerZ!</div>

It is the story of The Sixth Patriarch Hui Neng.<br><a href="http://sped2work.tripod.com/huineng.html" rel="nofollow">http://sped2work.tripod.com/huineng.html</a><br><br>He is illiterate, but he did not have the miracale of able to read from the wall, but he get someone to read for him the verses on the wall. Later, he asked someone to write for him on the wall too.<br><br>------------------<br>He who knows others is wise;<br>He who know himself is enlightened.</div>
