            <div class='col-md body'><strong>1. KING SUDDHODANA AND QUEEN MAHA MAYA</strong><br><br>Long ago, there was a king called Suddhodana. He married a beautiful Koliyan princess named Maha Maya. The couple ruled over the Sakyas, a warrior tribe living next to the Koliya tribe, in the north of India. The capital of the Sakya country was Kapilavatthu.<br><br>Since King Suddhodana was a very good king and Queen Maha Maya was equally good, everyone in the kingdom loved them. But they did not have children and they were longing for a son for a long time.<br><br>One full moon night, in the palace, the queen had a dream. She felt herself being carried away by four devas (angels) to Lake Anotatta in the Himalayas. After bathing her in the lake, the devas clothed her in heavenly cloths, anointed her with perfumes, and decked her with divine flowers. Soon after a white elephant, holding a white lotus flower in its trunk appeared and went round her three times striking her on her right side. Finally the elephant disappeared. She woke up and found it was all a dream.<br><br>The next day, early in the morning, the queen told the king about the dream. The king was puzzled and so he sent for some wise men and asked them the meaning of the dream.<br><br>The wise men said, "Your Majesty, you are very lucky, the devas have chosen our queen as the mother of the Purest-One and the child will become a very great being." The king and queen were very happy when they heard this.<br><br>They were so pleased that they invited many of the noblemen in the country to the palace to a feast to tell them the good news. Even the needy were not forgotten. Food and cloths were given to the poor people.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>2. THE BIRTH IN LUMBINI PARK</strong><br><br>About ten months after the dream, the queen was expecting her child and so she went to the king and said, "My dear, I have to go back to my parents. My baby is about due now." Since it was the custom in India, for a wife to have her baby in her fatherÂ’s house, the king agreed, saying, "Very well, I will make the necessary arrangements for you to go."<br><br>The king then sent soldiers ahead to clear the road and some were retained to guard the queen as she was carried in a decorated palanquin. The queen left Kapilavatthu in a long procession of soldiers and retainers, for the capital of her fatherÂ’s kingdom.<br><br>On the way to the Koliya country, they passed a garden called Lumbini Park. This garden was near the kingdom called Nepal, at the foot of the Himalayan Mountains. The beautiful park with its sala trees and scented flowers and busy birds and bees attracted the queen. Since the park was a good resting-place, the queen ordered the bearers to stop there for awhile. However, as she rested underneath one of the sala trees, her baby boy was born. It was an auspicious day. The birth took place on a full moon (which is now celebrated as Vesak, the festival of the triple event of BuddhaÂ’s birth, enlightenment and death), in the year 623 B.C.<br><br>According to the legends about this birth, the baby began to walk seven steps forward and at each step, a lotus flower appeared on the ground. Then, at the seventh stride, he stopped and with a noble voice shouted:<br><br>"Aggohamsmi Lokassa<br>Jettho Lamasmi Lakassa<br>Settho Hamasmi Lokassa<br>Aya mantima jati<br>Natthi dani punabhavo."<br><br>["I am chief of the world,<br>Eldest am I in the world,<br>Foremost am I in the world.<br>This is the last birth.<br>There is now no more coming to be."]<br><br>After the birth of her baby son, Queen Maha Maya immediately returned to Kapilavatthu. When the king learnt of this he was very happy and there was rejoicing all over the country.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>3. THE NAMING CEREMONY</strong><br><br>King Suddhodanna had an old teacher who was known to be very wise, and was called Asita the Sage. Asita lived in the jungle. While sitting he heard the devas singing and saw them dancing. "Why are you so happy?" he asked. "Because the most excellent of all beings has been born at Lumbini Park to Queen Maha Maya," replied the devas. When he heard this, Asita went quickly to see the king and queen and their newborn son.<br><br>The king was very happy to see his wise old teacher again. In the palace, after the sage was seated, the king brought the prince before him and said, "Teacher, my son was born only yesterday. Here he is. Please see if his future will be good."<br><br>As the king said this, he lowered the infant prince before the sage so that he might examine him properly. However, the baby turned his feet on to the sageÂ’s head. Thus surprised, Asita took hold of the babyÂ’s feet and examined them very carefully finding some marks on them. He got up and said, "This prince will become a very great Teacher in this world." The sage was very pleased and putting his palms together, paid due respect to the baby prince. The king seeing this also did the same. This was the first salutation of the king.<br><br>On the fifth day, the king invited five wise men to witness the naming ceremony and to suggest a good name for the prince. The wise men examined the birthmarks of the prince and concluded that, "The prince will be King of kings if he wants to rule. If he chooses a religious life then he will become the Wisest Â– the Buddha."<br><br>The youngest of the five wise men, Kondanna then said, "This prince will be the Buddha and nothing else."<br><br>Then the wise men gave him the name Siddhartha meaning "wish-fulfilled" or "one who has accomplished his goal".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>4. HIS EDUCATION</strong><br><br>On the seventh day after his birth, Prince SiddharthaÂ’s mother died. The king had another Queen called Prajapati Gotami. She was the younger sister of Queen Maha Maya, and she had given birth to a son on the same day that Queen Maha Maya died. Prajapati Gotami gave her own son to a nurse and brought up Prince Siddhartha, whom she loved very much, as her own son. Prince Siddhartha could not remember his own mother.<br><br>When Prince Siddhartha was only a few years old, King Suddhodana sent him to school. There were many children in his class, all of them were from noble families. His teacher was called Sarva Mitra.<br><br>He learnt languages, reading, writing, mathematics, history, geography, science, and many games like boxing, archery, wrestling and many others. He learnt all these subjects faster than any other pupil in his class. He was the cleverest in the class and the best at games. He gained distinction in every subject and became cleverer than his teachers. He was the wisest and the only one who asked many questions from his teachers and elders. He was the strongest, the tallest and the most handsome boy in the class. He was never lazy, never misbehaved and never disobedient to the teachers. He loved everybody and everybody loved him. He was a friend to all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>5. PRINCE SIDDHARTHAÂ’S KINDNESS</strong><br><br>Prince Siddhartha was very kind to people, animals and other living things. As a very brave horseman he won many prizes in the country. Although he did not have to suffer any hardships and difficulties as he had everything, he always thought of the poor people and living things who were working hard to make him happy. He felt sorry for them and wanted to make them happy too as he always was.<br><br>One day he was walking in the woods with his cousin Devadatta who had his bow and arrows with him. Suddenly Devadatta saw a swan flying and shot at it. His arrow brought the swan down. Both the boys ran to get the swan. As Siddhartha could run faster than Devadatta, he reached the bird first and found, to his surprise, that the swan was still alive. So he gently pulled out the arrow from the wing. He then got a little juice from cool leaves, put it on the wound of the birds to stop the bleeding and with his soft hand, stroked the swan which was very frightened. When Devadatta came to claim the swan, naturally Prince Siddhartha refused to give it to him. Devadatta was very angry to see his cousin keeping the swan away from him. "Give me my bird, I shot it down," said Devadatta.<br><br>"No, I am not going to give it to you. If you had killed it, it would have been yours. But now since it is only wounded and alive it belongs to me because I saved its life," said Siddhartha.<br><br>Devadatta still did not agree. Then Siddhartha suggested," Let us go to the court of the Wiseman and ask him who really owns the swan."<br><br>Devadatta agreed so of them went to the court of Wiseman to tell them about their quarrel. The Wiseman said, "A life certainly must belong to him who tries to save it, a life cannot belong to one who is only trying to destroy it. The wounded swan by right belongs to Siddhartha."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>6. PRINCE SIDDHARTHAÂ’S WEDDING</strong><br><br>Now the five wisemen who had come before Prince Siddhartha at the naming ceremony, had warned the king,<br><br>" When your son sees a sick man, an old man, a dead body and a monk, he will want to leave the palace and become a monk himself." Thus the king worried that his son would see these four sights and leave the palace. Therefore, he gave him many young servants and did not allow any sick or old people or monks to go into the palace. He built Siddhartha three palaces, one for winter, one for summer and one for the rainy season, as well as enclosed parks and hunting grounds.<br><br>Siddhartha hunted and played in a sunny world of gardens and groves attended by dancing girls and musicians. He lived in a world of plenty and beauty, he could have whatever he wanted, yet he was not happy.<br><br>One day the king asked some wise people, "What shall I do to make my son happy? He seems to depressed and sad always." They answered, "Now your son is sixteen years old. Shall we get a beautiful girl for him to marry?"<br><br>The king agreed and sent for all the beautiful girls in the country to some to the palace. When all of them came the king asked the prince to choose one to be his wife.<br><br>Among them there was a most charming and kind girl by the name of Yasodhara. When Prince Siddhartha gave her a present more valuable than what he had given to the other maidens, the king saw that the prince had chosen his love. The king happily accepted Yasodhara and allowed his son to marry her.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>7. AN OLD BEGGAR</strong><br><br>After what he had done for the prince the king was satisfied that his son would follow his footsteps and become a king later. He ordered a high wall to be built round the palace including the park but the prince was not happy living like a prisoner. One day he told his father, "I must go out of the palace gate and see how other people live."<br><br>"Very well my son," said the king, "you shall go outside the palace wall to see how people live in my city. But first I must prepare things, so that all would be good and proper for my noble sonÂ’s visit."<br><br>When the people had decorated the city the king said, "Now you can go, my dear son, and see the city as you please."<br><br>As the young prince was going through the streets, all of a sudden, from a small old hut beside the road, out came an old man with long silver grey hair, wearing very old torn, dirty rags. The skin of his face was all dried up and wrinkled. His sunken eyes were dim and he was almost blind. There was no teeth in his mouth. He stood up trembling all over almost bent double holding a stick and he did this with two skinny hands to save himself from falling. The old beggar dragged himself along the street paying no attention to all the gay people around him. He was speaking very feebly, begging people around him to give him food as he would die that very day if he nothing to eat. When the prince saw the old man, he didnÂ’t know what he was looking at, as it was the first time in his life that he had seen an old man of this type.<br><br>"What is that, Channa?" he asked his driver. "That really cannot be a man! Why is he all bent? What is he trembling for? Why is his hair sliver grey, not black like mine? What is wrong with his eyes? Where are his teeth? Is this how some people are born? Tell me, O, good Channa, what does this mean?"<br><br>Channa told the prince, that it was an old man and he was not born like that. "When young he was like us and now due to his old age he has become like this." He told the prince to forget this man. But the prince was not satisfied. "Everyone in the world, if he lives long enough becomes like this man. It cannot be stopped," said Channa.<br><br>The prince ordered him to drive back home at once, as he was very sad and wanted to think carefully about that terrible thing called old age.<br><br>That night there was a grand royal treat for the prince but he was not interested or happy at all during the dinner and dance. He was thinking all the time, "Some day you will all grow old, everyone of you, even the prettiest."<br><br>He could not sleep when the time came. He was in bed thinking that one-day, everyone would grow old, grey, wrinkled, toothless and ugly like the old beggar. He wanted to know if anyone had found a way to stop this horrible thing - old age.<br><br>The king, when he heard this story, was very sad and worried that his son would leave the palace. So he told his attendants to put on more dances and dinners. But the prince begged his father to allow him to see Kapilavatthu on an ordinary day without the people being told of his visit.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>8. A SICK MAN</strong><br><br>The king very unwillingly allowed the prince to visit the city. He thought it would not do any good trying to stop him now and would only make him unhappy. On this occasion the prince and Channa dressed up as young men from noble families so the people didnÂ’t know them.<br><br>This time the city was quite different. No more joyous crowds of people hailed the prince, no flags, bunting, flowers and well-dressed people, but simple people doing their daily work to earn a living. A blacksmith was sweating and pounding to make knives. The jewellers and goldsmiths were making necklaces, bangles, earrings and rings out of diamonds, gold and silver. The cloths-dyers were dyeing cloths of lovely colour and hanging them up to dry. The bakers were busily baking bread, cakes and sweets and selling them to the customers who ate them still hot. The prince looked at these simple common people. Everyone was very busy, happy and pleased in his work.<br><br>Then he saw a man on the ground, twisting his body, holding his stomach with both hands and crying out in pain at the top of his voice. All over his face and body were purple patches, his eyes were rolling, and he was gasping for breath.<br><br>For the second time in his life something made him very sad. At once the prince, being a very kind person and not liking to see people distressed ran forward and rested the manÂ’s head on his knee and said, " What is wrong with you, what is wrong?" The sick man could not speak but only cry.<br><br>"Channa, tell me why this man is like this?" questioned the prince, "What is the matter with his breath? Why does he not talk?"<br><br>"O, my prince," said Channa, "do not hold this man like that. This man is sick. His blood is poisoned. He has plague fever and it is burning all over his body. That is why he is crying loudly without being able to speak."<br><br>"But are there any other men like this?" asked the prince.<br><br>"Yes, and you may be the next if you hold the man as close as that. Please put him down and do not touch him or the plague will come out of him and go to you. You will become the same as he is."<br><br>"Are there any other bad things, besides this plague, Channa?"<br><br>"Yes, my prince, there are hundreds of other sicknesses as painful as this," replied Channa.<br><br>"Can no one help it? Will everyone be sick? Can it happen at any time by surprise?" asked Siddhartha.<br><br>"Yes, my dear prince," said Channa, "Everyone in this world. No one can stop it and it can happen any time. Anyone may fall ill and suffer."<br><br>The prince was even sadder this time as he returned to the palace dwelling on the man and his sickness.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>9. A DEAD BODY</strong><br><br>On returning to the palace after seeing the sick man, Siddhartha was very dissatisfied and depressed and was often seen in deep thought. The king seeing him so changed became very sad. Once again the prince asked for his permission to go out of the palace to see more life in the city. The king agreed as it was no use trying to stop his son.<br><br>This time again wearing the cloths of noblemen Siddhartha and Channa went out from the palace walking in many parts of Kapilavatthu. Then he saw a few people coming along the street crying while four men at the back were carrying a plank on which a very thin man lay flat and still. He was like a stone, never saying a word. The people then rested the person down on a pile of wood and set the wood on fire. The man did not move as the flames were burning the wood from all sides.<br><br>"What is this, Channa? Why does that man lie there so still allowing these people to burn him up?" "He does not know anything."<br><br>"He is dead," replied Channa.<br><br>"Dead! Channa does everyone die?"<br><br>"Yes, my dear prince, all living things must die some day. No one can stop death from coming," replied Channa.<br><br>The prince was shocked he did not say anything more. He thought that it was terrible that such a thing called death should come to everybody, even kings and queens. Was there no way to stop it? He went home in silence to his own room in the palace and sat deep in thought the rest of the day. Very sadly he pondered, "Everyone in the world must some day die, no one has found out how to stop it. There must be a way to stop it. I must find it out and help the whole world."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>10. THE MONK</strong><br><br>Once again after many days Siddhartha visited the city for the fourth time. As he was driving to the park he saw a happy man wearing an orange coloured robe. He asked Channa, "Who is this man wearing an orange robe? His hair is shaved off. Why does he look so happy? How does he live and what does he do for a living?"<br><br>"That is a monk," said Channa, "he lives in a temple, goes from house to house for his food and goes from place to place telling people how to be peaceful and good." The prince felt very happy now. He thought, "I must become one like that," as he walked through the park.<br><br>He walked until he was tired and he sat down under a tree to think some more. As he was sitting under the cool shady tree, news came that his wife had given birth to a fine baby boy. When he heard the news he said, " An impediment ("rahula") has been born to me, an obstacle to my leaving has been born," and thus his sonÂ’s name became "Rahula".<br><br>As he was returning to the palace he met the Princess called Kisagotami. She was looking out of the window and saw the prince coming and she was so taken in by the young handsome prince that she said loudly, "O! How happy must be the mother, and father, and the wife of such a handsome young prince!"<br><br>As he passed this women, he heard this and thought to himself, "In a handsome figure the mother, father and wife find happiness and Nibbana (escape from suffering, a lasting liberation which is happiness and genuine peace). How does one escape obstacles and suffering! I must quit this household life and retire from the world in quest of nibbana. This lady has taught me a valuable lesson. IÂ’II send her a teacherÂ’s fee." And loosening a valuable pearl necklace Siddhartha sent it to Kisagotami with thanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>11. LEAVING HOME</strong><br><br>The king arranged a grand dinner and dance for the prince to celebrate the birth of  Rahula. Invited were the best dancers and singers and musicians in the country. The king did this because he saw that the prince was depressed although he just had a son, and the king thought that the prince was going to leave the place for good. So for the last time he did his best to stop this from happening by distracting the prince.<br><br>The prince attended the party just to please his father. During the dinner the most delicious food was served, and the most enchanting, and beautiful dancing girls in the country performed before him. But he was so tired from thinking that he soon fell asleep.<br><br>When the singers and the dancers saw this they too stopped and fell asleep. Some time later that night the prince awoke and was shocked to see these sleeping people. What a sight! - All the prettiest, most charming dancing girls and singers in the country, who, hours ago, were trying to make the prince so happy, were now all over the floor of the room in the most ugly, shameful and loathsome positions. Some people were snoring like pigs, with their mouths wide open, some grinding and chewing their teeth like hungry devils. This alteration in their appearance made the prince even more disgusted and unhappy. "How oppressive and stifling this all is," he thought and his mind turned towards leaving the palace. So he got up quietly from the room and got Channa to saddle his horse Kanthaka.<br><br>As Channa was getting his horse ready Siddhartha went quietly to see his newborn son for the first time. His wife was sleeping with the baby besides her and her hand resting on the babyÂ’s head. He said to himself, "If I try to move her hand so I can take the child for one last cuddle I fear I will wake her and she will prevent me from going. No! I must go but when I have found what I am going looking for, I shall come back and see him and his mother again."<br><br>Siddhartha then quietly he left the palace at midnight on his white horse Kanthaka accompanied by Channa, his faithful servant, holding on to its tail. He came to the cityÂ’s gate and nobody stopped him as he rode away from all who knew, respected and loved him. He took a last look at Kapilavatthu - sleeping so quietly in the moonlight. He was going away to learn to understand old age, sickness and death.<br><br>He rode to the bank of the river Anoma ["illustrious"] and dismounted from his horse. He removed his jewellery and princely cloths and gave them to Channa to return to the king. Then he took his sword and cut his long hair, donned simple cloths, took a begging bowl and asked Channa to go back with Kanthaka.<br><br>"It is no use living in the palace without you my master," said Channa very sadly, "I want to follow you." But Siddhartha wouldnÂ’t let him although Channa asked three times.<br><br>At last Channa started to go but the horse refused. The prince talked to the horse very kindly, "Please, Kanthaka, go with my friend. DonÂ’t wait for me." But Kanthaka thought, "I shall never see my master again." Tears rolled down from its eyes as it kept its eyes fixed on the prince until he was out of sight. As Siddhartha did so KanthakaÂ’s heart burst and he died of sorrow.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>12. KING BIMBISARAÂ’S OFFER</strong><br><br>From the Anoma River, dressed as a beggar, the young prince wandered from place to place. Eventually he came to Rajagaha City, where King Bimbisara lived. With his begging bowl in his hands Siddhartha walked round the streets begging for food from door to door like any other religious monk. People began to call him Â‘SageÂ’, others called him Â‘Ascetic" or "Ascetic GotamaÂ’, but nobody called him Prince Siddhartha any more.<br><br>He was most handsome, young, healthy, clean and neat. He spoke very kindly and gently. He did not ask people to give him anything but people were happy and pleased to put some food into his bowl.<br><br>Some people went and told the king. "Your majesty, there is a young man. Some people call him Â‘Ascetic GotamaÂ’. He is very clean, neat, kind, polite and not like a beggar at all."<br><br>When King Bimbisara heard the name Â‘GotamaÂ’ he knew at once that this prince was the son of King Suddhodana, his friend. He went up to him and asked him, " Why do you do this? Have you quarrelled with your father? Why do you go about like this? Stay here and I shall give you half of my kingdom."<br><br>"Thank you very much Sir, I love my parents, my wife, my son, you and everybody. I want to find out a way to stop old age, sickness, worries and death. Therefore I am going thus," said Ascetic Gotama and off he went.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>13. ALARA AND UDDAKA</strong><br><br>At this time in India there were many religious teachers. One of the best and most well known one was Alara Kalama. Ascetic Gotama went to study under him. He stayed and was taught many things including meditation. He worked hard and eventually equalled his teacher in learning. Finally Alara Kalama could not teach Gotama any more and he said, "You are the same as I am now. There is no difference between us. Stay here and take my place and teach my pupils with me."<br><br>But Gotama was not interested in staying. Despite what he had learnt he could see that he was still subject to old age, sickness, and death and that his quest was not over.<br><br>Thus, Gotama left Alara Kalama and went in search of a new teacher. At last he found another great teacher who was famous for his cleverness called Uddaka. Again, Gotama learnt very quickly and soon knew as much as his teacher. He also found that Uddaka too, could not teach him how to stop suffering, old age and death and he had never heard of anyone who could solve these problems. Once again Ascetic Gotama was disappointed and left Uddaka making up his mind to struggle by himself until he found the cause of all the suffering of life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>14. TORTURING THE BODY</strong><br><br>After leaving Uddaka, Ascetic Gotama met his five friends - Kondanna, Bhadduya, Wappa, Mahanama and Assaji - who had also left the palace and a life of luxury to become ascetics. They went to Uruvela and for six years he struggled and tortured his body while his five friends supported and looked after him.<br><br>"I will carry austerity to the uttermost," thought Gotama, "and this way acquire wisdom." He practised fasting which was thought to be one of the best ways to acquire wisdom. Thus, he would live on a grain of rice a day, and later, nothing at all. His body became so thin that his legs became like bamboo sticks, his backbone was like a rope, his ribs chest were like an incomplete roof of a house, his eyes sank right inside, like a stone in a deep well. His skin lost its golden colour and became black. In fact he looked like a living skeleton - all bones without any flesh! He suffered terrible pain and hunger yet continued to meditate.<br><br>Another way of torturing his body was to hold his breath for a long time until he felt violent pains in the ears, head and whole body. He would then fall senseless to the ground. During the full moon and new moon he went out into the forest or cemetery to meditate wearing rags from graveyards and rubbish heaps. He became frightened at first, especially when wild animals came, but he never ran away from them. He stayed behind bravely in these dreadful places meditating all the time.<br><br>For six long years he did these practices and in spite of the great pain and suffering he did not find wisdom or the answers to his questions. He finally decided, "These austerities are not the way to enlightenment." So he went begging through the village for food to build up his body. When the five friends saw this they felt disappointed. They took their bowls and robes and wanted nothing more to do with him.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>15. SUJATA GAVE HIM MILK-RICE</strong><br><br>Now at the time in a nearby village called Senani there lived a young, very beautiful and rich girl called Sujata who wanted a husband of equal rank and a son. She had waited for many years and she was not successful. The people told her that she must go to certain banyan tree near Neranjara river and pray to the tree-god to give her a husband and son. She did as the people told her and later on she got married to a young man and they had a lovely son. She was extremely happy and decided to fulfil her vow to the tree-god for giving her all that she had asked for.<br><br>Sujata had a thousand cows and she fed them with sweet creepers called valmee so that the cowÂ’s milk was sweet. She milked these thousand cows and fed that milk to five hundred cows, and then fed their milk to two hundred and fifty cows and so on until she fed only eight cows. She did this to get the sweetest and most nourishing milk to a make the delicious rice milk as an offering to the tree-god. As she was doing this she was surprised to see her servant running back from cleaning and preparing the area at the foot of the banyan tree. Very happy and excited, the servant said, "O! My lady! Sujata the Banyan god is meditating at the foot of the tree. How lucky you must be to have the god in person to accept your food."<br><br>Sujata too was happy and excited and danced with joy with the servant. They then took even more pains to prepare the milk-rice, pouring it into a golden bowl.<br><br>Taking the delicious milk-rice both of them went to the Banyan tree and Sujata saw what she perceived to be a holy man. He was handsome and golden looking and sat serenely in meditation. She did not know that he was in fact Ascetic Gotama. She bowed with respect and said, "Lord, accept my donation of milk-rice. May you be successful in obtaining your wishes as I have been."<br><br>Ascetic Gotama ate the sweet thick milk-rice and then bathed in the river Neranjara. This was the last food and bath he would have for seven weeks. When he finished he took the golden bowl and threw it in the river saying, "If I am to succeed in becoming a Buddha today, let this bowl go upstream, but if not, let it go downstream." The golden bowl went upstream all the while keeping in the middle of the river.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>16. ENLIGHTENMENT - BUDDHAHOOD</strong><br><br>In the evening after SujataÂ’s lovely meal Gotama went to Gaya and looked for a suitable place to sit down and meditate. He found a bodhi tree and sat on its east side, the side that was believed to be stable and free from trembles and quakes. After sitting cross-legged with his back towards the tree, he made a resolution that, "Though my skin, my nerves and my bones shall waste away and my life blood go dry I will not leave this seat until I have attained the highest wisdom called supreme enlightenment that leads to everlasting happiness."<br><br>So he meditated on his breathing in and breathing out on a full moon eve. In the first part of the night many evil thoughts, often described as being like the evil god Mara and his army, began to come into his mind. Thoughts of desire, craving, fear and attachment arose in his mind. Yet he did not allow these thoughts to disturb his concentration and he sat more firm than ever. He began to feel calm and brave as he let these thoughts go and in the first part of the night he found the power of seeing his own past lives.<br><br>In the second part of the night he realised the impermanence of life and how living beings die only to be reborn again. In the third part of the night he realised the cause of all evil and suffering and how to be released from it. He understood how to end sorrow, unhappiness, suffering, old age and death. With this Enlightenment he found real peace, happiness, freedom and Buddhahood.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>17. THE SEVEN WEEKS AFTER THE ENLIGHTENMENT</strong><br><br>1.Under the Bodhi Tree<br>During the first week after Enlightenment, Buddha sat under the bodhi tree experiencing the happiness of freedom and peace. He was free from disturbing thoughts, calm and blissful.<br><br>2.Gazing at the Tree<br>During the second week, in thanks and gratitude to the bodhi tree that had sheltered him during his struggle for Buddhahood, the Buddha stood gazing at the tree without moving his eyes as He meditated on the bodhi tree.<br><br>Following this example, it is the custom of Buddhists to pay respect to not only the original bodhi tree, but also to the descendants of the bodhi tree that still thrive today.<br><br>3.The Golden Bridge<br>In the third week, Buddha saw through his mindÂ’s eye that the devas in the heavens were not sure whether he had attained enlightenment or not. To prove his enlightenment Buddha created a golden bridge in the air and walked up and down it for a whole week.<br><br>4.Jewelled Chamber<br>In the fourth week, he created a beautiful jewelled chamber and sitting inside it meditated on what was later known as the Â‘Detailed TeachingÂ’ (Abhidhamma). His mind and body were so purified that six coloured rays came out of his body - blue, yellow, red, white, orange and mixture of these five. Today these six colours make up the Buddhist flag. Each colour represented one noble quality of Buddha. Yellow for holiness, white for purity, blue for confidence, red for wisdom, orange for desirelessness and the mixed colour represented all these noble qualities.<br><br>5.Three Girls<br>During the fifth week, while meditating under a banyan tree, three most charming girls called Tanha, Rati and Raga came to disturb his meditation. They danced in a most seductive and charming manner and did everything to tempt the Buddha to watch their dance. Yet he continued to meditate unperturbed, and soon they tired and left him alone.<br><br>6.Mucalinda Tree<br>Buddha then went and meditated at the foot of a mucalinda tree. It began to rain heavily and a huge king cobra came out and coiled his body seven times around Buddha to keep him warm and placed his hood over BuddhaÂ’s head to protect him from the rain. After seven days the rain stopped and the snake changed into a young man who paid his respects to Buddha. Buddha then said:<br><br>"Happy are they who are contented. Happiness is for those who hear and know the truth. Happy are they who have good will in this world towards all sentient beings. Happy are they who have no attachments and have passed beyond sense-desires. The disappearance of the word "I AM " is indeed the highest happiness."<br><br>7.Rajayatana Tree<br>During the seventh week Buddha meditated under the Rajayatana tree. On the 50th morning, after seven weeks of fasting, two merchants came into his presence. They were called Tapussa and Bhallika. They offered the Buddha rice cakes and honey to break his fast and Buddha told them some of what he had found in his Enlightenment.<br><br>These two merchants, by taking refuge in the Buddha and his Dhamma (sometimes translated as "teachings of the Buddha"), became the first lay followers. There was no Sangha or order of monks and nuns then. They asked Buddha for something sacred to keep with them. Buddha wiped his head with his right hand and pulled out some hair to give to them. These hair relics called Kesa Datu, where later reputed to be enshrined by the merchants on their return home, to what is now known as Burma, in the Shwedagon Pagoda in Rangoon.<br><br>[This message has been edited by obiwan (edited 25 February 2002).]</div>
