            <div class='col-md body'>Just wondering what would the boss think of you instead...behind your back....<br><br>Then again there are good and bad boss... there are good and bad employees...<br><br>There are bosses who seems to be quite demanding and there are bosses who are seems unfair or bad temper...<br><br>Theres also alot of employees who couldn't do a job without even trying. I also see people who just quit without even asking anything and done anything then throw everything back to the company.... many still expect to claim every single cent from the coy.. In fact I met loads...many colleague quit in a week.... I guess they can't take the heat... Life is like that what else can they do outside with this kinda characters? I have alot of team members something are like that... didn't do much in the end throw everything back... it lands the rest in deep shit.... hmmm I pity their future.<br><br>I guess often the company where you find good bosses are those with good communication. Is the boss open for communication? of is it you that didn't communicate well? Of coz there are bad bosses which I met too... but I guess there are no perfect company in the world.... only which company I can excerise my potential and talents more...<br><br></div>
