            <div class='col-md body'>hey rider...what u say is quite true...look to yourslef first before u blame others...<br><br>for my case tho...I have looked and I dun find anything that I have dun wrong...I have talked to her and we have always been able to communicate ,(due to me thnak u...she was a really shitty communicator whebn we first met...always sweep the problem away)...so we tallkined and she told me that It wasn't me at all because I treated her really well and cared for her even tho she cheated on me...<br><br>But then I thot about it...if she says she still loves me and only likes that guy, then why sin't she with me and always with him...&gt;?????my only answer is that she's lying her ass off or she doesn't love me or want me anymore...<br><br>then I thot about it somemore and I realised that she is also quite young (21) and I was her first real relationship so she had so much more she was probably curious about...I had already told her at the beginning that since I was her first BF she wouldn't stya with me...she denied until siaow but see what happened...*sighz*<br><br>So I blame her inexperience and the other guy and herself for cheating on me...not to say that I wasn't tempted before....twice girls asked me to cheat on her with them and twice I declined even tho I wanted to ....but she...never even had to consider it...just went straight after it...<br><br>What did I do? I forgave her and gave her chance after chance and was still nice to her....so my only problem was most probably that I was too nice...never took a stand for myself....but even when I did, it didn't help...she ran off anyway....<br><br>What do I blame it on?....after soul searching...not myself for sure....I blame myself for not having the things that i know girls always adore about guys....<br><br>1 money<br>2 talk kock skills<br>3 X-factor<br><br>the 3 factors that he has and I dun have...She told me that he wasn't even good looking asnd that he just had this X-factor that u just liked him when he talked to u...befoer she even told me he talks a lot of rubbish andcock, I told her that he probably can tok cock like nobodies business...she asked me how I knew....<br><br>It's never good to know things before hand in relationships...better to be dumb...*sigh*<br><br>so my probelm is that I'm very plain...very normal...no x-factor that draws people to me...no money to takje her out to do things (how many time s can u stay hiome and sit around and screw before someone gets bored?)...and I'm just too smart...I can't talk rubbish....everything I say is either based on facts and theories of some sort or just too rational...but common, It;s who I am...am I really going to change how I talk  overnioght?.....cannot?....It's what makes me me...:-(<br><br>And yes, i did and do wallow in self pity...but in fact I dun even blame anyone...Shit happens...It just seems to happen more to me than to most people no matter how good and nice I am to my GF....<br><br>and the funny thing is that all her Gal friends have relaly screwed up bf who beat them and shit like that...and she's always telling me how glad she is I'm not like them...but now?....how?<br><br>I do cherish her and wish that we could be together.....When I put the utltimatum to her she asked me why I wanted to give up so quickly in the relationship...what the Hell!!!????  I retorted...Dun't ask me, ask yoruself that question, your the one going out with another guy...your the one who ditches me every chance u can meet him...your the one who can't seem to make any time for me and dun even have the deceny to be truthfull to me....and I've given her so many chances and told her so many times that if she doesn't change her attitude towards me I would leave her....and she never changed....despite her words that she would...<br><br>All I can say is that i tried and I gave it everything I had, even when she wasn;'t putting anything into the relationship anymore I was still putting in 110%.....ubntil I got dumped by her after giving her another chance to treat  me better....<br><br>*sigh* and I ask myself...what is it about me that makes women cheat one me...and I can't come up with an answer...the resounding reason that  my Xes have told me they cheated was that the new guy \made them feel excited again...like they were  in love again....<br><br>My answer is alwasy that no relationship lasts like that fporevre...in a few short months u won't feel that exhillaration and exfitement anymore...it's how much u care about the person that u stay....<br><br>So I still can't find an answer...I've been thinking that maybe I find these girls who are too inexperienced...all of my xex who played me were inexperienced...learned from methen go cheat on me...younger grls usually won't want to settle fro one guy...just a plain fact that I have learned the hard way...<br><br>and it's not all the time that women haff the most to lose...I have always had the most to lose in these reklationshsips because I usually put more effort intot hem than the girls....they usually reap what I sow and maybe that;'s my downfall....If they never have a share in the realtionship then how do they connect themselves with it?...maybe...It could be...but it's an extremely small consolation...<br><br>Shit is all I can say...blast...I'lll never find a girl I can settle down with...The girls my age are after guys in their 30s with tons of money....and the experienced girsl want handsome young studs who can talk rot and insignifigance the whole day...not some ordinary looking semi-intellectual guy like me...onli aunties want people like us right guys?...hahaha:-)<br><br>no matter what women say, they usually mean the opposite...that's what i have learned...they alwasy liek to say they like this tyoe of guy and would like to end up with this type or wouyldn't want to be with this or that type, but it' usually the case that they get into relationships with the exact opposite of what they say...So I['ve come to not trust women when they tell me that they will never cheat on me...or that they'll love me forever...or that I'm so good to them that they'll never leave me...BS....that's all I can say<br><br>Sorry I jumped very badly off point there, but when I started to write it all just came out...It's what happens when the friends around u have no interest in how u feel or are too wrapped up in theri own lives to listen...so U come here to post your feeings in hope that someone out there will somehow sympathise with your plight...Quite sad how life is like ......<br><br>But thanks God there are still computers..if not I would have absoluetly ntohing to do but wallow in misery...I dun expect anyone to really read such longwinded rubbish about my problems..but it's here and I feel a slight biot better knowing thatsomewhere  there is aperson who knows what I'm going thru...<br><br>shit this post has become one big self pity ost so I wil stop....*sigh* life moves on and I'm sure as heck aint going to stand still for someone who obviously doesn't give a shit about what happens to me....<br><br>up up and away!!!!! :-)</div>

Things can't be that bad if some girls are obviously attracted to you enough to ask you to cheat on your gf. Maybe the part about you not being attractive enough is not as accurate as you think.<br><br>Self pity is good to wallow in because somehow it feels right. I do that a lot of time.

            <div class='col-md body'>pacman - u have a tendency to pick topics that die very fast? thot i was the one? if u look, i think i'm often in the threads u reply to as well. those short lived ones.... so what makes u think it's u and not me? haha! well not to worry, i think between the two of us, we should be able to stop this thread in no time!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>fire - what can i say man? shit happens! ur ex is prob trying to find herself. what she wants in a partner. and it sounds like she isn't too sure. give her some time and maybe she'll be in a better position to decide. she prob likes you both. that really is possible. i know of cases like this. so it's really not a case of her forgetting abt you. like they say, u never really forget abt ur first. in the end, it'll still be a tough choice for her. i really dun think she has fun wif him all the time. i'm sure she thinks abt you a lot too. even when she's wif him. and she prob feels saddened, guilty and nostalgic. whatever she decides i hope it'll be for her own benefit, for her own good (we guys sometimes have to pretend we're martyrs of some kind). sometimes in times like these, the girl just follows her heart and not her head. this is where she just "allows" things to happen....that is, she hasn't really decided but is letting her feelings decide for her. so even if she says that she's made up her mind, i think it may well be because she didn't have the strength to act otherwise....dunno if this makes any sense to you. whatever the case, all i'm saying is that even if she leaves for good it may not be because ur comparatively a less suitable guy. like u said, she's inexperienced....prob wants to see the world first. maybe u were too close to the real thing, and that scared her somewhat. commitment is a word not everyone wants to learn how to spell. at least not just yet.<br><br>maybe it's just u and i, but i do feel the girls i noe place a high premium on money too. but they have a euphemism for it - i think they call it a "sense of security" or something like that. but u do seem to have formidable talk crap skills what! maybe u just need someone of the same talk crap frequency and the same level of imagination too.<br><br>haha! like what u said abt the aunties! actually for me it's the lil' old ladies....they always look at me like i'm the one they want their granddaughters to marry or something! according to my sis, some of my neighbours (aunties inclusive) have a darn good impression of me! wonder why? if only they knew....haha! which makes me think, why can't girls look at me that way and think of me like that! geez.....<br><br>actually i've come across quite a bit of that in my exp too - girls saying one thing abt their dream guy and then going after the diametrical opposite. maybe it's some reverse psychology thingey floating around the milky way....u think? and the amazing thing is how they don't see that the guy is the exact opposite! maybe we should just pin it down to human beings not knowing what the heck they really want. like some profound guy once said, we are unknown to ourselves, we seekers after knowledge.<br><br>u noe the good thing abt facing all this crap alone? at the risk of sounding like a peanuts comic strip....it helps build character. really it does. i noe ppl who always need someone to hold on to whenever they're down. they run from person to person for support. dunno abt u but i am usu the one who listens to my frens' problems while they're very seldom there for me. u noe why? well they say i can always take care of myself better anyways. haha! either that or they're too self-absorbed. anyways, there is a certain sense of independence i've gained from all this. a certain sense of self-sufficiency. and i think it may be a good thing. to always noe u have it in yourself to get out of whatever crap ur in.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>and i think what ur doing is fine....it's like writing therapy....more ppl should do it. there was actually an article in, was it newsweek? where they talked of the benefits of writing ur thots down....in a diary or journal or sth....heck maybe even in a forum! it has a therapeutic effect. i have this fren who talks and talks and talks. and then i realised that the reason why was that he was actually healing himself. as he talked, he healed himself at the same time. and it made him feel better.<br><br>but shit happens....we all know that.<br>so try to hang in there okay? i know you'll do fine.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>rider - yeah i guess it's true....when u want sth too much that's when self-interest comes in. not really related but there is this saying that u should always think twice before doing something (to assess if it's the right thing to do) but never a third time cos that's when self-interest sets in. but i don't think u should see urself as a villain. for the simple reason that if she liked u too then it was something that the two of you once shared. when ppl break up, there are two ways u can look at it. one is that u lost the person because u were not good enuf. the other is that u lost the person because she found someone perhaps more suitable. it's a subtle distinction, but i think it's an impt one. in the first case, u may see urself as the "bad guy". in the second, the focus is on finding "the right person". and altho it doesn't help that u lost her anyway, i think it's impt to say that maybe she found someone who is more right for her than to think that u never meant anything to her at all, that u were never an impt and significant part of her life, worse still, that u were a villain of some sort. one way of thinking gives more hope than the other. that maybe someday you'll find the one who's right for you too.<br><br>pacman - alritey.....let's see if this thread dies now. haha! can't let u take all the credit for killing this topic u noe?

If a girl wants to be set free to try other things, then I might grow to accept that I might not be "right" for her at that time, or that she has to to live for herself. Stuff like that.<br><br>But, if she comes back later, if ever, would you take her back? Would you have that niggling doubt whether she will fly again when she sees something appealing?<br><br>Also, I do agree that when shit doesn't kill us it makes us stronger, but I think it takes someone who is very confident and optimistic to look at it that way all the time. I'm just wondering if you do get angry when shit like that happens to good people. Where the hell if the fairness?

I choose not to let it come into the equation...It won't help me or her....:-) (so smilez)<br><br>I'm feeling a lot better today for some reason...maybe due to the fact that I wrote it down so much here or because I have somehow learned to deal with it...as u know it' s happened quite a few times already...<br><br>and there is a sense of heroism in suffereing as a martyr...I guess it makes us feel better in a way...a trick to hide our own guilt whether perceived or real...:-)<br><br>Star...as always...ur the wise man of the forum...u voice out what I cannot.

It builds up independence, but sometimes you wonder if this makes you detached too. Sometimes, it's always better for someone to listen to you. Humans are all fallible, no matter how strong they are. But how many understood that? People tend to place fixed conceptions on the unknowns, resulting in biased judgements.<br><br>firewire:<br>Well, I think you've quite a charisma that has attracted so many girls to you. Perhaps fate has it that you're going to meet your ex-girlfriends first before meeting the right one. Be patient. She'll be there someday. Maybe she's just round the corner. Maybe she's just standing in front of you. "See" with your heart, you'll find her somehow.<br><br>MysteryRider:<br>Great to see that you've seen the whole picture better after you "view with ur purest heart".<br><br>Love is not for yourself, but for the other party. Once you understand this point, you can let go.<br><br>pacman:<br>Okay, on the point if you'll take her back, I think it's important to know how you feel about her.<br>If you acknowledged that you might not be right for her at that point of time, and hence it's best to let go, you'll let her go. And when she comes back to you again, you'll take her back for the same reason you let her go; you loved her. Why fear that she'll go again? If she's leaving you again for a good reason; perhaps you're just not suited for her, etc, so you just have to accept it. Love can't be forced.<br>Sometimes, people are blinded by illusions. If you know she is blinded by it, you should try your best to make her see through it. But sometimes, the best way to learn their lessons is for them to learn from their mistakes. If it's this case, just be there to support her. Like a baby learning how to walk, when he/she falls, you help he/her up and teach him/her up and tell him/her not to cry and be brave and walk again, until he/she can walk on his/her own. It's a process that requires patience, but it's something worth waiting for.<br><br>On the point of nice people, people who are really nice don't expect anything back in return for their kindness.<br>If they do, they are not really nice people; "kind" hypocrites.<br><br>As for fairness, guess no one is really qualified to judge what is really right and what is really wrong. Just do what you feel is right; things that are not against you conscience.<br><br></div>

Haha  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The thing Firewire said about suffering as martyrs... so true. Not only heroism I think, but has a sexual appeal as well. But just for ourselves I think.<br><br>About anger, I suppose its not the best way to deal with things, but isn't it normal to feel anger? Sometimes anger is good. It can act as a motivation for people who are weak in certain situations, like alcohol boosting your courage in clubs and all that. Still, I suppose it is an entity/ emotion that, like love, can act both ways and I suspect if we ask whether anger is justified we will never get a consensus.<br><br>Ocean: That point about good people not wanting something in return, touche man. I always thought I was pretty decent, but I suppose part of me wanted a good ending for myself. I dreamt up a saying, "nice people finish last, if you don't finish last you are not nice enough." Wonder if its my all consuming pessimism or just crap that I spew out once in a while.<br><br>Dear wise people, I'll venture to say that even after posting all these we will still go for relationships.

            <div class='col-md body'>pacman - u are a worthy adversary. not in recent memory have i seen such reckless and wanton thread prolonging (tp) just for the heck of it. i shall now demonstrate my tp skills too. even tho i have nothing much to say. give up? never!<br><br>first off, i must say that i have seen many ppl who break off for someone else and get back together again after a while. what's prob impt is the reason for the initial break-up. and the reasons why both parties are willing to try again. if ur sure ur not deceived abt the reasons (i.e. if u think they're good reasons) then sometimes things work better the second time around. reason being that u work at the problem areas now and yet get to enjoy the familiarity of the original r'ship. while it may not be all fireworks and passion, it is something deeper and truer. like a sense that you belong together. some say that after getting back together, the r'ship actually grows stronger than it ever was before. maybe cos this time round u have ur eyes wide open. ppl usu long for the way it was. things never stay the same. but as long as the person is there with you then i think u should work at growing together.<br><br>and part of growing up is to know that the roses and champagne may die away, but that it's the two of you together that matters the most anyway. kind of a bitter-sweet kinda thing. did you catch forget paris last nite? something like that.....where you know things are tough, but that there's no one else you'd rather share the trials and tribulations of life with.<br><br>secondly, i am a strong believer that there is no justice and fairness in life. and why should there be? justice and fairness are human concepts derived from our need for peace and harmony. they are concepts that gather their importance from our need to live within the walls of a community. is there such a thing as natural justice? i don't know. some think so. but isn't that merely a metaphysical comfort? like the way some ppl say there must be an after-life cos otherwise there is no justice in this world? is divine justice not a projection of all- too-human hopes and desires?<br><br>so live your life like there is no justice in the world and then maybe you'd gain a better measure of sanity. cos it gets maddening to think there is justice, but to never experience it in your life. unless u are a firm believer in the after-life.<br><br>shit happens to both good and bad ppl. but we'd say (because we have this notion of justice) that the bad person deserved it. he had it coming maybe. but what i would say is that it isn't wrong to expect good things to happen to good ppl. i don't think if you expect "rewards" it means you're not really very nice. and here's why. nice ppl don't say, "i am gonna do this cos i want a reward". they're saying instead, "but i'm not a bad person, why does all this shit happen to me?" so there is a difference. nice ppl don't think of the appropriate means to the intended end. instead, they equate "being themselves" as being consonant with a good ending. geez....wish i could say these things a little simpler. hope the point gets thru none the less.<br><br>and like what boss said, a lot of nice guys don't finish last cos they don't finish at all. i think the reason for that is that nice guys give up too easily. they see the competition and then rule themselves out of the race altogether. if you don't run, you don't get to the finish line. simple as that. not even for a consolation prize.<br><br>okay i'm done for now....<br>pacman and ocean - take that!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'll keep posting so long as I think I have something to say. Its not that difficult because the points posted are quite good.<br><br>ocean: I really wasn't shunning away from relationships. The fact is probably that I don't get enough experience at all, but thats another whinge that I'll continue some other day. Don't worry, I have no intention of becoming Mr. Ice.<br><br>The good things I referred to include what you said, like knowing ourselves better e.g. our capacity for kindness or a sense of adventure, all of which might go undiscovered had we not gone into a relationship. It also includes having someone to share intimate feelings with, someone to count on, and someone to care for (I think that can be very satisfying if done appropriately.) And, don't forget about physical intimacy, although in this age that is not a criteria for a relationship.<br><br>Fadingstar: Very well said. I salute your ability to express your views man. Thats some fine writing.<br><br>After reading your first point I found that thats what I thought as well. Its just that I hoped that there is a concrete way of telling or at least a model solution. I know there isn't, but its good to be able to read someone putting it clearly.<br><br>Your second point on there being no justice is well taken. Like Firewire has said as well, its just a sequence of random events happening and not everyone gets the good end of the deal.<br><br>I think I've grown to face the fact that there is no natural justice, but I still believe in making things right to the best of your abilities. It might be a human concept, but thats what our life is about. Making something for us to do. A lot of things, concepts, systems, are human creations. Take medicine for example. Every act that doctors do is against nature. But for our survival, we do something to shift the odds to our advantage. Many laws (such as sexual discrimination laws) are laid down to make things even as well, and isn't that a way of enforcing justice when there is supposed to be none? I'm not sure if I'm expressing myself clearly, but what I'm trying to say is that, yes, it might be an artificial concept, but if that is what we need to get peace and harmony, which is what I think we need, then thats the way to go. Keeping our sanity is one thing. Figthing for whats right or absolutely neccesary is another thing. Maybe I'm being too idealistic or worrying too much.<br><br>So, when I talk about justice in nice guys getting into the relationships that doesn't end in shits, I suppose I'm referring to nice guys getting people who treat them just as well as they treat other people. But as you said, there is no justice.<br><br>I can accept that fact. I just don't like it. Like taxes. Neccessary but not liked. And I do apologize if I whinge too much, its just that I like to be reminded of such important stuff.<br><br>Back to you wise people. tp temporarily shut off.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>fadingstar and pacman:<br>You two are professional tps huh? Taken away so many of the things I wanted to say,(yeah, they are pretty good points)now I've to find something innovative to add.(can't just back off so early in the race right?)<br><br>"i am a strong believer that there is no justice and fairness in life"(fadingstar)<br>Well, I think there's no definite in life. When an end seems to be a start, when a start isn't a start, when a start is an end, when an end isn't an end. If you live a life so engrossed in looking for the definites, you become so detached from the real world that you'll lose the you in you.<br>Hence, the definites that you're looking for are actually defined by you yourself; trying to get someone to define it for you is as good as getting someone to redefine you.<br>That is why whatever you wished to do, as long as it's not against your conscience, do it. Life's short, treasure it and use it to the fullest.<br>I think I should touch a little on expectations. "Definites" originates from expectations. Without expectations, there will not be the desire to seek definites. Terms like justice, fairness are all expectations from us that they should exist. Hence, because of these "expectations", people go in search of the "truth". But what is exactly the "real truth"?<br>There are many "claimed truths" around us, more often accepted as truths 'cos they relieve hopes.<br>Leads to the point of hope. Will an accumlation of hope over a prolong period of time leads to an expectation(to discover the hope)? If it is, an expectation becomes a truth for the hope.<br><br>Let's take pacman's dream about being finishing last. The mind plays a major part in human life; if the brain keeps receiving the message that "nice people finish last, if you don't finish last you are not nice enough", you seemed to subconsciously want to finish last. Or for that matter that you do not want to finish, you subconscious state tells you not to. (You might still finish, by running a half-hearted race, increasing the possibility of finishing last. )<br>But there is no absolute right or wrong in finishing last. As long as your conscience is clear in what you do, it's good enough. To hope of getting something better, you might just get yourself into the vicious cycle.<br>Learning to be contented is important. Nice people are the least appreciated ones when they're around, the deeply missed ones when they're gone.<br>Perhaps, this is how people wake up from their "dreams"; they realised that they found the treasure when it has already slipped away from their hands. Maybe this is why when couples get back together, their relationship is stronger.(fadingstar, your illustration is good) People learnt to appreciate things better when they lose it, learnt to treasure it more when they find it again.<br><br>Think I better end here, else I seriously have to drop out of the race.(Who says nice guys don't try to complete the race? And none of you are going to give up so easily, yeah?)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ocean: I suppose you have a few messages, and one might be to take it easy. Agree. If we think about things too much we would be too busy to enjoy the journey and miss the true point.<br><br>About the definites though, I still think there might be some things that have to be definite. One of my favourite rules is " there is an expection to every rule," and that includes the rule itself i.e. there are some rules which have no expections. Damn rare, but we probably would be better off enjoying life than thinking too much. Agree on that.<br><br>You people take it easy..... Long live self improvement.<br><br>Merry Christmas!
