            <div class='col-md body'>my personal experience when watching a midnite show in Marina Sq GV with my gf. A group of four guys sitting behind us. Hair dyed to golden colour, tattooed covered arms, wearing boots and carrying full face helmets. Through the show, either they are seeking for trouble or plained bored. Started to throw popcorn at the ppl in front of them.<br><br>Would you risk telling them to stop throwing popcorns and stand by your rights or just continued watching the show. Take the first alternative, you will risk having a size 9 boot mark on your chest and full face helmet swinging at your head, take the second alternative and you will ended the show with a bit of disturbance but reached home in one piece. Which one would you choose ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this incident shows a lot of how our society is gradually 'evolving' into. a man got beaten up simply because he stood up for his rights? how many of us here have shushed noisy cinema-goers during our many visits to the theatre, whether with a "would you mind lowering your volume?" or a more direct "shut up your *&amp;^*(*&amp;%!"? keeping quiet during a movie, so as to not disturb the other people in the theatre should be something expected of us. yet there're always people who dont know the meaning of whisper, people who love their 3-mth old babies or toddlers too much to leave them under someone else's care for 3hrs at most, and people who miss their friends/family/dogs too much to not talk to them for a couple of hours.<br><br>it's simply revolting that now, before most of us speak up to ask some inconsiderate ass to keep quiet, we first have to worry if that wld put us, or our loved ones in any physical danger. i wld love to say that if you're in such a situation, who cares?! stand up for your rights man.. fight like a man.. etc. but what if you're with your family? what if you're with your pregnant wife? or even, what if you're just with your gf? everyone wld thk twice before putting their loved ones in danger. it's a common thg proved in all action movies, you may not hestitate if it's your life in peril, but everyone thks twice if it's someone's else.<br><br>this is a sad sad day for singapore...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... Just a little suggestion here.<br><br>Maybe we should have one security guard inside each cinema to make sure that everything is under control?<br><br>Or, if you're pissed, maybe you can get up and get someone working in the cinema to help?<br><br>------------------<br><a href="http://www.goodbookmarks.com" rel="nofollow">Goodbookmarks.com</a> - Daily updates of good and honest website, plus a daily joke!<br><a href="http://www.goodbookmarks.com/Submit_URL/submit_url.html" rel="nofollow">Submit Your Site Now!</a><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guard can also get whacked by those ah bengs. esp when u r tokking about 40-50 yr old rent-a-cops. Maybe the authorities should consider posting a policeman or the cinema could hire a cisco guy to stand around. Add a SAR to the guy's arsenal and hey, presto, no more phone pests beating up ppl willing to stand up for their rights.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just ban all Ah bengs and Ah Lians from cinemas..... they're probably too dumb to comprehend anything in movies anyway...<br>Juz kidding.... : P<br><br>Endurance is the best strategy.... at most change to some other empty seats nearby..<br><br>It never pays to antagonize the cowardly bengs who take comfort behind numbers.. challenge them one to one and they'll probably flee......<br><br>Juz not worth getting walloped by cowards for such trivialities eh?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>nah...I dun mind standing up for my rights...only if my patience is broken...and my patience I got a lot of...usually right before I am about to blow my top at people in the theatre they shut up already...so it's a bit of an anti climax....but the last time people did it, i just talked to thin air very sarcastically saying, " GOD!!! PEOPLE JUST CAN"T KEEP THEIR MOUTHS SHUT&gt;&gt;&gt;TOK LIKE THEY STILL IN KAMPUNG!!!"....<br><br>but they never shut up...6 women some mroe...<br>then the other day I watched a movie(forgot which) and I was thinking...my god, this is the first show in singapore I watched when noone's phone or pager beeped....just tehn this guys phone rang...he even let it ring 5or 6 times...then he answer and start tokking...wah lau...i damn fed up...then I listen and he's tokking to his mother...fuck man.!!!!  I was about to go and tell him to shut up but he hang up already...<br><br>but in cases where got ahbengs who do it all night thru the show...that I dun care whether they can whack me up or not...usually they damnz scared of me anyway..hahahah...perks of having a tatoo...even I stare at them when they are in a group they don't dare do anything...hehehehe...like I said perks of having a big asss tattoo that most people would consider the guy had to be crazy to get a tatoo like that....<br><br>my tattoo and also it's a perk to haff afucked up looking face all the time...har har har...<br><br>But we cannot blame guys who dun want to get intot he mix with grls they have to protect around....<br><br>I remeber this time I went to my sisters prom here in singaproe....Afterwards we went to orchard and my chio gal friend was wearing a damnz see thru dress(can see everything..even her panties inside was see thru...aiyoh...I loved it!!!)...Anyway as we walked past orchard mrt station at 11pm there were about 50 or 60 Malay guys sitting all outside there and they kept shouting at my gal friend...then this big drunk malay guy and his friend came and started to shout at my brother....then he started to try and get funny with my friend...I shoved them all past the metal wiries to cross the road...tehn all of a sudden the damn guy palm strike me on my back...bam...it wasn't a push i can assure u that...wah liaow...i almost whacked the guy...but I had to get my sister, brother, cousin visiting from canada and gal friend out of harms way....<br><br>Like I said there were a lot of malay guys sitting there shouting at the two other malay guys to "go!!!goLah..!!!get them...and I'm not kidding...there were a lot of them!!!  so I had to get them out of there....and my stupid gal friend kept turning around and asking the guy what his problme was...he kept trying to get close to her and I had to keep pushing him away...then after we finally got across the road to that hotel on the corner of tangs there (our friends were upstairs in one oft he rooms)...the two Malay guys followed us there....wah laow...I told my cousin to get the girls inside because it was going to get rough and I can't protect them if they get int he way...which the girl kept doing....well...my cousin was too scared to do anything I guess cuz he just stood there like an idiot(he was  devout christian ...never fought before)...and my brother also never ever got into a fight before...it was onli me...and that du,b girl kept coming up to that guy and asking him what the hell his problem was...wah laow the guy was damn bigs to her...she was really small...<br><br>Anyway I told her to go inside and call the piolice because she was getting in my way so I couldn't do anything...and the damn hotel guy just stood around and pretend like nothing was happening....get a life man...the malay guy had no shirt on and was spouting obscenitites....then he ebven kciked my brother...wah...i was about to go off on that bastard when ...u guessed it...the girl jump in the way and ask the guy what his problme was again...I was so frustrated...I just couodn't get her out of there....and he just kept trying to hit my brother...anyway i couldn't swing without hitting my own people so I just jammed my elbow intot he guys throat and shoved him back to his friend...his stupid friend was making a very unconcerted effort to stop the drunk guy...but actually he was enjjoying the whole thing...Wha laiow after I pushed the guy back I told the sober malay guy that he better keep that fucker away or else I'll kill him....after that i didn't even bother to look at what they were doing.  Just turned my back and walked intot he hotel with my gorup...wah laow so pissed off at my group...kept getting int he way...<br><br>anyway, i hope that u can understand that sometimes us guys really cannot do anything when grlsa are getting in the way...especially when u know that if she got hit by a guy twice her size she would probably concuss...sdazz....after that day i swore never to go out with her again...and I never did...the last time I got into a minor scuffle was with her also...some thai workers thot she was my prostitue and wanted to hire her....wah laow...she just stood there and I tried to cover her and told him no!,...biut she kepot coming back around m,e and looking at the guy like a bimbotic idiot...wah liaow so pissed...anyway i have never gone out wiff her again....hmph..<br><br>u see now I'm worke dup...yeah...singapore is a safe country but u still have to be careful...there are people out there who dun care about u or anyone else but themselves....just fuck them...as for getting whacked by a helmet...beleiev me, it's not that bad....just like when u get punched...you dun feel it at all until maybe an hour later when the pain starts...hahah<br><br>I know u won't believe me, but it's true...I tell you that getting slapped hurts more than a big ass guy punching you in your face...hahah:-)<br><br>It's true...no it's not just me and I'm not siaow...I'm sure those who've been in fights before can corroborate my words...:-)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, if you're afraid of tough guys with tattoes and motorbike helmets, the solution is simple - get a tattoo, and get yourself a motorbike helmet! Then you can stand up for your rights and push over those weaklings in cinemas as much as you like =)<br><br>But it helps being 6'2" and go to the gym a lot ... nobody ever dares to be funny with you =)<br><br>BTW, isn't it a bit strange that you've got to serve in the army (and maybe even kill people!!!) yet you don't have the courage to tell noisy moviegoers to shut up?</div>
