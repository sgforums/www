            <div class='col-md body'>Half of those surveyed do not wear condoms during sex with new partners, with the young showing cavalier attitude.<br><br>WHEN it comes to having sex, Singaporeans rank last among 22 countries. But that's not the bad news.<br><br>It's the confession that many do not wear condoms when they have sex with new partners.<br><br>This worrying picture, painted against the backdrop of a growing world Aids epidemic, emerged from the findings of an Internet survey which condom maker Durex released yesterday.<br><br>The Durex Global Sex Survey, in which about 50,000 young people took part, reports that, on average, Singaporeans have sex 110 times a year. The French top the list, doing it 167 times a year.<br><br>But the Singaporean's low sexual activity is not exceptional.<br><br>Generally, countries in the region, such as Malaysia, Taiwan, India and Thailand, have low frequencies: about 120 times a year.<br><br>But unlike many in the region, Singaporeans seem unusually cavalier in the way they brazenly admit they do not practise safe sex.<br><br>Half of the 868 Singaporeans, aged from 16 to above 30, who took part in the survey, said they go without protection.<br><br>Those younger than 21 are especially indifferent.<br><br>Nearly half of them - 47 per cent - say they did not wear condoms with recent new partners, when they took part in the survey held between August and September this year.<br><br>Gilbert Toh, a 17- year-old student interviewed last night, seems typical.<br><br>He told The Straits Times: 'My friends and I don't wear condoms because it is more enjoyable.<br><br>'We are not worried, because the health care system is so good here and Aids is not a big problem in Singapore.'<br><br>Gilbert's view reflects that of youths here, as the survey found that only a third, or 32 per cent of all the Singapore respondents feel that Aids or HIV infection is a serious problem here.<br><br>'It clearly shows how complacent we are,' said an irked Mr Benedict Jacob-Thambiah, administrator for the Action For Aids.<br><br>The total number of Singaporeans who have been infected with HIV is 1,788. Of these, 686 have died and 421 have full-blown Aids.<br><br>Many of the men got it from sex with strangers.<br><br>Every year, the bulk of the more than 200 people here who get infected with the Aids-causing virus are men who have casual sex, and sex with prostitutes here and overseas.<br><br>As a result the health authorities will from next year give men who travel alone to HIV-prone places a travel pack with condoms and information on the dangers of casual sex.<br><br>And Durex is now working with Action For Aids to conduct talks for national servicemen in the Army and Navy.<br><br>Doctors and Aids activists, however, caution against reading too much into the survey findings.<br><br>Said Associate Professor Ganesan Adaikan, president of the Asian Federation of Sexology: 'The survey does not specify the social-economic background of the respondents and does not say if they are married or unmarried.'<br><br>But they all agree that it at least provides a rough guide to the sexual attitudes among the young, which could be useful when planning for education and awareness programmes.</div>
