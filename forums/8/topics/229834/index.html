            <div class='col-md body'>I was on board bus service 180 heading towards the direction of Bukit Panjang. I board the bus opposite lakeside MRT station at about 545pm, i understand that bus service 180 is usually packed at this hour because after office hour. So when i Board the bus it was quite occupied but there were still empty seats( seats that were available were the ones that opposes the direction of travelling ). After boarding the bus i went to the seats that opposes the direction of travelling. I was about to shift in to the inner seat so that others can take the outer seat. The two young ladies infront of me was sitting as if they own the 4 seats. they dun even make the effort to sit properly and they left little leg space for me by extending their legs. Throughout the journey i was looking at this two ladies they were such classic example of ugly SINGAPOREANS and the best part mind u they were students of NIE. It really shocks me that educated people and maybe future teacher to be behaving like this in public. My gosh!! Any comments?</div>
