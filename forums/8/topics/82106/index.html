Remember, she is the one chasing after the cab.

By telling other people your own dirt about your relationship is never going to bring you any good advice. Both of you should try to compromise and solve it between yourselves and should not act like children, bringing your displease of each other to the attention of somebody who is older. In this case, it is the grandma. You need to remember this, there is always a generation gap between different generations...regardless of the tightness between the gap. In the future when she is going to be your wife, you cannot be still doing this kind of childish thing again.<br><br>You are really slow in your reaction. Why can't you hold her and stop her from chasing after the cab? Don't you care about her? Seems like you already got used to her presence that you don't pay as much attention to her anymore, right?<br><br>Well...I don't understand what is your purpose of posting this stuff here. Are you hoping that we will support you and talk bad about the grandma? Okie...sure...the grandma is having a generation gap with you, so her judgement are based on the values that still existed during her generation. I wouldn't say she is wrong, but it is true that you should pay more attention to your wife...think that is what she is trying to tell you.<br><br>Hope that you can realise the thing that is missing from you in this relationship before it is too late.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
