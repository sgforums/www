              <p>Hi everyone, recently, I came across an advertisement about someone trying to offer business venture opportunities. Claims himself to be a Internet Marketing prodigy. My instincts and guts tells me this guy is a con.</p>
              <p>Yet, it could be my bad experiences talking. How to figure out if it's a genuine opportunity. Well, my dad did suggest to me to run my own small business and work in partnership with him. Now that is genuine, because I know my dad runs businesses. But he has told me to seek my own funding, something I need to learn on my own.</p>
              <p>I have another source of possible funding, which is much more realistic. An engineer in his 40s, thinking of making a monthly investment into my business idea, as hopes to create a second source of income for himself and his family. That is genuine.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the advertisement I mentioned, the guy claims he made USD$100,000 in 3 months...fact? Or Scam?</p>
              <p>What's your say? For now, I'm running with my instincts, I don't think this guy is worth my time and money to meet up with.</p>
              <p>I'm still looking for a few more investors though...maybe 2 or 3 more...</p>

              <p>It can be a fact but it can also be a scam... but I can gurantee you thing... earning USD$100,000 requires effort... if it say can earn $$$ without effort, then its a scam...</p>
              <p>Uness its investing in something... but before investing there are 2 things you need to consider... 1) is legitamacy... whether the investment is real or a scam... 2) risk...</p>
              <p>I can tell you, those rich people right now are spending milloins of dollars on the IR shares which is now at an all time low... once business picks up, they are going from millionars to multi-millionares....</p>

              <p>I'm not supporting this guy... But I'd like to leave you one advice... Don't base it on instinct... investigate and research... learn more and find out... it could be real or it could be a fake but the truth will appear through research, not guts...</p>
              <p>I don't want to be the guy who randomly say its a scam without full knowledge... sekali its really legitimate and you could have made $100,000, you would have blame me and sgf members for giving you false ideas...</p>
              <p>so, yes... it has many characteristics of a scam, but we will not know until you investigate and find out for your self... but that doesn't mean diving in blindly to what ever the guy says...</p>

              <p>Hi everyone, recently, I came across an advertisement about someone trying to offer business venture opportunities. Claims himself to be a Internet Marketing prodigy. My instincts and guts tells me this guy is a con.</p>
              <p>Yet, it could be my bad experiences talking. How to figure out if it's a genuine opportunity. Well, my dad did suggest to me to run my own small business and work in partnership with him. Now that is genuine, because I know my dad runs businesses. But he has told me to seek my own funding, something I need to learn on my own.</p>
              <p>I have another source of possible funding, which is much more realistic. An engineer in his 40s, thinking of making a monthly investment into my business idea, as hopes to create a second source of income for himself and his family. That is genuine.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the advertisement I mentioned, the guy claims he made USD$100,000 in 3 months...fact? Or Scam?</p>
              <p>What's your say? For now, I'm running with my instincts, I don't think this guy is worth my time and money to meet up with.</p>
              <p>I'm still looking for a few more investors though...maybe 2 or 3 more...</p>

              <p>Anyway, my decision is final, after thinking about it for awhile, I'm going to rule this one out! Besides, when I first started my freelancing services, and gradually turning it into a Project-Based business, I enjoyed the process of designing, developing and delivering what the customers wanted.</p>
              <p>Yes, the money is good, but I've learnt that when it comes to doing something, it's important not to be motivated by money (or Greed). Having lots of money is great, but if the attitude and expectation we carry towards it is wrong, we'll end up in a ditch at the end of the day.</p>
              <p>I think I like to keep it a Project-based business and work with 1 investor first (not the con-man). Then see where it goes from there.</p>
