              <p>Hey guys, hope someone will be able to give me some advices on this matter... I'm actually feeling very disappointed and sad about it.</p>
              <p>I'm currently in my poly going third year in the course of accountancy. Third year will be when we'll be going for attachment for one semester which is 6 months. Most of us chose auditing for our choice of attachment.</p>
              <p>We just received the news of which company we will be going. Alot of my friends went into big companies like<span style="color: #000000;"> Merrill Lynch, the Big fours, and even Supreme Court... But for me, I got into some unknown local firm which don't even have a website!! Although it's at Tanjong Pagar area, even the building where the office is located looks so run-down!</span></p>
              <p>Tomorrow is the briefing for our attachment already, do you guys think I can talk to my teacher-in-charge about this?</p>
              <p>Should I just go with what I've been allocated to or should I show my unhappiness to my "Liason Officer"?</p>
              <p>What are the pros and cons of being attached to a small local unknown firm? Please advise me on what to do guys. Thanks alot and I'll really appreciate it.</p>

              <p>dont worry, if u attach to a small company u can take on more tasks and more responsibilities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>then u can write down in ur resume. and when the time comes for real interview for jobs next time u can relate ur experience there.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>to clinch a real job, its the things u did that matters not so much on the name of the companies. although Merryl Lynch and Big 4 sounds good...they might just take on petty work.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Be proactive, ask more more responsibilities and work to do k.</p>

              <p>hmm.. just because ur not in big companies does not mean you won't get to learn anything though. think of it as training ground though. everything happens for a reason though</p>

              <p>Since you're a poly grad, when you go to the Big4, you're probably to be one of the lowest lifeforms there, below the fresh grads, and the MBA associates. Not likely to be in any IB deals, but just data-crunching.</p>
              <p>Going to a small accountacy company, you'll probably get to work with SMEs, which form a vital core of the S'pore economy. You may get exposed to various lines of business too, which could be an employment advantage next time.</p>
              <p>Btw, most of my friends didn't enter the Big4 straight after graduation. They were offered the job when they were working in small accountacy companies.</p>

              <p>It's much better to work in a small company than in a large set up particularly when you get to learn more things at a more comfortable pace too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a large company with a large staff, learning opportunities are limited, it having to be shared. Besides, the pressure and stress levels working in a large company are always sky-high. You are expected to perform and deliver results at all times and mistakes are not tolerated at all.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angry.png" alt="angry.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>AS an attachee, getting learning opportunities is far more important than basking in the glamor of working in a large 'branded' company... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/embarrassed.png" alt="embarrassed.png"></p>

              <p>Small and medium sizes Companies good mah, they are more flexible, and the superiors will generous give good marks and praise for you. All those big ones are very discipline orientated, inflexible and lots of politics.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sometime at small companies, you see more things, as you are expose to more tasks, and most people there are less educated, so they look at you with respect, U be good and do your best. In fact, it is an opportunity for you to see how a local company run, and perhap one day, you can set up your own accountancy firms.</p>

              Don't worry about it, it's just an internship.
              
              My friend is pursuing an internship at Ernst &amp; Young, but all she does is file after file of taxes, although it does benefit her that there are dinner allowances, taxi allowances and other smaller benefits.
              
              I'm pursuing an internship at a much smaller start-up company, where the staff strength is barely five. To date, I've done branding concepts, company profile revamping, meeting big-shot clients (e.g. CEO of huge MNCs) to deliver presentations and will have opportunities to travel to Switzerland and Hong Kong for business.
              
              I would think that small companies are where you can shine most, be grateful and make the most out of your stint there!

              <p>In a big firm you'll be attached to a single department. Where you keep on doing the work that department does. I've known of a senior in my course who does nothing but operating the printer in the office. So basically 2 months of attachment is wasted.</p>

              <p>Hey guys, thanks for all the advices. Just went for my attachment briefing today.</p>
              <p>My friend who got attached to a big company is paid $1,000 per month. But he told me that he was told everyday there will most probably be OT. What's more, the company has already given him 4 sheets of information about the company and the job scope.</p>
              <p>I guess this is really a blessing in disguise, hehe. Hope the company that I'm going has lots of friendly colleages. Will keep you guys updated when I start next month.</p>
              <p>Really appreciate the comments given! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>
