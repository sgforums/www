            <div class='col-md body'>I met a good samaritan on the roads yesterday. This is what happened:<br><br>I usually put my wallet in my back pocket.. by yest, i was wearing a shorts w/o a back pocket, so I put it in my side pocket instead. The problem is that my wallet is very bulky and the pocket is very small. As I was riding on my bike along CTE, the wallet dropped out.. I didn't know until i reached my destination, which was about 10 minutes later.<br><br>Just then, somebody called to tell me that he has wallet. All the IC and stuff are inside. But he was on his way to Ang Mo Kio to do some stuff. Once he is done, he will deliver the wallet to my place.<br><br>So i waited for about half an hour, and he actually delivered the wallet to my block! He was a Malay guy driving an old Nissan car, and his whole family was in the car. The moment I saw him, he started apologising and said that he knows that there is quite a lot of money in the wallet. He tried to grab as much as he can, but some were at the middle of the road and were too dangerous to take.<br><br>when I checked, Most of my money was inside, (about $78 ) ... and most importantly, my IC, driving liscense and cards were there. I told him that i wanted to thank him and pay for his fuel expense. but he refused. This was exactly what he said: " <strong>I'm just doing my part as a citizen.</strong> "<br><br>So i thank him again and told him that if he needed any help, just give me a call. Before leaving, his wife apologised again for not doing enough to recover all the money.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>This relight my faith that there are still many good hearted singaporeans around us.<br><br>And I'm really grateful to this guy.. Any suggestion what i can do to thank him? I still have his hand phone number.<br></div>
