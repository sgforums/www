            <div class='col-md body'><strong>March 13, 2006<br>Pictures snapped without consent: What can we do?<br><br>RECENTLY, a man attracted criminal sanctions for using a camera to take pictures under a woman's skirt. With the rise in camera phones and phones in-built with video-recording functions, the question of the extent of one's right to privacy has assumed unprecedented importance.<br><br>I am not referring to incidents where a person videotapes himself or herself and this clip falls into the wrong hands. I am talking about strangers taking pictures of others without their consent.<br><br>I was travelling on a train recently when a man whipped out his camera phone and aimed it in my direction. I had never seen anyone SMS at that angle before so I grew a little suspicious. Sure enough, when he later turned towards some secondary schoolgirls, I could see from his phone screen that he was indeed taking pictures.<br><br>Later, he squatted down beside a panel separating us and stared blatantly at my chest. I used my file to block his view, but he stood up, and just kept staring. I was afraid to move for fear that he would follow me, and I felt safer sitting than standing.<br><br>He then whipped out his phone for the second time and tried to take my picture again. I turned away quickly.<br><br>Before anyone starts pointing fingers and saying, 'She probably asked for it with her dressing', I was dressed in an inconspicuous loose-fitting T-shirt and jeans.<br><br>And this is not the first time I have had bad experiences on trains. I no longer take the train during peak hours due to incidents where I have been brushed inappropriately.<br><br>For the purposes of this letter, though, I will stick to my complaint about pictures being taken without consent.<br><br>As a law student, I am all too aware that there exists no adequate law on privacy that will prevent others from taking our pictures.<br><br>However, with the advancement in the ability to manipulate and transfer information, this concerns me a whole lot. What if a photograph you had no knowledge of appears on the Internet? What if it was digitally modified into an obscene photograph?<br><br>Under the current law, it appears that you have no proprietary rights over even an image of yourself.<br><br>I was told that we may ask the person to delete the photograph from his phone, but if he refuses, you have no further recourse, and seizing the phone would place you at fault in the eyes of the law.<br><br>The current situation is very frustrating as it appears that the law is on the side of those men who pose a threat to females. And I have absolutely no recourse against that man, except to write in and warn other young women to be on their guard against such weirdos, one of whom was last seen dressed in a yellow and green cap, a yellow top, jeans and a haversack. He was in his late 30s, with greasy tanned skin and was of average height and build.<br><br>Sim Khadijah Mohammed (Ms)</strong><br><br>Wonder why did this minah bother to describe the guy? As if the guy will wear the same clothes everyday.There are many late 30s with greasy tanned skin of<br>average height and build.  GALs,LOOKOUT FOR MALES OF AVERAGE HEIGHT AND BUILD AND WITH GREASY TANNED SKIN,THEY ARE ALL PERVERTS!!!<br><br>If she felt violated, why didn't she question that "prick"?<br>Don't tell me law student apprehensive in a MRT full of people?<br>If she was confident..then her picture was being taken, get the MRT staff to apprehend and seize his phone...<br><br>I've never read about someone so full of herself/himself. This is a first...<br>Who does she thinks she is, Cindy Crawford?<br>If this is going to be a problem, let's ban camera phones like we did chewing gum???<br><br>*shrugs* <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
