            <div class='col-md body'>Mark Bosnich made alot of stunning saves yesterday from Real Madrid. and Andy Cole foiled United's chance of getting a goal.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hahaha.....well, you know Bosnich is a little like Clumsy James, on form one match, butter fingers the next. And you mentioned Cole had several chances, but so did McManaman, it was an evenly fought match, don't u think so?? Old Trafford is not the fortress that it used to be, it used to hold a record of dunno how many years without a loss, but with Schmeichel gone, we shall see. Real has excellent Cup form too.....Real vs Chelsea final....yeah</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fergie is right. The Real match was one of the worst performances in a big game I've seen from Man U in a VERY VERY long time.<br><br>Sure, the game was quite exciting....Becks chasing Roberto Carlos, the numerous Roberto Carlos freekicks which had my heart beating in my mouth and Macca's running.<br><br>No doubt, credit to Real and esp R Carlos, Macca and Raul. They took the game to Man U and surely deserved something more than a draw. Man U's solitary claim to a draw is Bossie's performance. While I still cringe at every of his kicks, he still lives up to his reputation as a brilliant shot-stopper.<br><br>Cole really should have put the flick-on from Stam away. Yorke was not getting chances and I was thinking of putting in Sheringham for Yorke as early as the 35th min, though a half-time switch would be better. Man U was giving away possession too casually and they needed someone like Sheringham who can hold up the ball. Which is why Cantona is still revered as one of the best Man U players now.<br><br>Throughout the whole match, I failed to see Man U string more than 5 passes together without losing possession. This is something very unusual as Man U is famous for being a passing team.<br><br>Can they beat Real at Old Trafford? I still think so, if they wake up and fight. There were too many occasions where Becks was too involved with defending R Carlos and unable to make his usual runs. More options for Giggs when he makes his runs too. As the commentator said, it's very exciting watching Giggs run with the ball. However, Giggs needs something to do with the ball. He can't just run and run without someone to pass to.<br><br>At top form, I would say that it's a toss-up between Barcelona and Man U for the title. Now? Man U doesn't deserve it from the Real performance. Barcelona would probably have walked away with a win. Chelsea is a good side and here's hoping that they can take advantage of Rivaldo's injury and come out with something good.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, maybe I am a little biased, but I don't really fancy ManU winning it the second time in a row. And I got news that ManU is now only no.3 in terms of odds to get the title. Oh well......<br>Anyway, Barcelona's injury list includes Rivaldo (doubtful), Luis Enrique (confirmed), Guardiola (doubtful), anymore......can't remember, anyway, Chelsea managed to beat Lazio, so maybe jus maybe, outside chances...though difficult without Leboef...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm...interesting results this morning.<br><br>anyway, here's my prediction for the return leg.<br><br>Man U vs Real Madrid at Old Trafford : 2-1<br><br>Bayern Munich vs FC Porto : 2-0<br><br>FC Barcelona vs Chelsea FC at Nou Camp : 2-1<br><br>Lazio vs Valencia : 2-0<br><br>Semi-finalists : Man U, Bayern Munich, Chelsea, Valencia<br><br>The only result which really stunned me was the 5-2 scoreline for Valencia.<br><br>I've always said that Chelsea is a good team which can beat Barcelona. Barca never had Man U's fighting reputation in the first place. Chelsea can attack with lots of flair as we all know. Man U realised that too, having been hammered 5-0 this season. While Barca probably have a more impressive strikeforce, Man U probably have a better backline though both have some problems.<br><br>For the return leg, my only fear is Anelka. He's fast and good. Still, I put my bet on the Old Trafford charm as the No.1 Premiership fortress today. The only thing I worry about is a 1-1 draw which will sink Man U. Heaven forbid.<br><br>Can Chelsea beat Barca at Nou Camp? Van Gaal is a good coach and I'm sure he'll tighten up the midfield for the return leg. Barca will probably win, but not by a sufficient margin to make it.<br><br>Porto was damn unlucky to concede the away goal late. Most top European sides won't have an off-day twice. Thus, like Man U and Barca, Bayern Munich will probably come back stronger and claim the place.<br><br>Sorry to Lazio, as much as I can't see Valencia repeating its stunning performance, I can't see Lazio working its way out of a 2-5 deficit unless Marcelo Salas can score a hat-trick without Valencia scoring.<br><br>Still, based on the current European form, Valencia and Chelsea must be firm bets as they are the only 2 sides who played convincingly.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you watched the Man U - Real match, you will realised that the biggest problem was that Beckham was so kept in check by Roberto Carlos that he has virtually no space to roam on the right, much less to send in crosses. So Real Madrid was right, Man U is a team dependent on Beckham. Fergie really has to counter Roberto Carlos in the return leg to have any chance. He must free up Beckham sufficiently to pump in all those crosses. I think Man U will win provided Real doesn't score first at OT.<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Leeds United 0 - 2 Galatasaray<br>------------------------------<br><br>David O'Leary's team suffered a bitter defeat of 2-0 at Ali Sami Yen Stadium yesterday. personally felt that Leeds united played a poor match, with Harry Kewell, Michael Bridges wasting few chances to net in the ball.esp theres a part where Harry Kewell ran past 3 defenders and shot high above the goalpost. 2nd goal from Galatasaray was due to the fault of captain Radebe. he failed to clear off the ball and Capone took the opportunity to net in the ball.. Galastaray's passing of the ball is much better then leeds united.<br><br>Leeds need to score at least 3 goals in the return leg in Elland Road to win the match on aggregate if Galastaray din manage to score any..<br><br>predicted score at Elland Road<br><br>Leeds United 2 - 1 Galastaray<br><br>Leeds United 2 - 3 Galastaray (aggregate)<br><br>Predicted finals of UEFA cup<br>----------------------------<br>Galastaray vs Arsenal<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> FnU  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>------------------<br>Magic -- Ekin</div>
