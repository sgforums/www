            <div class='col-md body'>personally, i felt that Carlos' remarks were quite obvious. while i'm a Becks supporter (of his footballing skill, not his social life), what Carlos said is quite true.<br><br>Becks has never been known as a fast player or a player with dazzling ball skill like Rivaldo, Zola or Giggs. however, Becks does have something which makes him special. Becks is still probably the best passer of the ball in the world today. Becks indeed lacks speed. while he does have defensive contributions, he's not that great defensively. moreever, his left foot is probably worse than Rivaldo's right foot. anyone saw his left-foot howler in the second half against Real?<br><br>Becks has a long long way to go before he can be a true great. he's good, but he'll need more than just great passing and cultured shooting to be a great. Rivaldo is a lot better. Becks is not magical by a long shot. Giggs comes a lot closer.<br><br>now, Zola spent hours practising his free kicks and we all saw the result against Barca. outside of training, i wonder how much time Becks spends on his own training. Bossie spent lots of time on his own, so did Cantona and Zola. if Becks goes and work more on the freekicks, i dare say that he'll be better. i was terribly disappointed by his freekick against Real.<br><br>Carlos? a good player, undoubtly, but really more of a fantastic whacker of the ball. i wouldn't want to be the goalie trying to stop his shots and i wonder how Bossie felt when he was facing Carlos' freekicks. Zola, Becks and some others are more cultured shooters. yah...i know Carlos' remarkable banana shot last time, but anyone ever seen him produce anything close to that since? just more very powerful shots.<br><br>if i were Carlos and Real, i wouldn't dismiss Becks just like that. if Cole put the header away, i doubt Becks would be insulted now. Man U is more than a Becks team. remember, if not for the rash challenge, Giggs might have either scored or pass the ball to a wide-open Cole. in the entire match, Real hasn't proved to me that they can stop Giggs yet. Macca and Carlos were both stopped due to tackles and defensive coverage. Giggs was stopped cos he mis-passed and was brought down roughly.<br><br>Real had better watch out, if Man U catches fire, Real will find that, like Barca learnt against Chelsea, it's fireworks for them. control the midfield. Real look better than they actually were in the match cos they held the midfield. do that and Carlos won't be sounding arrogant anymore. he'll be chasing Becks instead....or trying to stop the cross...</div>

Most wingers, when the ball is played to them, needs to stop the ball, size up the penalty area before crossing. This gives opposing defenders a chance to position themselves. Becks has this ability to whip in the cross the moment the ball is played to him. And very accurately. This tends to catch defenders off guard, allowing the strikers to run in front of them.<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>
