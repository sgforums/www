              <p>CIA is after me because of my below post in Yahoo Singapore about MH730. 30 minute after my post, an unknown ka-leng ring my door bell and try to sell me water filter. Nobody do door to door sales in Singapore you stupid CIA. Apparently, CIA assasins in Singapore are made up of ka-lengs riding mopads selling poisoned water filters door to door. He even say I can try the water filter for free for a week and free installation and removal if I dont buy. You will never get me CIA. In your efforts to silence me, you've just made me angrier. Now I will spread your secrets all over the internet and build an online army to oppose you.</p>
              <p>You will never get me or even find me again. Infact, I am not even posting this from Singapore anymore. You and your damn ka-leng assasins have failed CIA. The truth shall set me free.</p>

              <p>Original post in Yahoo Singapore</p>
              <p>MH730 was not "accidentally" shot down, US shot down the plan as the 2 Iranians were carrying US drone data to China. If China manage to crack the data, China/Iran will have the ability to hijack all US military drones in service.<br><br> MH370 was shot down by US over South China Sea and a US drone mimicking the plane's meta-data was flown to where the plane supposedly crashed over the Indian Ocean.<br><br> Efforts to locate the plane should be done around the area where the transponder stop functioning and not over where the plane supposedly crashed.</p>
              <p>In 2011, a US drone crashed intact in Iran. since then Iran has been trying to decipher the encryption used in US drones with no luck. iran then decide to seek China's help in this, 2 of Iran's intelligence agents were tasked to carry the drone data to china (that's why they were travelling using stolen european passports). US (CIA) found out about the operation and through the excuse of conducting naval exercise with their Thai allies, they deploy warships along the path MH730 was travelling over South China Sea.<br><br> Misinformation disseminated by US<br> 1. MH370 crashed over Indian ocean so that the search will not be perform over the actual crash site in South China Sea<br> 2. MH370 carrying valuable cargo and was hijack to cover up the fact that the plane was actually shot down and not hijack<br> 3. even the release of this book is a cover up in the event that evidence proving US warships shot down MH370 is recovered so US can claim "accidentally" shot down instead of intentionally shot down<br><br> Why no debris of MH370 is recovered<br> 1. a thermobaric missile was used so most of the plane was vaporized<br> 2 . what little debris remained is in South China Sea not in Indian ocean where the search is conducted.</p>
