            <div class='col-md body'>this is across the board for all civil service people.. the "evaluation"...<br><br>it is actually crap..<br><br>it is easily subverted and susceptable "lea-duhs" can easily promote their personal sycophants.. even when there is a "points system", it is unwieldy and crappy.. and worse, the subversion of this system is unknown and it allows a "quantitative measure" that is acceptable to HR heads who know less than nothing about their own people..<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by cornyfish2000:</div><div class="quote_body">I think all schools should have a formal teacher evaluation system in which students/parents are required to appraise the teachers at fixed intervals (eg. at the end of every semester). I believe this will help weed out the teachers who aren't interested in helping students at all.</div></blockquote></div>
