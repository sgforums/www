            <div class='col-md body'>Well umm, creams usually don't work if it's due to hormones.. if you're a 18+/girl and not against this method, certain prescript-only birth control pills can help regulate ur hormones and clear out your skin..

Any reasons as to why?</div></blockquote>Are you on antibiotics? by right skin specialist will see your condition and determine what's best for you. normally they will start with antibiotics first... if no improvement then will start to give you strong medication. Maybe if it's really jialat, they MIGHT give you the strong medication at once. So it depends.<br><br>3 weeks is not say long if you are on antibiotics but if you are on roaccutane/isotretinoin etc.. 3 weeks is good enough to see some results. Would suggest you to request for stronger medication(for private: it's usually roaccutane, for nsc: it's isotretinoin) if there is really no improvement. The price  for isotretinoin is cheaper after subsidisation if you go to NSC through polyclinic referral.<br><br>Also check that the cream you are given is suitable for you. If it's too oily etc, then i would suggest you to use other cream. Or you can try using clearasil pimple vanishing cream(blue white tube one) to keep your face dry and get rid of acne after few days(it works). Just apply like twice a day. Don't use clearasil acne cream(long blue tube one) because it's a bit oily. The older version of their acne cream is better.. don't know why they change now.<br><br>Anyway, if the cream is not suitable for you.. it will usually gives a irritating/a bit pain feel.<br><br>Besides, you need to have enough sleep and drink a lotsa water. Always try to  keep your face clean.<br><br></div>
