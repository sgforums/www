            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes, the normal procedure cannot warranty something that has to be done immediately.<br><br>Example of Case 1:<br><br>Family Members/Loved Ones/Close Friends/ threatened to take their own life. Serviceman had tried the necessary procedure to apply for leave/off-pass but failed, thus forced to abandon post.<br><br>Under training grounds or important tests or important alert duties. The duty officers had been found refusing these serviceman from leaving. Going through the necessary procedure, the serviceman needed at least an off-pass from their direct superiors. A superior who can officially sign an off-pass is, their PC, OC, RSM, CSM, TO, TWO, CO depending on the nature and the programme catered for them. Failure to obtain a necessary off-pass and leaving without official leave from the superiors warrantees a desertion case.<br><br>Example of Case 2.<br><br>Negligence by Serviceman during Duty/Training<br><br>Firearms, otherwise known as pyrotechnics, must be accountable for. There has been cases of serviceman losing live rounds or parts of weapon due to negligence.<br><br>Example of Case 3.<br><br>Mishandling, causing of illness/death to a military hound.<br><br>Military hounds, sudden pick up a scent, and ate some weird stuff in the darkness while serviceman, under the vocation of MP, was patrolling. Hound suspected to consume some drugs or things which caused death/illness.<br><br>All the above 3 cases are often disputed upon. However, serviceman charged under the three instances, were still sent to DB.</div>

No. but, if he had finished his 2 yrs stint, he would've earned more than enough to cover his debts over the next 5 yrs...</div>
