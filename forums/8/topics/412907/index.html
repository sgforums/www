              <p>Neuroscience has shown clear explanation , potentially, that religion feeling with god, oneness is associated with brain chemistry, and also specific brain wiring that cause people to become high tendency for feeling god, even in the face of logical evidence.</p>
              <p>Our decision and belief system does not reside in logic system only. our tendency is to choose our feeling over logic in some cases. Apparently, for believers, their brain wiring or chemistry seems to tend towards feeling type of people.</p>
              <p>For example, a person whose has absent brain normal visual wiring.... can actually point to where a flashing light is coming from a certain square out of many sqaures, but he will keep saying that he cannot see the light at or.</p>
              <p>Our visual retina is connected to a few places... one to our conscious... another to the another area... so when the conscious connection is cut... the person still walk  towards  can locate the light in the right square by 'intuition' but still always says that he cannot see the light.</p>

              <p><strong>David Richard Berkowitz</strong> (born <strong>Richard David Falco</strong>; 1 June 1953), also known as <strong>Son of Sam</strong> and the <strong>.44 Caliber Killer</strong>, is an <a title="United States" href="/wiki/United_States"><span style="color: #0645ad;">American</span></a> <a title="Serial killer" href="/wiki/Serial_killer"><span style="color: #0645ad;">serial killer</span></a> and <a class="mw-redirect" title="Arsonist" href="/wiki/Arsonist"><span style="color: #0645ad;">arsonist</span></a> whose crimes terrorized <a title="New York City" href="/wiki/New_York_City"><span style="color: #0645ad;">New York City</span></a> from July 1976 until his arrest in August 1977.</p>
              <p>Shortly after his arrest in August 1977, Berkowitz confessed to killing six people and wounding seven others in the course of eight shootings in New York between 1976 and 1977; he has been imprisoned for these crimes since 1977. Berkowitz subsequently claimed that he was commanded to kill by a <a title="Demon" href="/wiki/Demon"><span style="color: #0645ad;">demon</span></a> who <a title="Demonic possession" href="/wiki/Demonic_possession"><span style="color: #0645ad;">possessed</span></a> his neighbor's dog.</p>
              <p>Berkowitz later amended his confession to claim he was the shooter in only two incidents, personally killing three people and wounding a fourth. The other victims were killed, Berkowitz claimed, by members of a violent <a title="Satanism" href="/wiki/Satanism"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Satanic</span></a> <a title="Cult" href="/wiki/Cult"><span style="color: #0645ad;">cult</span></a> of which he was a member. Though he remains the only person charged with or convicted of the shootings, some <a title="Law enforcement agency" href="/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency"><span style="color: #0645ad;">law enforcement</span></a> authorities argue that Berkowitz's claims are credible: according to <a title="John Hockenberry" href="/wiki/John_Hockenberry"><span style="color: #0645ad;">John Hockenberry</span></a><sup id="cite_ref-hockenberry_0-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hockenberry-0"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></span></a></sup> formerly of <a title="MSNBC" href="/wiki/MSNBC"><span style="color: #0645ad;">MSNBC</span></a> and <a class="mw-redirect" title="NPR" href="/wiki/NPR"><span style="color: #0645ad;">NPR</span></a>, many officials involved in the original "Son of Sam" case suspected that more than one person was committing the murders. Hockenberry also reported that the Son of Sam case was reopened in 1996 and, as of 2004<sup class="plainlinks noprint asof-tag update" style="display: none;"><a class="external text" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Berkowitz&amp;action=edit"><span style="color: #3366bb; font-size: x-small;">[update]</span></a></sup>, it was still considered open.</p>
              <p><span id="Early_life" class="mw-headline">Early life</span></p>
              <p>Berkowitz was born <strong>Richard David Falco</strong> in <a class="mw-redirect" title="Brooklyn, New York" href="/wiki/Brooklyn,_New_York"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Brooklyn, New York</span></a>. His mother, Betty Broder, was married to Anthony Falco, with whom she had a daughter before the couple separated without legally <a title="Divorce" href="/wiki/Divorce"><span style="color: #0645ad;">divorcing</span></a>. After this, she had an affair with the married Joseph Kleinman,<sup id="cite_ref-crimelibrary_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-crimelibrary-1"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></span></a></sup> who fathered a son. Kleinman suggested she have an <a title="Abortion" href="/wiki/Abortion"><span style="color: #0645ad;">abortion</span></a>, but she gave birth to a boy and listed Falco as the father.</p>

              <p>Before he was a week old, the baby was <a title="Adoption" href="/wiki/Adoption"><span style="color: #0645ad;">adopted</span></a> by hardware store owners Nathan and Pearl Berkowitz, who reversed the order of his first and middle names in addition to giving him their own surname.<sup id="cite_ref-crimelibrary_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-crimelibrary-1"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>John Vincent Sanders wrote that Berkowitz's childhood was "somewhat troubled. Although of above-average intelligence, he lost interest in learning at an early age and began an infatuation with petty <a title="Larceny" href="/wiki/Larceny"><span style="color: #0645ad;">larceny</span></a> and <a title="Pyromania" href="/wiki/Pyromania"><span style="color: #0645ad;">pyromania</span></a>."<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></span></a></sup> Berkowitz's adoptive mother died of <a title="Breast cancer" href="/wiki/Breast_cancer"><span style="color: #0645ad;">breast cancer</span></a> when he was thirteen, and his home life became strained in later years, particularly because he disliked his adoptive father's second wife. He later claimed his new step-sister was interested in <a title="Witchcraft" href="/wiki/Witchcraft"><span style="color: #0645ad;">witchcraft</span></a>, sparking an interest in the <a title="Occult" href="/wiki/Occult"><span style="color: #0645ad;">occult</span></a> he would later pursue more actively.</p>
              <p>In 1969, the 16-year-old Berkowitz attended the <a title="Woodstock Festival" href="/wiki/Woodstock_Festival"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Woodstock Festival</span></a>. He joined the <a title="United States Army" href="/wiki/United_States_Army"><span style="color: #0645ad;">United States Army</span></a> in 1971, and served on <a title="Active duty" href="/wiki/Active_duty"><span style="color: #0645ad;">active duty</span></a> until his <a class="mw-redirect" title="Honorable discharge" href="/wiki/Honorable_discharge"><span style="color: #0645ad;">honorable discharge</span></a> in 1974. He served in both the United States and <a title="South Korea" href="/wiki/South_Korea"><span style="color: #0645ad;">South Korea</span></a>.</p>
              <p>In 1974 Berkowitz located his birth mother, Betty Falco. After a few visits, she disclosed the details of his illegitimate <a class="mw-redirect" title="Conception (biology)" href="/wiki/Conception_(biology)"><span style="color: #0645ad;">conception</span></a> and birth, which greatly disturbed him. They fell out of contact, but Berkowitz did stay in touch with his half-sister, Roslyn.<sup id="cite_ref-crimelibrary_1-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-crimelibrary-1"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>After leaving the Army, Berkowitz held several <a class="mw-redirect" title="Blue collar" href="/wiki/Blue_collar"><span style="color: #0645ad;">blue collar</span></a> jobs. At the time of his arrest, he was employed by the <a class="mw-redirect" title="U.S. Postal Service" href="/wiki/U.S._Postal_Service"><span style="color: #0645ad;">U.S. Postal Service</span></a>.</p>

              <p>Berkowitz claims that he joined a <a title="Cult" href="/wiki/Cult"><span style="color: #0645ad;">cult</span></a> in the spring of 1975. Initially, he said, the group was involved in harmless activities, such as <a title="Séance" href="/wiki/S%C3%A9ance"><span style="color: #0645ad;">séances</span></a> and <a class="mw-redirect" title="Fortune telling" href="/wiki/Fortune_telling"><span style="color: #0645ad;">fortune telling</span></a>.

              <div style="font-size: 90%;">Pelham Bay area of New York City</div>
              </div>
              <p>At about 1:10 a.m. on 29 July 1976, Mike and Rose Lauria returned to their apartment in <a class="mw-redirect" title="Pelham Bay, Bronx, New York" href="/wiki/Pelham_Bay,_Bronx,_New_York"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Pelham Bay</span></a> after dining out. Their daughter Donna, 18, and her friend Jody Valenti, 19, were sitting in Valenti's <a title="Oldsmobile" href="/wiki/Oldsmobile"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Oldsmobile</span></a>, parked outside the apartment, discussing their evening at the Peachtree, a <a class="mw-redirect" title="New Rochelle" href="/wiki/New_Rochelle"><span style="color: #0645ad;">New Rochelle</span></a> <a class="mw-redirect" title="Discotheque" href="/wiki/Discotheque"><span style="color: #0645ad;">discotheque</span></a>. As Valenti was about to leave, Mike Lauria agreed to his daughter's suggestion that they walk the family's dog together. Before he went inside to retrieve the poodle, Lauria noticed a man sleeping in a yellow <a title="Compact car" href="/wiki/Compact_car"><span style="color: #0645ad;">compact car</span></a> parked across the street and about sixty feet behind his own car. Neighbors would report to police that an unfamiliar yellow <a title="Compact car" href="/wiki/Compact_car"><span style="color: #0645ad;">compact car</span></a> had been cruising the area for hours before the shooting.<sup id="cite_ref-terry2325_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-terry2325-4"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>After her parents were inside, Donna Lauria opened the car door to depart, noticing a man quickly approaching them. Startled and angered by the man's sudden appearance, Lauria said, "Now what is this…"<sup id="cite_ref-terry2325_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-terry2325-4"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></span></a></sup> From the paper sack he carried, the man produced a handgun and, crouching as he aimed, fired three shots. Lauria was struck in her chest by one bullet that killed her almost instantly, Valenti took a bullet in her <a title="Thigh" href="/wiki/Thigh"><span style="color: #0645ad;">thigh</span></a>, and the third missed both girls. The shooter turned and quickly walked away.</p>
              <p>Valenti, who survived her injuries, said she did not recognize the killer. She described him as a white male in his 30s with a fair complexion, standing about 5'9" and weighing about 160 lb (73 kg). His hair was short, dark and curly in a "<a title="Mod (subculture)" href="/wiki/Mod_(subculture)"><span style="color: #0645ad;">mod</span></a> style."<sup id="cite_ref-terry2325_4-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-terry2325-4"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></span></a></sup> This description was echoed by Mike Lauria in his description of the man who was sitting in the yellow compact car parked behind Valenti and Lauria.</p>
              <p>Detectives from the 8th Homicide precinct of the <a class="mw-redirect" title="New York Police Department" href="/wiki/New_York_Police_Department"><span style="color: #0645ad;">New York Police Department</span></a> had little in the way of evidence. Most importantly, they were able to determine that the handgun used was a <a title=".44 Special" href="/wiki/.44_Special"><span style="color: #0645ad;">.44 caliber</span></a> <a title="Charter Arms Bulldog" href="/wiki/Charter_Arms_Bulldog"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Charter Arms Bulldog</span></a>. A high-power, five-shot <a title="Revolver" href="/wiki/Revolver"><span style="color: #0645ad;">revolver</span></a> intended for use in close quarters, the .44 Bulldog was identified because the unusual manufacturing process of its barrel left distinctive marks on each slug.</p>

              <div style="font-size: 90%;">Forest Hills Gardens, Queens. Most of Berkowitz's activity was in Queens, though he lived in Yonkers.</div>
              </div>
              <p>In the early morning of 23 October 1976, another shooting occurred, this time in <a title="Queens" href="/wiki/Queens"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Queens</span></a>. Carl Denaro, 25, and Rosemary Keenan, 38, were parked in a secluded residential area in <a title="Forest Hills Gardens, Queens" href="/wiki/Forest_Hills_Gardens,_Queens"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Forest Hills Gardens, Queens</span></a>. Keenan was driving her own <a title="Volkswagen Beetle" href="/wiki/Volkswagen_Beetle"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Volkswagen Beetle</span></a>, and Denaro was in the passenger seat. At about 1:30 a.m., the car's windows seemed to explode, and the duo dropped low in their seats as several bullets struck the car. Denaro and Keenan did not realize someone was shooting at them, even as Denaro was bleeding from a bullet wound to his head. They panicked and Keenan drove to Peck's, a bar about half a mile away. Keenan had only superficial injuries from the broken glass, but Denaro eventually needed a metal plate to replace a portion of his <a title="Human skull" href="/wiki/Human_skull"><span style="color: #0645ad;">skull</span></a>. Neither victim had seen whoever had made the attack.</p>
              <p>Police determined that the slugs embedded in Keenan's car were .44 caliber bullets, but they were so damaged and deformed that they thought it was unlikely that they could ever be linked to a particular weapon.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></span></a></sup> Denaro had shoulder-length hair, and police would later speculate that the shooter had mistaken him for a girl. Keenan's father was a 20-year veteran police detective of the <a class="mw-redirect" title="NYPD" href="/wiki/NYPD"><span style="color: #0645ad;">NYPD</span></a>, spurring an in-depth investigation. As with the Lauria-Valenti shooting, however, there seemed to be no motive for the shooting, and police made little progress in the case. Though many details of the Denaro-Keenan shooting were very similar to the Lauria-Valenti case, police did not initially suspect a connection, partly because the shootings occurred in different boroughs of New York City and were investigated by different local police agencies.</p>
              <p>Berkowitz later claimed that, while he observed and helped plan the crime, an unnamed female cult member actually shot Denaro.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated8_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated8-7"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></span></a></sup> The victims survived primarily, claimed Berkowitz, because the shooter was unfamiliar with the powerful <a title="Recoil" href="/wiki/Recoil"><span style="color: #0645ad;">recoil</span></a> of a .44 Bulldog.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated8_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated8-7"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>

              <p>Late in the evening of 26 November 1976, Donna DeMasi, 16, and Joanne Lomino, 18, had walked home from a movie, and were chatting under a streetlight outside Lomino's home in Queens. A man approached to within about ten feet of the girls. They later described him as about 5'9", tall and slender, weighing perhaps 150 lb (68 kg) with straight, dirty blond hair and dark eyes. He wore a slim, knee-length coat reminiscent of military surplus gear.</p>
              <p>Startled but not frightened by his sudden appearance, DeMasi and Lomino suspected the man was lost and asking directions. In a high-pitched voice he said, "Can you tell me how to get,"<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated8_7-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated8-7"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></span></a></sup> then he produced a revolver. He shot each of the victims once, and as they fell to the ground injured, he fired several more times, striking the apartment building before running away. Having heard the gunshots, a neighbor rushed from their apartment and saw the blond shooter rush by, gripping a pistol in his left hand.</p>
              <p>DeMasi and Lomino were hospitalized with serious injuries: Lomino was ultimately rendered a <a class="mw-redirect" title="Paraplegic" href="/wiki/Paraplegic"><span style="color: #0645ad;">paraplegic</span></a>, but DeMasi's wounds were less serious.</p>
              <p>Based on the testimony of DeMasi, Lomino, and their neighbor, police produced several <a class="mw-redirect" title="Composite sketch" href="/wiki/Composite_sketch"><span style="color: #0645ad;">composite sketches</span></a> of the blond shooter. Police also determined the gun was a .44, but the slugs were so deformed that linking them to a particular gun was all but ruled out.</p>
              <p>Berkowitz later claimed that while he helped plan the DeMasi-Lomino shooting, the actual perpetrator was cult member John Carr, and that a Yonkers police officer, also a cult member, was involved in the crime.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated8_7-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated8-7"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>

              <p>The new year brought more shootings in Queens. In the early morning of 30 January 1977, an engaged couple, Christine Freund, 26, and John Diel, 30, were sitting in Diel's <a title="Pontiac Firebird" href="/wiki/Pontiac_Firebird"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Pontiac Firebird</span></a>, preparing to drive to a dance hall after having seen the motion picture <em><a title="Rocky" href="/wiki/Rocky"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Rocky</span></a></em>.</p>
              <p>Three gunshots penetrated the car at about 12:40 a.m. In a panic, Diel drove away for help. He suffered minor superficial injuries, but Freund was shot twice. She died several hours later at the hospital. Neither victim had seen their attacker(s).</p>
              <p>Police determined the shooter had again used a .44 <a title="Charter Arms Bulldog" href="/wiki/Charter_Arms_Bulldog"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Bulldog</span></a>. Police made the first public acknowledgment that the Freund-Diel shooting was similar to the earlier cases, and that the crimes might be connected: the earlier victims had been struck with .44 caliber bullets, if not confirmed Bulldog revolvers, and the shootings targeted young women with long, dark hair and/or young couples parked in cars.</p>

              <p>At about 7:30 p.m. on March 8th, 1977, <a title="Columbia University" href="/wiki/Columbia_University"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Columbia University</span></a> student Virginia Voskerichian, 19, was walking home from school. She lived about a block from where Christine Freund was shot. The Voskerichian shooting differed from the other Son of Sam crimes in many respects. All the other victims were couples, and were shot on weekends in the late night or early morning.</p>
              <p>There were no direct witnesses to the Voskerichian murder, which happened on the victim's own street. In a desperate move to defend herself, Voskerichian lifted her textbooks between herself and her killer, only to have the makeshift shield penetrated, the bullet striking her head and killing her.</p>
              <p>Moments after the shooting, a neighborhood resident who had heard the gunshots was rounding the corner onto Voskerichian's street. He nearly collided with a person he described as a short, husky boy, 16 to 18 years old and clean-shaven, wearing a sweater and watch cap, who was sprinting away from the crime scene. The neighbor said the youth pulled the cap over his face and said, "Oh, Jesus!" as he passed by, sprinting.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated4_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated4-10"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Other neighbors claimed to have seen the "teenager," and another matching Berkowitz's description, loitering separately in the area for about an hour before the shooting.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated4_10-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated4-10"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></span></a></sup> In the following days, the media repeated police claims that this "chubby teenager" was the suspect in the shooting.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated4_10-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated4-10"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Berkowitz later claimed that he was at the Voskerichian murder scene, but the actual shooter was a "woman from <a class="mw-redirect" title="Westchester, New York" href="/wiki/Westchester,_New_York"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Westchester</span></a>."<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated2_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated2-11"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></span></a></sup> Additionally, Berkowitz claimed the Voskerichian shooting was partly designed to confuse police by seeming to change the <a title="Modus operandi" href="/wiki/Modus_operandi"><span style="color: #0645ad;">modus operandi</span></a> established in earlier cult shootings.</p>

              <p>The same day, the Operation Omega <a title="Task force" href="/wiki/Task_force"><span style="color: #0645ad;">task force</span></a> made its public debut. Charged solely with investigating the .44 Caliber shootings, the task force was led by Deputy Inspector Timothy J. Dowd, composed of over 300 police officers. Police speculated that the killer had a vendetta against women, perhaps due to <a title="Social rejection" href="/wiki/Social_rejection"><span style="color: #0645ad;">chronic social rejection</span></a>, and also declared that the "chubby teenager" was regarded as a witness, not a suspect in the Voskerichian shooting.

The phrase "me hoot, it hurts, sonny boy" was taken as a Scots-accented version of "my <em>heart</em>, it hurts, sonny boy"; and the police also hypothesized that the shooter blamed a dark-haired nurse for his father's death, due to the "too many heart attacks" phrase, and the facts that Lauria was a medical technician and Valenti was studying to be a <a title="Nurse" href="/wiki/Nurse"><span style="color: #0645ad;">nurse</span></a>.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></span></a></sup> On July 28, <em>New York Daily News</em> columnist <a title="Jimmy Breslin" href="/wiki/Jimmy_Breslin"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Jimmy Breslin</span></a> alluded to the "wemon" quirk and referred to the shooter watching the world from "his attic window."<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated1_17-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated1-17"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>

You can forget about me if you like because I don't care for publicity. However you must not forget Donna Lauria and you cannot let the people forget her either. She was a very, very sweet girl but Sam's a thirsty lad and he won't let me stop killing until he gets his fill of blood. Mr. Breslin, sir, don't think that because you haven't heard from me for a while that I went to sleep. No, rather, I am still here. Like a spirit roaming the night. Thirsty, hungry, seldom stopping to rest; anxious to please Sam. I love my work. Now, the void has been filled. Perhaps we shall meet face to face someday or perhaps I will be blown away by cops with smoking .38's. Whatever, if I shall be fortunate enough to meet you I will tell you all about Sam if you like and I will introduce you to him. His name is "Sam the terrible." Not knowing the what the future holds I shall say farewell and I will see you at the next job. Or should I say you will see my handiwork at the next job? Remember Ms. Lauria. Thank you.

              <p>Underneath the "Son of Sam" was a logo or sketch that combined several symbols. The writer's question, "What will you have for July 29?" was taken as an ominous threat: July 29 would be the anniversary of the first .44 Caliber shooting.</p>

              <p>A week later, after consulting with police and agreeing to withhold portions of the text, the <em>Daily News</em> published the letter, and Breslin urged the killer to turn himself over to authorities.

              <p>It was near the one-year anniversary of the first .44 caliber shootings, and police set up a sizable <a title="Dragnet (policing)" href="/wiki/Dragnet_(policing)"><span style="color: #0645ad;">dragnet</span></a>, focusing on past hunting grounds of <a title="Queens" href="/wiki/Queens"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Queens</span></a> and <a class="mw-redirect" title="The Bronx" href="/wiki/The_Bronx"><span style="color: #0645ad;">The Bronx</span></a>. However, the next .44 shooting was in <a title="Brooklyn" href="/wiki/Brooklyn"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Brooklyn</span></a>.</p>
              <p>Early on July 31st, 1977, Stacy Moskowitz and Robert Violante, both 20, were in Violante's car, which was parked under a streetlight near a city park. They were kissing when a man approached to within about three feet of the passenger side of Violante's car, fired several gunshots into the car, striking both victims in the head, before running into the park. Moskowitz died several hours later in the hospital. Violante survived, though one of his eyes was destroyed and he retained only very limited vision in the other eye. With her short, curly blond hair, Moskowitz was a departure from the other female victims. Based on telephone calls to police within seconds of the shooting, the crime occurred at 2:35 a.m.</p>
              <p>The Moskowitz-Violante crime produced more witnesses than any of the other Son of Sam murders, notably the only direct eyewitness who was not an intended victim. During the shooting, Tommy Zaino, 19, was parked with his date in a car three car lengths ahead of Violante's. Moments before the shooting, Zaino saw a peripheral glimpse of the shooter's approach and happened to glance in his rear view mirror just in time to see the crime occur. Due to the bright street light and full moon, Zaino clearly saw the perpetrator for several seconds, later describing him as 25 to 30 years old, of average height (5'7" to 5'9") with shaggy hair that was dark blond or light brown — "it looked like a <a class="mw-redirect" title="Wig (hair)" href="/wiki/Wig_(hair)"><span style="color: #0645ad;">wig</span></a>", Zaino said.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated5_24-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated5-24"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>About a minute after the shooting, a woman seated next to her boyfriend in his car on the other side of the city park saw a "white male [who was wearing] a light-colored, cheap nylon wig" sprint from the park and enter a "small, light-colored" auto, which drove away quickly.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated5_24-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated5-24"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></span></a></sup> "He looks like he just robbed a bank," said the woman, who wrote what she could see of the car's <a class="mw-redirect" title="License plate" href="/wiki/License_plate"><span style="color: #0645ad;">license plate</span></a>: unable to determine the first two characters, she was certain the others were either 4-GUR or 4-GVR.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated5_24-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated5-24"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Other witnesses included a woman who saw a light car speed away from the park about 20 seconds after the gunshots,<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated5_24-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated5-24"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></span></a></sup> and at least two witnesses who described a yellow <a title="Volkswagen" href="/wiki/Volkswagen"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Volkswagen</span></a> driving quickly from the neighborhood with its headlights off.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></span></a></sup> A neighborhood resident given the <a title="Pseudonym" href="/wiki/Pseudonym"><span style="color: #0645ad;">pseudonym</span></a> Mary Lyons heard the gunshots and Violante's calls for help, and glancing from her apartment window, she saw a man she later positively identified as Berkowitz, who was walking casually <em>away</em> from the crime scene as many others were rushing <em>towards</em> the scene to render aid.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Shortly after 2:35 a.m., a man given the <a title="Pseudonym" href="/wiki/Pseudonym"><span style="color: #0645ad;">pseudonym</span></a> Alan Masters was passing through an intersection a few blocks from the park. Masters was nearly struck by what he described as a yellow <a title="Volkswagen Beetle" href="/wiki/Volkswagen_Beetle"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Volkswagen Beetle</span></a> that sped through the intersection, against the red light and without headlights, with the driver holding his door shut with his arm as he drove. Angered and alarmed, Masters followed the Volkswagen at high speed for several minutes before losing sight of the vehicle. Masters described the driver as a white male in his late 20s or early 30s, with a narrow face; dark, long, stringy hair; several days growth of dark whiskers on his face; and wearing a blue jacket.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></span></a></sup> Upset, Masters neglected to note the Volkswagen's license plate number, but he thought it might have been a <a title="New Jersey" href="/wiki/New_Jersey"><span style="color: #0645ad;">New Jersey</span></a> rather than a <a title="New York" href="/wiki/New_York"><span style="color: #0645ad;">New York</span></a> plate. Violante encountered a very similar man as he and Moskowitz were in the park shortly before the shooting, describing him as a "grubby-looking <a class="mw-redirect" title="Hippy" href="/wiki/Hippy"><span style="color: #0645ad;">hippy</span></a>" with whiskers, wiry hair over his forehead, dark eyes, and wearing a <a title="Denim" href="/wiki/Denim"><span style="color: #0645ad;">denim</span></a> jacket.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>

              <p>Police didn't learn of the Moskowitz-Violante shooting until about 2:50 a.m., and Dowd didn't think it was another Son of Sam shooting until an officer at the scene reported that large-caliber shells had been used.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>About an hour after the shooting, police set up a series of roadblocks, stopping hundreds of cars to question drivers and inspect vehicles. Based on extended interviews of Masters and others who described a Volkswagen speeding from the crime scene, police now suspected that the shooter owned or drove such a vehicle. In subsequent days, police determined there were over 900 Volkswagens in New York or New Jersey, and they made plans to track down each of these cars and their owners</p>
