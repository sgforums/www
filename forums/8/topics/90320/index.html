People who you do not have much to talk about sometimes can be a lot more trustworthy.<br><br>My experience tells me whether a person is trustworthy or not is more dependent on their character than your relationship with them.

But most ppl would be if they are enraged. My advise is always try to screw ppl with legal lawsuits. Hit your opponents hard, make them stay down and for added effects, rub some salt into their wounds.
