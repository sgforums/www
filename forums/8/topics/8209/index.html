            <div class='col-md body'>MYSTERY DEATH<br><br>BOY, 14, TIED WITH RAFFIA STRING<br>The Sunday Times July 2, 2000<br><br>Quoting:<br><br>"A 14-YEAR-OLD schoolboy was found dead in a macabre manner by his sister when she returned to their Choa Chu Kang Central flat on Friday night. Eugene Yang Zi Le's hands and  feet were tied with red raffia string and his mouth covered with black cloth tape when the teenage girl came home at around 9 pm.<br><br>The bespectacled Eugene, a Secondary 3 student of Kranji Secondary School, also had a black belt tied around his upper arms and body. There were ligature marks around his neck. The police said that he was wearing white shorts. He was pronounced dead at around 9.50 pmÂ…His class teacher..said he was a nice, quiet studentÂ…A neighbour..said Eugene was polite and well-mannered...Eugene's death has been classified as unnatural for purposes of investigation by the policeÂ…"<br><br>"Macabre" from WEBSTER'S DICTIONARY: gruesome, ghastly, grim<br><br>Why did he die?<br><br>What did he do to deserve such death?<br><br>What kind of thoughts occupy his mind?<br><br>Who is the SUSPECT and what is the quarrel he(or a she) has with the boy?(If I know wont that put me and my family in great danger? Maybe certain things are better left unknown)<br><br>I am afraid of the SUSPECT if he can do the same thing to me or anyone else<br><br>Did the boy killed himself? Is this a case of AUTO-EROTICISM?<br><br>OFFICER LOSES REVOLVER<br><br>"An OFF-DUTY Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officer lost his service revolver early yesterday morning on Orchard Road.."<br><br>That is so shocking.<br><br>Will the person who has in possession of that revolver surrender it?(to the nearest authorities)<br><br>Whoever has it puts himself (or a herself) in great danger, does he value his own safety? Will he put people in danger? So Dangerous<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is always murder going around in these world. We can't stop it, and don't kept thinking about it will probably help you from imagining things. As for the case of the teenager boy mysterious death, we have to wait for the for coroner to come out with the verdict. Itmight be a cold-blooded murder, it might be an accidental death.<br><br>For the case of the missing revolver, that NCB guy is a gone case in the police force. He can forgets about getting promoted or even ever get one. Its a big black mark on his record. He can starts to think about getting another job.<br><br>------------------<br>why, bishamon? why bish?<br>coz he's God of War!!<br>But I'm a peacelover! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Every minutes every seconds there is someone dying in every corner of the world. Just only you know the person or not, or you choose to bother or not. We can't be every minutes or every seconds thinking of everybody who die.<br><br>As for the person who lost his revolver, I can only say its a sad thing to see. I doubt any person who found the revolver would return it. Main reason I think is because Singaporeans are mostly afraid of trouble. Imagine someone already used it to kill a person before he found it.<br><br>------------------<br>It takes a hour to like someone, it take a day to love someone and take a lifetime to forget someone</div>
