But you must remember that your boyfriend is the one who is going to live with you together for the rest of your life, and not your close friends. By placing your boyfriend in top priority doesn,t mean you have to ditch your friends. To not putting your boyfriend in top priority is tantament to your heart not in the right place. Love is not expendable, the one you treassure most is the one you love most.<br><br>Loyalty to friends is admirable, but not to the extent of them owning you. I don't think you like the ideas that your future boyfriend put his friends in favour of you. Do you sincerely hope that your boyfriend to treat his friends more important than you? I doubt so. You are building a future with your boyfriend, how can he not be in your top priority list? This is not selfish thought, this is putting your heart in the RIGHT place.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

A sensible person who in their right mind, would not want to feel expendable. There is a limit on how much you can compromise, then love will prevail.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
