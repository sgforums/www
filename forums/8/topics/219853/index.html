They only manage it. However, they appoint a few cetified traders to act as currency exchangers. There are also many traders who do currency exchange but not appointed by e-gold.<br><br>So to trace the seller, it's going to be difficult. First, e-gold users are anonymous and does not need any verifications. So you don't know who you are trading with. Also, e-gold do not reveal the transaction done in their system, for privacy purpose. So, you've no way to find out who the seller has transacted with.<br><br>The only safe way to deal with e-gold is to trade with reliable people.

Catch me if you can. Jail me if you can.'<br><br>Police are still investigating the case.<br><br>E-gold is a digital currency system backed by real gold.<br><br>What this means is that every dollar of the 'currency' circulating on the Internet has an equivalent amount of gold sitting in a vault, owned by the company that operates the system.<br><br>That company is Gold &amp; Silver Reserve, which was founded by two American citizens but registered in Nevis, a small Caribbean island known as a tax haven.<br><br>Two Singaporean e-gold traders agreed to explain to The Sunday Times how it works, but declined to reveal their names. One of them is a 24-year-old university student. The other would give only his age, 23.<br><br>To start using e-gold, a client needs to get an account with e-gold.com. That process takes mere minutes and, unlike banks, the information is not verified.<br><br>'You can start an account with fake details and nobody will check,' said the 23-year-old.<br><br>The next step is to buy gold to put into the account. This is done via e-gold traders.<br><br>Traders, like the two men The Sunday Times spoke to, operate like online money changers. They convert real money into e-gold and back, making a profit on the exchange rate.<br><br>For example, the trader operating wyngold.com will sell US$1 worth of e-gold for S$1.66 and buy it back for S$1.53.<br><br>The scammer would have to go to such an exchanger to convert his e-gold into real money, but as there are traders all over the world, it is extremely difficult to find out which one he uses.<br><br>To top it off, most traders operate informally and do not register their businesses with the authorities, the university student said.<br><br>Put it all together and the result is a dubious system, said Mr Danny Lim, 50, chief executive of authentication company Creditel.<br><br>'With credit cards, there's always some regulation. The issuing bank regulates the buyer and the receiving bank regulates the seller. With e-gold there's nothing,' he said.<br><br>A Google search on e-gold throws up differing opinions on the currency. Supporters say that because it is based solely on the precious metal, e-gold is immune to currency fluctuations.<br><br>Detractors point to it being the medium of choice for online scams known as High Yield Investment Programmes, which claim to offer up to 200 per cent interest for a deposit.<br><br>According to BusinessWeek magazine, one such scam involving US-based E-Biz Ventures took in US$50 million (S$80 million) before being shut down in 2001.<br><br>A handful of personal transactions on auction site eBay and car forums like the one prowled by the scammer also use e-gold.<br><br>But Mr Lim warned that people should be wary of making any transactions using this system.<br><br>He said: 'You should be immediately suspicious of anyone who demands payment in an unconventional currency. It's like someone asking to be paid in full in cash, upfront.'<br><br><strong>jeremyau@sph.com.sg </strong></div>

Then the real owner of the credit card discovered the fradulent purchase and requested for a chargeback from bank. The bank take the money back from the seller and put it back into the real owner's bank account. Now the seller lost both items + money. BUT this kind fraudster cannot use the same way to cheat if the payment processor is e-gold cos of the non-repudiation policy by e-gold.<br><br>Every payment processor also have loophole here and there. Don't know why they make a big fuss out of this. </div></blockquote>ehh.. paypal has verification system wor, i dun know bout egold though? which means the buyer can check if the seller is verified or not, if not verified, he can always reject the buyer leh.. to get verification from paypal, u need to send them a fax copy of your credit card statement with the same address and person's name etc.. and they'll check and verify with the bank that the card was issued.</div>
