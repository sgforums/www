            <div class='col-md body'>tsk!<br><br>------------------<br>1 Corinthians 14<br>1 Follow the way of love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy.<br>2 For anyone who speaks in a tongue [1] does not speak to men but to God. Indeed, no one understands him; he utters mysteries with his spirit. [2]<br>3 But everyone who prophesies speaks to men for their strengthening, encouragement and comfort.<br>4 He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church.<br>5 I would like every one of you to speak in tongues, [3] but I would rather have you prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues, [4] unless he interprets, so that the church may be edified.<br>6 Now, brothers, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction?<br>7 Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds, such as the flute or harp, how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes?<br>8 Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle?<br>9 So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air.<br>10 Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning.<br>11 If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and he is a foreigner to me.<br>12 So it is with you. Since you are eager to have spiritual gifts, try to excel in gifts that build up the church.<br>13 For this reason anyone who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret what he says.<br>14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.<br>15 So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my mind.<br>16 If you are praising God with your spirit, how can one who finds himself among those who do not understand [5] say "Amen" to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying?<br>17 You may be giving thanks well enough, but the other man is not edified.<br>18 I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.<br>19 But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue.<br>20 Brothers, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants, but in your thinking be adults.<br>21 In the Law it is written: "Through men of strange tongues and through the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people, but even then they will not listen to me," [6] says the Lord.<br>22 Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however, is for believers, not for unbelievers.<br>23 So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and some who do not understand [7] or some unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind?<br>24 But if an unbeliever or someone who does not understand [8] comes in while everybody is prophesying, he will be convinced by all that he is a sinner and will be judged by all,<br>25 and the secrets of his heart will be laid bare. So he will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, "God is really among you!"<br>26 What then shall we say, brothers? When you come together, everyone has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. All of these must be done for the strengthening of the church.<br>27 If anyone speaks in a tongue, two--or at the most three--should speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret.<br>28 If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and God.<br>29 Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said.<br>30 And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop.<br>31 For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged.<br>32 The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets.<br>33 For God is not a God of disorder but of peace. As in all the congregations of the saints,<br>34 women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says.<br>35 If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.<br>36 Did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached?<br>37 If anybody thinks he is a prophet or spiritually gifted, let him acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord's command.<br>38 If he ignores this, he himself will be ignored. [9]<br>39 Therefore, my brothers, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.<br>40 But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.<br><br>1 Corinthians 4<br>1<br>So then, men ought to regard us as servants of Christ and as those entrusted with the secret things of God.<br>2<br>Now it is required that those who have been given a trust must prove faithful.<br>3<br>I care very little if I am judged by you or by any human court; indeed, I do not even judge myself.<br>4<br>My conscience is clear, but that does not make me innocent. It is the Lord who judges me.<br>5<br>Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time; wait till the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of men's hearts. At that time each will receive his praise from God.<br>6<br>Now, brothers, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that you may learn from us the meaning of the saying, "Do not go beyond what is written." Then you will not take pride in one man over against another.<br>7<br>For who makes you different from anyone else? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not?<br>8<br>Already you have all you want! Already you have become rich! You have become kings--and that without us! How I wish that you really had become kings so that we might be kings with you!<br>9<br>For it seems to me that God has put us apostles on display at the end of the procession, like men condemned to die in the arena. We have been made a spectacle to the whole universe, to angels as well as to men.<br>10<br>We are fools for Christ, but you are so wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are honored, we are dishonored!<br>11<br>To this very hour we go hungry and thirsty, we are in rags, we are brutally treated, we are homeless.<br>12<br>We work hard with our own hands. When we are cursed, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure it;<br>13<br>when we are slandered, we answer kindly. Up to this moment we have become the scum of the earth, the refuse of the world.<br>14<br>I am not writing this to shame you, but to warn you, as my dear children.<br>15<br>Even though you have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.<br>16<br>Therefore I urge you to imitate me.<br>17<br>For this reason I am sending to you Timothy, my son whom I love, who is faithful in the Lord. He will remind you of my way of life in Christ Jesus, which agrees with what I teach everywhere in every church.<br>18<br>Some of you have become arrogant, as if I were not coming to you.<br>19<br>But I will come to you very soon, if the Lord is willing, and then I will find out not only how these arrogant people are talking, but what power they have.<br>20<br>For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power.<br>21<br>What do you prefer? Shall I come to you with a whip, or in love and with a gentle spirit?<br><br>1<br>After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi [1] from the east came to Jerusalem<br>2<br>and asked, "Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east [2] and have come to worship him."<br>3<br>When King Herod heard this he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.<br>4<br>When he had called together all the people's chief priests and teachers of the law, he asked them where the Christ [3] was to be born.<br>5<br>"In Bethlehem in Judea," they replied, "for this is what the prophet has written:<br>6<br>"`But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a ruler who will be the shepherd of my people Israel.' [4] "<br>7<br>Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.<br>8<br>He sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and make a careful search for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him."<br>9<br>After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen in the east [5] went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.<br>10<br>When they saw the star, they were overjoyed.<br>11<br>On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold and of incense and of myrrh.<br>12<br>And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another route.<br>13<br>When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. "Get up," he said, "take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."<br>14<br>So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt,<br>15<br>where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: "Out of Egypt I called my son." [6]<br>16<br>When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi.<br>17<br>Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:<br>18<br>"A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more." [7]<br>19<br>After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt<br>20<br>and said, "Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to take the child's life are dead."<br>21<br>So he got up, took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.<br>22<br>But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee,<br>23<br>and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets: "He will be called a Nazarene."<br><br>2 Corinthians 9<br>1<br>There is no need for me to write to you about this service to the saints.<br>2<br>For I know your eagerness to help, and I have been boasting about it to the Macedonians, telling them that since last year you in Achaia were ready to give; and your enthusiasm has stirred most of them to action.<br>3<br>But I am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you in this matter should not prove hollow, but that you may be ready, as I said you would be.<br>4<br>For if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we--not to say anything about you--would be ashamed of having been so confident.<br>5<br>So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to visit you in advance and finish the arrangements for the generous gift you had promised. Then it will be ready as a generous gift, not as one grudgingly given.<br>6<br>Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.<br>7<br>Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.<br>8<br>And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work.<br>9<br>As it is written: "He has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor; his righteousness endures forever." [1]<br>10<br>Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness.<br>11<br>You will be made rich in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion, and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God.<br>12<br>This service that you perform is not only supplying the needs of God's people but is also overflowing in many expressions of thanks to God.<br>13<br>Because of the service by which you have proved yourselves, men will praise God for the obedience that accompanies your confession of the gospel of Christ, and for your generosity in sharing with them and with everyone else.<br>14<br>And in their prayers for you their hearts will go out to you, because of the surpassing grace God has given you.<br>15<br>Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!<br><br>2 Corinthians 1<br>1<br>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, To the church of God in Corinth, together with all the saints throughout Achaia:<br>2<br>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<br>3<br>Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort,<br>4<br>who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God.<br>5<br>For just as the sufferings of Christ flow over into our lives, so also through Christ our comfort overflows.<br>6<br>If we are distressed, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer.<br>7<br>And our hope for you is firm, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our comfort.<br>8<br>We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about the hardships we suffered in the province of Asia. We were under great pressure, far beyond our ability to endure, so that we despaired even of life.<br>9<br>Indeed, in our hearts we felt the sentence of death. But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead.<br>10<br>He has delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us. On him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us,<br>11<br>as you help us by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on our [1] behalf for the gracious favor granted us in answer to the prayers of many.<br>12<br>Now this is our boast: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially in our relations with you, in the holiness and sincerity that are from God. We have done so not according to worldly wisdom but according to God's grace.<br>13<br>For we do not write you anything you cannot read or understand. And I hope that,<br>14<br>as you have understood us in part, you will come to understand fully that you can boast of us just as we will boast of you in the day of the Lord Jesus.<br>15<br>Because I was confident of this, I planned to visit you first so that you might benefit twice.<br>16<br>I planned to visit you on my way to Macedonia and to come back to you from Macedonia, and then to have you send me on my way to Judea.<br>17<br>When I planned this, did I do it lightly? Or do I make my plans in a worldly manner so that in the same breath I say, "Yes, yes" and "No, no"?<br>18<br>But as surely as God is faithful, our message to you is not "Yes" and "No."<br>19<br>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by me and Silas [2] and Timothy, was not "Yes" and "No," but in him it has always been "Yes."<br>20<br>For no matter how many promises God has made, they are "Yes" in Christ. And so through him the "Amen" is spoken by us to the glory of God.<br>21<br>Now it is God who makes both us and you stand firm in Christ. He anointed us,<br>22<br>set his seal of ownership on us, and put his Spirit in our hearts as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.<br>23<br>I call God as my witness that it was in order to spare you that I did not return to Corinth.<br>24<br>Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, because it is by faith you stand firm.<br>2 Corinthians 2 :: New International Version (NIV)<br><br>1<br>So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you.<br>2<br>For if I grieve you, who is left to make me glad but you whom I have grieved?<br>3<br>I wrote as I did so that when I came I should not be distressed by those who ought to make me rejoice. I had confidence in all of you, that you would all share my joy.<br>4<br>For I wrote you out of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to grieve you but to let you know the depth of my love for you.<br>5<br>If anyone has caused grief, he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you, to some extent--not to put it too severely.<br>6<br>The punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient for him.<br>7<br>Now instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.<br>8<br>I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him.<br>9<br>The reason I wrote you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything.<br>10<br>If you forgive anyone, I also forgive him. And what I have forgiven--if there was anything to forgive--I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake,<br>11<br>in order that Satan might not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes.<br>12<br>Now when I went to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and found that the Lord had opened a door for me,<br>13<br>I still had no peace of mind, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said good-by to them and went on to Macedonia.<br>14<br>But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of him.<br>15<br>For we are to God the aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing.<br>16<br>To the one we are the smell of death; to the other, the fragrance of life. And who is equal to such a task?<br>17<br>Unlike so many, we do not peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, like men sent from God.<br><br>2 Corinthians 3<br>1<br>Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some people, letters of recommendation to you or from you?<br>2<br>You yourselves are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by everybody.<br>3<br>You show that you are a letter from Christ, the result of our ministry, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.<br>4<br>Such confidence as this is ours through Christ before God.<br>5<br>Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves, but our competence comes from God.<br>6<br>He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant--not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.<br>7<br>Now if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory, fading though it was,<br>8<br>will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious?<br>9<br>If the ministry that condemns men is glorious, how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness!<br>10<br>For what was glorious has no glory now in comparison with the surpassing glory.<br>11<br>And if what was fading away came with glory, how much greater is the glory of that which lasts!<br>12<br>Therefore, since we have such a hope, we are very bold.<br>13<br>We are not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face to keep the Israelites from gazing at it while the radiance was fading away.<br>14<br>But their minds were made dull, for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read. It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away.<br>15<br>Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts.<br>16<br>But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.<br>17<br>Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.<br>18<br>And we, who with unveiled faces all reflect [1] the Lord's glory, are being transformed into his likeness with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.<br><br>2 Corinthians 4<br>1<br>Therefore, since through God's mercy we have this ministry, we do not lose heart.<br>2<br>Rather, we have renounced secret and shameful ways; we do not use deception, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.<br>3<br>And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing.<br>4<br>The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.<br>5<br>For we do not preach ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake.<br>6<br>For God, who said, "Let light shine out of darkness," [1] made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.<br>7<br>But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.<br>8<br>We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair;<br>9<br>persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed.<br>10<br>We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.<br>11<br>For we who are alive are always being given over to death for Jesus' sake, so that his life may be revealed in our mortal body.<br>12<br>So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.<br>13<br>It is written: "I believed; therefore I have spoken." [2] With that same spirit of faith we also believe and therefore speak,<br>14<br>because we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead will also raise us with Jesus and present us with you in his presence.<br>15<br>All this is for your benefit, so that the grace that is reaching more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God.<br>16<br>Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day.<br>17<br>For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.<br>18<br>So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.<br><br>2 Corinthians 5<br>1<br>Now we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands.<br>2<br>Meanwhile we groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling,<br>3<br>because when we are clothed, we will not be found naked.<br>4<br>For while we are in this tent, we groan and are burdened, because we do not wish to be unclothed but to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.<br>5<br>Now it is God who has made us for this very purpose and has given us the Spirit as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.<br>6<br>Therefore we are always confident and know that as long as we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord.<br>7<br>We live by faith, not by sight.<br>8<br>We are confident, I say, and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord.<br>9<br>So we make it our goal to please him, whether we are at home in the body or away from it.<br>10<br>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive what is due him for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.<br>11<br>Since, then, we know what it is to fear the Lord, we try to persuade men. What we are is plain to God, and I hope it is also plain to your conscience.<br>12<br>We are not trying to commend ourselves to you again, but are giving you an opportunity to take pride in us, so that you can answer those who take pride in what is seen rather than in what is in the heart.<br>13<br>If we are out of our mind, it is for the sake of God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you.<br>14<br>For Christ's love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died.<br>15<br>And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again.<br>16<br>So from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view. Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer.<br>17<br>Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!<br>18<br>All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation:<br>19<br>that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting men's sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation.<br>20<br>We are therefore Christ's ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ's behalf: Be reconciled to God.<br>21<br>God made him who had no sin to be sin [1] for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.<br><br>2 Corinthians 6<br>1<br>As God's fellow workers we urge you not to receive God's grace in vain.<br>2<br>For he says, "In the time of my favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you." [1] I tell you, now is the time of God's favor, now is the day of salvation.<br>3<br>We put no stumbling block in anyone's path, so that our ministry will not be discredited.<br>4<br>Rather, as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: in great endurance; in troubles, hardships and distresses;<br>5<br>in beatings, imprisonments and riots; in hard work, sleepless nights and hunger;<br>6<br>in purity, understanding, patience and kindness; in the Holy Spirit and in sincere love;<br>7<br>in truthful speech and in the power of God; with weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left;<br>8<br>through glory and dishonor, bad report and good report; genuine, yet regarded as impostors;<br>9<br>known, yet regarded as unknown; dying, and yet we live on; beaten, and yet not killed;<br>10<br>sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; poor, yet making many rich; having nothing, and yet possessing everything.<br>11<br>We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians, and opened wide our hearts to you.<br>12<br>We are not withholding our affection from you, but you are withholding yours from us.<br>13<br>As a fair exchange--I speak as to my children--open wide your hearts also.<br>14<br>Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?<br>15<br>What harmony is there between Christ and Belial [2] ? What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever?<br>16<br>What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: "I will live with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people." [3]<br>17<br>"Therefore come out from them and be separate, says the Lord. Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you." [4]<br>18<br>"I will be a Father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty."<br><br>2 Corinthians 7<br>1<br>Since we have these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit, perfecting holiness out of reverence for God.<br>2<br>Make room for us in your hearts. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have exploited no one.<br>3<br>I do not say this to condemn you; I have said before that you have such a place in our hearts that we would live or die with you.<br>4<br>I have great confidence in you; I take great pride in you. I am greatly encouraged; in all our troubles my joy knows no bounds.<br>5<br>For when we came into Macedonia, this body of ours had no rest, but we were harassed at every turn--conflicts on the outside, fears within.<br>6<br>But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus,<br>7<br>and not only by his coming but also by the comfort you had given him. He told us about your longing for me, your deep sorrow, your ardent concern for me, so that my joy was greater than ever.<br>8<br>Even if I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it. Though I did regret it--I see that my letter hurt you, but only for a little while--<br>9<br>yet now I am happy, not because you were made sorry, but because your sorrow led you to repentance. For you became sorrowful as God intended and so were not harmed in any way by us.<br>10<br>Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death.<br>11<br>See what this godly sorrow has produced in you: what earnestness, what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what concern, what readiness to see justice done. At every point you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter.<br>12<br>So even though I wrote to you, it was not on account of the one who did the wrong or of the injured party, but rather that before God you could see for yourselves how devoted to us you are.<br>13<br>By all this we are encouraged. In addition to our own encouragement, we were especially delighted to see how happy Titus was, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you.<br>14<br>I had boasted to him about you, and you have not embarrassed me. But just as everything we said to you was true, so our boasting about you to Titus has proved to be true as well.<br>15<br>And his affection for you is all the greater when he remembers that you were all obedient, receiving him with fear and trembling.<br>16<br>I am glad I can have complete confidence in you.<br><br>2 Corinthians 8<br>1<br>And now, brothers, we want you to know about the grace that God has given the Macedonian churches.<br>2<br>Out of the most severe trial, their overflowing joy and their extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity.<br>3<br>For I testify that they gave as much as they were able, and even beyond their ability. Entirely on their own,<br>4<br>they urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the saints.<br>5<br>And they did not do as we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us in keeping with God's will.<br>6<br>So we urged Titus, since he had earlier made a beginning, to bring also to completion this act of grace on your part.<br>7<br>But just as you excel in everything--in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness and in your love for us [1] --see that you also excel in this grace of giving.<br>8<br>I am not commanding you, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others.<br>9<br>For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich.<br>10<br>And here is my advice about what is best for you in this matter: Last year you were the first not only to give but also to have the desire to do so.<br>11<br>Now finish the work, so that your eager willingness to do it may be matched by your completion of it, according to your means.<br>12<br>For if the willingness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what he does not have.<br>13<br>Our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard pressed, but that there might be equality.<br>14<br>At the present time your plenty will supply what they need, so that in turn their plenty will supply what you need. Then there will be equality,<br>15<br>as it is written: "He who gathered much did not have too much, and he who gathered little did not have too little." [2]<br>16<br>I thank God, who put into the heart of Titus the same concern I have for you.<br>17<br>For Titus not only welcomed our appeal, but he is coming to you with much enthusiasm and on his own initiative.<br>18<br>And we are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the churches for his service to the gospel.<br>19<br>What is more, he was chosen by the churches to accompany us as we carry the offering, which we administer in order to honor the Lord himself and to show our eagerness to help.<br>20<br>We want to avoid any criticism of the way we administer this liberal gift.<br>21<br>For we are taking pains to do what is right, not only in the eyes of the Lord but also in the eyes of men.<br>22<br>In addition, we are sending with them our brother who has often proved to us in many ways that he is zealous, and now even more so because of his great confidence in you.<br>23<br>As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker among you; as for our brothers, they are representatives of the churches and an honor to Christ.<br>24<br>Therefore show these men the proof of your love and the reason for our pride in you, so that the churches can see it.<br><br>2 Corinthians 10<br>1<br>By the meekness and gentleness of Christ, I appeal to you--I, Paul, who am "timid" when face to face with you, but "bold" when away!<br>2<br>I beg you that when I come I may not have to be as bold as I expect to be toward some people who think that we live by the standards of this world.<br>3<br>For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does.<br>4<br>The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds.<br>5<br>We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.<br>6<br>And we will be ready to punish every act of disobedience, once your obedience is complete.<br>7<br>You are looking only on the surface of things. [1] If anyone is confident that he belongs to Christ, he should consider again that we belong to Christ just as much as he.<br>8<br>For even if I boast somewhat freely about the authority the Lord gave us for building you up rather than pulling you down, I will not be ashamed of it.<br>9<br>I do not want to seem to be trying to frighten you with my letters.<br>10<br>For some say, "His letters are weighty and forceful, but in person he is unimpressive and his speaking amounts to nothing."<br>11<br>Such people should realize that what we are in our letters when we are absent, we will be in our actions when we are present.<br>12<br>We do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves. When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are not wise.<br>13<br>We, however, will not boast beyond proper limits, but will confine our boasting to the field God has assigned to us, a field that reaches even to you.<br>14<br>We are not going too far in our boasting, as would be the case if we had not come to you, for we did get as far as you with the gospel of Christ.<br>15<br>Neither do we go beyond our limits by boasting of work done by others. [2] Our hope is that, as your faith continues to grow, our area of activity among you will greatly expand,<br>16<br>so that we can preach the gospel in the regions beyond you. For we do not want to boast about work already done in another man's territory.<br>17<br>But, "Let him who boasts boast in the Lord." [3]<br>18<br>For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends.<br><br>2 Corinthians 11<br>1<br>I hope you will put up with a little of my foolishness; but you are already doing that.<br>2<br>I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy. I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might present you as a pure virgin to him.<br>3<br>But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent's cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ.<br>4<br>For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough.<br>5<br>But I do not think I am in the least inferior to those "super-apostles."<br>6<br>I may not be a trained speaker, but I do have knowledge. We have made this perfectly clear to you in every way.<br>7<br>Was it a sin for me to lower myself in order to elevate you by preaching the gospel of God to you free of charge?<br>8<br>I robbed other churches by receiving support from them so as to serve you.<br>9<br>And when I was with you and needed something, I was not a burden to anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied what I needed. I have kept myself from being a burden to you in any way, and will continue to do so.<br>10<br>As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, nobody in the regions of Achaia will stop this boasting of mine.<br>11<br>Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!<br>12<br>And I will keep on doing what I am doing in order to cut the ground from under those who want an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things they boast about.<br>13<br>For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, masquerading as apostles of Christ.<br>14<br>And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.<br>15<br>It is not surprising, then, if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve.<br>16<br>I repeat: Let no one take me for a fool. But if you do, then receive me just as you would a fool, so that I may do a little boasting.<br>17<br>In this self-confident boasting I am not talking as the Lord would, but as a fool.<br>18<br>Since many are boasting in the way the world does, I too will boast.<br>19<br>You gladly put up with fools since you are so wise!<br>20<br>In fact, you even put up with anyone who enslaves you or exploits you or takes advantage of you or pushes himself forward or slaps you in the face.<br>21<br>To my shame I admit that we were too weak for that! What anyone else dares to boast about--I am speaking as a fool--I also dare to boast about.<br>22<br>Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they Abraham's descendants? So am I.<br>23<br>Are they servants of Christ? (I am out of my mind to talk like this.) I am more. I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged more severely, and been exposed to death again and again.<br>24<br>Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one.<br>25<br>Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, I spent a night and a day in the open sea,<br>26<br>I have been constantly on the move. I have been in danger from rivers, in danger from bandits, in danger from my own countrymen, in danger from Gentiles; in danger in the city, in danger in the country, in danger at sea; and in danger from false brothers.<br>27<br>I have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep; I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food; I have been cold and naked.<br>28<br>Besides everything else, I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches.<br>29<br>Who is weak, and I do not feel weak? Who is led into sin, and I do not inwardly burn?<br>30<br>If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness.<br>31<br>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is to be praised forever, knows that I am not lying.<br>32<br>In Damascus the governor under King Aretas had the city of the Damascenes guarded in order to arrest me.<br>33<br>But I was lowered in a basket from a window in the wall and slipped through his hands.<br><br>2 Corinthians 12<br>1<br>I must go on boasting. Although there is nothing to be gained, I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord.<br>2<br>I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know--God knows.<br>3<br>And I know that this man--whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, but God knows--<br>4<br>was caught up to paradise. He heard inexpressible things, things that man is not permitted to tell.<br>5<br>I will boast about a man like that, but I will not boast about myself, except about my weaknesses.<br>6<br>Even if I should choose to boast, I would not be a fool, because I would be speaking the truth. But I refrain, so no one will think more of me than is warranted by what I do or say.<br>7<br>To keep me from becoming conceited because of these surpassingly great revelations, there was given me a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me.<br>8<br>Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me.<br>9<br>But he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me.<br>10<br>That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.<br>11<br>I have made a fool of myself, but you drove me to it. I ought to have been commended by you, for I am not in the least inferior to the "super-apostles," even though I am nothing.<br>12<br>The things that mark an apostle--signs, wonders and miracles--were done among you with great perseverance.<br>13<br>How were you inferior to the other churches, except that I was never a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong!<br>14<br>Now I am ready to visit you for the third time, and I will not be a burden to you, because what I want is not your possessions but you. After all, children should not have to save up for their parents, but parents for their children.<br>15<br>So I will very gladly spend for you everything I have and expend myself as well. If I love you more, will you love me less?<br>16<br>Be that as it may, I have not been a burden to you. Yet, crafty fellow that I am, I caught you by trickery!<br>17<br>Did I exploit you through any of the men I sent you?<br>18<br>I urged Titus to go to you and I sent our brother with him. Titus did not exploit you, did he? Did we not act in the same spirit and follow the same course?<br>19<br>Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you? We have been speaking in the sight of God as those in Christ; and everything we do, dear friends, is for your strengthening.<br>20<br>For I am afraid that when I come I may not find you as I want you to be, and you may not find me as you want me to be. I fear that there may be quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, gossip, arrogance and disorder.<br>21<br>I am afraid that when I come again my God will humble me before you, and I will be grieved over many who have sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity, sexual sin and debauchery in which they have indulged.<br><br>2 Corinthians 13<br>1<br>This will be my third visit to you. "Every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses." [1]<br>2<br>I already gave you a warning when I was with you the second time. I now repeat it while absent: On my return I will not spare those who sinned earlier or any of the others,<br>3<br>since you are demanding proof that Christ is speaking through me. He is not weak in dealing with you, but is powerful among you.<br>4<br>For to be sure, he was crucified in weakness, yet he lives by God's power. Likewise, we are weak in him, yet by God's power we will live with him to serve you.<br>5<br>Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in you--unless, of course, you fail the test?<br>6<br>And I trust that you will discover that we have not failed the test.<br>7<br>Now we pray to God that you will not do anything wrong. Not that people will see that we have stood the test but that you will do what is right even though we may seem to have failed.<br>8<br>For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.<br>9<br>We are glad whenever we are weak but you are strong; and our prayer is for your perfection.<br>10<br>This is why I write these things when I am absent, that when I come I may not have to be harsh in my use of authority--the authority the Lord gave me for building you up, not for tearing you down.<br>11<br>Finally, brothers, good-by. Aim for perfection, listen to my appeal, be of one mind, live in peace. And the God of love and peace will be with you.<br>12<br>Greet one another with a holy kiss.<br>13<br>All the saints send their greetings.<br>14<br>May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.<br><br>1 Corinthians 1<br>1<br>Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes,<br>2<br>To the church of God in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be holy, together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ--their Lord and ours:<br>3<br>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<br>4<br>I always thank God for you because of his grace given you in Christ Jesus.<br>5<br>For in him you have been enriched in every way--in all your speaking and in all your knowledge--<br>6<br>because our testimony about Christ was confirmed in you.<br>7<br>Therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed.<br>8<br>He will keep you strong to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>9<br>God, who has called you into fellowship with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, is faithful.<br>10<br>I appeal to you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another so that there may be no divisions among you and that you may be perfectly united in mind and thought.<br>11<br>My brothers, some from Chloe's household have informed me that there are quarrels among you.<br>12<br>What I mean is this: One of you says, "I follow Paul"; another, "I follow Apollos"; another, "I follow Cephas [1] "; still another, "I follow Christ."<br>13<br>Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized into [2] the name of Paul?<br>14<br>I am thankful that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,<br>15<br>so no one can say that you were baptized into my name.<br>16<br>(Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I don't remember if I baptized anyone else.)<br>17<br>For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel--not with words of human wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.<br>18<br>For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.<br>19<br>For it is written: "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate." [3]<br>20<br>Where is the wise man? Where is the scholar? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?<br>21<br>For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe.<br>22<br>Jews demand miraculous signs and Greeks look for wisdom,<br>23<br>but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles,<br>24<br>but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.<br>25<br>For the foolishness of God is wiser than man's wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than man's strength.<br>26<br>Brothers, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth.<br>27<br>But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong.<br>28<br>He chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things--and the things that are not--to nullify the things that are,<br>29<br>so that no one may boast before him.<br>30<br>It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God--that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption.<br>31<br>Therefore, as it is written: "Let him who boasts boast in the Lord."<br><br>1<br>When I came to you, brothers, I did not come with eloquence or superior wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God. [1]<br>2<br>For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.<br>3<br>I came to you in weakness and fear, and with much trembling.<br>4<br>My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirit's power,<br>5<br>so that your faith might not rest on men's wisdom, but on God's power.<br>6<br>We do, however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing.<br>7<br>No, we speak of God's secret wisdom, a wisdom that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began.<br>8<br>None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.<br>9<br>However, as it is written: "No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has conceived what God has prepared for those who love him" [2] --<br>10<br>but God has revealed it to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.<br>11<br>For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the man's spirit within him? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.<br>12<br>We have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand what God has freely given us.<br>13<br>This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words. [3]<br>14<br>The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.<br>15<br>The spiritual man makes judgments about all things, but he himself is not subject to any man's judgment:<br>16<br>"For who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him?" [4] But we have the mind of Christ.<br><br>1 Corinthians 3<br>1<br>Brothers, I could not address you as spiritual but as worldly--mere infants in Christ.<br>2<br>I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you are still not ready.<br>3<br>You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere men?<br>4<br>For when one says, "I follow Paul," and another, "I follow Apollos," are you not mere men?<br>5<br>What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe--as the Lord has assigned to each his task.<br>6<br>I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God made it grow.<br>7<br>So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow.<br>8<br>The man who plants and the man who waters have one purpose, and each will be rewarded according to his own labor.<br>9<br>For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's field, God's building.<br>10<br>By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as an expert builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should be careful how he builds.<br>11<br>For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ.<br>12<br>If any man builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw,<br>13<br>his work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each man's work.<br>14<br>If what he has built survives, he will receive his reward.<br>15<br>If it is burned up, he will suffer loss; he himself will be saved, but only as one escaping through the flames.<br>16<br>Don't you know that you yourselves are God's temple and that God's Spirit lives in you?<br>17<br>If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him; for God's temple is sacred, and you are that temple.<br>18<br>Do not deceive yourselves. If any one of you thinks he is wise by the standards of this age, he should become a "fool" so that he may become wise.<br>19<br>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God's sight. As it is written: "He catches the wise in their craftiness" [1] ;<br>20<br>and again, "The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile." [2]<br>21<br>So then, no more boasting about men! All things are yours,<br>22<br>whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas [3] or the world or life or death or the present or the future--all are yours,<br>23<br>and you are of Christ, and Christ is of God.<br><br>1 Corinthians 4<br>1<br>So then, men ought to regard us as servants of Christ and as those entrusted with the secret things of God.<br>2<br>Now it is required that those who have been given a trust must prove faithful.<br>3<br>I care very little if I am judged by you or by any human court; indeed, I do not even judge myself.<br>4<br>My conscience is clear, but that does not make me innocent. It is the Lord who judges me.<br>5<br>Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time; wait till the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of men's hearts. At that time each will receive his praise from God.<br>6<br>Now, brothers, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that you may learn from us the meaning of the saying, "Do not go beyond what is written." Then you will not take pride in one man over against another.<br>7<br>For who makes you different from anyone else? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not?<br>8<br>Already you have all you want! Already you have become rich! You have become kings--and that without us! How I wish that you really had become kings so that we might be kings with you!<br>9<br>For it seems to me that God has put us apostles on display at the end of the procession, like men condemned to die in the arena. We have been made a spectacle to the whole universe, to angels as well as to men.<br>10<br>We are fools for Christ, but you are so wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are honored, we are dishonored!<br>11<br>To this very hour we go hungry and thirsty, we are in rags, we are brutally treated, we are homeless.<br>12<br>We work hard with our own hands. When we are cursed, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure it;<br>13<br>when we are slandered, we answer kindly. Up to this moment we have become the scum of the earth, the refuse of the world.<br>14<br>I am not writing this to shame you, but to warn you, as my dear children.<br>15<br>Even though you have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.<br>16<br>Therefore I urge you to imitate me.<br>17<br>For this reason I am sending to you Timothy, my son whom I love, who is faithful in the Lord. He will remind you of my way of life in Christ Jesus, which agrees with what I teach everywhere in every church.<br>18<br>Some of you have become arrogant, as if I were not coming to you.<br>19<br>But I will come to you very soon, if the Lord is willing, and then I will find out not only how these arrogant people are talking, but what power they have.<br>20<br>For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power.<br>21<br>What do you prefer? Shall I come to you with a whip, or in love and with a gentle spirit?<br><br>1 Corinthians 5<br>1<br>It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that does not occur even among pagans: A man has his father's wife.<br>2<br>And you are proud! Shouldn't you rather have been filled with grief and have put out of your fellowship the man who did this?<br>3<br>Even though I am not physically present, I am with you in spirit. And I have already passed judgment on the one who did this, just as if I were present.<br>4<br>When you are assembled in the name of our Lord Jesus and I am with you in spirit, and the power of our Lord Jesus is present,<br>5<br>hand this man over to Satan, so that the sinful nature [1] may be destroyed and his spirit saved on the day of the Lord.<br>6<br>Your boasting is not good. Don't you know that a little yeast works through the whole batch of dough?<br>7<br>Get rid of the old yeast that you may be a new batch without yeast--as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.<br>8<br>Therefore let us keep the Festival, not with the old yeast, the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with bread without yeast, the bread of sincerity and truth.<br>9<br>I have written you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people--<br>10<br>not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world.<br>11<br>But now I am writing you that you must not associate with anyone who calls himself a brother but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or a slanderer, a drunkard or a swindler. With such a man do not even eat.<br>12<br>What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside?<br>13<br>God will judge those outside. "Expel the wicked man from among you."<br><br>1 Corinthians 6<br>1<br>If any of you has a dispute with another, dare he take it before the ungodly for judgment instead of before the saints?<br>2<br>Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if you are to judge the world, are you not competent to judge trivial cases?<br>3<br>Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more the things of this life!<br>4<br>Therefore, if you have disputes about such matters, appoint as judges even men of little account in the church! [1]<br>5<br>I say this to shame you. Is it possible that there is nobody among you wise enough to judge a dispute between believers?<br>6<br>But instead, one brother goes to law against another--and this in front of unbelievers!<br>7<br>The very fact that you have lawsuits among you means you have been completely defeated already. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated?<br>8<br>Instead, you yourselves cheat and do wrong, and you do this to your brothers.<br>9<br>Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders<br>10<br>nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.<br>11<br>And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.<br>12<br>"Everything is permissible for me"--but not everything is beneficial. "Everything is permissible for me"--but I will not be mastered by anything.<br>13<br>"Food for the stomach and the stomach for food"--but God will destroy them both. The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.<br>14<br>By his power God raised the Lord from the dead, and he will raise us also.<br>15<br>Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ himself? Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute? Never!<br>16<br>Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The two will become one flesh." [2]<br>17<br>But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with him in spirit.<br>18<br>Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body.<br>19<br>Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own;<br>20<br>you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your body.<br><br>1 Corinthians 7<br>1<br>Now for the matters you wrote about: It is good for a man not to marry. [1]<br>2<br>But since there is so much immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband.<br>3<br>The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband.<br>4<br>The wife's body does not belong to her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not belong to him alone but also to his wife.<br>5<br>Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.<br>6<br>I say this as a concession, not as a command.<br>7<br>I wish that all men were as I am. But each man has his own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that.<br>8<br>Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I am.<br>9<br>But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.<br>10<br>To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband.<br>11<br>But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife.<br>12<br>To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her.<br>13<br>And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him.<br>14<br>For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy.<br>15<br>But if the unbeliever leaves, let him do so. A believing man or woman is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace.<br>16<br>How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or, how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?<br>17<br>Nevertheless, each one should retain the place in life that the Lord assigned to him and to which God has called him. This is the rule I lay down in all the churches.<br>18<br>Was a man already ci</div>

I am just plain lame.<br><br>------------------<br><strong>Genesis 1</strong><br><br>1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. 3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. 4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. 5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. 6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. 7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. 8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day. 9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so. 10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the wate rs called he Seas: and God saw that it was good. 11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. 12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good. 13 And the evening and the morning were the third day. 14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: 15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. 16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. 17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, 18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good. 19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. 20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. 21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good. 22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. 23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. 24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so. 25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good. 26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. 27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. 28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. 29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. 30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so. 31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.<br><br><strong>Genesis 2</strong><br><br>1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. 2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. 3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made. 4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens, 5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground. 6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. 7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. 8 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed. 9 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. 10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads. 11 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; 12 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone. 13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia. 14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates. 15 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. 16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: 17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. 18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him. 19 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof. 20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him. 21 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; 22 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man. 23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. 24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. 25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.<br><br><strong>Genesis 3</strong><br><br>1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? 2 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: 3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. 4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: 5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. 6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. 7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. 8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden. 9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? 10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself. 11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? 12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. 13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. 14 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: 15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. 16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. 17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; 18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; 19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. 20 And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living. 21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them. 22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: 23 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. 24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.<br><br><strong>Genesis 4</strong><br><br>1 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD. 2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. 3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD. 4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering: 5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. 6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? 7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him. 8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him. 9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper? 10 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground. 11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand; 12 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth. 13 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear. 14 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me. 15 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him. 16 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden. 17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch. 18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech. 19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. 20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle. 21 And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ. 22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah. 23 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt. 24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold. 25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew. 26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.<br><br><strong>Genesis 5</strong><br><br>1 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him; 2 Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created. 3 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, and after his image; and called his name Seth: 4 And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters: 5 And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died. 6 And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos: 7 And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters: 8 And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died. 9 And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan: 10 And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters: 11 And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he died. 12 And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel: 13 And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters: 14 And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died. 15 And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared: 16 And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters: 17 And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died. 18 And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch: 19 And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters: 20 And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died. 21 And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah: 22 And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters: 23 And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years: 24 And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him. 25 And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech. 26 And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters: 27 And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died. 28 And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son: 29 And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed. 30 And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters: 31 And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died. 32 And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.<br><br><strong>Genesis 6</strong><br><br>1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, 2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. 3 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years. 4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown. 5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. 6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart. 7 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them. 8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD. 9 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God. 10 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 11 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. 12 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth. 13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth. 14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. 15 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. 16 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it. 17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die. 18 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee. 19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female. 20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive. 21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them. 22 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.<br><br><strong>Genesis 7</strong><br><br>1 And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation. 2 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female. 3 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth. 4 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth. 5 And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him. 6 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth. 7 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood. 8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, 9 There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah. 10 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth. 11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. 12 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights. 13 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark; 14 They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort. 15 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life. 16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in. 17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth. 18 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters. 19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered. 20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered. 21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man: 22 All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died. 23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark. 24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.<br><br><strong>Genesis 8</strong><br><br>1 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged; 2 The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained; 3 And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated. 4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. 5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen. 6 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made: 7 And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. 8 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground; 9 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark. 10 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; 11 And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth. 12 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more. 13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry. 14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried. 15 And God spake unto Noah, saying, 16 Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee. 17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth. 18 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him: 19 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark. 20 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. 21 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done. 22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.<br><br><strong>Genesis 9</strong><br><br>1 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth. 2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered. 3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things. 4 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. 5 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man. 6 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man. 7 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein. 8 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, 9 And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you; 10 And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth. 11 And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth. 12 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: 13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. 14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: 15 And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. 16 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. 17 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth. 18 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan. 19 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread. 20 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard: 21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. 22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. 23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness. 24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him. 25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. 26 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. 27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. 28 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years. 29 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.<br><br><strong>Quotes from FOS (no, it's not full of shit)<br>I love gloating.
