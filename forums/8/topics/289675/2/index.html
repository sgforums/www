Drugs like ecstacy, marijuana, lsd have an almost zero addiction potential. Crack, dope, etc. can get more addictive but then again probably not much more than cigarettes. I know people who've done drugs for a long time and never gotten addicted and some who've even stopped cold turkey with no trouble at all. Most people who do drugs don't get addicted at all, only a minority do. So don't say stupid things like asking me to prove to you that you can quit drugs anytime.</div>
