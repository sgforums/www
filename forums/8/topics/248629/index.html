            <div class='col-md body'>Hi people, if you see this message I would have been dead. I am a tiger prawn. I was breed in a farm together with my peers before I was sold at the wholesale market.<br><br>With my peers, we were scooped up one find day, and transported to a steamboat restaurant (somewhere in the east of Singapore) where we were then released into a big tank.<br><br>Day by day, I watched my peers leave the tank. I knew exactly what happened to each of them. I saw with my own eyes, a fate that will soon befall me. I watched it happened everyday, but there's absolutely nothing I can do about it. I am just a prawn in a tank of prawns and there's no way to escape.<br><br>Every time a customer order live prawns, I watch some of my mates get scooped out from the tank, a satay stick poked through the end of its tail, extending all away into its head. It was painful, but prawns don't scream. Worst, we don't die instantly, we were left on a plate squirming from the pain, suffocating without water. If we were lucky, pain will go away in 20 minutes as we lay helpless, suffocating and squirming.<br><br>The unlucky ones will get dropped into a pot of boiling water. Then we feel the excruciating pain from the skewer that runs from our tail all the way into our head, suffocating from the lack of water and the intense burning sensation from being dropped into a pot of hot soup.<br><br>Perhaps it was an ingenious way of making sure the customer always taste the freshest prawn. Its probably good money. Customers love fresh seafood. But before you ever eat anything like this, imagine that it was you on the skewer, dropped into a pot of boiling water.<br><br>Oh yes, prawns, fishes and lobsters are cold blooded creature and many argue that cold blooded creatures do not feel the pain so its ok. Just because prawns are cold blooded creatures doesn't mean as humans, you have to be cold blooded killers as well.<br><br>The next time if you see anything like this, please send the correct message to the owners of the resturant by NOT eating seafood killed cruelly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi people,<br><br>by the time you read this message i'm probably be someway in your large intestine. I'm a stalk of xiao bai chai. I was grown in a farm up north.<br><br>We were planted into tilled soil up in the highlands with thousand of other seeds.  Everyday, humans will water me and i make alot of food under the sun!<br>Wah i grow very fast (i think it's in my genes) and turn green and leafy. That's when the nightmare started.<br><br>Everyday in addition to water, the humans will spray pesticide on me. I can hardly breathe with all the toxic chemicals.  The soil is laden with chemical fertilsers and the nearby river is polluted by chemical runoff.<br><br>Occasionally, some slow growth and sick friends got taken away, they barely whimpered. I heard they got buried into new plantations *shudder*<br><br>One day the plot of kailan next to us was a hive of activity.  However, it was horrible.  We heard screams as we saw these neighbours get ripped out of the ground.  They were all crying out in pain. Most went into shock and then went quiet.  I saw them get rinsed in a container of water and throw into a plastic bag on a weighing machine.<br><br>The lucky ones died quickly.  Those who were you can see them slow dying in the heat, wilting under the hot sun. It was pure torture.<br><br>Sad to say we were next. I was uprooted forcefully, my roots were left torn in the soil i was in since the day i grew from a seedling.  I was dunked and "package".  Sway thing is i was packed into a dark container with hundreds of my sibilings in a crowded stiffling container.<br><br>Next time i know, i was in a bright aircon place lying over my friends.  We stare blankly as humans picked and abused us...throwing those that they dont like.  My 3 brothers and i was brought to another weird place from a trip in a plastic bag.<br><br>We were dunk again in water...then thrown whole into a round tin container of boiling water filled with noodles and yong tau hoo.  I heard some suffered more because they got thrown into scalding hot oil in garlic and shallots.  Oh how they scream in agony!<br><br>Hello, i'm Fibre.</div>

I am a tiger prawn. I was breed in a farm together with my peers before I was sold at the wholesale market.<br><br>With my peers, we were scooped up one find day, and transported to a steamboat restaurant (somewhere in the east of Singapore) where we were then released into a big tank.<br><br>Day by day, I watched my peers leave the tank. I knew exactly what happened to each of them. I saw with my own eyes, a fate that will soon befall me. I watched it happened everyday, but there's absolutely nothing I can do about it. I am just a prawn in a tank of prawns and there's no way to escape.<br><br>Every time a customer order live prawns, I watch some of my mates get scooped out from the tank, a satay stick poked through the end of its tail, extending all away into its head. It was painful, but prawns don't scream. Worst, we don't die instantly, we were left on a plate squirming from the pain, suffocating without water. If we were lucky, pain will go away in 20 minutes as we lay helpless, suffocating and squirming.<br><br>The unlucky ones will get dropped into a pot of boiling water. Then we feel the excruciating pain from the skewer that runs from our tail all the way into our head, suffocating from the lack of water and the intense burning sensation from being dropped into a pot of hot soup.<br><br>Perhaps it was an ingenious way of making sure the customer always taste the freshest prawn. Its probably good money. Customers love fresh seafood. But before you ever eat anything like this, imagine that it was you on the skewer, dropped into a pot of boiling water.<br><br>Oh yes, prawns, fishes and lobsters are cold blooded creature and many argue that cold blooded creatures do not feel the pain so its ok. Just because prawns are cold blooded creatures doesn't mean as humans, you have to be cold blooded killers as well.<br><br>The next time if you see anything like this, please send the correct message to the owners of the resturant by NOT eating seafood killed cruelly.</div></blockquote>Ehheh if you wan more people to comment and post here you must change your title to "STOP KILLING PRAWNS YOU BASTARDS!" You see my last thread so successful.</div>

Some scientists claim that prawns, lobsters and other spineless invertebrates such as hum, oysters etc. don't have the capacity to feel pain because their brains are just too small and due to the very little nerves and these nerves do not lead to the brain.<br><br>But still.... why be so cruel. You can simply leave the prawns out in the open and soon they will die. Or maybe you can freeze them in the freezer? Why skewer them and boil them alive?</div>

Its ok if the animals die a quick death, but to torture them so that you can have them "fresher" or "tastier" is really just wrong.<br><br>The only way to stop restaurants and food stores acting so cruelly is to stop buying food cooked in this way.</div>
