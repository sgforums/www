I knew exactly what happened to each of them. I saw with my own eyes, a fate that will soon befall me. I watched it happened everyday, but there's absolutely nothing I can do about it. I am just a prawn in a tank of prawns and there's no way to escape.<br><br>Every time a customer order live prawns, I watch some of my mates get scooped out from the tank, a satay stick poked through the end of its tail, extending all away into its head. It was painful, but prawns don't scream. Worst, we don't die instantly, we were left on a plate squirming from the pain, suffocating without water. If we were lucky, pain will go away in 20 minutes as we lay helpless, suffocating and squirming.<br><br>The unlucky ones will get dropped into a pot of boiling water. Then we feel the excruciating pain from the skewer that runs from our tail all the way into our head, suffocating from the lack of water and the intense burning sensation from being dropped into a pot of hot soup.<br><br>Perhaps it was an ingenious way of making sure the customer always taste the freshest prawn. Its probably good money. Customers love fresh seafood. But before you ever eat anything like this, imagine that it was you on the skewer, dropped into a pot of boiling water.<br><br>Oh yes, prawns, fishes and lobsters are cold blooded creature and many argue that cold blooded creatures do not feel the pain so its ok. Just because prawns are cold blooded creatures doesn't mean as humans, you have to be cold blooded killers as well.<br><br>The next time if you see anything like this, please send the correct message to the owners of the resturant by NOT eating seafood killed cruelly.</div></blockquote>Damn, after reading this u made me hungry for more seafood tonight!</div>
