                  HIS hurry to catch a flight at Changi Airport's Budget Terminal
                  yesterday morning, retiree Ang Heng Soon, 61, grabbed the wrong
                  passport and left home.
              <p>He took his 39-year-old son's passport. They had left their
                  passports on the dining table, because the son was also flying from
                  Changi Airport.</p>
              <p>The father's mistake, and how he cleared all security checks at the airport and flew to Vietnam, led to a long day for both.</p>
              <p>Even with the wrong passport, Mr Ang first checked in at the
                  Tiger Airways counter for his flight to Ho Chi Minh City, where he was
                  headed for a six-day holiday.</p>
              <p>He next got past the security check by Certis Cisco officers at the entrance to the restricted passenger area.</p>
              <p>Then he ran into problems, failing repeatedly to scan his fingerprint at the immigration Automated Clearance System.</p>
              <p>Noticing his difficulty, an Immigration and Checkpoints Authority officer directed him to a lane for manual clearance.</p>
              <p>There, an officer cleared him to leave Singapore, and he boarded his plane.</p>
              <p>Mr Ang told The Straits Times he realised his mistake only during the flight.</p>
              <p>As soon as he arrived at the Ho Chi Minh City airport at 8.15am,
                  he owned up to immigration authorities there and they put him on the
                  same plane back to Singapore.</p>
              <p>Around that time at Changi Airport's Terminal 1, his son
                  Vincent, an electronics company sales and marketing executive, also
                  discovered the mix-up.</p>
              <p>He was waiting to check in for his flight to Hong Kong when he realised that he had his father's passport.</p>
              <p>He cancelled his flight and went to Tiger Airways' office in the
                  Budget Terminal, where he learnt that his father was heading back.</p>
              <p>Father and son were reunited at close to noon. Both made fresh
                  arrangements and flew off to their respective destinations later in the
                  day, correct passports in hand.</p>
              <p>By then, it was too late for Mr Vincent Ang to make it to his business meeting in Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>Speaking to The Straits Times before catching his flight, he
                  said: 'The question is, how did this happen? From a security point of
                  view, this is pretty shocking.'</p>
              <p>Responding to queries from The Straits Times, the Immigration
                  and Checkpoints Authority confirmed that Mr Ang had cleared all the
                  checks at the airport despite showing his son's passport.</p>
              <p>In a statement late last night, it said that the immigration
                  officer who looked at his passport and did the 'face-to-face
                  verification' let him through because he bore a resemblance to the
                  photo in the passport.</p>
              <p>'The officer should not have relied only on this but should
                  have checked Mr Ang's boarding pass with his passport,' a spokesman
                  said.</p>
              <p>'He should also have conducted a secondary biometric check to
                  ascertain Mr Ang's identity. The fingerprint scans would have led to
                  the positive identification of Mr Ang and that he was holding his son's
                  passport.'</p>
              <p>The spokesman apologised to Mr Ang for the inconvenience caused and said: 'ICA takes a serious view of such lapses.</p>
              <p>'We will conduct a thorough investigation into the case.
                  Appropriate disciplinary action will be taken against the officers
                  responsible for the lapses.'</p>
