A man appeared, I could have kept her but I din try hard. Somehow think about my ex, actually quite glad I have broken up with her, but can't understand why she ends up with a dun-noe-how-to-say man. Quite affected as this reflect badly on her taste. Anyway should not think about the past, no point crying over torn shirt. Concentrate on wad will happen.<br><br>Okay in my mind, i got H, P, S . Somehow I was quite an attractive man who sometimes attract good girls, but hate myself being proud and refused to make the first move. Hate myself not giving girls a chance. Can't I recall those lonely evenings when I wish it was spend with someone else. If i can try to accept those girls who like me, life need not be so miserable. I am going to learn dancing again, to know more girls, I a also going to give myself a chance to know P, H better.<br><br>S is what I always wanted but so many thing happened. If she was not meant eventually for me, why must I spend so much time.<br><br>A is gone. I was too emotional. I should always put up my characterisic as a grown up man. I had done my best, wad's hapened , has happened. If i can't have it, I dun want it.<br><br>Why must I spend so much time on things that will not happen. Why must I put priority on those who are non-responsive. If they dun give chance to this relationships even before it can start, I can see why they are the one for me eventually. They are just too naive for me.<br><br>Relationship is meant to complete the life of each other and make each other better and not to make each other more miserable. If I feel miserable before it can start, then she is not the one for me. Going after her is simply not worth it.<br><br>Same to me, if I disqualify a girl even before knowng her better, it also shows i have not matured. Give chance to others, generosity gives happiness. Every girl is meant to be beautiful, it is only whether you want to know further to see her beauty. Explore more to be fair. Life might be better if I go with people who already fallen in love with me.<br><br>Be the man, lead the way to happiness. Make both individual happy with just a little pain at the start of the way. Make her wish my wish. Lift all her sorrows. Her heart will never be empty for I will be her inspiration.Make her the happiest woman , make eveyone jealous of her. Make fairy tales. I can be your knight prince on black dragon wearing the golden armour. Why afraid to show when you have something great to offer.<br><br>Those who are not externally beautiful may be the person with excellent personality. I am not going to get Miss Universe as my gf. Those who sell themselves too high, I simply dun buy. Your orange is too expensive, I will not buy. Relationships means 2 individual spending time happily, looks is not so important eventually.<br><br>I open my heart to you, please show me wad to do. If you help me start again, you will be sure that I will be with you right till to the end.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hehe, it is me .. well, I am confident i am attractive (maybe others dun think so, its okay) I can attract many girls but there is also many girls I cannot get.<br><br>N is another girl. My ex really gotten with a dun-noe-how-to-say man, many ppl say so.<br><br>Sometimes the same girl is pretty and I am attracted to her, but the other time she is less attractive, I feel so normal. I dun want to be so superficial but this is how I feel. I guess falling in love is to get through this physical beauty thing and like her wadever she looks.<br><br>I am a attractive but arrogant man. To somebody I am helpless. It is okay, must importantly it is how you see yourself. I learn a lot from all these. Maybe falling in love is al about improving yourself, it involves so many areas in your life.<br><br>It is a game of emotions, if you can't take it and your are impulsive , you can be out of the game.</div>
