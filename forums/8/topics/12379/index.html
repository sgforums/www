            <div class='col-md body'>SORRY people, this is actually ORIGINALLY POSTED by DEXTER in another forum. But I think this article DESERVES a place here. I don't know HOW TRUE the origin of this letter is, but I guess it still makes pretty much SENSES to me?<br>THANKS if you bother to read this...<br><br>To my friends,<br>I've been hearing a lot of talk about "bombing Afghanistan back<br>to the Stone Age." Ronn Owens, on KGO Talk Radio today, allowed<br>that this would mean killing innocent people, people who had nothing<br>to do with this atrocity, but "we're at war, we have to accept<br>collateral damage. What else can we do?" Minutes later I heard<br>some TV pundit discussing whether we "have the belly to do what<br>must be done."<br><br>And I thought about the issues being raised especially hard because I<br>am from Afghanistan, and even though I've lived here for 35 years<br>I've never lost track of what's going on there. So I want to tell<br>anyone who will listen how it all looks from where I'm standing. I<br>speak as one who hates the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden. There is no<br>doubt in my mind that these people were responsible for the atrocity<br>in New York. I agree that something must be done about those<br>monsters. But the Taliban and Ben Laden are not Afghanistan. They're<br>not even the government of Afghanistan. The Taliban are a cult of<br>ignorant psychotics who took over Afghanistan in 1997.<br><br>Bin Laden is a political criminal with a plan. When you think<br>Taliban, think Nazis. When you think Bin Laden, think Hitler. And<br>when you think "the people of Afghanistan" think "the<br>Jews in the concentration camps." It's not only that the Afghan<br>people had nothing to do with this atrocity. They were the first<br>victims of the perpetrators. They would exult if someone would come<br>in there, take out the Taliban and clear out the rats nest of<br>international thugs holed up in their country. Some say, why don't<br>the Afghans rise up and overthrow the Taliban? The answer is, they're<br>starved, exhausted, hurt, incapacitated, suffering.<br><br>A few years ago, the United Nations estimated that there are 500,000<br>disabled orphans in Afghanistan-a country with no economy, no food.<br>There are millions of widows. And the Taliban has been burying these<br>widows alive in mass graves. The soil is littered with land mines,<br>the farms were all destroyed by the Soviets. These are a few of the<br>reasons why the Afghan people have not overthrown the Taliban.<br><br>We come now to the question of bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone<br>Age. Trouble is, that's been done. The Soviets took care of it<br>already. Make the Afghans suffer? They're already suffering. Level<br>their houses? Done. Turn their schools into piles of rubble? Done.<br>Eradicate their hospitals? Done. Destroy their infrastructure? Cut<br>them off from medicine and health care? Too late. Someone already did<br>all that. New bombs would only stir the rubble of earlier bombs.<br>Would they at least get the Taliban? Not likely.<br><br>In today's Afghanistan, only the Taliban eat, only they have the<br>means to move around. They'd slip away and hide. Maybe the bombs<br>would get some of those disabled orphans, they don't move too fast,<br>they don't even have wheelchairs. But flying over Kabul and dropping<br>bombs wouldn't really be a strike against the criminals who did this<br>horrific thing. Actually it would only be making common cause with<br>the Taliban-by raping once again the people they've been raping all<br>this time. So what else is there? What can be done, then?<br><br>Let me now speak with true fear and trembling. The only way to get<br>Bin Laden is to go in there with ground troops. When people speak of<br>"having the belly to do what needs to be done" they're<br>thinking in terms of having the belly to kill as many as needed.<br>Having the belly to overcome any moral qualms about killing innocent<br>people. Let's pull our heads out of the sand. What's actually on the<br>table is Americans dying. And not just because some Americans would<br>die fighting their way through Afghanistan to Bin Laden's hideout.<br>It's much bigger than that folks. Because to get any troops to<br>Afghanistan, we'd have to go through Pakistan. Would they let us? Not<br>likely. The conquest of Pakistan would have to be first. Will other<br>Muslim nations just stand by? You see where I'm going.<br><br>We're flirting with a world war between Islam and the West. And guess<br>what: that's Bin Laden's program. That's exactly what he wants.<br>That's why he did this. Read his speeches and statements. It's all<br>right there. He really believes Islam would beat the west. It might<br>seem ridiculous, but he figures if he can polarize the world into<br>Islam and the West, he's got a billion soldiers. If the west wreaks a<br>holocaust in those lands, that's a billion people with nothing left<br>to lose, that's even better from Bin Laden's point of view. He's<br>probably wrong, in the end the west would win, whatever that would<br>mean, but the war would last for years and millions would die, not<br>just theirs but ours.<br><br>Who has the belly for that? Bin Laden does. Anyone else?<br><br>Tamim Ansary<br><br>I wonder why US didnt help the Afghanistans against the Taliban when thousands of them were killed. Maybe American lives are more equal than Afghanistans lives.<br><br>------------------<br>In LIGHT I shall FEAR NOT. FOR what I AM is CUT so DEEP inside of ME.<br>I LIVE my FLESH and SOUL ONLY to BLEED for the OTHERS.<br>FEAR ME NOT. FOR I AM YOUR 'MASTER'. GIVE YOU STRENGTH. FOR YOU ARE MY 'ENEMY'.<br>DEVIL PHRASE I<br><br>I have no 'friends' nor 'family'.<br>I hold no past and see not future...<br>These are just samples of illusions....<br>I don't exist, but I shall live ETERNITY.....

            <div class='col-md body'>The Muslims in MiddleEast are trying to stand together to fight a "Holy WaR" against the West ,which perhaps in their view, representing Christianity. And for the many Americans, it's a war aginst the Evil.<br><br>However, I dont think it's a war fighting for 'any' God. Neither is it a war of good against evil.<br>War is a sin which God is against. <strong>These people are just fighting a war using religion as an excuse.</strong></div>
