I sorta agreed with you 2 posts back <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br>Maybe I was a bit unclear in my prev post. apologies.<br><br>I don't find that it is a draw back to look after parents... afterall, they are the very ones who provided us food/shelter when  no one else could be bothered to even take a second look. I mean seriously, who wants to raise an orphan when they can have their own? Maybe some angels out there, but no. this is reality. good ending stories are scarce.<br><br>anyway, what i said about pursuing own happiness is not about marriage. I was actually referring to happiness itself. If you happen to date a fantastic mate (guy /girl/it I don't care), and you hold yourself back because of parents.. thats kinda sad.<br><br>Because if your mate loves you, he/she/it will be able to understand and accomodate you... Get what I'm trying to say?<br><br>Perhaps my perspective is wierd and to me , you are adopting a closed door policy and.... well... you might just miss out on some good things in life.<br><br>I am rather similiar with your situation, in certain aspects, and I do forsee that in the future my parents will not havethe sort of income they do now.  Infact, I have a bunch of young siblings to care for when they grow up and my parents retired.<br><br>Thats how things goes. ya? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> life is never fair, but don't make it any less fair for yourself.
