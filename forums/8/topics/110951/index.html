Not every woman gets a cramp or wants to have babies. If you are stereo-typing that girls are 'forced' to have cramps and give birth. Then you are as guilty as foxwalk. Open your eyes and mind and look around you. Given a choice, women won't give birth nor want cramps.  Thats why some women removes wombs, take hormone pills and don't want children! IT IS A d@mn CHOICE!<br><br>Accusing someone as having inferiority complex is as good as trying to justify your own complex by saying cramps and birth is 'mightier than thou'.<br><br>Try doing NS,RT,ICT and reservist sometime, on top of that, deal with people who have mood swings, PMS and people who think they are right 'just because they are female'.<br><br>I seriously think you should re-think your opinions and have them filtered before spewing it around..</div>
