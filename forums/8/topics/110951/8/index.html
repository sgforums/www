            <div class='col-md body'>Dec 5, 2004<br>Bedroom blues<br><br>Marriages break down due to different opinions on sex and parenthood<br>By Li Xueying<br><br>SEX, to graduate student Joyce Tang, is not all it's cracked up to be. <span style="color: red;">After just one year of marriage to her IT engineer husband, she's bored, she said.</span><br><br>According to a Sunday Times survey, just 65 per cent of women, compared to 72 per cent of men, described their sex life with their spouse as 'good'. Also, 67 per cent of women rated their husbands' lovemaking skills as 'good', while 76 per cent of men said the same of their wives.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Evidently, Singaporean couples may share the same bed but not the same views on sex.</span><br><br>Experts such as Dr Wei Siang Yu, Singapore's self-styled Dr Love, said men are more self-absorbed, neglecting the needs of their partners.<br><br>The difference in opinions extend to parenthood.<br><br><span style="color: red;">More than 30 per cent of the husbands want three or more kids, compared to just 18 per cent of the women.</span><br><br>This could become a source of marital discord.<br><br>Administrative manager Anne Tan, 33, divorced her pilot husband two years ago after four years of marriage, partly because he didn't want any children.<br><br>Coincidentally, her new fiance, Mr B. Tan, 34, a sales manager, also divorced his engineer wife of six years for the same reason recently.<br><br>'She was very focused on her career, very ambitious,' said Ms Tan. So when she and Mr Tan met, they 'could understand each other'. They are tying the knot next month.<br><br>Psychiatrists say that they see patients whose marriages are in trouble due to differences in opinions about parenthood and sex.<br><br>And one key reason is the lack of communication before marriage, leaving issues unresolved. Said Dr Adrian Wang from the Institute of Mental Health: 'One common complaint from the women is that all the household duties lie with them, while it's very easy for the men to say they want three kids.'<br><br>On the flip side, the decision not to have children may lead to problems later in the marriage.<br><br>Psychiatrist Brian Yeo said: 'Without children, there is not much glue in the marriage. There is nothing to hold the couples back from drifting apart, especially when men develop a roving eye. In fact, some will tell their wives that it was their fault they didn't want children and so they can't be blamed for finding mistresses!'<br><br>But this does not faze Ms Elaine Koh, 29, a corporate communications officer. She and her husband, Mr Kuek Hai Leng, 31, who works in advertising, have been married for three years.<br><br>'My husband thinks that he can convince me in five years that I'd be ready for children. But I don't think I would change.<span style="color: red;"> If I have kids, I'd be taking away money that I could have given to my parents or spent on myself.</span><br><br>'My husband will satisfy my emotional needs... I've told him I'll get a puppy and teach it how to say 'Daddy'.'<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Give me a woman like her anytime<br>FOREIGN BRIDE FOR THIS S'POREAN PROFESSIONAL<br><br>HE'S a young, well-groomed yuppie, looking to fill a gaping void in his life.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Aged 36 and with a comfortable salary of $4,000 a month, Mr Matthew Chan is in the prime of life. But he's still single. </span><br><br>Not for long, though.<br><br>The bank officer has signed up with matchmaking agency Mr Cupid International Matchmakers to find himself a bride.<br><br>A Cambodian woman might just be the right one for him.<br><br><span style="color: red;">He isn't looking for much - just someone who can look after the family, tend to the household chores and, most importantly, get along with him. </span><br><br>She doesn't need to be a graduate - just 'presentable looking' and have a certain degree of 'chemistry' with him.<br><br>She must also know how to play the roles of 'wife, girlfriend and mistress'.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Mr Chan told The New Paper on Sunday: 'I've dated my share of Singaporean women, and I've had enough of them.<br><br>'They're materialistic, they flirt around, drink and socialise too much. </span><br><br>'I'm an extrovert but I draw the line at women who act that way.'<br><br>FAILED RELATIONSHIPS<br><br>He's dated successful women - many of whom were graduates, financially independent and good-looking - and even had three serious relationships. Unfortunately, all three failed - one due to parental objections.<br><br>Five months ago, Mr Chan, who is the second of three children, decided to turn to a matchmaking agency for help to find that special someone.<br><br><span style="color: red;">He said: 'I'm tired of Singaporean women being obsessed with the 5Cs (car, condo, credit card, cash, country club membership).<br><br>'I want a woman who won't put so much emphasis on such material pursuits. </span><br><br>'I think foreign brides from Vietnam and perhaps Cambodia may be the answer.'<br><br>Over the past few months, he has read reports and surfed the Internet for matchmaking agencies, and is under the impression that Vietnamese women fit his bill.<br><br>Moreover, his parents have told him that friends and relatives who have chosen Vietnamese or foreign brides are happily married and have no problems with the marriage.<br><br>It was the final stamp of approval.<br><br>Next month, Mr Chan will be making his way to Vietnam to see if he can find his potential bride there. If not, he won't rule out Cambodia, since it's a new market and the prospects seem promising.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Mr Chan says that he doesn't mind marrying a woman with lesser educational qualifications than him - like many of the Vietnamese women he will be meeting. </span>But he likes to have the option of choosing from another pool of women who have attained a certain level of education.<br><br>'This opens up more choices for the men,' he added.<br><br>He dismissed the idea of going to the government matchmaking outfit, the Social Development Unit (SDU), saying that it was 'too close for comfort'.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Mr Chan said: 'If the single women at SDU are anything like those I've dated, then what's the point of wasting my time there? </span><br><br>'I want to settle down soon and perhaps start a family next year, so I might as well concentrate on finding someone from overseas.'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's true. The over-30s singaporean women are feeling their biological clocks ticking. So much so that the women's advocate group 'aware' has formed a committee to look into the matter. <span style="color: red;">No doubt they'll blame the men for not 'being up to their standard'. </span><br><br>They refuse to acknowledge the fact that THEY are the ones who've become unattractive &amp; unfeminine to local men.<br><br>So what does today's singaporean woman bring to the marriage table? <span style="color: red;">So she has her own career, her own car, her own business. </span>So what? A man also has his own career, his own car, his own business. <span style="color: red;">So where's the difference. For a man, it's just like marrying another man.</span><br><br>Nature had intended men to be masculine &amp; women to be feminine. That's why there's a ying &amp; a yang. Opposites attract &amp; complement each other. <span style="color: red;">If a woman has qualities that are the same as a man, where's the attraction? It's just like being with another man.</span><br><br>I believe THAT'S the real reason why singaporean Men are marrying foreign women. It's because these women haven't forgotten how to be feminine.<br></div>

As mentioned if my husband allows me to stay at home and do the housework, I'll gladly accept that. But he won't as he feels that it is a waste of education and talent.<br><br>The point I have been trying to put across to you is that not every guy has the same, Me Tarzan, you Jane attitude and mentality as you do. The media you are quoting are for guys to justify why they have to look for a foreign bride.<br><br>I believe a lot of guys would like a local girl but if they can't, be it money or  charecter faults or extreme chavanistic views that does not keep up with society they have to start justifying to themselves why a foreign girl is better.<br><br>Of course there are those who are geniunely in love with a foreign girl and have not gone through the match-making service.<br><br>I guess the best thing is what one of my guy friends said. Btw he is looking for a foreign bride. "Yes, some Singporean girls are materalistic and demanding and I don't have the education level or earning power to keep up with them, But at the same time alot of Singaporean guys are also very demanding and unrealistic on what they expect from the girl. They want everything but give out little."<br><br>Therefore in conclusion, the key is balance. Please do bear in mind that Singapore do not have enough workforce and if you want to cut out the women and want them to stay at home, Singapore will lose half of its work force. Chew on that.</div>

As well, in the middle east where the opression on women is so great, archetiologists (or I can't spell the word) have uncovered female bones in battle garb which implies that in the past, females were in the army as well, protecting the country. If you want me to look up the article to support my claim I can do that.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I am not trying to say that females are physically stronger to protect themselves well all the time. But seriously your so called patriachal protection is way too extreme and over-rated. As for rape, studies show that most rapes happen at home and done by someone close to the girl.<br><br>Gee next thing I see in this thread is that Singaporean women cannot go out unless they have a guy with them and they must be covered from head to toe and no make up is allowed because that attracts sexual attraction and will cause them to be raped. seriously if you have some extreme views, Why don't u convert into an extreme muslim and move to the middle east and get a middle eastern wife slave</div>

I think alot of females except for the few bad eggs that are everywhere wants a partnership. This also applies to the guys and the bad eggs who want everything and not willing to give out anything.<br><br>And I do agree that guys are shortchanged in the all important factor: Time.
