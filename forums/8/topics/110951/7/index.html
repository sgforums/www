Guys in SG really don't have the right to say that girls don't understand the luxury they live in as many are really spoilt brats as well.<br><br>As well, some men always bash women. It works two ways. As a Singaporean woman, I can say yes I have seen how the 3rd world live. My parents have brought me when I was young to India and 3rd world countries to see how they live.

No argument there.<br><br></div></blockquote>Singapore Girl losing out in love<br><br>Star, Malaysia<br>December 5, 2004<br><br>Insight: Down South<br>By SEAH CHIANG NEE<br><br>THE sad existence of 300,000 white-collar workers in Singapore who canÂ’t find wives was headlined in a recent report: Â“No money, no looks, no educationÂ”.<br>This has emerged as a national crisis because of the numbers involved. It is the cumulative impact of SingaporeÂ’s rapid economic changes, especially the fast emergence of the educated woman.<br><br>Over the years, female undergraduates have outnumbered males and also matched or outperformed them in many professions as part of a global trend.<br><br>Few of these women are prepared to marry men who are below their educational or economic status.<br><br>The prospects of this small army of blue-collar men ever getting local wives range from slim to near impossible.<br><br>Girls who hold degrees averagely earn S$2500 to S$6000 a month, while the menÂ’s earnings are no more than S$1200 to S$2500.<br><br>The impact of this mismatch has become patently evident. Men in their 40s live with their parents or siblings, and some related in interviews that they had not gone on a date for more than 10 years. This is dealing a severe blow to the institution of marriage and the family.<br><br>In recent years, an increasing number of them are seeking their brides in Vietnam, China, Kalimantan and other regional countries.<br><br>The reason is, of course, not entirely economical. Even some educated men are convinced foreigners make better wives, because they are perceived as more domesticated, less arrogant or materialistic.<br><br>One common complaint against Singaporean women is their demand for the 5Cs Â– condo, car, credit card, country club and cash. Others blame the WomenÂ’s Charter, which they say is over-protective of women, loaded against men and may even encourage marriage break-up in some cases.<br><br>Others say the 30-month (now reduced to 24) national service for men has sharpened gender rivalry.<br><br>In recent months, Internet forums are full of comparisons between Singaporean and foreign women as wives.<br><br>Â“Some Singaporean females are simply arrogant, especially those with high education levels,Â” read one message. Â“They always think that Singaporean men are good for nothing while they themselves are perfect.Â”<br><br>Others complain that many women here donÂ’t know how to cook or do household chores and are too dependent on maids since very young.<br><br>In a recent popular TV documentary Get Real, one Singaporean lady agreed that her peers are Â“hard to love because they donÂ’t need anyone; they're too independentÂ”.<br><br>Not all the men who marry foreigners are hawkers, taxi drivers or low-skilled workers. Some are professionals, earning S$5000 to S$7000 a month.<br><br>For every Singaporean man looking for a Vietnamese bride, there are 2000 women seeking Singaporean husbands. The demand is so great that it has spawned an active matchmaking business in Ho Chi Minh City.<br><br>Â“The cost of a marriage package is as low as S$6000 to S$7000 compared to S$15,000 in recent years,Â” said one bride-seeking Singaporean.<br><br>The ladies are hitting back. One has angrily denounced men who import brides as spineless and whiners.<br><br>Â“They believe in self-contradictory ideals when it comes to women and have no intention of working hard for their family,Â” she said.<br><br>Â“Singaporean women wish to see some backbone in you all. We do not care about what you earn or whatever. Just show us that you truly are a man and not some whining screwdriver. This is very, very disheartening.Â”<br><br>On charges of arrogance or being spoilt and demanding, they shoot back with: Â“Look at the mirror first, please!Â”<br><br>Not long ago, a woman wrote a letter to the press asking for the government to intervene to make it harder for foreign women to marry Singaporean men.<br><br>Singaporean women are increasingly measuring better and better against their regional sisters in education and earning capacity, but are not too highly valued as wives.<br><br>Â“They are more career-minded, not domesticated and have high expectationsÂ” is one verdict. Vietnamese and Malaysian women, for example, are more gentle, less demanding or opinionated.<br><br>Â“I am a simple man looking for a simple girl,Â” said a 30-plus ethnic Chinese on television who recently married in Ho Chi Minh City.<br><br>One newspaper reader suggests the government makes it mandatory for a new wife Â– and husband Â– to undergo minimum training in cooking and various domestic chores.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s appalling Â– many Singaporeans over 30 canÂ’t cook, wash or iron their clothes or do simple household chores. Many live with their parents and are looked after by maids,Â” said a returnee from abroad.<br><br>He had learned to do all these while living abroad.<br><br>Â“I think most Singapore girls can't make it. Those who really make good wives are rare,Â” he said. Â“It seems our society has changed for the worse due to external influence. Some of them like to flirt around.Â”<br><br>A Singaporean woman penned an articulate letter to the press recently, in which she said the Singapore girl is a challenge to love.<br><br>Â“Although she may, at the end of the day, be a supportive and faithful spouse, the barbs hiding her soft interior are daunting to the suitor,Â” she said.<br><br>Â“She is materialistic, and loves being so. Shopping is a major hobby, and looking good is absolutely essential. The man is but another accessory, a helper, chauffeur, bag carrier.Â”<br><br>The writer said she had been to Vietnam.<br><br>Â“The girls, true to form, are slim, tall and soft-spoken. Every word is punctuated with a smile, even when you are driving a hard bargain with them,Â” she said.<br><br>Â“Their speech is melodious, and they work hard without complaining, carrying loads of cloth and vegetables in the market stalls and food places. Simple, gentle and hardworking, it's hard not to fall in love with them.Â”<br><br>By comparison, the women here have assimilated Western role models of strong women Â“without taking into account the men alongside usÂ”.<br><br>They tell themselves: Â“We are not going to be one of those docile wives who nod their heads and cook for you at the slightest command.<br><br>Â“We are not going to have wool pulled over our eyes by your romantic nonsense. No way! We are women of the new age.Â”<br><br>She concluded: Â“Somehow the whole idea of womenÂ’s liberation in Singapore seems to have come at the expense of our love lives.Â”<br><br>o Seah Chiang Nee is a veteran journalist and editor of the information website littlespeck.com (e-mail: cnseah2000@ littlespeck.com )<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Taken from The Straits Times Interective (6/11/04):<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>By Zuraidah Ibrahim<br>Political Editor<br><br>EDUCATED women here have been getting the metaphorical black eye or two lately.<br><br>How's this for starters: This week, to snag some publicity for a birth control programme, a committee chided tertiary-educated women for going for abortions, citing how the number of abortions among this group had seen a three-fold rise since 1988.<br>Riding on this statistic, a committee member rued the sorry state of educated women, adding that some who went to his clinic for abortions told him they didn't want babies to block their career paths.<br><br>What these statements omitted to mention was the inconvenient fact that the total number of tertiary-educated women had also jumped - four-fold. In other words, the proportion of tertiary-educated women going for abortions has actually declined.<br><br>One wonders, too, if the doctor was too quick to suggest that married women were torn between child and ambition, as if these were the only factors at play.<br><br>The choice may not be so cut-and-dried. Even if work gets in the way, it is hardly fair to characterise all the women concerned as heartless climbers of the corporate ladder, the way some of these discussions are wont to do.<br><br>The woman may be driven more by fear than by ambition - the fear of companies not willing to hire pregnant women, or of juggling the bundle of joy and the burden of work with a husband who is not willing to share the load.<br><br>The main point that the committee was trying to make was a valid one: educated Singaporeans who are not ready for children should know better than to resort to abortions; they should avoid conception through birth control.<br><br>But, have you noticed how the onus is placed on the woman? The experts could have chosen to highlight the fact that a rising number of tertiary-educated men are making their wives pregnant before they are ready for it.<br><br>No, instead, the accusing looks are directed at the women. It is as if Singapore's men share no responsibility for birth control; as if they are innocents seduced into surrendering their seed by the predatory females of the species.<br><br>One doctor on the committee acknowledged that part of the problem could be that the gap between marriage registration and traditional ceremonies made it embarrassing for these women if they became pregnant.<br><br>This is revealing of the state of morality and men-women relationships here. But more of that later.<br><br>Next, witness the letters to the Forum page lamenting the Singapore woman's lack of womanliness, her 'barbed exterior' and her insistence on putting career above everything else.<br><br>The onslaught against the Singapore woman comes amid this vexing concern that more men here are marrying foreigners or keeping them as mistresses. The prevailing sentiment - if the letter-writers and these men who marry foreigners are to be believed - is that women here are too difficult and therefore deserve this fate of being passed over for foreign women.<br><br>The presumptuousness of these letters in assuming that every woman's desire is to be wedded is exceeded only by their sheer chauvinism.<br><br>What about the role men play? How do they contribute to keeping a relationship happy and healthy?<br><br>The discussions, while they may be passed off as just idle chatter, reveal much about the mindset that still govern all of our lives here.<br><br>Singapore women have made enormous leaps in education and many have become independent, strong-minded, driven people, no different from Singapore men bred on the same ideals.<br><br>But here's the rub: The men just have not kept up.<br><br>More of them seem to be caught in a time warp. A time when women stayed at home, cooked and took care of their men's needs or, in a slightly updated version, women went to work but still found themselves left with taking care of the house.<br><br>In the second version, the men want their women to be their economic equals. But in everything else, they want to be more equal than their women.<br><br>This mismatch between what Singapore women have become and what Singapore men still are is really the reason behind the recent letters berating women and why it's so convenient to place the blame on abortions by educated women - on only them.<br><br>Society has some catching up to do.<br><br>For some reason, a woman's advance is always measured in terms of trade-offs she must make - between career and family - whereas a man's is never that.<br><br>In politics too, women politicians are constantly being asked that question. Few of us journalists ever ask male politicians about the trade-offs they make.<br><br>This mindset seeps into many other decisions - including whether to have or keep the baby. The responsibility of keeping the baby as implied by the doctor rests with women.<br><br>And worse, for those women who have to get rid of their babies because they have not gone through their traditional vows, why the insistence on face? What is being transgressed here? Society's expectations that a couple must not have copulated before marriage? Or, the veil of hypocrisy that it goes on but let's not tell the whole world?<br><br>If the marriage is legal, so should the baby-making be.<br><br>But no, for the sake of maintaining some myths about female virginity and tradition, abortion is the chosen way out.<br><br>The expectations on Singapore women are huge. At the workplace, they are supposed to be equal to men even though they earn less. At home, they contribute to the family income yet bear the larger burden of rearing children.<br><br>Yes, I know, there will be men who will say they are doing their fair share, they are as liberated as their women.<br><br>I have met these specimens too and some are very dear to me, but I would hazard a guess they are not the overwhelming majority of men.<br><br>For all that they have delivered, Singapore women have a right to be demanding and, yes, difficult even.<br><br>And if women decide not to have children, don't be quick to blame them. Men, and the rest of society, should also look at themselves in the mirror.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>From The Straits Times Interactive:<br><br>Dec 22, 2004<br>MM: Baby dearth could not have been prevented<br><br>At best, it would have been delayed had S'pore held its women back<br>By Azhar Ghani </strong><br>THE baby dearth problem hit Singapore more rapidly than elsewhere because the country had moved quickly to remove barriers to women being educated, joining the workforce and having careers open to them, Mr Lee Kuan Yew said on Monday.<br><br>But even if women had been held back, it would not have prevented the problem from arising altogether, the Minister Mentor told the Foreign Correspondents' Association (FCA) when asked just how serious the population shortage problem was.<br><br>'I used to blame myself for being too hasty that in 1959 we passed the Women's Charter and imposed monogamy and opened up education and jobs, and that caused all this,' he said.<br><br>'But I've come to the conclusion it would only have delayed it 10, 20 or 30 years.'<br><br>He said the problem was not peculiar to Singapore and has been happening in many parts of the world.<br><br>Lifestyles and aspirations of women in other societies, increased travel and interaction with people from other parts of the world also had a part in influencing the decision of women here to put careers ahead of starting a family.<br><br>It was a problem that Japan also faces, despite having 'kept their women in place', he noted.<br><br>'But the Japanese women have travelled. They are now not wanting to get married and become slaves to their husbands and their in-laws and their children. So their birth rates are as perilous as ours.'<br><br>Unlike Japan, which has to work with a population of 130 million and a people who are homogeneous, Singapore is fortunate in that it has a small base of four million people.<br><br>'So we can top up. There's China, there's India,' he said, adding that Singapore could offer their citizens 'a better life... for the next 10, 20, maybe slightly more years before their big cities can offer the kind of lifestyle which we offer immediately'.<br><br>'We are multiracial. So absorbing new migrants of different races and religions and cultures doesn't worry us. In fact, it makes us more attractive as a cosmopolitan centre and makes us more relevant to the world.'<br><br>Mr Lee conceded that it might be hard to encourage women to have children given that they also wanted their careers.<br><br>Singapore's birth rate hit an all-time low of 1.26 last year, well below the population replacement rate of 2.1.<br><br>This prompted the Government to announce new measures, including a five-day work week, lower maid levies and extended maternity leave, to support parenthood and encourage Singaporeans to have more children.<br><br>Mr Lee, during a question-and-answer session after a dinner with members of the FCA, also responded to a question on why Singapore has not sent ground troops to Iraq despite having said that the situation there is an important global issue.<br><br>He reminded his audience that Singapore's army is largely made up of enlisted operationally-ready national servicemen.<br><br>And unlike in the former East Timor, now Timor Leste, where the Singapore Armed Forces had sent troops consisting of volunteers to undertake peacekeeping tasks, the role in Iraq is one of peace-making.<br><br>'My guess is the Defence Minister and probably the Prime Minister would conclude that parents would not be over-anxious to have their children do national service in Iraq. But that does not mean that Iraq is not important,' he said.<br><br>When the questioner made the point that South Korea, which also has an army made up of enlisted men, had sent troops into Iraq, Mr Lee said that Seoul was in a different position.<br><br>The country has 37,000 American troops stationed there, it has a demilitarised zone (DMZ), and has North Koreans just across the DMZ.<br><br>'Seoul could be devastated within hours of any conflict. So that's a sufficiently compelling reason to pay an insurance premium,' he said of South Korea's deployment<br></div>
