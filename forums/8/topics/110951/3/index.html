In the real world its about not having money to even eat and being a burden to the family.<br><br>lady's in thai or vietnam don't have a choice like singapore woman..Tell me what are the alternatives? Go school? Where to find the school fees? get a job? Where to find when all have to work in the fields to supplement pathetic incomes.. they are not useless and stupid as you presumed..<br><br>the lady's before evey meal, helps to clean up the utensil and wait till you eat before they consume, they peel prawns and pick food for us.. yes, they are treating us like emperors, but don't get me wrong.. that's where we feel the love coming from.. its not what you presume..<br><br>what we are asking from local lady is simple.. be less vocal.. know your roles in the house.. we don't need any extravagance like thai lady's.. we argue simply for the fact that we still care about local lady's..<br></div>

(rich &amp; influnencial not counted).<br><br>many a times, the S'porean woman would just defend this argument that they simply want somebody loving, sincere &amp; caring to spend their life with. but often the question of financial stability is left out. let me ask u guys: how much does an average guy earn per month? many of us cannot even take care of ourselves. how to take care of a family with a S'porean wife whose expectation, whether intentionally or unintentionally is so high? many times, the struggle for financial responsibility often lead to divorce.<br><br></div>

Guys in SG really don't have the right to say that girls don't understand the luxury they live in as many are really spoilt brats as well.<br><br>As well, some men always bash women. It works two ways. As a Singaporean woman, I can say yes I have seen how the 3rd world live. My parents have brought me when I was young to India and 3rd world countries to see how they live. Its really heart wrenching to see them fight over a loaf of bread or a coin. I have slept on cold stone floors and eat just rice and vegetables.<br><br>No one ever said that they are stupid. Just not given the opportunity. Likewise, since we Singaporean women are given the opportunity, shouldn't we make the most of it?<br><br>You feel love coz they stroke your ego? Aww....come on, if serving a guy hand and foot means love, shouldn't you guys treat her like a queen and show that you love the girl by serving her hand and foot  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Talk about double standards!!! You really do crack me up!!!! Wait for you to consume before they eat?? Which era did you pop up from??? A lot of families in Singapore don't even treat their maids that way!<br><br>Anyway what I can say that I am really glad that lots of local guys do not have the mentality like you do...A woman should know her place in the house...She be less vocal.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  A marriage is a partnership. It moves with time and moves with circumstances. Decisions made should be thoroughly discussed together and not because the woman has to shut up and keep her thoughts to herself while the guy makes all the decisions!</div>
