            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The statement that "sg gals are still smarter than imports" is an implied admission that you are completely outclassed in the looks department. *sigh*<br><br>It really doesn't matter if you are smarter than the imports. I believe both local men and women subscribe to the same idea - we all go after money under the guise of talent. So when a lady says to me: "I like you because I think you are brainy." What she really saying is : "You are not good-looking but at least you are educated enough to earn a decent income. I want to share your income."<br><br>You see ? Don't be tricked by the word "brainy". Men are aroused by tits and pussies, not a lump of brain cells. If they need intellectual communication, they can always speak to another intellectual man or pick up a book by Plato and Aristotle. Lets be honest. A degree from NUS, NTU, SMU or SIM is not going to turn you into an intellectual powerhouse.<br><br>As for labelling the export oriented local males as "unwanted guys". Well, it's the simplest consolation that you can conjure. We don't deserve to be considered brainy if we think the entire piece of land that stretches from Saigon to Hanoi is nothing but a gigantic farmland.</strong></div>
