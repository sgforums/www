Part timer? full timer?   Your mom is  a capable woman regardless for balancing the house and work. Does she clean up after you?<br><br>Equality is a relative term - meant to abolish discrimination between men and women in terms of social structure.<br><br>I cook and housekeep for myself now since I moved from Singapore . I never had a maid  .  My mom used to cook for me , my dad attempted but he gave us all diarrhea after. My dad attempts to help out on his offdays with housework but it ends up more mess to clean up than help.  So my mom ends up as the housekeeper.<br><br>Household chores can be divided amicably among the couple depending on their capabilities. Some guys like to cook . No one likes to clean. Laundry is no fun.  Get on with the change - there are househusbands out in the world now. Men who are willing to housekeep while their wives are the breadwinner.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Even in today's society, it's more socially-acceptable for a woman to stay home and be a home-maker than for a man to do likewise. Therefore, it is then the onus of the woman to do most of the housework. Having come home from work, the man is frustrated, tired and hungry. He does not want to come home to a debate on equality. He wants food, comfort and to spend time with his wife and offspring, if any.<br><br>Having said that, if both parties are working full-time jobs, then both have to contribute equally to the house chores and some system must be in place. E.g. man mops floor while woman cleans stove-top.<br><br>I think the whole argument about this thread is not the fact that women should stay at home all the time. However, I do agree that in the pursuit of "equality", the role of women in the home has become a platform for conflict and not one that articulates love and care for the home. That's why we have the Chinese song "Only a Mother's good in this world" (direct translation), in the past, the woman has always been a target of affection by children due to their level of interaction with the children and the one that is always looking after the household. Ask the older generation, did they feel closer to their mum or dad, the answer will most likely be mum. Sadly, it is one avenue less for us to respect women for nowadays.<br><br>The man has always been set out to be the head of the family. Quite a few religions preach this, and it's always been the way. Only when this equilibrium  gets upset, e.g. mother becomes overbearing or father fails to do his job of fathering properly, that's why we get serial rapists, women-murderers and homosexuals.</div>

Quite a few religions preach this, and it's always been the way.

Humans being humans will tend to add in their own thoughts and feelings but this is a whole different issue all together.<br><br>Anyways what is written in history does not mean its applicable now. It has now come to the point where housework virtually has to be equally shared. Sure, you can be the guy who goes to work and your wife does the same but still have to come home and slave for you.
