            <div class='col-md body'>Man Utd was <strong>HOME</strong>, and they struggled to even get out of their half until Wenger decided to play safe in the 2nd half. Arsenal obviously played better with the fluid passing in spite of the rain.<br><br>Man Utd didn't deserve to win at all. I feel that it should have been a draw would've been a very fair result. Rio got away scot free after that foul on a already through Ljunberg (not even yellow ?!), and Arsenal had 2 penalty appeals in the first half alone. Henry was enough of a man (and a bit stupid IMO) to get up quickly and play on; after what could very well been a penalty in such a big match.<br><br>Clearly Fergie's tactic was <span style="font-style: italic;">"If you can't outplay them, mow them down and frustrate them"</span>. Look at Vanisterooy coming down hard on Ashley's knee with his boot. He knew the linesman was <span style="font-style: italic;">behind</span> him and the referee was too far to see. Then he walked away like nothing happened. I was utterly disgusted. And that unprovoked push on Lehmann later ? And Neville clearly spitting on Lauren after he went down in the penalty area ? Dive or not, he shouldn't have done that. And so many other incidents I shan't bother to mention. So much for sportsmanship.<br><br>All that, and a penalty goes to a somewhat tame foul ? Not that it wasn't a foul, given the ref's earlier decisions it's definately <strong>NOT</strong> a penalty. But nope, he points to the spot right away. Even the commentator was saying that the referee has given 8 out of 8 penalties to Man Utd for all of the last 8 matches he's officiated with Man Utd playing.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>That really killed the game and Arsenal's morale, as neither team could really break the each other's defences. Give Arsenal a penalty at that moment and I'm very sure Arsenal would too have killed, and gone on to win the game.<br><br>Having said all that, we (Arsenal) lost and that's the cold hard truth. It had to end somewhere. And it ended dramatically at 49 matches unbeaten in the EPL, a feat that might never again be repeated in our lifetimes. I'm glad I was around to see it. Although I feel it's still too soon for the run to end (which Arsenal fan doesn't?), I wouldn't want it to end at anywhere other than Old Trafford.<br><br>C'mon Gunners ! We're sore at a undeserved loss, but this is soccer and the ball is round, so let's be graceful losers. Bounce back from this defeat and win the treble this season !!!  Show the world which is the greatest english team of all time !<br><br>Scratch that, show everyone this Arsenal team <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span> GREATEST TEAM OF ALL TIME !!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>From an big Arsenal fan.</div>
