When they looked up to see what the commotion was, they said they saw something shocking: A woman letting go of a dog over the edge of the corridor.<br><br>The dog fell six or seven storeys to its death.<br><br>One eye-witness, a 17-year-old student who declined to be named, said she was under Block 473, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10, chatting with friends at about 3pm yesterday.<br><br>'My friends and I heard two dogs barking. People started gathering opposite (under a covered walkway) and looking up. We suspected that something was happening and joined the crowd. When we went there, we saw the woman release the dog.<br><br>'My friend shouted at her, but she just touched the plants outside the flat and disappeared.'<br><br>They were standing just opposite where the dog landed, near the middle of the block.<br><br>Another witness, Mr Martin Chan, who was walking his own dog, was stunned when the dog landed nearby.<br><br>He called the police immediately.<br><br>Mr Chan, 23, a financial adviser, said: 'I heard another dog barking upstairs. Some people were looking up. The next thing I knew, a dog landed about three metres away from me.<br><br>'It was quite scary, especially because I'm a dog owner myself. I was shocked that someone would do this.<br><br>'I think the dog died instantly. It didn't move or anything.'<br><br><strong>WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED </strong><br><br>When The New Paper arrived on the scene at 3.30pm, the police confirmed that a dog carcass was found in the void deck, but did not comment on the cause of death.<br><br>The New Paper questioned residents of Block 473, to try to piece together what might have happened.<br><br>One resident living on the seventh storey, who asked not to be named, said there were no dogs on his level.<br><br>He said that the dog, a 3- or 4-year-old shitzu, lived just below him on the sixth storey.<br><br>'I always hear this dog barking and jumping against the corridor,' he said.<br><br>Nobody responded to our attempts to contact the person living below his flat.<br><br>But the neighbours confirmed that a woman lived there, and she owned a dog.<br><br>But they added that they rarely saw either of them.<br><br>Most of the other residents learnt of the incident only when the police arrived.<br><br>Mr Madhavan Kannan, head of the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) Centre for Animal Welfare and Control, said: 'If the dog was thrown down from the apartment, (the perpetrator) can be charged for cruelty to animals.<br><br>'The penalty for this is a $10,000 fine, one year's jail or both.'<br><br><strong>DID YOU SEE IT HAPPEN? </strong><br><br>THE dog appeared to be someone's pet.<br><br>It was certainly well cared for.<br><br>Ms Deidre Moss, a spokesman for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said: 'Apart from the bleeding, the dog was in generally good condition. It was well taken care of, and must have been somebody's pet.'<br><br>She added: 'On veterinary examination, there didn't appear to be any fracture. The dog was bleeding from the mouth and had a broken left lower jaw.<br><br>'It is assumed that the dog died from head injuries. This may be because it fell from a height.<br><br>'We do not know the cause of death, but the dog died under questionable circumstances.'<br><br>Ms Moss does not think the dog jumped to its death.<br><br>'Because of the size of the breed, it is highly unlikely that the dog could have found its way over the balcony.'<br><br>She appealed to witnesses to contact the police.<br></div>
