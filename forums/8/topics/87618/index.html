            <div class='col-md body'>group of managers were given the assignment to measure the height of a flagpole. So they went to the flagpole with a ladder and measuring tape. They keep falling off the ladder, dropping the tape and the whole thing is in a mess. An engineer comes along and sees what they are trying to do. He walks over, pulls the flagpole out of the ground, lay it flat, measure it from end to end, gives the measurement to one the managers and walks away. After the engineer left, one manager turns to another and laughs. "Isn't that just like an engineer? We are looking for the height and he gives us the length!<br><br>Moral of the Story :<br>No matter how ingenious you are. Managers can always find fault with you</div>
