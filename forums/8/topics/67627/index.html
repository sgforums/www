            <div class='col-md body'>Dorm life is a fun part of university life - but what do you do when your roommate is a real pain?<br><br>By Serene Luo<br><br>THIS is the stuff urban legends are made of.<br><br>You loan your roommate your computer when her laptop fails and she just takes it over.<br><br>Your roommate shaves her legs - by propping her legs up on your bed.<br><strong><br>You come back from the holidays to find that one of your dorm mates has dumped prawn shells into the toilet bowl - and left them there without flushing.<br></strong><br>Guess what? These stories are for real.<br><br>While living in hostels is convenient and an unforgettable part of university life, getting roommates from hell is a scary reality.<br><br>Jimmy Lee, 24, remembers how he was assigned another roommate after his first one changed schools.<br><br>'His timing was all upside-down,' says the fresh graduate. 'He would sleep from 6pm to 3am, and when all the others wanted to go to sleep, he would get up, switch on the lights and study.' His roommate would also shut all the doors and windows and draw the curtains.<br><br>Coupled with oily smells from packets of cooked food he would leave around the room and the pungent smell of athlete's foot from which he suffered, the room often gave off an awful stench that passers-by complained of, he says.<br><br>Each time it happened, Jimmy would glare at his roommate and make him clean up the room under his supervision, but a few days later, the situation would repeat itself.<br><br>Despite this, Jimmy never complained because he didn't want to 'go through the hassle of complaining and moving rooms'.<br><br>Each year, some 15,000 students return to the 10,800 rooms in the hostels of Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and the National University of Singapore (NUS). The third university, the Singapore Management University, does not have dorms.<br><br>While most students do state their preference for roommates or get single rooms, there are a minority who do not do so and are assigned a room randomly.<br><br>At NTU, students who have special requirements can write in to the Student Affairs Office when they apply for their rooms.<br><br>Despite these arrangements to pair off suitable roommates, complaints arise owing to different study, sleep and other lifestyle habits.<br><br>When this happens, hall masters at NTU and NUS meet the students involved and help them reach a compromise.<br><br>They are encouraged to give themselves another go at living together but if things still do not work out, they are allowed a transfer, depending on the availability of rooms.<br><br>But like Jimmy, very few people actually complain - preferring to suffer in silence rather than be seen as carrying tales.<br><br>An undergraduate who wants to be known only as Julia, 22, tolerated her roommate who took over her computer and messed up the room.<br><br>'She was my friend and I didn't know how to tell her,' she says.<br><br>Another undergraduate, who gave his name as Will, had to put up with a stinking toilet and room after the prawn-shell incident.<br><strong><br>He says: 'The solution was to compete at who could be more smelly, in order to take revenge.'<br></strong><br>Consultant psychiatrist Brian Yeo, 42, explains that living together and meeting one another at classes are very different experiences.<br><strong><br>'When you see one another for shows, projects and parties, you'll always see each other's best side,' he says.<br><br>'You'll never see the side of the sloppy eating, the getting-ready for school, or the slipshod dressing.'<br></strong><br>Undergraduate Lester Chiew, 22, was paired up with a roommate not of his choice and had to adjust to 'the weird feeling of sleeping in the same room as someone you don't know'.<br><br>But unlike the others, he was unwilling to suffer in silence.<br><br>'You want to get to the root of the problem so you must speak up.<br><br>'If you just keep quiet, your room-mate will think that you're fine with his actions. Complain and kick him out!'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Make peace, not war<br><br>Dr Brian Yeo, a consultant psychiatrist from Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre, shares tips on how to live peacefully with your roommate:<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Housekeeping is usually an issue, so draw up a timetable for sharing chores. That makes it obvious who has to do what and makes the other party conscious of what you are doing.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> If you can't seem to bring up problems with your roommate, speak to him indirectly through your mutual friends. It may be easier to talk about things through a third party.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Generally, irritating hall neighbours are easier to deal with if people are united. Get other like-minded people on the same floor to support your case.<br><br>- ST<br><br>[/quote]<br><br>anyone had similar experiences?<br><br>luckily when i first went Uni, my first hostel room was a single room. in the 2nd yr, i already got to noe better the new frens i made there, so can choose a roommate when we moved out of campus.<br><br>but my experience in ocs, where 2 share a room, was quite bad! somemore there is no avenue to complain!<br></div>
