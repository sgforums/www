            <div class='col-md body'>You can't blame the Air Marshal in this case.Why? As in the tight confines of the aircraft, in any situation you will only be given a split second to decide pulling the trigger and a missed opportunity. On top of that, all military,law enforcement personnal, when confronted with a situation like this, their brains literally turn into water and flows out of the ears,and countless hours of training at the range,snap shooting and quick target acqusition and evaluating of threat/s just take over.<br><br>And i belief, these Air Marshals are actually going through an emotional turmoil each time they board a flight. They are like tightly wound springs, just waiting to unleash when the need arises. And I salute them for that, as nobody who is sane would feel good pulling the trigger fully knowing that it can kill or injure another person who has got parents and family like they themselves.<br><br>**just my 2 cents**</div>

I was called to duty right after september 11 occur, and my instruction at that time is very clear, i will have to issue verbal warning, but if the threat do not comply or appear to be an imminent threat, my order is to put a bullet into him. i do not even hve to see the bomb, i just have to see him trying to reach or activate something which i thing may be a bomb or a weapon. period. This is to protect national interest and lost of lives. So it is your respossibility not to put yourself in such situations.<br><br>Rules of engagement in singapore is very similar, dun believe me? take a box, go to jurong island entrance, shout out loud "i have a bomb", then try to open the box, i m sure you can find several bullet holes in you pretty instantly</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Aveme:</div><div class="quote_body">so transquiliser dart cost is more expensive than a human life?<br><br>I am not sure how fast any such best transquilser take immediate effect on a human being but if it will disable a person's movement just as fast as a killing bullet,the cost is justified</div></blockquote>i dun think cost is an issue here. But the fact is clear, transquilser will nv be able to stop a bomber from activating his bomb, it is common sense, transquilser shot is like an injection, after an injection the fluid will flow into the blood stream, and then flow to other parts of the body to take effect. that is why when you get bitten by a poisonous snake, you dun die immediately, even the most poisonous snake's bite take mins to kill you.  unless u r so sure that the threat is really a madman and not a terrorist. otherwise will you choose tranquilser or a bullet? i think the answer is very clear</div>

Their job is to put the situation under control. In 1991, SQ117 is hijacked, when special operatons force from SAF commandos storm the plane, their job is also not to id who is a terrorist, they will go in, and if u appear to be a immediate threat, they will put a bullet into your head, then they will tie eveyone else up including the stewardess and passengers, and move them out ouf the plane for the investigators to id who is a terrorist and who is not.</div>
