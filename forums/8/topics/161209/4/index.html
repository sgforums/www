On the other hand, people with a healthy lifestyle may live longer. But we all have to die one day...old people tend to have a higher risk of cancer and treatment of cancer is more expensive.<br><br>So perhaps if the government wants to save more money, they should encourage us to eat all the crabs we can find and all die from our first heart attack at a young age.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with most except about the karma and cancer.<br><br>One of my husband's family relatives died of cancer recently - she is a doctor herself.  Her husband is a doctor too but left earlier (not cancer) than her.  Her daughter has cancer too but still treating and under control.  My aunt is still fighting intestine cancer , and her husband died of liver cancer.  Her daughter has some health problem but unidentified.<br><br>I believe the reason for their suffering of cancer is because of their lifestyle, especially the way they eat.  As for the doctor who passed away, it is hereditary.  Just like my friend who have lost dad, mum and sister due to brain tumor/cancer.  He himself has won a battle over intestine cancer but he can't have kids for fear of passing the bad gene.<br><br>Its really unpredictable for those who suddenly hear the bad news.  For those who have bad genes - its not their choice either.<br><br>Karma - I believe charity is an important element in karma.  Do more good deeds so that you will be rewarded in short-term karma or your next life.<br><br></div>

Her husband is a doctor too but left earlier (not cancer) than her.  Her daughter has cancer too but still treating and under control.  My aunt is still fighting intestine cancer , and her husband died of liver cancer.  Her daughter has some health problem but unidentified.<br><br>I believe the reason for their suffering of cancer is because of their lifestyle, especially the way they eat.  As for the doctor who passed away, it is hereditary.  Just like my friend who have lost dad, mum and sister due to brain tumor/cancer.  He himself has won a battle over intestine cancer but he can't have kids for fear of passing the bad gene.<br><br>Its really unpredictable for those who suddenly hear the bad news.  For those who have bad genes - its not their choice either.<br><br>Karma - I believe charity is an important element in karma.
