But I must add that she might also miss out on being with people her age, hanging out etc.  But 5 years is no big deal. I'd go out with someone 10 years younger than me if I weren't married.

But if a guy who is 5 years older than me ( he would be 22), likes me, I would feel kinda awkward. Somehow when I compare the numbers 17 and 22 the age gap seems quite huge. Maybe it's because I'm still a teen and he's already an adult. But thinking again, if I'm 21 and he's 26, somehow the age gap seems smaller.<br>I'm not sure why too... hm....<br>Smthing I've pondered over and still pondering about.</div></blockquote>hey hey hey, guess what? i'm 17 and my bf is 22 and it's true, tht's why i started this topic....hehehe<br><br>------------------<br>My, u gotta be happier than me - Janice</div>
