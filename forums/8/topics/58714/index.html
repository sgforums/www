            <div class='col-md body'>i think they're over reliant on michael owen, so when he's a bad day, the team doesnt perform. Also the manager likes to bring in those unknown players. he should start bringing some stars(other than kewell) to boost the overall confidence of the team.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Diouf is one fellow who gets on my nerves, he dribble dribble then cross in so disapointingly. Then very easy fall down get free kick. I would very much prefer Heskey in his place. Dribble too long is no good cuz by that time defenders would have closed down on you making you less room to manoeuvre and send in an accurate cross.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Think Liverpool depends too much on individuals.<br>If Owen injuried, no one to attack....<br>If Hyypia or Henchoz injuried, no one to defence...<br><br>What makes Liverpool different from Man U or Arsenal is that they do not have a second team... no players to cover the main players.<br><br>Their midfield also not as good... Gerrard is an attacking midfielder and if he or Murphy goes on holiday (under perform) their in trouble.. like now... Murphy totally lost touch.<br><br>Diouf nickname serial killer.... only thing he killed is his scoring touch...</div>
