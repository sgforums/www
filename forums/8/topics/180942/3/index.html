            <div class='col-md body'>I say try despite what the advertisement requires. If the employer is desperate and the job is not that appealing, you might stand a chance. The boss then has two choices, he either hires someone inexperienced or pays a very high salary to entice someone experienced. Different employers might have different requirements. My former boss hired me even though I had no experience. It was a lucky break for me, but I was so lowly paid even I felt it was low, exploitative even. But years later I was better positioned in the market to move on to bigger better things. Later I realised that my boss didn't want to hire the best applicant, but the inexperienced (and therefore hypothetically the worst) and of course the cheapest cos she had a family to feed and could not afford the chosen applicant to overshadow her.</div>
