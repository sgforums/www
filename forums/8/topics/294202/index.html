            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">U can try but i won't gurantee that it works. But this is wat i observed from my fren.<br><br><strong>Number 1 rule: First impression.</strong><br><br>Basically don come into the school with dyed hair. FOr guys try to ahve a nice and neat haircut, not too long. FOr girls try not to dye your hair. Anyway it doesn't really matter for girls. GIve your class advisor aka form teacher a good impression of u and it will helps u to getting a 4 pt GPA.<br><br><strong>Number 2 rule: Your attendence.</strong><br><br>Rules are not the same as secondary anymore! Your attendence does contribute to your 4 pt GPA. Try to maintain a 100 percent attendence, if not above 95 percent. Don skip classes or u will give teachers a bad impression of u.<br><br><strong>Number 3 rule: Mix with the right friends!</strong><br><br>Try not to mix with friends that skip classes, typical ah beng and bad results.<br>It's best advised to hang out with nerds and girls. U shld know girls are better in studies and won't get off track easily.<br><br><strong>Number 4 rule: The art of bootlicking. </strong><br><br>I won't reckon this but it does works. Not asking u to buy your teacher dinner or drinks, but u can maintain a good relationship with your teachers. Everytime u go into the class, greet them. Always ask them questions be it necessary or not. Always talk with them. Always sit at the front, do not sit behind and chit chat with others.<br><br><strong>Number 5 rule: Don't mess with the section heads. </strong><br><br>Most ppl shouldn't have this prob unless they have dyed hair, long hair, creating trouble with teachers or students. Messed with the section heads and your name will b blacklist. And chances are u won't go poly.<br><br><strong>Number 6 rule: The art of cheating.</strong><br><br>Find your ways and means to cheat. U don need me to teach u right? Of course don get caught by teacher or your friends.<br><br><strong>Number 7 rule: Get a CCA, do your CIP!</strong><br><br>CCA does helps in your GPA. Trust me. DOn be lazy. CIP are necessary.<br><br><strong>Number 8 rule: Be proud that u are in ITE.</strong><br><br>There will always b ppl who look down on ITE students. BUt u don have to b angry, jus b proud that u are ITE student. And tell yourself that one day, u will succeed.<br><br><strong>And lastly</strong><br><br>Do the above steps and most likely u are a 4 pointer. But of course u must study too! I'm from ITE and graduating. I'm not a 4 pointer. I don give good impression, i don bootlick, i don have a CCA or do CIP, i messed with section heads, i don mix with correct friends and my attendence sux.<br><br>I don want anyone to follow my footsteps thats why i am writing this to help those ppl who are entering ITE. This is wat i observed frm my classmates and now they are a 4 pointer. U see, ITE is really a diff place from your secondary sch days. Anyway best of luck to u all!<br><br></span></div>
