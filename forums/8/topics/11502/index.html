            <div class='col-md body'>I cannot help but see this episode highlight a certain factor within the bush administration: They appear to be undoing all the goodwill initially laid by the clinton administration<br><br>Bush's tough stand on China once again shows his cabinet's direction. His methods may satisfy the public at home but he's hardly improving his PR image overseas, having snubbed the European CO2 pact and openly declaring that his administration will re-assess the North Korean Policy ( a snipe at Kim Dae Jong and his efforts for a lasting peace in the Korean peninsula).<br><br>What (if any) is he trying to accomplish with all these actions?<br><br>Given all that he's done so far, maybe Al Gore may not have been such a bad choice?
