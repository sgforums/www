            <div class='col-md body'>let's just say that spying? everyone does it.. and only when someone is caught, does it blow up... still, it's a grey area..<br><br>like i said.. if someone who is seen as a probable enemy, i'd want to know as much as possible... especially when PRC does its macho posturing at ROC which is an ally of the US... add nukes to the equation... and if you were the leader of any country that could, would you not send out spies?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by BillyBong:</div><div class="quote_body"> I agree racism is not the issue here...<br><br>but to allow America to conduct survillance just like that? hardly something i would condone, considering the US has listeing devices that include spy sats, high freq broad band equipment...<br><br>And by the way, it's always easy to call the US an "international police force",  but scrutiny will tell u they help countries only when they have some political or economic gain (look, they're already considering pulling thei troops outta Isarel);<br><br>in any case, nobody in his right mind will agree to getting such "survillance", it blantantly disregards personal privacy...<br><br>in that case do u mind if i spy on u indiscriminately?<br><br>enuff said!<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
