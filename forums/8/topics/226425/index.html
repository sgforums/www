Do it on campus. They are recognised everywhere. Do it distance and you will find it damn tough.<br><br>The rest I look at are just second or third tier universities next to those courses. University of Manchester is not even good for Business Admin/Management.<br><br>NUS - first tier<br>NTU- second tier<br>SMU - third tier<br>SIM - no tier<br>MDIS - no tier<br>PSB - no tier<br><br>Besides Bachelor of Arts (especially in America)  and Bachelor of Business Admin/Management are degrees which wastes your time unless you have a daddy who will pass on the family business to you. How many Bachelor of Business admin and management people gone on to become clerks compared to those who actually make it. And you must know there are so many MBAs - your bachelor becomes obsolete unless you decide to downgrade your pay and career climbing.<br><br>Anyone can do an MBA .  Like my friend , she did computer science and then went on to an MBA and If you just did straight Business Admin - both of you sit in the interview- likely  she gets the job. Overseas they take all your experiences into account and not many straight Business Admin people go up very high unless they have connections or another skill like having good intuition in picking investments/ can do programming etc. Oh yeah Where your degree comes from is also a core factor.<br><br>Learn a skill like finance , accountancy , economics. Finance and Accountancy are the best combos. You work for banks and investment houses.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have to start pulling strings of friends to get my sister into jobs when she graduates from Business next year or persuade my parents to pay for her to do accountancy since it is a required skill. She can't even get a job with her scores in polytechnic .Not even a clerk job because it went to some uni grad who was willing to take the shatty pay.  Waste of time doing business admin.</div>

My friend who did computing science - she has a statistical major as well- double major - all quantitative analysis. She did the MBA and went to become an Analyst. Info tech - you can't really compete against the Indians.<br><br>Do something which gives you quantitative skills . Statisticians are hard to come by in alot of countries. If you have the cash and you are good with maths , do actuarial science  and get the UK membership which is recognised by the Australians as well. A lot of employers are willing to import you from Singapore or anywhere for that matter. Two of my friends did actuarial science. Before they even graduated , they got the job offers from HSBC and Allianz.</div>
