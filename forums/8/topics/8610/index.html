No rules, no laws, everyone's a stranger and it's every man (and woman) for him (and her) self. IRC used to be geek heaven when it first started, but not any more. Even your streetsmart ah bengs know how to get to this lawless territory. So like in the real world, all sorts of pple are around.<br><br>There in IRC, you can also say whatever you want, protected by your veil of anonymity, without any fear of presecution or any consequences at all. This allows pple to pass comments that they do not have to take responsibility of. Not only in IRC, but here, and anywhere where such cowards can take guerilla swipes. hit and run...<br><br>Tat's why i'm always a sceptic i guess, and i ever trust anything fully that i heard from any questionable source. It's easy to get angry and retaliate while on IRC..haha..happened to me the first time i went there...lashed out at this bugger...and so it's as easy to make frens as well as enemies. Rumours, nasty ones, are always spread around by pple u dun see, behind your back, be it in irc or in the real world. sthg we have to live with i guess...<br><br>so is irc full of nasty pple? sure, as many as there are other types of pple around..your average guy, the nerd, the occasional pervert...but to erm..use one bamboo pole to knock down a whole boat of pple? maybe that's a bit too harsh rite?<br><br>(oh btw, are u who i think u are splashie?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>)<br><br>------------------<br>*~*~*~*~*~*~*~**~*~*~*~*~*~*~**~*~~*<br>"To see the world in a grain of sand,<br>and the heavens in a wild flower; to hold<br>a flower in the palm of your hand, an<br>eternity an hour..."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey there splash.....<br>The replies above are right in the sense that the good and bad co-exist.  However, wat is the definition of good or that of bad?  How do we classify ppl as good or bad?  Or good and bad also co-exist in everyone of us?<br><br>Dun be affected by others if you think you have not done anything wrong lah.  But then again, we have to give ppl the freedom and rights of a human.  They have the right to dislike somebody if they want to.  Nobody can stop them loh.  We also have the right to choose whether we wanna get upset or be happy.  So knowing that you have the choice, will you choose to be happy or sad?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I just heard something from a friend of mine.  He said that a person should not change for the sake of other ppl.  If anyone is to change, it should be for the better of oneself (self-improvement).   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>So the point is to be wat you wanna be and if you are comfortable wif that, so be it.  But we cannot expect everyone to be o.k with wat we choose to be.  So even if a person damn nice, there will still be ppl who will dislike him or her one.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Take care.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>I aM WhO I aM,<br>ItS iMpOsSiBle To bE aNy MoRe Or LeSs......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yups, I agree with Zounds and TDG<br><br>There wasa time when I was *so* addicted to it though. Cos it was full of nice folks who taught me stuff that would take me ages to learn on my own.<br><br>It was really fun to role play and pretend to be something, someone just for a moment.<br><br>And sometimes have a great outing that everyone could enjoy as everyone had already known each other through mutual chat and all.<br><br>(but of course who could forget the high high bills?)<br><br>But nowadays it gets too wierd going back to irc. I see plenty of strange characters .. ala ..<br><br>sexybabe: Hi guys! I love you all<br>huge(blah): hey there baybah ...<br><br>bla bla bla ...<br><br>I mean its fine and totally all right to flirt, but isnt there this thing called the private chat mode? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Anyway my chat conversation would usually be like this<br><br>me enters the toom<br>me waves hi<br>someone: you know .. bla bla bla<br>someone_else : yeah .. bla bla bla<br>someone : why ah .. bla bla bla<br>someone_else : because youre so cute .. bla bla<br>me waves hi!!<br>someone : can i see you<br><br>And after a few mins I would look in disgust and give up ... hahaha<br><br>Oh heck care :-)<br><br>But not everyone is nasty in irc.
