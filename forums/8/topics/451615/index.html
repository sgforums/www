              <p>Do you realize that there are some Singapore laws that contradict itself and make the laws look quite stupid? Let me give a couple of examples. You cannot commit suicide because it's a crime (for being so stupid that can't even commit suicide successfully). In case you fail, you may be imprisoned and you can try commit suicide again inside.</p>
              <p>The other I can think of immediately is that euthanasia is illegal in Singapore so even if you're suffering from alot of pain from cancer (which is a death sentence by itself), you're not allowed to relief your suffering by going through euthanasia. HOWEVER, this is the funny part, all you need to do is go to another country, buy over 15 grams of heroin, and come to Singapore and let the officers know, and the Singapore government will give you the death penalty (euthanize you). So basically Singapore law states it's illegal for you to die, but they will help you die under the right conditions.</p>

              <p>Whatever others say, commit suicide takes courage. The victim might not attempt again. Anyway, from my knowlegde, he/she would be sent to IMH rather than prison.</p>
              <p>Laws are necessary to maintain social order.</p>
              <p>Laws do not equal ethics/moral.</p>
              <p>You follow the laws because of the possible ramification.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, many have unnessecary sacrifice their lives for 'justice'. Singapore had the highest death penalty rate according to a report published in 2004: http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3958717/ns/world_news/t/singapore-has-highest-death-penalty-rate/#.T6AH8NnlpDQ</p>
              <p>Highest rate of death penalty implemented does not mean lowest crime rate - check out which country has the lowest crime rate.</p>
              <p>STOP KILLLING. At the very least, 15g heroin shall not constitute to a death sentence.</p>

              <p>Yes, laws are required... my point is not about the laws itself, but how the laws can contradict each other... which means 1 law can contradict the other law... Erm, it's illegal to die but they will kill you themselves.</p>

              First, I think there's a place for anti-suicide laws in Sg. Especially those jumping off HDB flats or buildings. They endanger people at ground level! You won't find it funny or hypocritical if someone landed on you or your loved ones due to their suicide attempt. Second, any failed or successful suicide attempts waste needless manpower from the police, ambulance services, etc and inconvenience the public. Who to recover these costs from? Lastly, discouraging suicides with laws is good because at least some will be prevented when they start to think thru' the consequences before they act.
              
              However, I think the government should really rethink the position regarding euthanasia! At the very least, debate this issue publicly. Why can't a terminal and continually deteriorating case be given the right to choose an earlier and dignify end to his/her suffering???

              <p>Until recently, oral sex was illegal, but oral sex before penetration sex was legal.</p>

              <p>I dont think its "hypocritical". There are reasons why there are laws. A combination of social policies and for Sg's case, common law traditions.</p>
              <p>Sure, you can "suicide" by allowing yourself to be caught with 15g's. No doubt about that.</p>
              <p>And as for euthanasia, its not as simple as you think. The right to die may well become a duty to die. Not to mention Doctors Hippocratic Code, even now are subject to fierce contention by opponents and proponents of euthanisa. E.g Do you give the terminal ill morphine to ease his pain or do you give the terminal ill morphine to end his life "humanely". There is a difference.</p>
              <p>Netherlands has seen horror stories from thier euthanasia centres. Sign your document in the morning, dead by night.  And many did not die "humanely" as suggested. Some suffered for 9 to 12 hours and even some cases 18 hours.</p>
              <p>What say the legal consequences. Imagine now you are allowed to kill...albeit under certain circumstances. Now human life has degrees of value. Personally, I think it should still be illegal, but by a case by case basis, the crime must still be punished however under mitigating circumstances resulting in substantially lesser charge.</p>

              absolutely ! The cost of living  with 3rd or 4 th stage cancer and trying to prolong  life with chemo and radiation and then suffer the after effects after which short remission and when it come back as a relapse  the pain is even worse- forget it! Euthanasia is th e way to go!
