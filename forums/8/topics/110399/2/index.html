            <div class='col-md body'>Pagemap,<br><br>The reasons why some Singaporeans dislike Chinese, in their views are:<br><br>1. Chinese generally talk louder and not polished in social skills.<br><br>2. Have poorer hygiene.<br><br>3. Not sophisticated.<br><br>4. Work in low-paying or undesirable jobs.<br><br>Please don't misundestand and think Im anti Chinese. I merely explain the reasons why some Singaporeans dislike Chinese. I myself don't dislike Chinese.<br><br>1. The Chinese talk loudly because that's the why how they talk. Different peoples have different ways of communicating. For example, Westerners especially Americans are more direct while Asians prefer politeness and indirectness. No right or wrong here. Just different ways of communicating. Similarly, some Chinese talk loudly. It doesnt mean they are rude to you, but for Singaporeans who are used to talking softer, they are not used to it and think the Chinese are rude.<br><br>2. The Chinese have poorer hygiene because of several reasons. In China, many of them used to live communally or in big households where they share a bathroom. The quality of these bathrooms are not high, because most of the Chinese are poor, and also because it's a public thing where sense of ownership and responsibility is small. Many also spit everywhere. For example, on streets. Also, when in winter, some Northerners do not bathe for considerable length of time. When the Chinese come here, Singaporeans are not used to these habits and think the Chinese are rather disgusting.<br><br>3 &amp; 4. The Chinese are not sophisticated, work in low-paying or undesirable jobs, because most are poor. Poorer than Singaporeans. Richer Singaporeans therefore have a tendency to look down on the Chinese.<br><br>So basically, it is a habits and social class mismatch between the Chinese and the Singaporeans.<br><br>Of course, my explanations are general. There would be exceptions, like  highly educated Chinese, rich sophisticated Chinese etc. Especially now that China is rapidly developing and getting richer. For example, Chinese from big cities like Shanghai are totally different from Chinese from poor areas, who fit my explanations more.<br><br>Racially and culturally Singaporeans are close to the Chinese, because 77% of Singaporeans are Chinese by race. These Singaporeans are descendants of Chinese immigrants.<br><br>Singaporeans tolerate very well other overseas Chinese such as Malaysian Chinese, Indonesian Chinese, etc. Because they do not have habits and social class mismatch as great as compared to the mainland Chinese.<br><br>In fact, on the other end of the spectrum, some Singaporeans dislike Westerners because Westerners here are mostly professional expatriates who earn much more than the locals. Many are jealous of them, think they  snatch good jobs, and also think they are arrogant and haughty.<br><br>I hope Singaporeans would have more understanding and patience towards all the immigrants, while the immigrants hopefully would adjust to the local customs after some time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think a definition is in order. Some of my friends reading this are a little confused. Chinese here has two meanings, ethnicity and nationality. Obviously people from China takes both meanings. For Singaporean, their nationality is Singaporean while their ethinicity are Chinese, Malays or Indians.<br><br>To explain it in context to American folks, if your ancestors are from Ireland, you would be Irish American, Ancestors from Italy, Italian Americans, from Arabian nations, Arab Americans, and it continues on. Japanese American, Korean Americans, African Americans, blah blah blah. <span style="font-style: italic;">(For Singaporeans who think US is all 'angmos' or white people of european descent, this country is much less whiter than you think; its just that more white folks take up positions of power and infleunce, and thus more visible.)</span><br><br>Now apply that to Singaporean Chinese and China Chinese, and it should make better sense.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thing is, we should not have to regress in order to find employment.This is the end result of having too much FDI in a country.We have become another maquiladora, another EPZ for MNCs and not having nurtured a domestic market or domestic supply chains large enough or unique enough to wean us off the teats of MNCs.No doubt, firms will go for lowest cost labour, but do we want to stay as a majority manufacturing state for the long term or do we want to move up the food chain?It's getting too crowded here, we should really elave the production of TVs and low-level electronics to PRC or Vietnam.Instead, we should focus on more tertiary sectors and be information cum data centers or knowledge hubs and logistical/third wave infrastructural conduits.Uplift our tourism and get involved with more aerospace/space-related activities.We are the most seismically stable country in this region, and we could easily setup a commercial spaceport or have satellite production farms.Move up the engineering chain, it's getting too crowded down there.<br><br>But let's not focus all on the sciences too.Place emphasis on academia and humanities while we at it.No country ever became a mature and developed nation with scant respect paid to the arts and social sciences.We need think-tanks, NGOs and advocacy groups to act as speed brakes and rest stops on the nation's path to progress.</div>
