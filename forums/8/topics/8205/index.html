If someone loves you, but you don't really love him, you are NOT being fair by choosing him. Because, he is NEVER the best in your heart. You may GROW to love him but ask yourself, are you being true to yourself?<br><br>Nevertheless, what colette says is true, whoever is the one you love, the best is that he/she loves you back. If not, there will be more heart breaks. *SIGHZ* Still, this is NOT the reason to settle for second best just because the one you love don't love you back. You can still wait for another one to come along. Patience is the word.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>=================================<br>Do Pixies like a rainy day?<br>A-piping through the dell?<br>The Pixies must enjoy the rain;<br>Thats when they weave their spell.<br>Rain drops, rain drops<br>Play a Pixie-tune<br>=================================</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i believe that love can be cultivated and that even if you do love the person in the beginning, it takes a lot of work and commitment to make it last till the day you die.<br><br>many people fall in love rapidly and yet mere years or even months later, they fall out of love. why? is it because in the beginning of a relationship, we tend to show our best behaviour to attract the other party? once he/she is within our "clutches", our true self begin to shine true and thus disillusioning the other party? the worst thing about falling out of love is that the party usually no longer cares for you, his/her concern for you is worse than that of a compassionate stranger, i think that's what hurt most when the ones we love fall out of love with us.<br><br>love is a many facet thing, it's not merely just feelings or chemistry, i think it's more complex than that, exactly what it is, i'm still searching for it but suffice to say that i still love myself most currently.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>------------------<br>Love at first sight is one thing, usually lust and something va-va-voom, love at second sight is the lasting kind.<br>~ Cameron Crowe, director of Jerry Maguire<br><br>and i want that, love at second sight.<br>~ colette<br><br>[This message has been edited by colette (edited 02 July 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just a related qn to pose here:<br>Most of us nowadays have the choice to choose whom we want to be with to spend our lives, whether it be the one we love, the one who loves us or as most of us seek, mutual love. However why is it that when we have the choice to choose what is supposedly good for us that the marriage insitution is no longer as strong as before?<br><br>Previously just a few generations back or even some of our parents or grandparents, they marry at a young age. Some of them marry without any choice and it is a case of "mei shou zhi yan, fu mu zhi ming" aka "the matchmaker or the parents words are final in marriage" or even "zhi fu wei hun" translated as "matchmade while still in the womb". Somehow or other, a lot of them managed to live happily ever after even if they are left with no or limited choice of their partners. Why is that so? Does this suggest that love between strangers can be cultivated even after marriage? Why do we, nowadays given the choice and we make our own decisions end up with so much trouble before and after marriage and an increasing number of affairs and divorces?<br><br>Any views?<br><br>[This message has been edited by light (edited 02 July 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Crysania,<br><br>It is a very interesting question that you ask. On another level, it is about compromise and getting what you want. Both the relationships I have been thru, were of each feature.<br><br>The first relationship is that I fell in love with her, and the moment she broke my heart, it turned my world upside down.. Then when I met my 2nd ex-gf, she fell for me and after a lot of twists and turns, we went together even though she was totally opposite the kind of gf which I wanted to find. Just before a year I broke up with my second gf, I come to realize that I loved her, and I am willing to compromise because I was happy. Never did I realize, that it was her who broke my heart in the end. Perhaps, it was retribution in some sense. I used to think that I loved my first gf more because she is the woman I loved, and then I realized that I loved my 2nd gf more in the end, because of the times we have gone thru and all those little things which she care for me, made me love her. It is very strange that it would turn out this way....<br><br>Now I come back to the same question, to choose the person I love or to compromise by choosing the person who loves me. Actually after going thru both sides of the coin, I will prefer to love someone, because it pains me much more to lose someone who loves me and I have decided not to compromise anymore even if I have to be single. So, I choose the gal who I love.<br><br>yours,<br>Prodigal<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights. However, love is not about finding someone to relieve you, but love is about you devoting your heart and soul to love that someone, even if you know that someone do not love you the way you do."<br>- Prodigal</div>
