            <div class='col-md body'>I have changed my hp number recently but am not going to update any of the banks.  In fact, I never update any banks, nor CPF Board etc, except for my mailing address.  Reason being I have been receiving calls from insurance companies' telemarketers representing the banks to sell me insurance policy.  Yes, they are very attractive and cheap.  But I hate to make decision over the phone.  I prefer to read something, then sign up for it.<br><br>But some of the telemarketers refused to send me anything to read.  They would ask me "Why?  What's your concern?"  Once, I got really impatient and I told the girl "I told you I don't make decision over the phone.  I want to read something.  Which part you don't understand?"  After that the girl didn't send me anything at all, though I was interested to find out more (and might eventually buy from her).    Sometimes, it's the bank that calls me to persuade me to sign up for dunno what account.  But the bank is not so bad.  They will still send me fax for me to read.<br><br>I told the banks that I did not want to receive any calls from them or their representatives.  But still, every month, I receive at least two to three calls.  *pissed off<br><br>Recently, I changed my hp number with the change of my job.  It was a good chance for me to get rid of the telemarketers.  But then, ever since then, whenever I call the bank to ask for some info, they refuse to tell me right away and insist on having my hp number to call back.  Really.  Even a simple question like "When is the due date for this month?"  They claim that they have to call me back.  They cannot check on the screen, must check with another dept.  Before I change my handphone number, I didn't have this problem with them.  They could straight away tell me what I wanted to know, as long as it's a straightforward question like "Have you received my payment?" or "Have you sent out the statement?"<br><br>Why are banks so irritating?<br><br>Yesterday, I went to Citibank branch to apply for something.  The customer service staff said that I have to call the other dept via the citiphone located within the branch.  So I did as she told.  I called and the staff told me that she would fax the form to the branch for me to sign.  But she needed my hp number to call me back in 5 minutes.  I was like "WTF??".  What she needed to do is to fax the form to the branch and I sign on it and the branch staff fax it back to her.  What's so difficult?<br><br>I told the girl, I was already at the Citibank branch and if she needed to check on something &amp; call me back, she could do so by calling the branch and I would be there.  Otherwise, she should be able to assist me without me waiting for her call.  Still, she asked me again for my hp number.  I told her off and said, "I don't have a handphone, so don't ever ask me for my number again."  In the end, I didn't see her having to call me back.  Instead, she managed to process what I wanted, fax to the branch for me to sign.<br><br>UOB Bank was another troublemaker.  I asked for the due date of a certain bill.  They claimed that they have to call me back.  The same happened when I just wanted to check whether I have made payment for the credit card as I often make double payment without knowing.<br><br>Banks are irritating!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The telemarketing people are a real pain.  If they call you and insist that they don't have any reading material, don't believe them.  They just want to close the sale over the phone to meet the quota.  I worked in telemarketing long ago and was told that if the customer wanted reading materials, we could fax or mail to them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nowadays a lot of stuff is done online if the amount is not big enuff. Of course if you worry about security in the faceless internet I got nothing to say. With internet I pay a lot of my bills online. I still wonder if I should terminate my cheque book services since now most if not all banks offer internet banking.<br><br>However I draw the line at GIRO or if the amount to pay is big in the range of 10K above! GIRO problems I face is they are just too punctual and if I say to terminate GIRO I did not give enuff notice, they will deduct first and then tok later. This feature I find it undesirable. Getting money back after you have paid is always a time wasting and troubesome process.<br><br>So what about you all paying bills habits?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
