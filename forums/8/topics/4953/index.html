Although there are a few who actually give up on the relationship due to their bfs being in NS, I still feel that JC(or poly, whatever equivalent) is the time to do it. For losers like me who couldn't do anything in JC, I find out (but only from my experience) that most girls have already got someone on their minds.

            <div class='col-md body'>EcK.. You posted this comment that it's better to get a partner and settle down, for this, I remembered what my friend said. It's typical of many engine guys in local uni who want to settle down and start a family as soon as they graduate, not sure how true is this though.<br><br>This might not be a good thing if they want to go far in their career. At times, the job might requires staying oversea for an extended period, would these people still go ahead?? I doubt so.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry if i seem to be deviating from the main topic but charges against me need to be address.<br><br>Rinoa,<br><br>I HAVE wondered why I'm misunderstood (that sounds so pathetic). Perhaps I'm better at English than most here or we may have different types of syntax construction. Maybe being away from S'pore so long has made me rusty with the local vernacular, or perhaps I think differently from most SÂ’poreans, or perhaps IÂ’m older than most here Â– I donÂ’t know, I really don't know. To be honest I donÂ’t really care if IÂ’m misunderstood BUT I do realise my views will not be accurately put across if I do not pay close attention to the nature and manner of writing around here Â– and that would defeat the purpose of having a forum. So I shall try and write with more clarity.<br><br>Secondly, I donÂ’t believe in neutrality. Whatever the issue, if one ponders over it long and thoughtfully enough one will arrive at a view or opinion. Neutrality is often used as a guise for mental laziness. If I do come across strong in my views I do not apologise since this is a forum for contrasting ideas. I only wished people wouldnÂ’t take it so personally. It is important to test out personal ideas and it is natural that personal world-views are shaken when someone proposes a new way of looking. There is no shame or insult if the other party can present a case to combat the opposing one.<br><br>Lastly, I do not think highly of my abilities. I have seen and know enough to realise that they pale in comparison to some.<br><br>cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think that getting attached during uni is less risky than if u were to find a bf after venturing out into the workforce. From my own experience, the circle of friends gets smaller as u are working. There may be colleague and biz associates, but they are merely acquaintances who contact u only during biz dealings. Oso, these pple are usually more street smart and u may neber know wat they have on their minds. Students are "purer" and less contaminated by the gou1 xing1 dou4 jiao3 of the working world. So it is a safer option.<br><br>As for getting attached in JC or poly, I dun think its advisable, esp JCs. For the simple reason that NS is a great disadv to the guy compared to those suave and horny guys in the office and uni respectively. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Every change of environment brings with it new challenges and problems. So couples really have alot to deal with if they get attached too early. All in all, I still think that Uni provides a great attaching ground... anyway most of my cousins and frens got attached in uni, and are applying for flats oredi!<br><br>------------------<br>Have a break, have a TicTac...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know about local unis so I'll speak for the romantic situation of S'poreans at overseas unis.<br><br>When S'poreans come to overseas unis, they may be either single or attached (and if they are attached the partner is usually back in S'pore). Being strangers in a strange land, the community draws together very tightly and friendships are made very fast. Of course loneliness and homesickness helps in the bonding. Romantic relationships form like nobody's business. Getting a girlfriend is ABSOLUTELY no problem when you are in an overseas uni because of the sociological factors. SO if you need a boy/girl friend go abroad....If you prefer Asian to Caucasian helps, there is good regional mix of women (or men) as well from M'sians*, Hong Kong, Indonesian Chinese*, Thais, Taiwanese*, Japanese*, Korean...the list goes on. Hence, at the end of the day, it is a concoction of curiousity, variety, loneliness etc. that usually drives people into relationships here and if they are lucky, it works out. If not, they smile, thank each oher for a good time and move on.<br><br>(* personal recommendation.)<br><br>Secrets, Yes, when a woman is smarter and older than one, more often than not they hold very good jobs and earn good salaries. That may be intimidating if the man feels all he has to offer as a man is money and machoism. If a man thinks that he is a man solely on the premise of money he earns and his ability to 'protect' his woman then he will obviously entcounter some women who have risen above his abilities and need more than he can offer - as a result men who think like that will be redundant to higher educated women.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup, it's true that when you go oversea for further studies, the likelihood of finding someone there is slightly higher. I know of some friends who know each other while studying oversea and in the 2nd year there, they moved in with each other. Good thing about this is you saved up on accomodation cost. Still there are many more who go overseas and come back empty handed..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To attitude:<br>In any case, I agree with you. The way I see it, people are either meant to be together.<br><br>To Terrence, Luf and the rest :<br>I have been through both Singaporean and overseas university. It seems to me back in home that the nice gals in NUS are already attached. Most of the time, they have gotten themselves hitched. Maybe I have been around among the fortunate couples, as all of them have transited from JC to NS/Uni and to finally get married. So, perhaps, I have missed the ride when I was in JC and NUS...<br><br>When I am in England, things are slightly different. It is almost the same situation as what Terrence has described in his post. One thing is true about people I know here. Some of them get together for the 3 years that they are studying and then go seperate ways. I have a British gal friend who recently got hitched to an Irish guy after 2 years of heartbreak.. Yet she told me that she may not be together with him forever, and just see where the next train will take them. What I can see that people there can do, is to break off and going on living their own lives... Being at both sides, I have yet to locate any possible target.<br><br>For me, I will not mind having a wife who earns more or even more intelligent than me... I think at the end of the day, communication is the most important thing between a couple, or the other term,which gals like to justify themselves with : chemistry...<br><br>Sometimes, one have to ponder, do you want a moment of brilliance or a truly lasting r/s? I prefer to have the latter, because I do not have to anticipate another heartbeak....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> What about you?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... just a couple of stray thoughts after prolonged exposure to the threads in the forum :- *sorry*<br><br>a) A substantial amount of exposition on the perceived values of educational "qualifications" seemed to reflect a worrying misconception. What does it mean for the NTU girls mentioned earlier, to get attached to a person of higher or equal qualifications? That they are prefixing notions of intelligence to certificates?<br><br>When we talk about the "dun mind lah, just as long can communicate can alreadi", the register is at the level of paper rather than the actual interaction. In an Foucaultian twist, power relations are externalised ; the object (the certificate) becomes the subject (the relationship).<br><br>And so we use the educational yardstick too promiscuously to decribe for us essentially different things : a yearning for communication being equated to having an empirical (but fallacious) object. It is unfortunate that certain people I meet with wonderful letters after their names, cannot articulate any creative, independent thought, esp the MBAs in Singapore, who still thinks Marx is a dirty word and those who talk abt materialist capitalism describes people who should be locked up by the ISD  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I hope I am not digressing from the topic as what I meant to show is that on a general basis, Singaporeans register too many values into objects to quantify their social relations (love) and that it is important to discard the driftwood from the timber. Resorting to statements like "If Love is strong ..." is actually misplacing the context as what really showed the character was "dun care if she O levels or Masters".<br><br>b)  So how and when do you get attached? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> Who the hell cares? I mean, it's when you are comfortable with the a relationship! Girls in universities are seldom different from the girls in polytechnics are a base level. So to maintain a discussion on that basis is discouraging to say the least of people who hold the "Luuurve conquers all"  :p<br><br>c) Another stray thought is that I noticed the discourse here is generally of a Cartesian response, as in, a social relation has to conform to issues of rationality. For example, TicTac talks abt "risks" and Eck and Luv talks abt, also, risk assessment of "settling down" in the discourse of economics (i.e. opportunity cost). Not that there is any negative views on that... but it is an observation which could be linked back to misplacement of the register of values.<br><br>If the above rationalist response is maintained, to speak of "dun mind someone who is higher/lower qualified than me" is inherently contradictory. They have every right to mind then. Doesn't that strike you as being unfair?  :p<br><br>cheers.<br><br>------------------<br>Cindy Crawford,<br>ON COURAGE...<br>"They were doing a full back shot of me in a swimsuit and I thought, Oh my God, I have to be so brave.
