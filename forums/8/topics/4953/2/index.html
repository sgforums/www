            <div class='col-md body'>Barclays,<br><br>The promiscuity of education as yardstick is symptomatic of the metanarratve most Singaporeans subscribe to. As a realised form of dominant ideology in the Althusserian Ideological State Apparatus sense, cultural discourse (even social) is articulated in dialectic form with this ideology. Only by appealing to a common experience will the ethos of any articulation of a message, amongst a people so subjugated to metanarrative, be ideologically homogenised enough. As such officially sanctioned avenues are most appropriate to give a homogenised expression to sentiments what will thus find optimum cognitive sympathy. This is why many MBA holders cannot express themselves, why so many NUS grads lack the means for an intellectual subterfuge against edu-cultural norms and why most in this forum articulate education as some sort of metonym for love. And as a result we get the Foucaultian externalisation.<br><br>cheers<br></div>

I believe the only difference between someone with a high iq and someone with a low iq is the time taken to think a thought and find a link between information.<br>So thus i believe in relationships eq is very important cos i mean if time is the only factor well wouldnt u rather have someone u could talk to along the way about insignificant thingies while waiting for thought in unison?<br>ps pardon the badly pharased sentences</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello all....guess I have not posted for some time....I was simply waiting for a good topic. So here goes... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I am an NTU student Accountancy who has almost finished his studies and gonna graduate soon. The situation is NTU is really rather interesting. Let's split this up first...first year, second year and final year girls....(All this applies to Accounts and Business Studies Faculty in NTU...so please DON'T Generalise)....<br><br>First year girls go into NTU acting blur blur...join orientation and get to know lots and lots of new GUYS. At this point, I would give it a rough estimate that at this point about 30 % of all the girls are attached...either thru JC, Poly or Sec school even. Their Bf would be either in the Army, in NTU/NUS or overseas. This would leave a significant 70% of girls for "chasing".<br><br>Thus the first year is the most "lucrative" for a guy who is unattached (better still if he is staying in Hostel !). Most guys go all out to chase girls in the first year. Most succeed....except for those either EXTREMELY blur (like me !)....or extremely shy or BOTH ! There are also some unfortunate guys who end up liking a girl who is already attached, and just sit and stare at her in tutorials everyday (this sounds familiar too)....<br><br>By second year, the statistics would have shifted. Probably about 70% of girls are attached or WERE attached before...those already attached before coming to NTU either break up with their bf (an estimated 30%) or else continue their relationship (70%)....<br><br>Those girls attached in first year usually stay so....this is according to personal observations. Also, the second year is when guys get a little more desperate if they have been "asleep" during the first year. As a result, more girls get attached....<br><br>By third and final year, things have sort of stabilized. About 75 % of girls in ACC/BUS faculty are attached....and this includes girls who broke up so badly with theur bf that they are disillusioned about love (So this excludes them from being chased). This leaves a paltry 25% left for the remainder guys to chase....and believe me there are quite a few unattached guys still by third year ! (ahem !)<br><br>As someone had mentioned, it is really more difficult to find girls after Uni, because most are already applying for flats ! ALso, work commitments tend to be very tight...and when one first starts work as an auditor (which most ACC grads do), it is a busy and hectic job, with not much time for socialisation.<br><br>Thus, the remainder girls who are unattached throughout Uni will not find it easy to find a partner, and the same goes for a guy too.<br><br>YET ! There are quite a few girls unattached throughout their ENTIRE University lives. Some reasons include: (1) Studies are more important - The workaholic girl who thinks about getting honours and a good job....guys are a secondary thought ! (2) Not ready for a BGR - Guess some think they are not "mature" enough....hope they think so soon cos some of these girls are quite good really. (3) Broke up before and scared of guys/BGR - Blame the ex-bf for instilling such thoughts in the girl....some have to wait till 2 years after the breakup to try loving a man again....<br><br>Of the 3 categories, (3) is the easiest to tackle after graduation. Face it....(1) just wants to be a career woman and (2) never really knows when she is ready (perhaps NEVER ?).<br><br>I would say category (3) girls are only about 3 to 5 % among the current graduating cohort of students from ACC and BUS in NTU. Of course, one might say that there are "more fish in the ocean" when one goes to work, rather than just the Uni batch of girls.<br><br>This is TRUE....and it's a comforting thought to all unattched guys AND girls who have never been attached b4 or have felt disillusioned by love in Uni.<br><br>So good luck to all of you and please.....learn to love yourself first if you wish to love someone else !!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ummm... Terence, who say its easier to get a gf in uni when u are abroad? i think it really has to do with the location of ur university first man... I'm at a uni in Indiana, USA and trust me... there are no girls here. I've never had a gf at all during my uni life and i'm gonna grad in 1 yrs time. Ratio of guyz to girls 4:1 coz this is engineering school. This is not east or west coast where there are lots of mixed couples going out so forget abt asking white girls out... white girls here look for asian guyz dat look like white guys... so unless u mixed, u ain't gettin' no vanilla ice cream ok? As for the asian population here... lets just say its depressing... All the girls who come here only 5% are worth going after, da rest juz aren't my type. Also, da really pretty ones are wives of graduate students... so dat one also out too...I'm still surprised my standards haven't gone down... maybe itz coz i come back to spore and get updated =)<br><br>To me, it seems like cute spore girls go to Canada or UK or Australia... none come to Indiana, USA man... So as much as uni girls in my uni is concerned, i really dun have much to say. But i tink ger in spore uni SHOULD be very desirable =)</div>

There's this unsaid competition between guys in Engineering faculty. When the guys are in the first year, they have the highest chance of getting a gf. If by second year, they still haven't gotten a girlfriend, they might still have a chance 'cos some girls will still find 'slightly' older guys attractive. BUT by third year, you're considered an old man alreadi.<br><br>Anyway, if a gal can't get a bf thoughout her uni days, most likely is she hangs out with her group of girl-friends too much...guys afraid to approach a group of girls.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Barclays:<br><br>Thats why I added the words "in this area" when I was talking about wasting time. For some people (ok for me at least) getting attached is one part of life in uni that seems to be interesting enough to warrant trying, if you can. I am NOT saying that I go to LOOK for relationships in uni, because I didn't, and I am not going to. You can't force these sort of things. Good if you can be part of it, fine if you can't.<br><br>Regardless of what you think about me thinking people like to compare themselves against others, I really think we do that all the time. So many surveys, so many studies, so many questions. Condoms, how many times people in different countries do it, etc. What for? Isn't it because we want to know where we stand? What you do with that knowledge is none of my business. I just think that people like to know.<br><br>You last point about being hollow to go into a relationship as an objective to be met... thats what I think too, although I'm not sure if thats why most relationships fail.<br><br>Still, what we can objectively see from the sidelines becomes totally different when we are in the heat of it. We think up of many different justifications for doing things. In other situations we just heck care and do it anyway.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Shervon99:<br>haha .. you probably ..and should know who I am .. but I dissagree on your point .. and yes .. boredom has got to me .. so I am now more active into forums. ok .. I dissagree that eng student should get a gf before 3rd year .. coz getting a gf for the sake of getting it is not a good idea .. you might end up with someone you might regret. I think it's better being single then being attached with someone you would regret eventually .. at least you keep your options open. anyway .. if you consider 3rd year old ah .. leow man .. but then again if you are in singapore you should be 24 lah .. but then again .. that's not that old wat..anyway don't you see all the old man getting really young girlfriends .. (*then again could be coz of money lah*) .. anyway .. let's leave this topic for open discussion. Eng courses are famous for having a lack of women anyway .<br><br>------------------<br>ZeroS</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It would rarely work for the guy if he is to approach a group of girls. 1stly, the girl would be too shy to accept the approach, 2ndly, if he fails, all the girls would know, then they might spread the news.. super malu. Also if in the future you like one of the girl in the group, and she know what you had done, what would she think then.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
