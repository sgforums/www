Don't forget, they don't just take care of planes on the runway, they also have to watch out for planes in holding patterns, etc.<br><br>A crude analogy would be this. The ATCs function as traffic lights, to ensure that planes do not collide with one another.

            <div class='col-md body'>Arbiter, that is where you are wrong. That is precisely the role of an air traffic controller, to babysit the pilot. There are quite a number of positions in the tower itself. From the start up of the airplane, to the taxing of airplane, all these are not within the scope of the AIR traffic controller. The main duty of the air traffic controller is basically to ensure the runway is clear for takeoff, to coordinate with other agencies (I think this part is confidential), and honestly, it is very very seldom you have jumbo jets holding at a pattern in an aerodrome. If that happens, it will be a major major screw up on the controller's part. But I have yet to point out the rest of the members of the tower crew, which I guess I am not at liberty to say. But I think you get my point. The Air Traffic Controller has as major a part to play in this as well as the pilot and co-pilots. The careers of those in the tower and those in the cockpits are basically ruined. I guess I should put the full stop here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

There are a lot of other contributing factors that brought about this accident.<br><br>I'm not sure if the Straits Times reported the international standards for airport runways, 'cos if you read the article, it will be obvious that the Taiwan Civil Aviation Authorities followed none of the points stated. Can someone sue them please?<br><br>And it's so disgusting to hear the director/chief of the Taiwan Civil Aviation Authority saying that the pilot should be entirely responsible for the tragedy, trying to shrugg off any reponsibility. If the crashing plane belongs to Taiwan's airline, they won't be that happy making that statement.<br><br>Shouldn't anyone blame those construction workers for not driving those evaucation machines to some storage area instead of letting lying around? Well, I know the rain is heavy, but that's just irresponsible of them to leave things around.<br><br>Anyway, what was the airline that was directly waiting after SQ plane for takeoff? Does it belong to Taiwan? If I'm the prosecutor, I would definitely sue the two pilots who claimed to have seen SQ taxing into the wrong runway, sueing them for trying to hide information... yeah hor, what to sue them for?<br><br>Moose: They have a radar that detects air traffic above certain heights, but not ground traffic (which they have plans to install).<br><br>Stingray: Yeah lor... that's the purpose what... if not just post a one-liner if where got interesting... so many possibilites what...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
