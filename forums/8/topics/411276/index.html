              <p>Dear all,</p>
              <p>I would like to hear your opinions on whether people will judge you based on the school you are from. Strict meritocracy is practised in Singapore and most people judge others based on their academic results and the school they are from(some may deny but this is definitely true to a certain extent). Do you think people in Singapore are too affected by branding? I am from a mid-range junior college in Singapore and some people i know have already pointed out that i am "lousy". Super Demoralising.</p>

              <p>well, at least I can say for sure that if you are going for govt job, you will be judged on your academic results.   Some govt companies have their job application forms to get the candidates to fill in details of their academic results.    </p>
