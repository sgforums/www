If China would give her alot of insentives do u think she wans to come here? And Susilo, he got his citizenship 2 years ago. He trained since 8 years old in inodnesia and his brother in law is the famous Mr Wijaya playing for indonesian doubles. When i am being approach by my indonesian frens...we exchange alot of thoughts....Finally they manage to put me into dillemma...whether are these foreign sportsmen really fight for $$ or country. or izit that they really hate thier own country?<br><br>I do acknowledge that alot of countries actually import players. But isnt this situation is simliar with money can buy anything? ( except life  and health lah) The poorer country cant afford to pay so much...can only expect thier citizen wont run away by attractive insentives. I really wish that in future, singapore wouldnt rely on foreign talents to get some medals in the olympics. Becoz each time when i try to boast about these atheletes...i will get a gang bang from my universities frens which consist of msian, indonesian, PRC and vietnamnese. Believe it or not..to them...singapore is weak in sport. That's y they say bla bla bla..singapore need to "buy " talent...use money to get them here; what to do singapore government got money mah...therefore...i REALLY do hope that one day...a light will shower upon singaporean to fight for thier own country and not letting others to do so.<br><br>just my 2 cents worth.</div>
