Reading this is a waste of time.<br><br>As for the foreign talent thingy, obviously u are lost in the world of sports (while trying to be an expert in this field). For years the other countries have been taking in foreign talent. Eg. when France won the World Cup soccer, half the team comprised non French nationals....they were originally from Africa.</div>
