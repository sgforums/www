              <p>Hi everyone!</p>
              <p>First off, I'm not sure if I'm posting in the correct forum. I have seach around SGforums looking for a similar post but am not really able to find one. If I am posting in the wrong fourm, do let me let me know! </p>
              <p>I'm 20 this year, graduated from Ngee Ann Poly with a Diploma in Psychology. I'm very interested in pursuing my further studies in Psychology in an Australian University. My family has no objections to it, but they are very much like 'you are an adult, you make your own decisions'. My family is of an average income. </p>
              <p>So yes, I've took a few baby steps on my own, like searching on the Australian Universities tuition fees and also to submit my applications at the past IDP fair. I opted to take a Bachelor of Arts, Major in Psychology. Am also interested to take another Major/Minor in Criminology. </p>
              <p>Some of my questions include: </p>
              <p>1) For a degree in Psychology, which Aussie University?<br>I did asked my advisor at IDP, he said University of Melbourne. But it's way too expensive for me. I would really love to go, but out of my financial capability. So it boils down to two choices; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">University of Queensland</span> or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">University of Adelaide</span>? <br>Both the schools offer me advance standing la. </p>
              <p>2) Regarding the study loans?<br>I am truly lost about this! Initially I wanted to take a bank loan, but I later found out that banks only offer for local universities and you will need a income (?) So I decided that  I will take a loan from my mother. But as she is old and still working, I don't want to take the full lump sum from her. So i'm intending to take a half-half. Half from mother, half from bank. Is it possible? </p>
              <p>So far these are more of the pressing questions. Other problems like accomdation and things like that I will have to ask later, haha! </p>
              <p>So sorry for the long essay! Replies will be much appreciated! </p>

              <p>Why didn't you try SIM Global Education like US University of Buffalo Bachelor of Arts in Psychology ?</p>
              <p>For your info, the difference in US and Australia degree are Australia degree do carry their own "ranking" after you graduated like 1st class honors and 2nd class honors etc, if your academic result are excellent by all mean you can choose Australia degree, otherwise this grading will be an disadvantage for your career advancement, for US degree as long as you pass their GPA grade, you can graduated with their degree without been judged by whether you are 1st class honors and 2nd class honors holder.</p>
              <p>If finanical is your obstacle, you can always apply for scholarship either from the Australia university of your choice or locally, but usually local scholarship tended to require you for served their bond upon completed of your degree course : <a href="http://brightsparks.com.sg">http://brightsparks.com.sg</a></p>

              <p><br>Did think of studying locally before, but studying overseas was some sort like a dream for me. Not to go there to play or what, but just to experience life on my own, a different education system. </p>
              <p>James Cook is my backup plan, in the event that this studying overseas stint does not fall through. Don't really want SIM, cuz I just kinda want a different education environment. </p>
              <p>My results are average. Good enough to get into private, not good enough for local. Got rejected by NTU and NUS.</p>
              <p>I submitted five applications through IDP (kiasu, i know). To Uni of Melb, Uni of Sydney, UNSW, Uni of Queensland and Uni of Adelaide. They all accepted, so now it's up to me to choose. Melb is that I'm afraid that the living cost will kill me. UNSW and Sydney doesn't offer the programme I want to international students. So that's why I have to two remaining to choose from. </p>
              <p>Is it correct to say that most scholarships offered are usually bonded by govt? </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Universities in the USA use a "liberal arts" model that develops broadly educated graduates who have strong writing, reading, research, and problem-solving skills. That means you will be prepared for virtually any job or career. Students at U.S. colleges and universities are active participants in their education. Individually, in research and project teams, and in the classroom, you will be encouraged to think critically, be creative, ask questions, and apply concepts in real-world situations.</p>

              <p>Which U.S. universities are best? Your goal is not to find the "best" university; it is to find the university that is best for you! Will you be most comfortable at a large school or a small one, in a warm climate or a colder one, in a city or in a suburban or rural area?

              <p>Take up cricket. Those idiot queenlanders can relate to you on that.</p>
              <p>Also, being psycologist have its perks there. THe racist aussies will love you for it. They belief in the power of Zoloft, Xanax and Prozac. Yes the aussies are drug addicts in the legal sense, they belief that the anti-psychotic and depressant drugs are solution to their problems.</p>
              <p>Psychiatrist is a con-man job (sorry to say). They just sit there and listen to people problems, and never tell their patients any solution. Instead their solution is to prescribe drugs. They are in cahoots with the big pharma companies.</p>
              <p>There  are a lot of perks. The psychotic industry is big bucks for pharma companies. So they regularly bribe psychiatrist to induce them to sell their drugs. The competition is hot. If you are a guy, they send you all sort sof escort girls, free umbrellas, free leisure traveling to popular tourist havens like Bali, US virgin islands. Not to mention you get to splurge on free overseas conventions subsidised by big pharma companies including your hotel stay and your airplane ticket.</p>
              <p>If you truly want to help people, then be a psychologist not a psychiatrist.</p>
              <p>As for James Cook. Why want to study there? Nobody heard of it. Please go to a reputable university. Uni of melb is expensive, yes. But you have an enjoyable uni life. There are a lot of places to hang out there. Ok ok, granted brisbane weather is sunny and nice unlike the gloomy weather of melb.</p>
              <p>And when you stay there, watch out for the stupid indian migrants. Damn stupid, especially the taxi drivers. Very inconsiderate. Don't even pick up the luggage for you. Scold them with four letter words if you have to. Its no surprise the aussies hate them because of their "don't care attitude".  </p>

              <p>Don't listen to those who say there's racism against Asians. I never experienced anything but warmth and good friendship from the Aussies I met in Melbourne.
