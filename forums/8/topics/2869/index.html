            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly speaking, I don't seek a lot of attention from anyone in face to face. In fact , i favour more in being alone than rather to be someone. I was brought up with FEW friends anyway.<br>Even though if i am now a christian, i just kept my same isolation attitude and do not interact a lot of other people than those i m familar with. It shows that i don't really care about others.<br>But it goes deeper. As i tried to get my unsaved friends &lt; i know face to face &gt; to at least COME AND WATCH ( that's simple ) to some of my church services, they simply said they are not interested .  I can't force them to come if they aren't interested because i pratice Free will to let others choose what they want to do.  With a cost of not being interested in worldly people . It really impacts me of not communicating with normal people whether or not they use vulgarities as if it is normal to do so.<br><br>I do appear on Galaxynet . But at this point,  i don't chat to my church mates  and ignore any people who i don't know and i don't like having idle chat with strangers.<br><br>Over and out.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm..somtimes I think its better to have a few good friends than many aquintances. We're talking about the quality of friendship here, not the quality  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">. But of course you'll have to admit that no man is an island and socialising is a very important skill, especially when it comes to teamwork and networking. Honestly if you want to make it in life, these are skills you will have to work on, even though you are a loner at heart. Of course, as with everything in life, don't overdo it.<br><br>You know, sometimes it does not matter what other people think of you.

            <div class='col-md body'>One of the most important goals of the charismastic Christian is actually to evangelise. But I guess it doesn't make you special or anything. After all people come in all shapes and sizes and God's plans for each individual, Christian or otherwise, differs. We have our own outlooks in life, we have our own responsibilities.. so surely perhaps our views towards being a good Christian differ... Some Christians think evangelising is most important.. Some Christians think helping others is more important.. Some Christians feel that the essential part of being who they are is to praise God and believe in Him in a personal way... Then of course there are other Christians who don't see the meaning of being Christian other than going to church...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup, have to agree with EcK.<br><br>Dunno why, but most ppl think that being a loner is a bad thing... not really true, it's quite fulfilling and refreshing sometimes.<br><br>Besides, as EcK puts it, being around many friends is not always the immediate solution to loneliness.

            <div class='col-md body'>dear ECk<br>maybe ur feeling lonely even when ur around a group of friends cos maybe there not friends ur love as in love:a situation where u feel totally fearless and safe. Thus in a position where u can be urself without having to worry about what ur friends are going to think of u. IMHO(in my humble opinion) u should get comfortable with yourself first so that u can feel less lonely then maybe perhaps ur wont need to umm rely on friends for umm well a solution to lonlyness.</div>
