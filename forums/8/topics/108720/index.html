            <div class='col-md body'>Today I went back to my old work place to get together with my ex colleagues.<br><br>I arrived there and I called my ex manager, who straightaway announced my arrival.  They were all cheering and thrilled.  Yes, we were all very close and work like good friends and family, before.   And we are still very good friends.<br><br>So they came out and we proceed to the lunch place.  We were laughing, joking, teasing each other like in the old time.  Just then, I saw a woman eyes big big, never blink, stared at me rudely as she walked closer from the opposite direction.<br><br>It was the 50 year old female director (aka teenager wannabe) that I mentioned in my old threads:<br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=80563" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=80563</a><br>&amp; <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=67237&amp;page=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=67237&amp;page=2</a><br><br>I didn't recognised her cuz this 50 year old woman did a hair extension recently.  Otherwise, I would mumble something not so nice to her like "Old lady, be careful, don't fall down".<br><br>She literally gave me the kind of stare that gave the message,"What the hell are you doing at my place?"  She forgot that's a tourist attraction and I'm a member aka her customer.  My membership fee went into her salary.<br><br>I can't believe that a 50 year old woman, a mother of 2 kids, doesn't know how to behave.  I have no kid, I still know the basic courtesy.  Moreover she just got promoted to a senior director.  Doesn't she know how to behave like an educated person? Let alone a top management personnel.<br><br>I hope she gets to read this.  There is no slandering cuz I have the whole dept of people witness her rude stare.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wah reading this story reminds me of my ex-director.<br><br>She has a bad temper. Everyday scold people. Everyday shout.<br><br>She has to do things her own way, her own system. If u disagree with her and have a suggestion, she will not take it. You must follow her exact instruction.<br><br>When she scold you, you cannot try to explain yourself. If u attempt to explain urself, she thinks u are trying to argue with her.<br><br>She likes to micro-manage. When she sees a staff working, she will ask "What are you doing now?" If she is not satisfied, she will give instructions what the staff should be doing. Even until the very small things.<br><br>She will change her instructions many times during the day. U must follow her latest instruction.<br><br>If she wants u to do something, u must stop whatever you are doing and do what she wants. Immediately.<br><br>Most of all, her temper is simply very bad. Nobody is immune from her scolding. And when she scold u, she raises her voice until very loud.<br><br>That company has a very high rate of staff turnover. I can say the main reason is because of this over-controlling and bad-tempered director. People just come and go. I myself couldnt stand her. Anyways I didnt resign because of her. It was mutual between the company and me because there was no more work for me.<br><br>People like her need to learn management skills. They should attend management classes and courses to know how to properly manage the staff.<br></div>
