            <div class='col-md body'>Reel Facts!<br>50 Things You Would Never Know if<br>it Weren't For the Screen.<br>All Of Life's Mysteries are on Your TV!<br><br>1. If staying in a haunted house, women should investigate any strange noises wearing their most revealing underwear.<br><br>2. If being chased through town, you can usually take cover in a passing St Patrick's Day parade -- at any time of the year.<br><br>3. All beds have special L-shaped top sheets that reach up to armpit level on a woman but only waist level on the man lying beside her.<br><br>4. All grocery shopping bags contain at least one stick of French bread.<br><br>5. It's easy for anyone to land a plane, providing there is someone in the control tower to talk you down.<br><br>6. Once applied, lipstick will never rub off - even while scuba diving.<br><br>7. The ventilation system of any building is a perfect hiding place. No one will ever think of looking for you in there and you can travel to any other part of the building without difficulty.<br><br>8. You're likely to survive any battle in any war unless you make the mistake of showing someone a picture of your sweetheart back home.<br><br>9. Should you wish to pass yourself off as a German officer, it will not be necessary to speak the language. A German accent will do.<br><br>10. The Eiffel Tower can be seen from any window of any building in Paris.<br><br>11. People of TV never finish their drinks.<br><br>12. A man will show no pain while taking the most ferocious beating but will wince when a woman tries to clean his wounds.<br><br>13. The chief of police is always black.<br><br>14. When paying for a taxi, never look at your wallet as you take out a note just grab one at random and hand it over. It will always be the exact fare.<br><br>15. If you lose a hand, it will cause the stump of your arm to grow by 15cm.<br><br>16. Kitchens don't have light switches. When entering a kitchen at night, you should open the fridge door and use that light instead.<br><br>17. During all police investigations, it will be necessary to visit a strip club at least once.<br><br>18. Mothers routinely cook eggs, bacon and waffles for their family every morning, even though the husband and children never have time to eat them.<br><br>19. Cars and trucks that crash will almost always burst into flames.<br><br>20. Wearing a singlet or stripping to the waist can make a man invulnerable to bullets.<br><br>21. A single match will be sufficient to light up a room the size of a football stadium.<br><br>22. If a killer is lurking in your house, it's easy to find him. Just relax and run a bath - even if it's the middle of the afternoon.<br><br>23. Medieval peasants had perfect teeth.<br><br>24. Although in the 20th century it is possible to fire weapons at an object out of visual range, people of the 23rd century will have lost this technology.<br><br>25. All single women have a cat.<br><br>26. Any person waking from a nightmare will sit bolt upright and pant.<br><br>27. Even when driving down a perfectly straight road, it is necessary to turn the steering wheel vigorously from left to right every few moments.<br><br>28. One man shooting at 20 men has a better chance of killing them all than 20 men firing at one.<br><br>29. Creepy music coming from a graveyard should always be closely investigated.<br><br>30. If a phone line is broken, communication can be restored by frantically beating the cradle and saying, "Hello?, Hello?"<br><br>31. Most people keep a scrapbook of newspaper cutting - especially if any of their family or friends has died in a strange boating accident.<br><br>32. It does not matter if you are heavily outnumbered in a fight involved martial arts - your enemies will wait patiently to attack you one by one by dancing around in a threatening manner until you have knocked out their predecessor.<br><br>33. During a very emotional confrontation, instead of facing the person you are speaking to, it is customary to stand behind them and talk to their back.<br><br>34. When you turn out the light to go to bed, everything in your room will still be clearly visible, just slightly bluish.<br><br>35. Dogs always know who's bad and will naturally bark at them.<br><br>36. Police departments give their officers personality tests to make sure they are deliberately assigned a partner who is their total opposite.<br><br>37. When they are alone, all foreigners prefer to speak English to each other.<br><br>38. Action heroes never face charges for manslaughter or criminal damage despite laying entire cities to waste.<br><br>39. No matter how badly a spaceship is attacked, its internal gravity system is never damaged.<br><br>40. If there is a deranged killer on the loose, this will coincide with a thunderstorm that has brought down all the power and phone lines in the vicinity.<br><br>41. You can always find a chainsaw whenever you're likely to need one.<br><br>42. Rather than wasting bullets, megalomaniacs prefer to kill their arch-enemies using complicated machinery involving fuses, pulley systems, deadly gases, lasers and man eating sharks that will allow their captives at least 20 minutes to escape.<br><br>43. Having a job of any kind will make all fathers forget their son's eighth birthday.<br><br>44. Many musical instruments - especially wind instruments and accordions can be played without moving the fingers.<br><br>45. All bombs are fitted with electronic timing devices with large red readouts so you know exactly when they're going to go off.<br><br>46. It is always possible to park directly outside the building you are visiting.<br><br>47. Guns are like disposable razers - if you run out of bullets, just throw the gun away. You can always buy a new one.<br><br>48. Make-up can safely be worn to bed without smudging.<br><br>49. A detective can only solve a case once he has been suspended from duty.<br><br>50. If you decide to start dancing in the street, everyone you bump into will know all the steps.<br><br>THE END</div>
