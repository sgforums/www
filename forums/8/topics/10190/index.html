            <div class='col-md body'>THE initial excitement is gone, the crowds have dwindled. These days, Speakers' Corner in Chinatown, seems desolate as it plays host to only a few die-hards.<br><br>Last week, there were no more than three names up on the nearby police post listed to speak on any one day. The crowd was sparse, the ice-cream seller -- who used to be a regular -- was not there either.<br><br>Gone too are the students who livened up the Corner in its first few days in September.<br><br>But this has not flagged the spirits of the speakers who are still there.<br><br>Former Colombo Plan scholar Tan Kim Chuang made his 20th appearance on Friday and told The Sunday Times that he would continue making his regular Friday and Sunday appearances.<br><br>""I don't think we can expect too much here. In the spirit of S21, we have to be active citizens and speak up on the issues," said the senior vice-president of a stockbroking firm.<br><br>""I am here to speak my mind and I have a rapport with the people. If there is no one here, I will talk to the grass."<br><br>As Mr Tan began speaking on the jailing of landlords, the Central Provident Fund and S21 among other things, a crowd of around 10 people began to surround him.<br><br>It was a far cry from the numbers that milled around him in the early days.<br><br>When the corner opened on Sept 1, there were more than 20 speakers registered.<br><br>On Friday, three -- including Mr Tan -- were registered initially and a fourth registered to speak at around 6 pm.<br><br>So what has happened to the Corner?<br><br>Administration assistant Mavis Choo, 26, passes Hong Lim Park after work and said she has seen a visible drop in the numbers of both speakers and their audience.<br><br>She said: ""Maybe people are bored listening to the same thing every day. Even the ice-cream man that used to be here in the evenings doesn't come by so often."<br><br>""I think when people see cameras and reporters around, it attracts a crowd. But since there is not much media attention these days, maybe there is less interest."<br><br>Miss Choo said when the media seems interested in listening to a speaker, passers-by will stop and listen as they feel that the person has something interesting to say.<br><br>Mr Ong, who declined to give his full name, who claims to be a regular, said: "Whatever the response, I hope this place does not close. Singaporeans should come and at least listen because this definitely better than shopping or going out."<br><br>------------------<br>Don't blame me for being heartless if you are cruel to me in the first place</div>
