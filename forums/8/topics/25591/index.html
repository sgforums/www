SIngapore universities are like factories. Lookng at the secondary education, the number of stupid subjects is also alarming. Geography, literature, history, chemistry, you name it, they have it. What i mean is, even though you can choose what you don't want to study, the fact is that you still have to study those that you loathe to study. It boils down to one simple question. What are  their relevance?</div>
