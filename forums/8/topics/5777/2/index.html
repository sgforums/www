            <div class='col-md body'>Wah, Patie, Attitude, Altrex,<br>The things you guys are talking abt really brings back memories...used to listen to Wang Jie, Cai Xin Juan and my favourite song ever is Eric Moo's 'Yi Wang Guo Qu'<br><br>I loved the XinYao era becos,we were growing up and the songs sang my life in school, at home, in love....<br><br>I felt that with a guitar and a good voice, songs were so much more grounded, so much more real. That is why I still go back to Ming Ge Chan Tings whenever I come back to S'pore and lose myself, even for awhile in Li Lian's voice singing 'Rang Ye Qing Qing Luo Xia'.<br>And the Dreamz FM have been around longer than this. I wonder how many people still remember them singing 'live' in a cafe a few years back?<br>BTW, I'm 23.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Lomg time huh?</div>

"xi shui chang liu" is also one of my fave songs. songs like that cannot be found these days. Just a few basic instruments in the background and pure singing.<br><br>True, Panda used to be like that, but now a bit too commercialised, though I still prefer his version of "wo zhen de ai chuo"<br><br>i still remember the early days of 933 awards when Pan Mei Chen was like unbeatable in Fave female singer. Poor Stella Chang Ching Fang was always nominated but never got it.<br><br>Still.....times have changed and often, the musical style is different. We should move with the times and with regards to that, kudos to Jacky Cheung for being very willing to explore new frontiers.<br><br></div>
