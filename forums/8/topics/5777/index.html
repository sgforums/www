            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone,<br><br>ya..i agreed tht after the SOUND album things really not tht great for BEYOND...Maybe it's the lack of composer and also..jiaju was the lead guitarist and the best Vocal of the 4 of them( FYI, he actually went for Vocal operation to increase his vocal note)....<br><br>Well, i don't relly listen to group..well mabye just listening to their songs not paying particular attention to it..Well, when China first started their own rock bands, i brought one of the collection of China rock singers...Relly a good one i can say...From the album can really feel the anger in them with the social and other unfair treatment...Anodize is on eof the group inside the album...<br><br>FEY : Well i went to Ai QIn Hai b4...Quite good..the atmosphere is nice too... Although the Mu chuan in Apollel centre is near my house, i didn't go there b4 just walk pass...Hmm..should go one of these day sia...<br><br>Anyway, just curious how old are all of them out there...I'm 24 this year...have been listening to music since very young.....have been buying my firwst cassette tape when i'm prim 5.  Anyone here also support Huang Shu jun and those more talented singers? Like zhangyu, Fan Ren(Disband liao), Yu guang hua, zhang xiao wen,etc.....<br><br>Hope to hear all of your comments soon..</div>

I'm 24 as mentioned b4....Actually spend most of my childhood at chinatown and got influence by the Pop song..from cantonese to chiense to english...<br><br>As for cai xinjuan , i think the first song i can remember should be "dong fang nue hai"..As for Andy lau..i actually saw him long time b4 during 1983 when he first visited singapore..my sis used to be his fan and brought me along...he was bold head then...Hmm..pretty long then...<br><br>Okie hear u all..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FYI..Cai chunjia is going to have her own album soon..I think she got popular after singing "won kan jian le" for wu tai ju.."wo zai hu bian 1999"...and though she looked ordinary she can really sing...<br><br>Cai Lilian...well, she can sing but lack of the "xin wei"...I mean like Zhou Hui has got good singing voice but she really does not possess the looks and sad to say, she really  had to depend on her loyal fans to survive...I mean in order to be a well-reowned shi li pai ge shou...U have to have lotsa advertisement....and xuan chuan..or else...U can't go far...<br><br>When I was young, I listened to Little Tigers and Jeff Chang...and I dun think anyone who knew a girl's group called You huan pai dui....most of the singers I like is from Taiwan anyway...Now...I am more into Qiqin and Faye Wong..and the bai ting bu yan older songs from Wang Jie like duo shao ci as well as Baby I am you man...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmmm... talking about Huang Shujun he is one really talented songwriter and producer... he may not sing too well but darn his songs are funny!(esp. in his early era) I like singer-songwriters alot and give them a lot of respect. Esp. Tao Ze, I followed him when he first released his first album and have been listening to his songs since.<br><br>Others like Panda(wayyyy to commercialised now, great first album), You Hong Ming(darn melachonic songs) and Jimmy Ye(now where did he go?)<br><br>------------------<br>Why? Why me?<br><br></div>
