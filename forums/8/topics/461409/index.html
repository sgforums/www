              <p>Forgive me for saying this if you're a Singaporean Indian as my topic only directs at Indian nationals working in Singapore! I was called up for work as a traffic controller at Little India during the Deepavali celebrations on Deepavali eve. After the fireworks went off during the celebrations at Little India, I saw Indian nationals on the streets setting off their very own fireworks into the sky and I wonder how on earth they manage to smuggle them into Singapore! There was even one over enthusiastic Indian national dancing in the middle of a busy road and all cars either stopped or steered the other way to avoid hitting him! I pushed him back to the pavement and he then went back to the middle of the road and danced again and some cars had to stopped to avoid hitting him! I then push him back to the pavement and told him off but he f**king laughed at me! That's not all! Some of them even hugged me to wish me "Happy Deepavali" and laughed at me! Aren't they showing any form of respect to law enforcers? Some of these guys even performed gymnastic moves on the road when the traffic lights turned red! My colleague almost got himself into a fight when another insane Indian national went to dance on the busy road and got pulled by my worried colleague with some force and the Indian national got violent! It took my ground supervisor to settle the issue peacefully in the end. Drunkards were laying down everywhere on the streets and people were even seen eating and drinking near the drains! Puke was laying everywhere as well! It was total chaos! We don't get to see this with our local Indians! They are treating our country like what they usually have in India!</p>
              <p>I do feel sad for them for leaving their families and settle for low-paying construction jobs in Singapore but on the other hand, they are just a bunch of low-class and insane 'animals'! </p>

              <p>Forgive me for saying this if you're a Singaporean Indian as my
              topic only directs at Indian nationals working in Singapore! I was
              called up for work as a traffic controller at Little India during
              the Deepavali celebrations on Deepavali eve. After the fireworks
              went off during the celebrations at Little India, I saw Indian
              nationals on the streets setting off their very own fireworks into
              the sky and I wonder how on earth they manage to smuggle them into
              Singapore! There was even one over enthusiastic Indian national
              dancing in the middle of a busy road and all cars either stopped or
              steered the other way to avoid hitting him! I pushed him back to
              the pavement and he then went back to the middle of the road and
              danced again and some cars had to stopped to avoid hitting him! I
              then push him back to the pavement and told him off but he f**king
              laughed at me! That's not all! Some of them even hugged me to wish
              me "Happy Deepavali" and laughed at me! Aren't they showing any
              form of respect to law enforcers? Some of these guys even performed
              gymnastic moves on the road when the traffic lights turned red! My
              colleague almost got himself into a fight when another insane
              Indian national went to dance on the busy road and got pulled by my
              worried colleague with some force and the Indian national got
              violent! It took my ground supervisor to settle the issue
              peacefully in the end. Drunkards were laying down everywhere on the
              streets and people were even seen eating and drinking near the
              drains! Puke was laying everywhere as well! It was total chaos! We
              don't get to see this with our local Indians! They are treating our
              country like what they usually have in India!</p>
              <p>I do feel sad for them for leaving their families and settle for
              low-paying construction jobs in Singapore but on the other hand,
              they are just a bunch of low-class and insane 'animals'! </p>

              <p>Being an Indian national and a Singapore PR (for past 15 years) I feel compelled to reply to this. Do note that I have lived half my life in India and half of it in Singapore. So in a way, I am as much Singaporean as I am Indian.</p>
              <p>Anyways, your title is absurd and totally misleading. You just managed to stereotype the whole group by saying Indian nationals are bla bla bla. This, my dear friend, can easily get you in trouble with the law in Singapore. Being from law enforcement, I would have thought that you would have known it better than any of us. But you failed to display that level of intelligence which caused me to read your article with only half interest.</p>
              <p>I do agree that some of the "Indians", most often from the lower salary range, can become unruly and lack the polished behavior that we would expect in a developed country. And why did I use the brackets to say Indians? It is because your Indians is referring to people from India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and to some extent, Pakistan as well. So it is not just Indians.</p>
              <p>To assume that all Indians are low income wagers would make you look stupid.</p>
              <p>As for the dancing and merry making, you spoke like a typical person from Singapore who hasn't seen the world. This is not something special for the Indians. In any country, people who are celebrating a festival or event do act and behave like this. Not everyone of course but a small percentage of them definitely does that. I have been living in Belgium for the past 2 years and I have seen such kind of unruly behavior plenty of times. And to be really technical, Belgium is a developed country and Singapore is a developing country. I have seen such behavior VERY frequently in London. UK obviously is a developed country too. I have seen such behavior in Australia.</p>
              <p>If Singaporeans do not behave in such way, does not mean that no where in the other parts of the modern developed world, people behave that way. So it is another mistaken generalisation by you to relate this only to the Indians. However, I do agree that whichever country we are in, we have to respect and follow its rules. But if the gahment doesn't enforce and teach the laws then you can't hold the people responsible. Unfortunately not everyone is as intelligent and gracious to understand the laws of one's country. Not even you.</p>
