            <div class='col-md body'>The good news for couples is that if you give birth to more babies, the more incentive and cash the goverment is giving to you. Here is the bad one, who is gonna pay for your kids after the scheme is cut off when they reach 6 years old? Give birth, dun give birth. We have all heard it too many times. The demographics that the rest of the developed countries faced are declining birthrates. So now, the goverment needs babies and fast. Excuse me, but i think wheter a couple wants children or not is their own damn bizness! I grew up in a family of 3 other siblings and throughout my life, i have never seen a goverment official being concerned about me nor my siblings. Screw them, wheter i want no kids or enough kids to form a soccer team is no concern of theirs. The only advantage of a baby boom is to replace a greying population, the bad news is they may be less than enough to distribute wealth and resources equally. Sure the goverment wants families to have 3 kids or so. However, with the increasing affluence and rising costs, only well off families and not lower income familes can afford that. Thank god me and my siblings are all grown up now and self sufficient. If my entire family were to survive on my father's income, i would estimate we would have enough money left every month after bills for a dinner of plain white rice and soya sauce. Rising utillites costs did not helped much in increasing my father's disposable income. So what is it going to be? You and your spouse work your ass off to give your offsprings a comfortable life and neglect them in the process? Or how about working less and bring home a lean strip of bacon and let providence take care of the rest?? Ok, so i may sound materialistic, get real! This is Singapore, the most developed country in this part of the world! Nothing is free here save promotional giveaways! Economists would scoff at them, every goods and services has it's own intrinsic or hidden costs. The only thing that is free in economic terms is air, breath as much as you want. You do not have to pay a single cent for it, yet. All right, we are gonna make some babies, aye? You wanna pay for them all?? Who wants to answer that question??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At a time of rising prices and inflation and a couple has to work to maintain quite a reasonable standard of living and the urge by the government to continuously keep learning less we get overtaken in the rat race coupled with the high costs of having kid eg maternity leave where the family is deprived of 1 incomes,computer lessons,swimming lessons,tuition etc etc.It's no wonder people are put off by the idea of having kids,heehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
