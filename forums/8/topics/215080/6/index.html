But after coming to Australia, I think my courtesy level and other-centredness must have doubled. Don't believe me? Well just ask most of the others who come to Australia to study. When I came to Australia, I was pleasently surprised and amazed at how friendly and helpful the Aussies were. Even if they have never seen you before, they will offer to pay for your tram ticket if you have lost your wallet. If you were on crutches, a few strangers will get down and help you up the tram.
