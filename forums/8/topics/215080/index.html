To make things worse, those standing at the doorway refused to move in, making it even more difficult for her.<br><br>Once on board, no one bothered to give up his seat to my wife, who was carrying our son.

I was shocked beyond words.<br><br>We went to a packed food court for lunch. No tables were available. We waited and finally noticed a couple leaving. We inched our way towards their table but, with just 5m to go, a group of office girls ran ahead of us and took the table.<br><br>When we finally got a table, it was unbelievably messy.
