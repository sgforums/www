            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dragg:</div><div class="quote_body">Oct 14, 2006<br>The Straits Times<br><br>RECENTLY, my friend from Australia commented that Singaporeans behaved like pigs. I disagreed, saying that at most it's a small minority who behaved that way.  He challenged me to a test. I accepted his challenge, determined to prove him wrong. I was bitterly disappointed.<br><br>Here is an account of what happened.<br><br>My friend, my wife, our one-year-old son in a pram and I (wearing a neck brace and with my arm in a sling from injuries sustained in a car accident) went for an MRT ride. My wife and son couldn't get into the station for some time because other commuters kept using the gate meant for the disabled, ignoring her and the pram.<br><br>When the train arrived, people rushed in while alighting passengers rushed out. No one gave way to my wife and the pram. She had to compete with the horde to get onto the train. To make things worse, those standing at the doorway refused to move in, making it even more difficult for her.<br><br>Once on board, no one bothered to give up his seat to my wife, who was carrying our son. Those seated were young, able-bodied and educated (executive-type) adults. Finally, it was two Thai workers who gave up their seats to us.<br><br>Later, an old woman boarded the train. Again, no one gave up his seat until a man in a neck brace and an arm sling did so.<br><br>When we reached our destination, we tried to take the lift from the platform to the ticket concourse. The lift was packed with able-bodied people. My friend asked that my wife and the pram be allowed in but one man turned around and remarked rudely, 'Why can't you take the next lift?'. I was shocked beyond words.<br><br>We went to a packed food court for lunch. No tables were available. We waited and finally noticed a couple leaving. We inched our way towards their table but, with just 5m to go, a group of office girls ran ahead of us and took the table.<br><br>When we finally got a table, it was unbelievably messy. There were chicken bones, spilt sauces and prawn shells all over the table.<br><br>I turned red in the face when my friend, who was helping to clear the table, asked, 'So, do you still think that it's only a minority of Singaporeans that behave this way? If so, take a look around you. Look real hard at the tables when they leave... You guys eat like pigs.'<br><br>Martin Goh Lye Thiam<br><br></div></blockquote>Ok, yah.. this is truly BAD for us. This is giving further crap-smears on our reputations as Singaporeans.<br><br>But let me say that I see two things that made those commuters and people in general, not willing to give way or be considerate; 1) there is that word 'xenophobia' (some people don't like whites) so hence the remark from a man in the lift at the MRT station, 2) people here are taught to be self-preserving and money-centric, so hence no time for grace.<br><br>This I know is NO excuse at all for behaving like pigs, BUT if these Australians were to try this 'test' on weekends in some heartland MRT station, I think the results would be better.<br><br>I FEEL that people here in general, WERE brought up this way BY our GOV and their POLICIES.<br><br>I always stress the point; a child is brought up to become the WAY, the parents brought the child up!<br><br>If courtesy begins at home, then the characteristics of a people starts at the heart of the Nation - its GOVERNMENT.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">Poor fella.  I've come across alot of boorish behavior too, so I empathize.  Most S'poreans are not civic-minded.. that's like the antasis of "kiasu".  I give up my seat and clean up after myself @ the foodcourt if the cleaners don't beat me to it first, but I seldom see others do it.. something must be wrong if majority of toilet and foodcourt cleaners in a "1st world" country are senior citizens.. and something is definitely terribly wrong when commonfolk leave a mess for them to clean up and justify it by saying "but it's their job, what".<br><br>That, plus the control-freak gahmen who so kindly throws us commonfolk scraps from time to time .. boy, it hardly instills a sense of National pride.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  </span></div>
