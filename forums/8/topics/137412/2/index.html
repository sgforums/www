We should at least celebrate the vast range of sounds.<br>Music, with roots from Latino sources, became the rave and show no signs of leaving. For the most the rythmic, upbeat tempo and sexually suggestive lyrics have hit a chord with American audiences. It may not be the roots of Rock and Roll, but it was different and grand!</div>
