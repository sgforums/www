            <div class='col-md body'>I went through all the threads before me and we have yet to see the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FULL</span></strong> details.   Highlights don't the situation, the teacher or the phone owner justice.<br><br>There's gotta be a reason that the teacher what she* did.  I doubt that something was done for no reason at all.  The teacher puts her job on the line everytime something is done, no way she's going to do something that she doesn't have an explanation for.  I think there's more to this than the author willing to tell us.<br><br>Going through this thread, it just shows how many young people are this board, many probably don't even make the age requirements.  Too many immature and inconsequencial (sp?) attitudes and thoughts/comments, judging things from face value.  Teachers (even if they were 50 plus and unmarried still) have lives and wouldn't go out of their way to make life hell for their students.  I used to think that way too but a wake up note for you guys.  YOU'RE NOT THE KING OF THE WORLD!!<br><br>*"She" to make it easier.</div>
