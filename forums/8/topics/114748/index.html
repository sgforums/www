            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Sleep Paralysis</strong><br><br>The characteristics of sleep paralysis are as follows:<br><br>* Inability to move or speak for 30 seconds - 3 minutes<br>* Speech is difficult or almost impossible<br>* Happens before falling asleep or just after waking up<br>* Can be hereditary<br>* Can be brought on by stress<br><br>Sleep paralysis is the experience of waking up (usually form a dream) and feeling paralyzed, except for being able to breathe and move the eyes. Hypnogogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis may occur together. These conditions are common in people with narcolepsy but can also effect others, particularly people who are sleep-deprived. Although a pretty terrifying event, these events are not physically harmful. There are two major types of sleep paralysis: common (typical) also known as CSP and hallucinatory (hypnagogic) sleep paralysis known as HSP.<br><br>Differences between CSP and HSP.<br><br>* CSP is common and universal, HSP is rare and seems to be geographically episodic.<br>* CSP is only unnerving for the sleeper but HSP is accompanied by a nightmare like hallucination.<br>* CSP is of relatively short duration where HSP can last as long as seven or eight minutes.<br><br>One of the most important differences between Night Terrors and CSP is that CSPs occurs in Stage one of sleep and Night Terrors occur in stage four.<br><br>Different cultures throughout time have interpreted HSPs as different spirits or events.<br><br>* Ancestral ghosts - Southeast Asians<br>* Hag - Irish and Scottish<br>* Cats - Chinese<br>* Spectral foxes - Japanese<br>* Djinn - Arabs<br>* Guilt - Romans and the Egyptians<br>* Witchcraft - Mexicans<br>* Vampires - Europeans<br>* Demons - Medieval Europe<br><br>HSPs are usually a vision of a small creature that sits on the victims chest. The creature then either compresses the chest or attempts to strangulate the victim. Almost all attacks have been reported by people sleeping on their backs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Night Terrors</strong><br>People who have night terrors are often misdiagnosed. The most common one is a simple nightmare. Any of you who have had a night terror can say they aren't even close! Another common misdiagnosis (especially among veterans) is PTSD or Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.<br><br><strong>Night Terrors Symptoms:</strong> Sudden awakening from sleep, persistent fear or terror that occurs at night, screaming, sweating, confusion, rapid heart rate, inability to explain what happened, usually no recall of "bad dreams" or nightmares, may have a vague sense of frightening images. Many people see spiders, snakes, animals or people in the room, are unable to fully awake, difficult to comfort, with no memory of the event on awakening the next day.<br><br><strong>Night Terror or Nightmare?:</strong>Nightmares occur during the dream phase of sleep known as REM sleep. Most people enter the REM stage of sleep sometime after 90 minutes of sleep. The circumstances of the nightmare will frighten the sleeper, who usually will wake up with a vivid memory of a long movie-like dream. Night terrors, on the other hand, occur during a phase of deep non-REM sleep usually within an hour after the subject goes to bed. This is also known as stage 4. During a night terror, which may last anywhere from five to twenty minutes, the person is still asleep, although the sleepers eyes may be open. When the subject does wake up, they usually have no recollection of the episode other than a sense of fear. This, however, is not always the case. Quite a few people interviewed can remember portions of the night terror, and some remember the whole thing.</div>
