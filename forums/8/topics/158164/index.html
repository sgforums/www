            <div class='col-md body'>WARNING... New Credit Card Scam.<br><br>Note, the callers do not ask for your card number.<br><br>This information is worth reading. By understanding how the VISA &amp;  Mastercard telephone credit card scam works,<br><br>you'll be better prepared to protect yourself.<br><br>The SCAM:<br><br>My husband was called on Wednesday from "VISA", and I was called onThursday from "MasterCard."<br><br>The scam works like this:<br><br>Person calling says,  "This is (name), and I'm calling from the Security and Fraud Department  at VISA. My Badge number is12460. Your card has been flagged for an unusual purchase pattern, and I'm calling to verify. This would be on your<br>VISA card which was issued by (name of bank.)<br><br>" Did you purchase an Anti-Telemarketing Device for $497.99 from a  Marketing company based in Arizona? "<br><br>When you say " No ", the caller continues with,  " Then we will be issuing a  credit to your account. This is a company we<br>have been watching and the  charges range from $297 to $497, just under the  $500 purchase pattern that   flags most cards.<br><br>Before your next statement, the credit will be  sent to (gives you your  address), is that correct? "<br><br>You say " Yes."<br><br>The caller continues - " I will be starting a  Fraud investigation.  If you  have any questions, you should call the 1-800<br>number listed on the back of  your card (1-800-VISA) and ask for Security.   You will need to refer to this  Control Number."<br><br>The caller gives you a 6 digit number and asks,  " Do you need me to read it  again? "<br><br>Here's the IMPORTANT part on how the scam works...<br><br>The caller then says, " I need to verify you  are in possession of your   card."<br><br>He'll ask you to " Turn your card over and look  for some numbers."  There are 7 numbers; the first 4 are part of<br>your card number, the next 3  are the security Numbers' that verify you are  the possessor of the card.<br><br>These are the numbers you sometimes use to make  Internet purchases to prove  you have the card.<br><br>The caller will ask you to read the 3 numbers  to him. After you tell the   caller the 3 numbers, he'll say,   " That is correct, I just needed to verify that  the card has not been lost  or stolen, and that you still have your card.<br><br>Do you have any other  questions? "  After you say " No ", the caller then thanks  you and states, " Don't  hesitate to call back if you do", and hangs up.<br><br>You actually say very little, and they never  ask for or tell you the Card  number. But after we were called on Wednesday,<br><br>we called back within 20  minutes to ask a question... Are we glad we did   ! The REAL VISA Security Department told us it was a scam and in the last 15 minutes a new purchaseof $497.99 was charged to our card !<br><br>Long story made short - We made a real fraud  report and closed the VISA  account. VISA is reissuing us a new number.<br><br>What the scammers want is the 3-digit PIN number on the back of the card.<br><br>Don't give it to them!!...<br><br>Instead, tell them you'll call VISA or  Mastercard directly for  verificationof their conversation.<br><br>The real VISA told us that they will never ask  for anything on the card, as  they already know the information since they<br>issued the card.<br><br>If you give the scammers your 3 Digit PIN  Number, you think you're  receiving a credit. However, by the time you<br>get your statement you'll see  charges for purchases you didn't make, and by  then it's almost to late and/or more difficult to actually file a fraud  report.<br><br>What makes this more remarkable is that on Thursday, I got a call from a "Jason Richardson of MasterCard" with a word-for-word repeat of the VISA  scam. This time I didn't let him finish.<br>I hung  up! We filed a police  report, as instructed by VISA. The police said   they are taking several of  these reports daily! They also urged us to tell  everybody we know that this   scam is occurring very rapidly right now.<br><br></div>
