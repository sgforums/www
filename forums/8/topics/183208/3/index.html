            <div class='col-md body'>i thought this topic was another which i replied to...<br><br>seems like the same "singapore is boring" threads pop up frequently...<br><br>i would seriously like to challenge those who keep going "boring" with this question:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">what do you find interesting?</span><br><br>most would not even know how to answer that question... i would think those who think everything is "boring" lack basic imagination.. they want.. nay.. DEMAND! everything to be served to them on a platinum platter.. after which they'll complain that the legions of slaves were not around to pop chilled, peeled and pitted grape into their mouths while the rest waved palm fronds to cool the air...<br><br>seriously... what interests you? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>i've lived here and abroad.. i've ALWAYS found interesting things to do no matter how "boring" the place was <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>and Singapore is no exception...<br><br>just like last week, there was a music festival... i tried to ask a few people to go.. they were "it's boring".. i was wondering... WTF??<br><br>oh well.. i've ranted enough..<br><br>i would suggest to the "bored masses" to go see the Wizard of Oz to find get some imagination from him.. maybe you'll not be so bored once you find that it is within you to change that.. but you don't want to because you're too jaded..</div>
