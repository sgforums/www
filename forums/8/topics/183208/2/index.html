I'm in Melbourne, Australia and it can get boring here too.<br><br>I guess we can do a few things that u can't.

That's without supersizing it. Convert that to SGD and compare it. And for a plate of 'chinese' food. (Chow Mein + 2 items) you'd have to pay around USD 7.. compared to zhu chao... you think that's expensive?<br><br>in singapore at least you have transport. buses stop at 5pm here. the only way to get around is if you have a car. cab rides the distance from changi airport to orchard road can set you back USD 40 bucks. Convert that and let me know if you think that's cheap.<br><br>Lets talk about concerts.. ok fine. There are more concerts to watch here.. but you're going to have fork out at least USD 70 for a lousy ticket... go figure out how much the rest might cost..<br><br>and movies.. Student price at off peak hours is USD 7. During peak.. it's USD 9. Popcorn and drinks are USD 10 a set... so how? you still think singapore is expensive?</div>

Simply ridiculous and an embarassment.<br><br>I could go on and on comparing Perth to Singapore but i'm not going to do that... On an ending note, i'd like to mention that Perth is known as 'dullsville' among Australians (which i agree is a perfect description of this graveyard) and I cannot understand why some Singaporeans dont realise they are living in one of the best cities in the world.<br><br>I'm looking forward to my next trip to Sing. Should be even better than it was before.<br><br></div></blockquote>Thank you for your kind compliments... Unfortunately, Singapore is a country dotted with ingrates that do not know the treasures they seek are before their very eys</div>

I've seen a few demonstrations and there were mostly peaceful and unobstrusive. Basically involved a group of women with prams walking to the city centre la... or ppl holding placards near to Parliament.<br><br>Btw, do you live in Iraq?</div>
