Recently my fiancee and If went to Modesto's @ VivoCity for a meal last Saturday. I must say the food (we had a la carte pasta and pizza) was good as usual but I can't agree with the manner in which payment was settled.<br>Based on UOB's credit card discounts, a la carte meals at Modesto's are entitled to a 10 per cent discount, excluding public holidays and eve of public holidays. So as it was a Saturday and presumably not the eve of a public holiday (based on common understanding, Sundays are not considered a public holiday), we paid for our meal with a UOB credit card.<br><br>To our surprise, we were not given the 10 per cent UOB discount but billed in full. The reason given by the waitress was that Father's Day (the following day) is a public holiday so the UOB 10 per cent discount did not apply.<br><br>My questions to UOB, Modesto's and other relevant parties are:<br><br>- Are Mother's Day and Father's Day public holidays? That cannot be so since they are not gazetted as such.<br><br>- If the discount is not applicable on special occasions like Mother's Day, Christmas and so on, and the eve of these occasions, the credit card company should specify this in brochures and materials sent to cardholders to avoid misunderstandings.<br><br>Incidentally, this is not the first time we have this problem. In my previous encounter last year, I paid with my Citibank credit card (with the Creations promotion card) for a meal at Al Dente Esplanade on Dec 22. A discount of 50 per cent of the meal would have applied if the promotion had been honoured by Al Dente. However, I was told the credit card discount was not applicable on the eve of a long weekend. I was quite amused but largely put off by the excuse as I called Al Dente Holland Village outlet to clarify that my Citibank-Creations Card discount applied on that day. It was also not part of the terms and conditions of the card to exclude eve of long weekends.<br><br>I feel the service standards of Singapore banks and their business partners have a long way to go and there is simply too little consumer protection.<br><br>Ng Shze Wee </span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>While i respect the fine print in most vouchers and brochures of credit cards, there are times where certain conditions do not spell out the precise prerequisites, hence the merchants take advantage of consumers by claiming a blanket 'no-discount' policy, so long as grey matter is encountered.<br><br>Should the merchants be blamed for setting ad-hoc conditions as and when they like, or should credit card and banks be precise in determining the requirements by which discounts MUST be offered?<br><br>Merchants and banks may consider such feedback as trivial, but all it takes is for one person to escalate the situation into a legal dispute before people take action. Hopefully, it doesn't come to that.<br><br></div>
