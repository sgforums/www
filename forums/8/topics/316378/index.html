              <p><span style="color: black; " lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">One of the most important rules in life is never to take things at face value. That is, do not adhere blindly to everything that your boss, professor, agent or even parents say!</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; " lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In this day and age where information is easily accessible, it is of greater importance that we learn how to assimilate the information we acquired. The key is to <strong>absorb information, with prudence</strong>.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; " lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Firstly, <strong>there is only that much that one knows</strong>. Whatever a person tells you about a subject, there is surely someone out there who knows more than him and someone who knows less. It is rather unlikely, if not inconceivable, that you would get to know someone who knows everything more than everyone else. There is a limit to what a person knows.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; " lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The knowledge that one acquires, might be through personal experience and involvement. As time goes by, a certain set of values and attitudes might be ingrained in him such that he feels strongly for. As a result, the knowledge that he has might be more applicable for his context and has a higher degree of relevance to him. His level of comprehension would rely significantly on his own perceived experience. For instance, a way that he finds useful for solving problems might not be necessarily your preferred approach or even work for you. Fundamental beliefs are the foundation which governs how a person looks at everything else. Two people with different fundamental beliefs will see and interpret everything else differently from each other.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; " lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Back home, parents with well-meaning intentions, by offering their own set of solutions to your existing problems might not always be the best way. Certain things might have worked well for them in the past which got them to where they were, but in this fast changing world, the only constant that we have now is change. On average, more than half the knowledge that were taught to university students in their first year gets outdated two years after they graduate. We can no longer rely on traditional methods to solve existing problems. Being adaptable and flexible in our approach to new situations is an added advantage in order to keep abreast of changes.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; " lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In the corporate setting, the most practical way for an individual to learn is to be introspective enough to realize that one will never have all the answers and that the counsel of others within the organization is vital as well. Often, success in an organizational context emerges from a complex interplay of the various resources with the external environment. While the leader or manager may be a significant component, it is dangerous for everyone to always adhere to what they advocate. There is also the potential danger of Hubris manifesting within the leader which is categorized by exaggerated pride and self-confidence that may be detrimental to the organization’s objectives. Therefore, the best way to learn and work within most organization is to establish cultural norms that encourage membership to disagree without being disagreeable. “Groupthink” may do good for situations that require immediate decisions but not necessary so in the long run. To combat the limitations of groupthink, the organization could be composed of members with diverse backgrounds as well as functional areas. But this alone may not be sufficient. Members must also have the integrity and courage to argue for alternatives that differ from those desired by the senior executives.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; " lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Secondly, <strong>there is only that much that someone would tell you</strong>. Let’s assume we have someone who is at the top of his industry. He could be the chief engineer, top lawyer or a renowned doctor. Do their words necessary hold more weight than others every single time?</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; " lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Remember, there are people out there who would tell you only what they want you to hear. Like it or not, most humans have an agenda to what they are doing. Even if they don’t, these people might be limited by possible time constraints to share the whole complete picture with you, as much as they might want to. They could only explain the general situation to you at best.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; " lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Just like in law, there are always exceptions to every rule. What they advise you to do, might apply only to the general situation, but it might not always be the case. If possible, do seek a second opinion to prevent any possible biasness from just a single source and increase the reliability of the information.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; " lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Also, an important factor which affects how much someone is willing to share his expertise with you depends on how receptive you are to the knowledge. For instance, some successful people are only willing to share their experiences and knowledge only to a person who demonstrates humility and has the desire for learning. They are only interested in helping people who are willing to help themselves. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; " lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Lastly, the best often think differently from the way most people out there would think. To learn to become the best, one must start to think opposite of conventional wisdom. What seems like the ‘right’ thing to do for most people might not always be the best way. Those that do things apart from the average in the right manner, are the ones who get exceptional results. That is why there is a need for us to defy consensus reality for the purpose of achieving that which is far above the expectation of the norm. <strong>The mentality of the best is not like the rest.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; " lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Bear in mind that while it is good to learn from the best out there, chances are they will only be able to teach you according to the level which they have attained. <strong>The very same mentality that sets them above those who are below them is also the same mentality that limits them.</strong> In those instances where you want to achieve above their level, you must know be able to identify and reject the very areas that limit them and move beyond. You must transcend their limited way of thinking.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; " lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">To sum it all up, I would end off with a quote given by </span><a name="OLE_LINK2"></a><a name="OLE_LINK1"></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">William Saroyan- <strong>‘Every man in the world is better than someone and not as good as someone else</strong>.’ Be always open to new information from different sources on the same subject matter and allow prudence, to direct you whether these new knowledge should be absorbed or done away with.</span></span></p>

              <p>nah fireice didnt do anything except to take away my personal site. it is a site which i share my views and advice about how we could improve our life socially, emotionally, intellectually and financially.</p>
              <p>but i wished fireice had at least taken a look at it and might realise that it is truly value adding and probably would not have taken it away. </p>
