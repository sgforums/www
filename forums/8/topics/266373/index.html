            <div class='col-md body'>Having just returned from a 2-year teaching stint in Jakarta, Indonesia, I noticed with interest how the educational system has changed. In fact, when I was in Indonesia, I often had to field many questions from parents and students on how the educational system here compared with that in the better known schools there. Quite often, the questions would turn into criticisms as they compared the Singaporean system with the schools that purportedly offer the Singaporean educational system.<br><br>Truth to say, many schools that have opened in Indonesia are claiming to use the Singaporean curriculum. However, upon closer scrutiny, most of them are just cashing in on the high standards set in Singapore as their only basis for the claims are the textbooks and assessment books used here. This has caused many of their students to be disappointed and turn to other systems. Though it is understood that the MOE has no way to regulate the way overseas organisations advertise themselves, there should probably be ways in which it can further disprove claims made by these schools there other than just stating on its website that there is only one international school which is affiliated. This is important as parents who may be thinking of sending their children here to study can be often put off by those whom they see as affiliated to the Singaporean educational system.<br><br>With Singapore's focus to put itself on the global map as the educational hub in Asia, it is of utmost importance to ensure that its reputation is not sullied by schools both here as well as those overseas.</div>
