            <div class='col-md body'>when some people fart, only dogs can hear them too... but that's beside the point<br><br>different strokes for different folks...<br><br>BTW, you missed the whole meaning... people use truths and bend, twist and manipulate them to suit their purposes...<br><br>just like people like Greenpeace rant about trees being cut down while conveniently forgetting to tell people that trees are usually replanted or actually grow by themselves on the open places that were left behind...<br><br>it's so easy to switch off your mind and follow isn't it?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some people in Greenpeace are "sponsored" by large corporate entities to fan their organisation's interest, but under the pretence of environmental interest. Yes, I do already know that.<br><br>But I personally feel the post above has no coheret message or point at all. But simply, a very distateful stab at rhetoric humour. As I said, it neither made any point nor made me laugh.<br><br>But well, different folks different strokes.</div>
