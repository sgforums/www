              <p>4. Mental stress and being psychotic is defined differently medically.  Unless of course you were consulting the same 'la kopi with medical doctor fella thus became medical expert fella' Gendeken mentioned.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I am not saying that you are wrong. I used to think like you but soon relies that i am no 'god'. Say for example i used to have some casual remarks or suggestions, i do thinks  that most usually will not do but that does not make me unique. More so i think its just my habit and i find it weird when others cannot do like i do. But this makes me look bad bacause bosses like to use me as an example to achieve their own intention. They liks to use me as a comparison and as a result many people hate. Hey like i got a better job so what? If you can do it go get a better job. If you cannot then even if you bring me down you will still not get a good job. And believe me they all waited everyday for me on my way to and from work so as to spite me. What the fcuk? If they spend those efforts and time doing better things they may well run for the next GE</p>

              <p>I also got people tell me not to bring work home, say work done in company can already once go home just forget about it. but i always hear people complaining about colleagues bosses work on the way home. I even hear people on such shet on weekends. so once you go home forget about work and company lah why still complain? even if i like to save work on thumbdrive and bring it home to do so what? i happy cannot meh?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>also i don't like to bring home affairs to work. if you got problem solve it at home. if not take leave and solve it. unless you tell me you cannot solve so come company find someone to complain about fine. if it makes you feel better. just like religion. chosse one if you feel you want a direction in life. but i can tell you the path to the end of life is the same. Nothing. you seize to be and you physical shell rot of burnt to ashes in a box.</p>
