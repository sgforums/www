            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I was wondering what is the role of a woman in the modern society nowadays? Woman becoming more and more independant, putting as much emphasis in their career even after marriage. I know woman of the millenium is definately different from the past. But is it a good thing?? I mean, let's put in a prospective as in as a wife and a mother. How do guys define a good wife or a good mother?<br><br>In my point of view, I sincerely thinks that a good and successful planning surely leads to a better family being set up in the long run. A lot of broken families are mostly no family planning or lack of understnading before marriage. And the kids as a result suffers esp when the mum works and with no communication established, the kids will have a gap in understanding what he is doing in his own life.<br><br>I do think that most kids will want their mum to talk to them and let them understand the way of life there is so novel to them. A world they are going to venture not knowing what is in store for them. Imagine when he comes back from school, there is no one at home, and he has to find his own food and try to find things to do to kill his time. This is the typical schema of a kid who has both parents working. I mean the character of how the kid is going to grow up has an indirect impact on the teachings of the parents. I wonder how many of us here really think that their parents have done a really good job in upbringing them? Maybe all of us can share...<br><br>Of cos, there are cases whereby children wants to go astray themselves but I think the family has to play a part in the nature of the kid as a result.so is it a result of working parents and no one to guide them , in this case the mum since the dad is the bread winner?<br><br>In another case, do guys mind to switch roles with their wife if the wife has greater earning ability as them? Which means The husband will cook and take care of the kid.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As usual, these are tough questions, and I only have viewpoints to some of them.<br><br>Planning for stuff is usually good. But you can't plan for everything, and shit happens. In addition to planning, which is of course important, you need to be flexible to tackle whatever crap comes up along the way.<br><br>As for children going astray, if there were clear answers, there probably won't be any trouble today. But the fact is, there are so many factors in young people going astray, and lack of parental support is only one of the predisposing factors. I say predisposing factors because not everyone who doesn't have someone there when they go home turns into young monsters.<br><br>Some time ago Mind posted the topic "Upbring of Children," but its a pity that the response is not good. Probably because not many people have had actual experience in that, so no point talking about it.<br><br>Still, I think women and men will never play the same roles in life. I feel that they can have same responsibilities i.e. bread winner, but as far as the roles are concerned, they are never meant to be the same. For example, you can't expect a female to instill male qualities in a child, because she isn't a male.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well , parents do have a responsibility in the upbringing of their children.  But i don't think that responsilibility lies in the mother alone.<br>For me i respect my partner decision to work or to stay at home to take care of the children. WE can have a good talking section before we decide to have a child.  I think most pples will do that coz for me, B4 having a child i will make sure i am finanicially stable and also my partner will knoe wht is expected of it.  MAybe for the first few years, the mother might want to take care of the child personally.  Later when the child is older, they can decide wht to do next.  From what i see so far, most women will be willing to stay at home if THEY ARE FINANICIALLY able to do that.  Why not, rite? One of my colleague, she converted her contract into a part time one and only return to the company occasionally.  She even brought work back to do using her own computer at home not needing to go back office.  I think soemthing can be worked out if couples are willing to sit down and talk abt it.<br>I personally feel that my parents didn't have a good upbringing of me.  My childhood was really complicated where i spent most of the time at chinatown with bad company. The only things they knoe were to beat up their children when they have bad mood or did somehting wrong.  I was left at home most of the time when i go to Kindgarden and prim. School..  I was mostly left at home or else went to my friend house to stay.  But i think tht didn't change too much of me coz i think i'm born more introvert type of person and not easily influence by other. At least , i don't smoke or drink.  Instead, i learnt to be more independent and wanna work harder when i see how hard they worked when i was young.<br>Well, if the women is able to support the family financially, i won't mind switching roles with my partner.  maybe i can switch to home base type of job.  The US side is rather popular noeaday with man working at home and woman working outside.  Well ,i find that if we don't switch roles, how do we knoe the hardship of each other.  I don't think it's easy for a women to work at home all days with those house chores and taking care of the children. Should be rather boring. Also, if the women is to take care of the family, her thinking will be different too as she knoes she has to take care of the whole family and this will put her in much more stress.  I think this is the best way to knoe each's other hardship.<br>Hmm...Just my personal comments.  Sorrie if it's didn't sound right to u.....*wink* *wink*...<br><br>[This message has been edited by patie (edited 09 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Borrowing a quote or a few quotes:<br>"Woman is not made of a man's head to climb over him,<br>She is not made from his feet to be trampled on,<br>But from his rib to be by his side as an equal,<br>Under his arms to be protected and close to his heart to be loved."<br><br>Way long ago in the past, men and women have well defined roles regardless oc which society u are in. But now, there is a lot of grey areas.<br><br>For me, whether my future wife wants to go out to work or not( if we have no child), its entirely up to her. But she mustn't be the super career workaholic woman that kind. If she is this kind of woman, i wouldn't have married her in the first place. Its not bcos i'm afraid that she might surpass me in career wise( anyway i have confidence in my own ability) but its bcos i dun want a wife who places her career above her family. If we have a child, frankly speaking, i prefer her to stay at home to take care of our child. But if she still wants to go out to work, its ok so long she place the family as her top priority. This is bcos i dun want to leave our child in the hands of maids or child care centre. I dun want to reach the stage where our child feels closer to the maid than to us. I'm sure u ppl have heard abt the qn on if so and so falls into the sea, who will u rescue if u can only save one. In some family, both the father and mother are working, leaving the child in the hands of the maid, if u were to ask the child whether he/she will save the maid or the mother. i think many of them will save the maid. The mother in this case can't complain that her child is infilial cos the child is juz saving the person who he/she is closest to. Being parents, it not juz abt providing the child with materials needs. Parental love for the child is more than that. My mum stop working when I'm borned. Some of the career minded girls might feel that its too big a scarifice but to my mum, it isn't. Like what she said ," no pt having a successful career when my son is a failure."<br><br>I juz read abt this in the sunday times yesterday. In japan, most women stayed at home to look after the children. In short term economic way of looking at this, the work force is halved but in the long term it is an advantage cos the japanese mothers have done a fantastic job bringing up their children, nurturing capable leaders of the next generations. So these women, in my opinion, has played a very big role in the economic success of japan. On the hand for singapore, in the opinion of lee kuan yew, children are left to the influences of tvs. Yes most women in singapore works but waht abt the upbringing of children?<br><br>The upbringing of the children should not be left to women alone. Men has got to play a role too. Bringing up the child without a father influence is bad. On who should stayed at home to look after the children can be viewed from biological viewpts or feminist viewpts. Biologically speaking, women are more gentle and careful than men, hence they are better than men in bringing up the children. Therefore its make more sense for the women to stay at home to look after the children and for men to be the breadwinner. However from the viewpt of a feminist, i think they will argue that men and women are the same and women has the right to go out to work. But ulimately its up to the couple themselves. Its not juz enough to look at who earns more. U have to take into consideration who can look after the children better. So what are the couple going to do if the wife earns more but at the same time is much better at looking after the children than the husband.<br><br>For a husband to stay at home to look after the children is not as simple as it looks. Maybe in the other societies, this is widely accepted but in singapore, i think we are at the crossroads of conservative and liberal thinkings. Even then, i think the husband might still be criticised for not supporting the family, after all many girls are marrying upwards and men downwards. I dunno how is the scenario is like outthere, but for my class, the girls in my class prefer their husband to go out to work while they stayed at home if one of them has to stayed at home to look after the children.<br><br>Maids are gd helpers at household chores but they can never substitutes the parents. Maids working here work for a period of 5 yrs. After that they got to go back to their own country. Juz read an article a few months ago, a child has grown so attached to the maid that he became dejected after the maid went back and the mother still doesn't know that the maid has a more impt place in the child's heart than her. She was angry with the child and its only after the intervention of counsellors that she realised that its not the fault of the child. Its kinda her fault cos she places her career above her child and she doesn't even know that her child is sick or not. Everything was left to the maid. Of course the father also got to be blamed too. Cos the bringing up of a child is not juz the resposibility of the mother. Its the resposibility of both the father and the mother Personally, i will not leave my child in the hands of maid even if i have one.<br><br>If both parents are working, i think it will be gd if we can reform the way we work here. After we are supposed to enter the IT age. Maybe make it such that mothers can work at home using laptops and modems.<br><br>Ultimately whether the mother stays at home to look after the child or leave the child in the care of maids or child care center is decided by the couple. A gd talk btw the couple is advised and if they decided to leave the child in the hands of maids, they better not complained when the maid becomes more impt to the child than them.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I totally agree with Mind. But the problem is how many woman with high qualification willing to humble themselves and commit themselves full time as a house wife? Maybe some girls here can give their opinions too. I for one think that family is of utmost of importance. A successful woman is determined not by the amount of money she earns but how successful she is able to nurture her children well..as well be a good wife to her husband. Of cos, the upbringing of the child falls in the hands of 2 person. A maid can never subsitute motherly love and also the bondage. A child care may solve the problem for a short time but still the attention and the love the child have is crucial and lots of parents neglectt he fact that the most crucial years is when he starts to get influences from his peers and his surroundings??<br><br>Therefor communication between two party is importants. Good family planning will be further reinforced by seeing the developments of the child growth. Well, pacman may be right in saying nothing can be foreseen, but what I feel is that a good plan is better than just leave it cos like i have earlier said that Kids needs lotsa attention and love as they were growing up.<br><br>Of cos, not all of us here live in a good environment. If under such circumstances, the child very own self-discilpline is very important then. I wonder why do ppl married even they know they are not financial stable? Money do really play a essential role but this shan't be an excuse for both parents to work and neglect the kid. In the first place, the financial stability of the family should be already be settled to ensure that the family, with the kid can live a comfortable life.No money = No marriage??Yes...at least that is what I think.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agree that money is important as well. I think we need to fulfill this very basic need before we can go on to provide the very best environment for the child to grow up in. E.g. enough money for the child to buy a computer and join forums like this and hopefully, he/she will read the right posts and grow mentally.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh well...I think the threads in the Millinnium are more on social topics compared to about 5 weeks ago, all mostly about sex topics. I mean I personally "learn" quite a bit from the sex topics but I personally do not hope my children go into those threads, gee...hope my sis have not visited the forum that period of time. Oh yeah! Now the internet can also be one of the source that can lead your kids astray.

            <div class='col-md body'>The neo post-feminist of s'pore seeks gender empowerment via the social relations of production without the means to participate in the labour process, hence evokes the philosophy of capitalism as specificity for existence. This naturally, as we all know, results in a sesquipedalian route to an ideological acceptance of the feminisation process. Its logic however cannot be exorcised in post-colonialism since the metanarratives have broken down and along with the socio-political patterns they attempt to apply to.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Rinoa :<br><br>In my humble opinion, the role of women has not been well defined in the context of the modern society. First of all, in the ancient past, women are seen to be the caretakers of the home when men are to go out and seek out the food and other resources for the family. By old feudalistic traditions, strict and stupid rules are imposed on the women, such that it became a very chauvanistic society.<br>In the last 2 centuries, things have slightly changed, because there is an increasing struggle for equal rights for women and now the modern women has a new role which was yet to be defined. First of all, the value of marriage, if not been degraded to a legal contract, has been changed. The woman can now  choose divorce as an alternative if the relationship does not work out. Sometimes, both parents (since man are equally to be blamed as well) do not realize how the divorce could cause a very bad impact to the kids, and there become an increase in social problems caused by kids in modern society. Look at the perspective of the woman, since she can choose to be independent of the man, hence she can divorce him and live a new life . It is up to her whether she wants to live as a wife or a career woman. Some managed to do both and some failed. Hence it is very difficult to really tell.<br><br>Even as a man, I have decided to learn to cook and will enjoy looking after kids. That does not mean that I do not care about my career. I think that both man and woman (as husband and wife) must help each other in maintaining a modern family. Since our children are easily exposed to so much external influences, the need for guiding them becomes important and we need to constantly to explain to them what they see thru different sources of media. Otherwise, it will lead to them doing wrong things.<br><br>So much are my thoughts.. Need to sleep before the long flight back to UK....<br><br></div>
