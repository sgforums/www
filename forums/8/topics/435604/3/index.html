              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>There have been many complaints (mostly whines) about the
              foreign 'talents' in this island. The term 'foreign talent' refers
              to those immigrant workers who come here to be white collar men and
              women, not the roustabouts from India, China, Bangladesh etc who
              work in construction sites. These 'foreign talents' apparently
              cause different problems based on whatever country they come
              from.</p>
              <p>For example, those from China are known to be uncivillised,
              doing things like urinating into trash bins and hanging their
              laundry to dry in playgrounds. The women are also known for
              prostitution, though I suspect that they were tricked into this
              profession. Afterall, who the hell would want to do that job if
              given a choice?</p>
              <p>Indian nationals seem to be an arrogant bunch. They condescend
              upon locals, regardless of race, and even bring their weird caste
              system here. They also willfully choose not to integrate, opting to
              send their little devilspawns to international schools instead of
              our schools. I think I know the reason why they think so highly of
              themselves. India is a country where 1 in a 1000 people is a
              graduate. And all these 'talents' here are obviously graduates from
              India who think they are very special. They must realise that in
              Singapore, so many of us are educated. There is nothing special
              about their degree, which is not even that good compared to
              Singapores tertiary education. So, even though they are here, their
              mentality is that they are 1 in a 1000. </p>
