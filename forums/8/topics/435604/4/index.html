              <p>Well more foreigners come because and only because the 'Local trash' is exactly what it is:Trash and of course a Govt who doesn't give a damn. In th few years I spent with the local graduates they simply sucked. terrible accent, extreme narrow mindedness, ass kissing in Genes, no direction/ambition in life, no individualism and simply not bright.So in the end you are the problem.</p>

              <p>Do the UK, and PRC have caste system for them to not like their
              fellow countrymen that are of a different region? The Northern
              Indians and Southern Indians don't like each other in Singapore.
              This is like the Tibetians hating the Han Chinese.The dislike has
              nothing to do with the caste system. </p>
              <p>The dislike you mentioned is just plain prejudice or bigotry
              nothing more.</p>
              <p>So it cannot be said that <strong>the Indians thinks sg have a
              caste system.</strong></p>
              <p>They know they have a caste system <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in India</span>, and they know there
              is no similar caste system in Singapore.</p>

              <p>If you're talking about living the way of life according to the caste system, you can't find that in Singapore. However, if you're asking whether the Singapore Indians know which caste they belong to, the answer would be yes. Caste system is still applicable in Hindu marriages. The caste system came from Hinduism. It didn't came from Indians.</p>
