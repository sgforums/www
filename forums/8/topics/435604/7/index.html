              <p>The was once an incident earlier this year which impressed me on the steadfastness of a particular Indian national. It happened in ICA, where I was trying to extend my mother in law's visit pass. It had been a long wait... Finally my number is called so we went to the counter. As the officer at that counter was still attending to someone, I lead my family beside the counter. Then an Indian man brought his wife cut right in front of me. I gestured him that its my turn as the counter was displaying my number, placing my queue ticket. He replied that he has an appointment letter. I understood the procedures so I tell him very politely that everyone has the appointment letter and have to wait for their number to be called. He insisted that he wants to talk to the officer... Getting irritated, I told him that the officer would tell him the same thing and its rude to cut queue. He snapped back that he just want to ask the officer. I said ' Please, I'm leading my family here (total 3 adults, 1 child and a toddler here and you are leading your wife. I'm reasoning with you and just think for a moment that what I said is sound. The officer would tell you exactly the same thing as I have told you.' He retorted that he is not interested in talking to me. So I reprimande him that this is Singapore, not the same as where you came from. He is bringing hooliganism into our country which is undesirable. He then totally ignored me. His wife (I think) appeared to be apologetic so I just shrugged...</p>
              <p>Standing beside him, the officer told him " please wait for uour number to be called." He turned to me and and i showed him a double thumbs up and my troll face. The induan is smartly dressed and speaks fluent English</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>TL;DR version: Culture which is in the blood is very hard to reform... Even logic and sound statements are mostly ignored. Someday the tolerance limit will break, better be sooner.</p>

              <p>Some of them think that their alma mater is very good, because of the competitiveness. You know, in such an overpopulated country, the university would get 200,000 applications, but only admit 1,000, so they think they are damn special to be the top 0.5%.</p>
