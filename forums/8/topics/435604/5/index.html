              <p>There have been many complaints (mostly whines) about the foreign 'talents' in this island. The term 'foreign talent' refers to those immigrant workers who come here to be white collar men and women, not the roustabouts from India, China, Bangladesh etc who work in construction sites. These 'foreign talents' apparently cause different problems based on whatever country they come from.</p>
              <p>For example, those from China are known to be uncivillised, doing things like urinating into trash bins and hanging their laundry to dry in playgrounds. The women are also known for prostitution, though I suspect that they were tricked into this profession. Afterall, who the hell would want to do that job if given a choice?</p>
              <p>Indian nationals seem to be an arrogant bunch. They condescend upon locals, regardless of race, and even bring their weird caste system here. They also willfully choose not to integrate, opting to send their little devilspawns to international schools instead of our schools. I think I know the reason why they think so highly of themselves. India is a country where 1 in a 1000 people is a graduate. And all these 'talents' here are obviously graduates from India who think they are very special. They must realise that in Singapore, so many of us are educated. There is nothing special about their degree, which is not even that good compared to Singapores tertiary education. So, even though they are here, their mentality is that they are 1 in a 1000. </p>

He said no, but he dunno how to turn the tap in his bathroom, so I told him to call the hotel service staff, he said, he dunno how to press the electronic pad in his room, so I ask him to go down and ask, he said it shameful to ask, so end up I go Ritz and on the tap, which is touch controlled, for him, then, show him how to off it, so that he dun come and call me again in the middle of the night when I am busy doing something.</p>
