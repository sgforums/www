            <div class='col-md body'>I got led through this process to the end too.<br><br>some HK person called up, ask me do survey, then say they got stef sun to partake in their event.<br><br>They doing something for the IR in SG, then told me to stay tuned for their show, or to be there.<br><br>But HK leh, impossible to be there one what. 1 week later call me told me i win 3rd prize, then say dun need to pay anything, a few days later the lawyer office will call me.<br><br>The lawyer guy called me, then asked for all my particulars. I gave it to them, thought wah really got chance to win prize lei. $66,666 not small sum! (Yea, why all the sixes again? they tie up with someone we know is it?), and they said they'll put it in an account.<br><br>Then ask me to call this number (presumably a bank), and got automatic record one. damn power. I had to key in my bank account number and then the recorded voice told me i had $66,666 inside.<br><br>Ah yes, the guy also told me to be nice, and look at their sponsor's website, which is entirely in chinese, and looks rather.. normal.<br><br>Later then the lawyer said i had to put in 3k worth for 5% of the taxes thing, cause he quote me some statute that in HK any prizes won above $10k must have a cert or something.<br><br>It was all very cleverly done, to make me think i had really won something.<br><br>But of course i'm not so stupid to just pay the 3k. Heck, i don't even HAVE 3k. He told me to lend from someone, then say can pay back a few minutes after i get the money.<br><br>What made me initially suspicious was that while i was talking to the 2 of them, got other people call in and thank them for getting the money.<br><br>I did some research, and i found out that their logo was actually from some other REAL hotel. the website's down now but it used to be dyent88.com<br><br>Other than my personal particulars, and some HK airtime, i didn't lose much. But i learnt that if its too good to be true, it usually is.<br><br>I think what these companies do, is to paint a very realistic picture of everything. Invite you for events that is just not possible for you to attend, then tell you that you've won some big prize.<br><br>Its not just greed that they're playing on. I mean, who could not use an extra few thousand ? or a few hundred thousand? This is the same principle as buying 4d, Toto mah.<br><br>But yea, do keep a look-out for these companies. I actually got a missed call 2 times before i picked up the third time (in the span of 2 weeks).</div>
