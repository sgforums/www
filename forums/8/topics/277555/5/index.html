This time round, the organizer is "Venetian Macau" okay...somemore they said the event was broadcast over pheonix tv on sunday n urge me to watch the live telecast to see that my number was one of the lucky 10 to win the 2nd prize.<br>And now their tactics had changed. They no longer asked you for your bank account number outright but they insist thay I have to go to Macau personally to claim the prize, then pay 2.5% to the Macau Social Welfare Depatment or something like dat.<br>So I played along with them loh, to see when they will start asking me for my bank account number. So when the "lawyer" called, I asked him for his license number so I can check with the relevant authorities that he start giving some stupid excuses...*lol* I say I will call him back to arrange an appointment wih him when I settle my matters in singapore to fly over there.. Like I will ever will..<br>We shall see if they dare to call me back again.<br>I also called the CAD this morning to report this case, and the officer in charge said they have recieved several calls regarding this venetian macau thing.<br>Waste my time!<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Home &gt; News &gt; Story Sep 23, 2007<br><strong>122 hit by lottery scams this year  </strong><br><br>Victims lost a total of $1.5 million to fraudsters; police advise public to be more wary of such ruses<br>By Selina Lum<br><br>MORE than 100 people have been conned of a total of $1.5 million in lottery or lucky draw scams so far this year.<br>The smallest amount was $6 and the highest $353,000, said the police, which released a statement warning the public about such scams.<br><br>The 122 victims were duped into handing over money after receiving phone calls or SMSes claiming that they had won prizes in overseas lucky draws.<br><br>Since January, the police have received nearly 300 reports of such scams.<br><br>As such ruses take different forms and the tricksters change tactics regularly, the public should be careful, said the police.<br><br>The bottom line: If anything sounds too good to be true, it probably is.<br><br>This is how a scam typically works: A call would be made to the victim's mobile phone.<br><br>The caller, claiming to be a staff member of an overseas company, would pretend to be conducting a survey or to invite the victim to attend an event abroad. A few days later, the victim would get a phone call from the company again - this time informing him that he had won a lucky draw entered on his behalf.<br><br>Besides phone calls, another tactic used by the tricksters is to send SMSes to the victims' mobile phones, notifying them to call an overseas number to claim their 'prizes'.<br><br>But to claim their winnings, the victims are asked to make upfront payments of 'administrative' or 'processing' fees via remittance companies to China.<br><br>In some cases, local accounts were also used.<br><br>To make their claims look credible, the swindlers may even provide the victims with login IDs and website addresses of supposedly reputable overseas firms.<br><br>Inevitably, the victims who fall for the ruse would later find that there are no such lottery winnings.<br><br>After pocketing their money, the fraudsters would either make up more stories seeking further payment or just abscond with what they have collected.<br><br>The police said they take a stern view of such cases and have been working with overseas agencies to nab the culprits.<br><br>Since 2005, at least six people involved in get-rich-quick scams have been caught and jailed for 14 months to three years.<br><br>Anyone with information on these scams can call the Commercial Affairs Department on 1800-325-0000, or go to any police station.<br><br>selinal@sph.com.sg<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by juvi:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi all,<br>I also received a phone call telling me that I have won the 2nd prize of their charity draw. This time round, the organizer is "Venetian Macau" okay...somemore they said the event was broadcast over pheonix tv on sunday n urge me to watch the live telecast to see that my number was one of the lucky 10 to win the 2nd prize.<br>And now their tactics had changed. They no longer asked you for your bank account number outright but they insist thay I have to go to Macau personally to claim the prize, then pay 2.5% to the Macau Social Welfare Depatment or something like dat.<br>So I played along with them loh, to see when they will start asking me for my bank account number. So when the "lawyer" called, I asked him for his license number so I can check with the relevant authorities that he start giving some stupid excuses...*lol* I say I will call him back to arrange an appointment wih him when I settle my matters in singapore to fly over there.. Like I will ever will..<br>We shall see if they dare to call me back again.<br>I also called the CAD this morning to report this case, and the officer in charge said they have recieved several calls regarding this venetian macau thing.<br>Waste my time!<br><br></div></blockquote>Dear all,<br><br>I think these posts are very informative so I wana share my experience with the same "Venetian" scam.<br><br>I got some calls from these chinese speaking ppl over a super noisy background telling me watch the charity event on STARWORLD on the 23rd of Sep. I was at home then so I tuned in just to double check, of course there was no such thing lah..(not sure why they would name such a prominent channel when its pretty easy to tune into) anyways, knowing by then it was gona be a fraud thing I played along with them. When I mentioned that no such programme or advertising about the show had been done here (I read the papers a whole lot) the lady very smart lor, she told me what for they spend so much money call me all the way from macau just to cheat me. So I ended the call then by telling her that I was working and no time to watch or go down.<br><br>Think by then they decided to target me further because I told them I did not watch the show, so they assume Im just busy and ignorant. So..yesterday this lady called 杨梅斯 Yang Mei Si phoned me again tru a super noisy background, called to tell me that I won the 2nd prize also..yes..HK$1million. Honestly, just to hear that I won such a big amount whether tru anot is quite pleasing to the ears~ lol<br><br>Anyways, I questioned this lady alot and she even took the liberty to make small talk with me ask me if Im gona tell my parents, if im looking to spend a night at their hotel and even told me about the beginnings of the resort etc..their business etc. At the back of my mind I was really just thinking of how long they train themselves to remember such information just to scam ppl! Very 厉害 lor. lol<br><br>So I asked for email addresses, websites, web coverage, all she couldn't provide for me. But she really never gave up! She then proceeded to ask me for my IC no. Normally I would think its ok to give, anyways when u participate for lucky draws its always the mandatory thing to provide, but I was afraid they would use it to create fake ids etc with the number, so in the end I requested that they send me an official letter about the prize.<br><br>Perhaps now their running out of ideas because from others it seemed like they blatantly ask you to go to macau or pay them a sum of money for some tax thing. This one very clever, just tell me that they dun need to send me the letter to state that Iv won, just give them my address and they will send the cheque and I can bank it into HSBC, and just mail them back the receipt.<br><br>Now Im gauging that they'll call me back again sometime next week asking me if I've gotten their supposed cheque lol, I'm hoping to come up with something to scam them back too..or at least waste their time so they will have less time to target other weak folks. I think we shld make this a headline in the newpaper or something, coz at least it seems the bunch of us here are still net savvy enough to look up on such scams, but those who don't may just unknowingly fall into the circle of frauds.<br><br>Anyways, for those who also encountered the same thing or same person,<br>I recorded the number that was used to call me and the number (which is most likely fake too) for other's references.<br><br>They called me using this no: +234567890<br>Return number: 85366426739<br><br></div>
