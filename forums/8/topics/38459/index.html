            <div class='col-md body'>2 years ago, I entered an institute of higer learning after serving the army. At first, i was a bit lonely as my jc friends were all in different schools from mine. However, i managed to make new friends in no time. I thought life was a bed of roses. That was until i realised that i had started to develop feelings for this particular girl in my class - A. At first, i did not really take any notice of A. In fact, I wasn't even aware of her presence (I'm the bo chap type who couldn't even bother to remember people's name unless i am really close to them). Anyway, there was these silly rumours going around that i liked her. But, i didn't really care.<br><br>I really got to know her better after we chose to do the same major. As fate would have it, i ended up in the same class again after i asked for a transfer because of my "best friend", B. Soon, we spent a lot of time together, thanks to the endless reports and projects that we have to do. I started to have feelings towards A because i found her to be cute and innocent. At that time, B has volunteered to "help" me chase A. Actually, he was the one interested in A. To cut a long story short, A and I have distanced ourself from B after we found out all the wrongs that B have done to me...backstabbing, etc. However, deep inside, I don't really hate B for all the wrongs that he had done. There was only jealousy. It's a feeling worse than hatred.<br><br>A and I are still good friends....and she is only treating me as one. Deep inside, i really wanted to be more than friends. But I know it is impossible. I have tried going out with another gal to force myself to forget A, but to no avail. I felt so guilty as I had lead the other gal on. I really do not know what to do....except to forget her. It may hurt...but time may heal all pains <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
