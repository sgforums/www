            <div class='col-md body'>Heya'll Homies:<br><br>It's me once again. Missing in action: Well, I've been reading a few threads, and that's all. Im sorry if I don't reply to your post, or I never continue my thread: That's because I really do hate what some of you say (I know you feel the same towards me but I'm the one posting. You can ignore this if you like!)<br><br>&gt;&gt;<br><br>Allright guys. First and foremost, of course I've to talk about my dear nemesis again whose password is apparently ilove<strong>bratpitt</strong>, yet another white sensation. Nice going FireICe, hope you'll meet your dream white guy soon.<br><br>&gt;&gt;<br><br>BBQ? Forum BBQ? Cool. I would love to go there. PM me the venue. Just dont blame me and my homies for spoiling ur day!<br><br>&gt;&gt;<br><br>Oh ye, what the other readers highlight about local girls loving white guys (oh why am i back at it again? because its hell true[for the majority]!) is definitely true. Man, I was at the Singapore Expo Food Bazaar or something and I saw this OLD BIG WHITE JERK lovin' that YOUNG HOT TANNED CHINK S1UT. Man, nice couple. Hope when im old, Singaporean girls can fill my needs.<br><br>&gt;&gt;<br><br>Bush has won! OMFG. He's a crack! You know he smoked weed before? Well that aint a surprise. (I do smoke weedie before/ but not now anyway) Singapore is a drug-free society? Haha. Dudes, I often bring SG HOT CHINK girls to nearby countries to have some drug shots. Well those sg chink s1uts love weedie. It's sorta expensive in Asia. A bowl of Weed in California (around 7 oz.)  cost USD $15. The same quantity in Indonesia costs around US$27. Man. But anyway lotsa chink girls love weed.<br><br>&gt;&gt;<br><br>Switched on Channel News Asia the other day. Man, CNA is another ripoff of CNN. And look at the way they speak. Man, if you wanna impersonate us or the Brits, pls do it clearly, like some of the Singaporeans (male and female) i know. Don't gimme that hybrid accent crap. It sounds awfully goofy.<br><br>&gt;&gt;<br><br>Singapore Idol! Yet another American Ripoff! Nice accent people.<br><br>&gt;&gt;<br><br>Underaged s3x lotsa 'em nowdays. I heard a white kid from my neighbourhood went to screw a 13 yo chink girl. Good going, but (you know) asian parents always complain.<br><br>&gt;&gt;<br><br>Jack West. Heard of him? He's screwed dude (in and out). Man that's a big sicko (i aint know him in my community.) That white american was a s3x maniac. He raped his son when his son was 13, commited fraud and other crimes. When he was convicted, West flew away and landed in Singapore - yet another Whites Paradise! He soon got a nice PAYING job (though he was a convict!) and screw lotsa young chink girls. He also ran a website (not porno, dudes!) that showcased willing Singaporean Girls who craved for white boyfriends! (Are you one of the girls? It's a popular site!) If you think i made up all this crap about jack west, or i blew up his case, check it out in the Straits Times!<br><br>&gt;&gt;<br><br>On last note: Singapore! You're truly a white man's paradise! Even raping your own son can land you such happiness (until he was caught because he commited yet another crime here: if he doesnt commit any crap crimes, he will be living luxuriously forever!)<br><br>Talk about shooting away the colonial mindset chinks, you're actually building on it!<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Supremist</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You are right! White man are more preferable by employers and women, I think it is because they are smarter and have bigger dick. Your mother married to a white man as well isn't it? She can't be wrong!<br><br>White man is the strongest race in the world!<br>White man have the biggest dick!<br>White man is God to other races!<br><br>If I have a daugther, I would suggest her to suck up to a white man and try to marry one, doesn't matter if he is old or poor or a sicko, as long as he is white! Why? because even the worst white man is better than asian man!<br><br>Supermist you are right! bravo! keep it up! that's the attitude you should have as a white man! I salute you!<br><br>Of cause I said all this is just because I, a chink asian man see white man like you as God, white man can't be wrong!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Someone once asked me about the difference between a chink and a Chinaman. "I know the word chink is offensive," he said. "But what's wrong with calling someone a Chinaman?" To illustrate the difference between the two, I decided to tell him a story:<br><br>There was once a superhero named Chinaman, like there once was a superhero named Superman. Superman could lift cars and fly and run real fast, while Chinaman did nothing cool at all. He only built miles and miles of endless railroad tracks, like his ancestors who once built miles and miles of endless stone walls. Back home in China he pulled rickshaws for miles and miles as extremely fat men sat in the back and yelled at him to go faster. When he moved here he slaved away on sugar plantations in Hawaii, fishing canneries in Alaska, gold mines in California, and hand laundries everywhere for half a penny an hour. This meant it took him two hours to make any real money. And while Superman didn't have to take shit from anybody, Chinaman took shit from everybody, kind of like Jew Man. Chinaman was thrown down wells, deported about fifty million times, excluded from America for sixty years, beat up for his money everyday, and taxed for all the gold he ever found in the lonely Californian hills. And if Superman and Chinaman ever got into a fight, Superman would win because he can punch Chinaman all the way to the moon while Chinaman can barely dent the Man of Steel. So how can Chinaman even be considered a superhero if he was such a loser? Superman would have done everything a zillion times faster and better than Chinaman, right? I'll let you think about this one.<br><br>And just like Superman had an arch-nemesis in Lex Luther, Chinaman had an arch-nemesis in a villain known as the Chink. Everybody hated the Chink. The Chink would take away jobs from another superhero called White Man by flooding the whole country with his evil yellow brothers. The Chink would marry White Man's sisters and make evil little half-Chinks. The Chink would open opium dens, gambling parlors, and whorehouses, and the innocent youth of America would go to these places and be corrupted. The Chink also ate rats and dogs and anything else that crawled because he was not human. Chinaman, however, had a hard time fighting the Chink. This was because the Chink was a part of Chinaman, just like Mr. Hyde was a part of Dr. Jekyll and the Nigger was a part of the Negro. What made it worse was that Chinaman could turn into the Chink at any time. Someone only had to call the Chink's name, or get angry at Chinaman, and the Chink would magically appear. Pretty soon Chinaman became inseparable from the Chink, and their names became interchangeable. Realizing that he would never win the war against the Chink or the people who could summon his enemy, Chinaman retreated to his Chinatown base. He hid there in fear of himself and other people.<br><br>Chinaman passed away many years ago. Nobody killed him; he just grew old like acid-washed jeans and went the way of Negro and Red Indian (You'll have to ask someone else about these two other superheroes). Chinaman's children are still around, but are no longer referred to by their father's name because it was so synonymous with the Chink. Many of them also moved out of Chinatown, living wherever they want. But the Chink never died. He's a part of Chinaman's children, and if you want to see him you simply have to say or think Chinaman or Chink. Instantly the Chink will appear to you, one billion strong, ready to take over your world and your jobs, eat your dogs, breed you out of existence, drive in the wrong lane, take a zillion pictures of the same thing, and do better than you on the hardest of math and science tests. That's what the Chink means to you. And that's why he still exists.<br><br></div>
