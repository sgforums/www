            <div class='col-md body'>I think applying generalisations to an entire race or nationality isn't very wise.<br><br>I have met American people whom I love and those whom I dislike.  I have also worked with HongKongers, Indonesians, Thais, Australians, Canadians, Filipinos, etc etc and have learnt that a person's nationality / ethnicity is not a sure reflection of their character and values.  I prefer to see them as individuals and would rather formulate my opinion of them after knowing them on a personal level.<br><br>Everywhere you go, there will always be Singaporeans who worship all things American / Western but there will also be those who embrace their own roots and tradition.  Then there are those who strike a good balance between the two. I say, to each his own, live and let live, and let's stop saying that ALL Singaporean girls are like this or ALL American men are like that.<br><br>Each time I travel to the US, I've benefitted from the hospitality and generosity of my American friends.  I've also seen racism rear its ugly head.  I prefer not to be prejudiced and keep an open mind towards people of different races and nationalities.<br><br>A few people suspect that Supremist is actually a Singaporean trying to make us wake up to an issue that obviously bothers him.  I think they're right.  His rhetoric and something about his writing style tells me he isn't who he claims to be.  He works too darn hard at trying to make us hate his own race and kind!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I got some things to say.<br><br>1stly. Fireice i didn;t know u loved brad pitt, haha so much for ur local product talk. But either way ur still fine.<br><br>2ndly.. errr about bush's re-election, it just goes to show how incredibly STUPID most of the WHITE american electorate is, even though they have so-called superior white genes. Yeah NEw york is the new Rome, where the romans were fickle.<br><br>3rdly. About u and ur no doubt KKK wankers going to the forum bbq, you aint got the GUTS to go, and i can't be bothered to see if u or ur so called homies do or not..<br><br>4thly.. errr about u going to the some food bazaar thing, well, as i keep telling white people and local inferior men, spgs are a freakin minority. The rest of the local female population don't give a damn about white men. So why keep playing up this pretext that white men are more desirable??? Your making us look bad like we are insecure and need so much consoling.<br><br>5thly.. about channel news asia being like CNN, haha! Yeah ur kinda right about that, but hey it was a cool move, especially with the de-westernisation movement going on, we are seeing the asian version of everything that is western. But as for their accents, only a few asian people are like that, those that have been educated abroad, otherwise the rest of them speak more locally and only a bit incomprehensibly. Besides, CNA is more like BBC, with all their non-news programmes, CNN sucks.<br><br>6thly.. yeah singapore idol haha, agreed. You know when i was 12, i loved wheel of fortune so much, i wrote to TCS and said they should have singapore wheel of fortune, the director said i was nuts.. when i was 18.. what did we have?? Singapore wheel of fortune that did not last long rofl.<br>But i believe, rather then a move to be WHITE, the reason we have these shows here is coz the local dramas SUCKKK esp the channel 5 ones.. which they constantly have to bring back in "final seasons" which are not final rofl.<br><br>7thly. Sg aint no universal white man's paradise.<br><br>8thly.. i am sick of ur behaviour, u make me sick and if i ever see you i will give u an uppercut.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i read this: u know why black (africans) have big di(ks? it's 'cause their women are very promiscuous, so over evolution, they had to grow v big di(ks to keep their women. if u think abt it, since the white guy likes to harp abt how big/great his di(k is, it's prolly cuz white women are slu77y. so following this logic, white women are slu77ier than chinese girls!!!</div>

Dudette wake up pal, how can i reply to so many replies when all Singaporean geeks here who love sgforums and nothing else bombard me? Some stinky geeks also message me and post some WhiteGuy/ChinkGirls porn for me to view. Dudes who've done this. I appreciate it. Asian girl porns are all the rage in America, but, my chink girlfriend stays with me, she'll be unhappy. Anyway she frequents this forum too <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> That's how i know about this trashplace.<br><br>&gt;&gt;<br><br>Dudette. I didnt comment about the size of people at all! Stop being paranoid! Wow, she said something like THERE'RE SO MANY asian guys marrying white girls. Haha. Get your facts right dudette, put it relative to the no. of Chink girls and white guys. Good excuse to fend yourself off when your asian boyfriend catches you with some hot white dude on bed though.<br><br>&gt;&gt;<br><br>Suppose you insult americans? Well, americans were always criticised. But we accept criticisms with an open heart! What about you chink people? You only try to deny it and screw me back with some useless rhetoric!<br><br>&gt;&gt;<br><br>I told you bush is a crack. He overspent USA's resources and still get elected. Anyway, my vote went for kerry.<br><br>&gt;&gt;<br><br>Me, a kid? Just because I put that birthdate in my profile as 1987 i mean it? Geeks, get a life. I just blindly filled up those craps. Calling me a pig? Oh well, pigs have yellowish skin. Speak for yourself.  Smell of ignorance? Then can you thoroughly address the Jack West case?<br><br>&gt;&gt;<br><br>Chink friends, my point is made.
