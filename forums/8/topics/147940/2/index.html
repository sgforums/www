            <div class='col-md body'>Happy Birthday to MM Lee Kuan Yew<br><br>For over the past 46 years since you become PM and rule over Singapore you have developed it from a shattered (developing, third world country)city to a modern and high-rise buliding (developed, first world country). But there is still room for improvment is some ways and matter as all government in the world is not perfect but you still try to cover this and that. I want to say a big thank you to you and hope that you still can listen to our views on the government or Singapore as this is our country and we can comment what we can   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Yours sincerly<br>gorby107<br></div>

Every true blue Singaporean had and will continue to contribute to nation building and effort by all (no matter how small) needs to be noted and appreciated. Yes, we shall never forget the contribution by the many comrades, workers and fellow Singaporean who had dedicated their life to nation building and had fallen on the way. I say thank you very much for giving us a place which we can proudly call Â“our country our homeÂ”.<br><br>Yes, Happy Birthday to MM Lee Kuan Yew.  I thank you for your contribution for you had dedicated your whole life for the good of Singapore, our country our home.  I wish you continuous good health and happiness.<br></div>
