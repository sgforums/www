            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, this has come to my attention and I would like to bring it forward to you ppl.<br><br>Adults are experience, mature and thinks much coherently than 'kids'. This may be true to some extent but what I do not like is how they kept trashing kids like they are so perfect in every sense.<br><br>I have a few real life examples :<br><br>1. My comp broke down and our phone line was not working because my stepmum divorced my dad and she cut off the telephone line. No choice, have to use my dad's handphone. I call and ask for help but to no avail. I am a computer amateur and my dad push all the reponsibilities to get the comp working right to me. The phoneline has been cut off for many days, why didn't he go renew it? Because his hp has important calls coming in, he starts to become impatient and told me to hurry up. ok I hurried up but still the computer not working. For a few days my comp not working, he will sit there and whine about how it gives a lot of trouble, disrupting calls all that. Like wow, i dun have a hp and the phoneline is cut off and i'm calling a hotline no. of course i cant use the public phone. He calls me stupid and slow whereas he just sits there and do nothing.<br><br>I paid for the computer repair out of my own pocket money and all he does was to bring it to the repair shop. oh wow, if he's soo clever why didn't he check it properly before fixing it to my hse? And he says it's working fine over there and he blame it on the hse's luck  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>2. My previous sec sch teacher has a very lewd crush on me (arrghh) I felt uncomfortable in his presence as he will keep stalking me..wherever I am, he will be there. He is like 40+ if im not wrong..So another teacher she knew about this crush (this teacher doesn't likes me) ignores the fact I was being disturbed. This stupid teacher was very bias. She will only cares abt students who suck up to her -.-" So when the stalking gets on my nerves, I raise my voice in front of the office. This bias teacher happens to be there too and from then on, she talks to me like I was a 4 year old kid -.-" Evrything I say she will just dismiss them off, heck care and just scold.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Virtual world :<br><br>1. Ok this adult girl was killing the whole map, I was below killing some the monsters (it's an mmorpg so it's a public game yah?) She suddenly tell me to get lost and insulted me as a kid who whines all day without a reason..I guess she didn't want to share and I told her that it was only a few monsters and why is she scolding me liddat. She told me she's a working adult and she needs to work tomorrow so dun waste my time, get lost -.-"""<br><br>oh wow wow, next think I knew, I was being defamed. I told her that she is tarnishing the name of adults and she told me that you are just a kid anyway you have no say..<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>So what do you think of adults like that?</div>
