            <div class='col-md body'>Before giving my opinions, I have to ask you whether are you just over weight or grossly over weight? If your BMI belongs to the grossly overweight, I would advise that normal exercises like jogging, skipping ropes, aerobics and all high impact exercises be avoided.  Because at that weight, high impact exercises would kill ur knees.  The only exercises you should do are brisk walking and swimming.  If you are just slightly overweight, I would still advise u on swimming and brisk walking as they give the best results for the minimal side effects but its ok if you wanna go ahead with others.<br><br>As for dieting, there are people who suggested skipping meals or eating just 2 meals a day.  If you are really that disciplined and do not find it a chore and a suffering, by all means eat 2 good meals per day.  But if you really cant do it, let me suggest something to you.<br><br>Its very easy; if your input of food is lesser than your output, you will surely lose weight no matter how much. Alot of times, the weight gained do not come from our normal meals unless you have KFC for all your meals.  It comes from the snacking, the finger foods, the in between meals, late suppers etc.  These are the killers.  Rather than asking you to skip meals, I would suggest you cut down drastically on ur snacking and stick strictly to 3 good meals per day.  In that way, you do not suffer and you lose weight.  What should you eat in a meal, you may ask.  On a normal day at the economic rice store, I have rice with 2 vegetables (or sub with 1 egg) and 2 meat dishes.  WOW, you may say.  But I say, eat well and full so that you do not have any excuses and reasons to snack and eat in between meals.<br><br>I lost weight that way. I am still overweight now but without exercising and skipping meals, I lost 20kg over the last 1 year. I find it amazing but its true. Some other people may say, hey thats not alot what...but i say I lost weight but still i eat all i want and i did not really exercise other than some brisk walking.  So well its a good tradeoff.<br><br>If you really wanna lose alot of weight fast, then by all means skip meals, exercise. If you do not mind the time frame, try my method.  Also if your weight is really endangering ur health, go see a doctor, they will give you advice on losing weight.</div>
