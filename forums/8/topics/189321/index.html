The main opposition Conservative Party made strong gains.<br><br>The BBC projected that, had Thursday's elections taken place across Britain rather than just parts of England, the Conservatives would have won 40 percent of the vote.<br><br>The smaller opposition Liberal Democrats would have gained 27 percent and Labour 26 percent.<br><br>Political analysts in Britain regard local elections -- where the biggest issues are often neighbourhood policing, swimming pools and rubbish collection -- as mid-term snapshots of a government's popularity.<br><br>"I think this shows the Conservative Party is broadening its appeal, that it's attracting new voters and I think we see a Labour Party that is in some sort of serious meltdown," said the Tories' youthful leader, David Cameron.<br><br>Adding to the humiliation, Labour's earlier iron grip on the working-class east London council of Barking and Dagenham weakened as the far-right British National Party scooped up 11 seats with its anti-immigrant platform. - AFP /dt<br><br></div>
