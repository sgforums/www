            <div class='col-md body'>Mods, help to lock this thread. Much thanks.<br><br>Please do forward this!<br><br>My Dear Friends, (4th April 2006)<br><br>I would like to seek for your help, as one of my classmates is now facing a huge problem in helping her sister fighting against cancer. She is now urgently looking for AB+ platelets donar (For more infomation, please refer to the mail below). Unfortunately, she is not be able to find anyone with that blood type yet, but her sister might need them next week.<br><br>Please give us a hand, because life is precious. If you are AB+ blood type and willing to help, please contact me at 97511805.<br><br>Thank you,<br>Fong May<br><br>Dear friends,<br><br>My sister, Angeline Khoo is currently hospitalizes at the isolation room no.5 of ward 58 (The Cancer Institute) of NUH. She diagnosed with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) after the bone marrow aspiration since last year. CML is a malignant cancer of the bone marrow. It causes rapid growth of the blood-forming cells (known as myeloid precursors) in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and body tissues. To cure this disease, she decided to undergo the bone marrow transplant (BMT). After some times of seeking for suitable bone-marrow donor, the doctor decided to take my brother, Andrew Khoo as a donor. My brother is of A+ blood group while my sister is of B+ blood group originally. After the BMT, the new A+ blood group will get rid of the existing B+ blood group in my sister's body. In which eventually, my sister will be changed to A+ blood group.<br><br>BMT has started since last week by high-dose chemotherapy as an initial process/state to kill all the bad and good cells. The chemotherapy end on Tuesday and followed by injection of stem cells on Thursday and was fully injected successfully. She is under observation state now. I was then told to look for AB+ platelets donor and O+ blood donor to backup in case of bleeding and bruising<br>occured.<br><br>However, based on her good progression today (i.e. her blood condition is stable), I was told that O+ blood group donor is not needed anymore. But, backup AB+ platelets donor is still needed as there may be activation of platelets donation if her platelets count drops within this 2 weeks. As such, I need to look for about 3 backup AB+ platelets donors. Please see the details below.<br><br>Please let me know if anyone iswilling to volunteer as a backup donor. You can contact me through my mobile: 90046938, u can sms or just call me.<br><br>Many Thanks.<br></div>
