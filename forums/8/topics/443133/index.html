              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">A woman was near death from a special kind of cancer. There was one drug that the doctors thought might save her. It was a form of radium that a druggist in the same town had recently discovered. The drug was expensive to make, but the druggist was charging ten times what the drug cost him to produce. He paid $200 for the radium and charged $2,000 for a small dose of the drug. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">The sick woman's husband, Heinz, went to everyone he knew to borrow the money, but he could only get together about $1,000 which is half of what it cost. He told the druggist that his wife was dying and asked him to sell it cheaper or let him pay later. But the druggist said: "No, I discovered the drug and I'm going to make money from it." So Heinz got desperate and broke into the man's store to steal the drug for his wife.</span><br style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">Should Heinz have broken into the store to steal the drug for his wife? Why or why not?</span></p>
              <p>And also, what are your thoughts on altruism? How many types are there? Are human beings altruists by default?Â </p>

              <p>isn't it happening already?</p>
              <p>big corporations were suing places like India for producing generic medication for their own population as the people could not afford the insanely high prices charged by the corporations for their patented drugs...</p>
              <p>and it's going to get more insane in the future as doctors may not be allowed to diagnose patients because "medical procedures" may be patented so a doctor who knows of a procedure which may save the patient, may not be allowed to use it...</p>

              <p>so maybe this dilemma may end up on the doorsteps of doctors for real in the near future of SCOTUS goes ahead with this...</p>

              <p>True altruism does not exist I think, there's always at least a subconcious reward.</p>
              <p>But the story you initially posed, there's no form of altruism, as the druggist already intended to profit and Heinz wanted to save his wife which in a way, is something dear to him. I would say Heinz and Druggist are selfish, opposite of altruism.</p>
              <p>However, in the bus scenario, the good guy displays form of altruism as he gains no benefit from saving a stranger.</p>
              <p>I still think for every action, there's a reward, hence purest form of altruism is inexistent. In short, just acknowledging that you did/must do something good, is a pyschological reward.</p>
