              <p>Let me tell you a simple and honest truth.</p>
              <p>Go out to work first before taking any degree in science. before you regret.</p>
              <p>MDIS</p>
              <p>= 2 to 2.5 years after cut off.  ~28k.</p>
              <p>= Take 3-4 subjects at the same time and exams, like Poly.</p>
              <p>PSB</p>
              <p>= 4 years minimum after cut off. ~ 30+k.</p>
              <p>= Take one module at a time and exam after like 1 month plus.</p>

              <p>p.s anyway some of my seniors took up accountancy courses and they told me that in their classes alot of the people there took triple sciences and do not have poa as foundation in sec sch.</p>
              <p>so if i never take biology, not even in combined sciences, will i be at disadvantage when applying for courses mentioned above ? or when in poly they still teach what people learn in sec sch so those never bio in sec sch wont lose out?</p>

              <p>what poly are you from ?? </p>
              <p>if not biomedical science, how about those like biotechnology or
                  molecular biotechnology? what do they do in the course? is it
                  the same as biomedical sciences? anyway if study biomedical
                  science, what can we work as ? something like a doctor or what?
                  anyway why useless ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>p.s anyway some of my seniors took up accountancy courses and
                  they told me that in their classes alot of the people there took
                  triple sciences and do not have poa as foundation in sec sch.</p>
              <p>so if i never take biology, not even in combined sciences, will
                  i be at disadvantage when applying for courses mentioned above ? or
                  when in poly they still teach what people learn in sec sch so those
                  never bio in sec sch wont lose out?</p>

              <p>I am from NP. In biomedical no further studies = lab assistant = low money. And no way you can be a doctor. Nus school of medicine is the hardest to get in school ever. Not only you need to have a perfect score/ near perfect score. But you also need recomendation letters from your teachers. A portfolio of yourself, good cca records, and a interview maybe.</p>
              <p>You can. But of course some basic knowledge is no harm.</p>

              <p>Doesn't matter really, private is still private. You're still gonna get your wages downplayed because you hold a private degree. You might as well just work longer and go overseas for your degree.</p>
              <p>Last resort is SIM imho, other than that, I don't really see a point to go other private Uni. Else, if your portfolio is impressive, you can try to get into NUS/NTU through discretionary admission.</p>

              <p>They actually reserve about 15% to 20% of their slots to Poly students. And DWM is a confirmed entry.</p>
