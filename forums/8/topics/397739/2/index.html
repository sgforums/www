              <p>Usually 3.5 is the cutoff, some course have up to 3.2 or even 2.5.</p>
              <p>But science course is different, I didn't see the GP but I think it's 3.7+ for the last 10th percentile.</p>
              <p>Anyway 3.27 should be able to get into SMU IS provided you ace the interview. Their cum laude holders were highest paid in a survey this year.</p>

              <p>3.5 will not get you into local university for Life Sciences (NUS) or Biological Sciences (NTU). You need MORE than that. If you want to be guaranteed a place, you need a Diploma with Merit.</p>
              <p>Anyway, my advice to you would be to work first, then try to use ya work experience as a form of advantage to get you into either NTU or NUS in 1-2 years time. Otherwise you should go overseas to Australia like Melbourne and Queensland Uni for further studies.</p>
              <p>If you wish to do research or laboratory based work next time, then it is highly recommended that you stick to NUS or NTU. Getting a Science (Biological or Life Science or Biomedical) from Psb or Mdis, is equivalent to having just a diploma. It will not increase your pay that much. Degrees from NUS and NTU would be much much recognised both locally and overseas as compared to those from Mdis and Psb.</p>

              <p>Was I putting anyone down? I was merely stating my point of view in regards to MDIS/PSB against SIM and then SIM against SMU. Statistics don't lie neither do they not, but can they not be used as guidelines? Else, what's the point in the first place?</p>
              <p>I did not essentially point out that SMU was better than NUS or NTU, IÂ bet your reply would have been different if NUS Law was topping the charts.</p>
              <p>Did I say having a spot in a local uni equate to a life of success and fame? I did not, in fact, I made no such reference so don't twist my words.</p>

              <p>Was I putting anyone down? I was merely stating my point of view in regards to MDIS/PSB against SIM and then SIM against SMU. Statistics don't lie neither do they not, but can they not be used as guidelines? Else, what's the point in the first place?</p>
              <p>I did not essentially point out that SMU was better than NUS or NTU, IÂ bet your reply would have been different if NUS Law was topping the charts.</p>
              <p>Did I say having a spot in a local uni equate to a life of success and fame? I did not, in fact, I made no such reference so don't twist my words.</p>

Not only you need to have a perfect score/ near perfect score. But you also need recomendation letters from your teachers. A portfolio of yourself, good cca records, and a interview maybe.</p>

              <p>Secondly, do you know that SIM have offered 2 Scholarships value $100,000 where you can choose to study overseas or local, but must have GPA of 3.5 out of 4. Anyway no harm apply and if it does not work out, you can always choose option suggested above. Link : <a href="http://www.sim.edu.sg/simscholarships">http://www.sim.edu.sg/simscholarships</a></p>
