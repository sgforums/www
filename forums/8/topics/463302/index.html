              <p>Is 2013,  The End of Life as we know it ?</p>
              <p>Scientists have warned that society as we know it, may be greatly disrupted by an intense solar flare predicted for 2013. A solar flare is a sudden eruption of intense high-energy radiation from the sun’s surface caused by a huge explosion on the surface of the sun. A Solar Flare could hit the Earth like a lightening bolt and knock out all electrical and navigational equipment in key parts of the World or even a complete shutdown across the globe.</p>
              <p><a href="http://newport2010.com//2013solarflare/flare/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/78255234.jpg"><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 10px; border: black 5px solid;" title="78255234" src="http://newport2010.com//2013solarflare/flare/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/78255234.jpg" alt="Solar Flare" width="165" height="134"></a>Scientists believe it could damage everything from aircraft and ground controls, emergency services’ systems, emergency hospital equipment, banks and traffic controls, through to everyday items that we all take for granted such as home computers, tvs and the driver’s friend – the Sat Nav. Power grids could overheat and bring counties to thier knees whilst electronic items, navigation devices and even satellites could stop working after the Sun reaches its maximum power sometimein 2013. The effect of such a ‘storm’ could be felt for days, weeks or even months as we try to bring the World back on line with electricity, communications and vital services. The entire World relies on electricity and satelites for it’s day to day life and to suddenly be thrown into the dark ages will be a major disaster for anyone effected by the solar flare. It is beleived that such a phenomenon occurs only once about every 100 years. A once in a lifetime space storm is forecast to stretch from late 2012 into 2013 when the sun’s 22 year magnetic energy cycle coincides with its 11-year peak in superpowered sun spot activity.</p>
              <p>The last time a huge flare effected the earth was in 1859, when is it said that a large proportion of the sky was covered in a bright red haze.</p>
              <p>According to a report published in December 2008,  NASA’s THEMIS space craft discovered a hole in earth’s magnetic field which is 10 times as large as previously thought by scientists.  The magnetosphere, is designed to protect the planet from the plasma of solar flares, but  now it has a hole in it four time the size of the earth.</p>
              <p>According to the NASA report, “Northern IMF events don’t actually trigger geomagnetic storms. A loaded magnetosphere is primed for auroras, power outages, and other disturbances that can result when, say, a CME (coronal mass ejection) hits.”</p>
              <p>But was all this chaos predicted generations ago in a Mayan prophecy?   They predicted the end of the World or the end of the Earth as we know it for 2012.   Maybe, they were slightly out out on thier predictions ?   The peak of the solar maximum will not occur until sometime in 2013, and such a huge solar storm would not  normally occur until shortly after the peak of surface activity.</p>
              <p>The only saving grace is that  a solar flare would not destroy the Earth – the Planet would still continue, but how would human kind manage without power and communications and the Internet ?</p>

              <p>A solar physicist at NASA says there&amp;apos;s no reason to think that strong solar flares expected in 2013 will disrupt life on earth, a day after a British official warned they could bring power and communications systems to a grinding halt.</p>
              <p>"Solar flares happen all the time," NASA&amp;apos;s Jeffrey Newmark said from Washington. "The key is, how do we mitigate?"</p>
              <p>At a conference earlier this week, British Secretary of Defence Liam Fox caused a stir by warning that a once-in-a-century solar flare could bring modern life to a halt by paralyzing power grids and disabling satellite communications.</p>

              <p>Fox said the British government has been working with experts and private companies to "build collective resilience" against the effects of a powerful solar flare.</p>
              <p>"Much of our critical national infrastructure depends on data and services delivered from, or through satellites, whose sensitive electronics are vulnerable to some of the radiation emitted by the sun," Fox said.</p>
              <p>NASA has predicted that a new wave of solar activity will likely peak around 2013. But the agency maintains that the stronger flares will be similar to those that earth has experienced as recently as 2002.</p>
              <p>Newmark told Canada AM that the sun goes through 11-year cycles and solar flares are indeed expected to intensify over the next few years -- but they should be "business as usual."</p>
              <p>The planet has experienced a solar cycle "maximum" before, he said Thursday morning, "and we understand what to expect from the future."</p>
              <p>NASA has a fleet of spacecraft that monitor solar activity so that the agency can predict the sun&amp;apos;s behaviour, Newmark said.</p>
              <p>The space agency also has a warning system in place in the event of unusually powerful solar flares, he said, that could help safeguard power grids and satellites.</p>
              <p>In 1859, a "super solar flare" knocked out telegraph lines around the world and lit paper on fire at telegraph offices. In today&amp;apos;s high-tech world, a similar event could cause billions of dollars in damage, by some estimates.</p>
              <p>Newmark acknowledged that our wired societies make them more vulnerable to solar events.</p>
              <p>"However, at the same time the technology we use enables us to better understand these events, better predict them and enable us to mitigate them," he said.</p>
