We sin... Unless of cause you are sinless... which is impossible... Only one person is sinless as we believe which is Jesus... anyway not getting into it. Ok then Jesus have the abilities to bear your sin from judgement of going to hell... You go to Jesus then He will do that. That is how it works...<br><br>The same thing as... in the ancient world. Everyone who is a criminal should go to jail and suffer punishment... but if you know the emperor or you are his son... you can go a free... except that in the above case you need to be repentful... truely repentful...<br><br>also if Jesus is the Lord then of course you need to find him to recieve the forgiveness and not some other tom dick or harry which is not God... ( no offence here just speaking in condition of purely Christianity perspective as illustration) Example... you go to a mdm wong... know the bouncer there you can get in free... not some other funny character or another pub's bouncer.</div>
