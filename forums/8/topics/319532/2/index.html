              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>Think it's a good habit to formerly quote your sources....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok that said, after Qin's 'one people, one nation' consolidation, there are many dialect groups that made it to the court as ministers. What is Xu Fu's? Also, the  virgin bois and gers were specially selected from all over China to exchange for Qin's Tongkat Ali a.k.a. elixir of longevity -  they were not from only one part of Central Nation  and thus they comprised of different dialect groups as well.</p>
              <p>Chinese studying Jap lang will know that certain Jap words sounded like certain dialects. E.g. Pencil = enpitsu and in hakka, it is the same pronounciation. Another wild silmilarity is 'Mediocre' = ma ma desu - doesn't it sounds like Cantonese 'mah mah deh'?</p>
              <p>If you wish to find out more, investigate on Xu Fu's dialect and his staffs' dialect. Cos none of them returned to China when they failed to bring back the elixir. I'm not sure of your claim that they returned to resup - please quote the source.</p>
              <p>One point to note is Qin's emporor's head dress and traditional Jap royal blood's head dress. In Jap royal head dress, it's black and seldom gold - at least the earliest record. In ancient China, no one was allowed/had the resources to wear yellow or gold. All the ministered had to wear the offical black. And I believe Xu Fu also wore black head dress. Compare that (design and colour) to Jap ancient royal head dress.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Quoting this website, Japan was linked to the continent and it seems that academics think that Japan came from Korea &gt; China.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The Jomon culture, in essence a Mesolithic culture (although they
              display Neolithic traits, such as pottery-making), thrived in Japan
              from the eleventh century to the third century <span>B.C.</span>,
              when it was displaced by a wave of immigrants from the mainland. These
              were the Yayoi, and their origins lay in the north of China. Northern
              China was originally a temperate and lush place full of forests,
              streams, and rainfall. It began to dry out, however, a few thousand
              years before the common era. This dessication, which eventually
              produced one of the largest deserts in the world, the Gobi, drove the
              original inhabitants south and east. These peoples pushed into Korea
              and displaced indigenous populations. Eventually, these new settlers
              were displaced by a new wave of immigrations from northern China and a
              large number of them crossed over into the Japanese islands. For this
              reason, the languages of the area north of China, the language of
              Korea, and Japanese are all in the same family of languages according
              to most linguists. Because Mongolian (spoken in the area north of
              China) is also part of this language family and because the Mongolians
              conquered the world far to the west, this means that the language
              family to which Japanese belongs is spoken across a geographical region
              from Japan to Europe. The westernmost language in this family is
              Magyar, spoken in Hungary, and the easternmost language in this family
              is Japanese.
              <br><br>   The Yayoi brought with them agriculture, the working of
              bronze and iron, and a new religion which would eventually develop into
              Shinto (which wasn't given this name until much, much later). While we
              don't know what these immigrations did to the indigenous peoples, there
              are several possibilities. According to one theory, which is widely
              accepted in Japan, the waves of Yayoi immigrants were very small. While
              they brought new technologies with them, they were nevertheless
              assimilated into the native Jomon culture. By this account, Japanese
              culture, particularly as it is represented by the Shinto religion, is
              very ancient and indigenous Japan. Some Japanese believe that the Jomon
              spoke an <strong>Austronesian</strong> language, that is, that the Jomon were more closely related to south
              Pacific islanders and that Japanese is still largely a Pacific island
              language. In the West, historians believe that the Yayoi displaced the
              indigenous Jomon and thus ended their culture permanently. The Yayoi
              displaced the indigenous language, social patterns, and religion of the
              original inhabitants. In this view, Japanese culture is a foreign
              import deriving ultimately from the north of China and ancient Korea, a
              view that is not popular among the modern Japanese.</p>

              <p>Well, you can see that Japs are linked to many ethnic groups and culture. The thing to note is, with gene pool diversification, the off springs are healthier.</p>

              <p>This topic....is quite interesting to me...</p>
              <p>As a coincidence...recently I borrowed a book from the local library.....</p>
              <p>Happened to be written by an ex-ambassador.....Singaporean.....posted to afew countries in his career, including Japan.</p>
              <p>He wrote some things which more or less echo what you said....which is....Japan, and Korea, they have retained many ancient cultures from China, which in mainland already dissipate or gone.</p>
              <p>Afew things he said surprised me.......he said the Japanese language...almost half of it originate from Chinese language, that one maybe I heard before.....but he also said.....Kimono actually came from China's Tang dynasty, and Sumo is not a native Japanese sport, there was ancient cave wall painting in China depicting sumo.</p>
              <p>Hmm....forgot what else....thats all.....</p>
