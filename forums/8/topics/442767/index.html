              someone whom i considered a friend owed me some money that i tried to recover but each time the reply is sue me bankrupt loh. the problem is not that he owed me 4digits, its that i think he owed at least a couple other people 4digits, maybe even 5 but those other nitty gritty details i am not very clear yet.
              
              as far i last understood:
              a. hes unemployed, or maybe working part time or freelance,
              b. he has no other assets except maybe an empty-ish HDB (not sure under his or his family's name, lets assume His for starters),
              c. he dont mind stuck in sg or even going to jail, that fact that he even goes around repeatedly taunting people to sue him bankrupt, i dont know why and what he has in mind..
              
              so can i ask the sexperts here some questions:
              1. how to sue someone bankrupt literally?
              2. does it cost a lot? take a lot of time? what other factors help determine if its worth it at all?
              3. what happens then if the other party indeed goes bankrupt?
              4. what if someone else gets more upset and then take actual action to sue him bankrupt before i do? does the order of things makes any difference?
              5. if i dont sue that person bankrupt, cant afford time or energy to chase down the address every other day, what else can i do?
              6. if he starts working freelance or part time again, or even ride rickshaw or drive taxi or becomes offshore boatman (still in sg waters), can i intercept his cash flow? how? remember, i dont have a lot of time of my own to chase him down every street corner or canal. and i really trying not to throw more good money after bad money.
              
              ok i know some will jump straight to conclusion and try to gun me down for even lending money to such people, but the story is longer than that, he didnt actually started owing me money, he owed intangible stuff that had to be converted to monetary value over time, like he inevitably damaged my things etc etc..which cannot be repaired or those that can, at a costs. so please be kind and offer your best-est advice to the best of your knowledge, which is what i really need right down, really really appreciated. :)

              <p>There is no way you can get the money back from him. He can just claim that he has never received the money or this money is given. </p>
              <p>Unless there is formal contract (black and white being made).But in this fornal contract, probably you never thought of stating the interest rate and the time duration for the return.</p>

              @mancha:
              
              -small claims court can work? 
              -you mind roughly describe the process? 
              -need lawyer or ownself present? 
              -can courts order he pay? 
              -can he dispute? 
              -what if he dont pay even if court order? does he go jail? so what if he comes back out again?
              -if indeed courts declare him bankrupt isnt me ruining the chances of other creditors getting -any cent back from him (this i heard from friends, not sure correct or not so pls dont shoot me down)
              
              @veron soh:
              
              would you share any idea how much the process and how long it might take?
              what do you mean not 100% return? thks

              @Lokey
              
              thanks for the note, but i think i can get least some black/white, the burning questions in my mind are in my first posts, what each step in the process of suing someone bankrupt involves, entails and implies

              the questions i pose in this thread is to find out, can creditors take legit action to claim something back owed
              so are you saying in a way, that debtors pwn creditors totally and absolutely?
              can you share with us some of the details of some of the claiming processes that you came across that gave you that less than favourable impression?

              thanks but what can SCT do ultimately to the debtor and his outstanding debts? 
              if that works, then why people still need to file or sue for bankruptcy?
              so hence the question should be, then why didnt SCT work?

              <p>It's actually the long process and waiting that is a huge turn off. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="icon_neutral.gif"> If the debtor doesn't turn up for the meeting, then judge will reschedule to next meeting. It's kinda like a waiting game. Ultimately, after the last summon is send and he still doesn't appear, the court will issue writ of seizure.</p>
              <p>This is fun because the officer will go to the debtor house and start pasting stickers.</p>

              <p>You don't sue for bankruptcy. It is for the debtor to declare bankruptcy.</p>
              <p>You are advised to make sure the debtor is capable of paying up, before making a a claim.</p>
              <p>Like is said before, if you have the evidence, and the court judges in your favour, an order is made by the court to the debtor to pay up.</p>
              <p>The debtor can disobey the order at his own risk, or if really can't pay, put hands up and declare bankrupt.</p>
