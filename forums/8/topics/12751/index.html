            <div class='col-md body'>&lt;&lt; StarHub cell-phone users see red over cut lines &gt;&gt;<br><br>*** WHO IS IN THE WRONG??? STARHUB OR THE CUSTOMERS? HAVE STARHUB DONE CORRECTLY AND WHAT WILL OTHER MOBILE OPERATOR DO IF PAYMENT IS NOT PAID??? ***<br><br>Article extract from Straits Times:<br><br>MORE than 300 StarHub Mobile subscribers showed up at the StarHub Centre in Cuppage Road during lunchtime yesterday to find out why their mobile lines were cut abruptly over the previous 24 hours.<br>StarHub, which has more than 460,000 mobile-phone subscribers, said the lines were cut because of unpaid bills, after repeated reminders by letter and SMS.<br>It declined to say how many customers were affected but said most of the subscribers had bills outstanding for more than 90 days.'The suspension of service was made only as a last resort after our repeated attempts to have these customers settle their outstanding bills,' it said.<br>But six out of the seven people The Straits Times spoke to said they received no such reminders. Mr Sylvester Wong, 40, an interior designer, said: 'In my line of work I have to make and receive a lot of calls on the go. It's very disruptive and costly for my business when people can't reach me.' Mr Irman Salleh, a 26-year-old restaurant Manager, said: 'The line was dead when I tried making a call this morning, and I didn't know what happened. 'I could not get through to the customer service hotline, so I had to take leave from work, come all the way from Jurong just to find out I had outstanding bills.' Some subscribers, however, admitted they did not pay their bills on time. A 32-year-old sales executive, who gave her name only as Ms Sim, said: 'I know I had an outstanding payment, but it's less than $100. I didn't know they would cut my phone line so suddenly over such a small amount.' All seven people The Straits Times spoke to had outstanding bills of between $40 and $400. But even after making payment, some subscribers complained of not getting their mobile-phone lines reactivated soon enough. Said Mr Chin Kok Hiong, 33, a design consultant: 'I paid my bill of $200 this morning at 10 am. It's close to 4 o'clock now and I still cannot make calls on my phone.' A StarHub spokesman said: 'In normal circumstances, the line would be re-activated almost immediately, but due to the overwhelming demand we now have to adopt a queue for those reactivating their phone lines. Once you make payment, you will immediately join the queue.' Mr Lai Kee Chwee, StarHub's general manager for consumer markets, said: 'We're definitely looking at ways to prevent a repeat of this incident. 'We're considering sending more reminder letters and SMS messages, if necessary, before suspending lines with outstanding bills.'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Err.. Virgin also red and white.. how to differentiate?<br><br>Anyway, the cut throat attitude of Starhub is admired. COme on, although the customer is always right, there is not need to give them so much priviledge. Since they can afford to show this action, Starhub must have had confidence in its own customers right? I don't think it intended to kill its own image this way.<br><br>Think about the customers. Since they defaulted, they should not have service. This is correct, isn't it?<br><br>------------------<br><strong>I consider myself an Expert tomato gardener since all of my friends tell me I have the most colourful and sweetest tomatoes.<br><br>"Life is too short to bother with tasteless tomatoes."<br></strong></div>
