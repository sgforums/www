            <div class='col-md body'>ok forumers... need advice from u guys..<br><br>if u and yr bf have been together for about 2 years and he treats u fine in that 2 years. however, ebery now and then u will dream that u and another girl is sharing him, u get worried and tell him abt the dream but he assured u that nothing of such has happened. But u grew suspicious coz he wouldn't let u visit his family even during chines new year (yr whole family knows abt him) and he gives stupid excuses such as he is not prepared yet..<br><br>Then one day he was posted to work in another country for about 5 weeks, not surprising coz he goes there once in a year, but u pleaded not to go, coz u feel that something will happen when he comes back.. during his absence you felt empty and time and time have the thought of paying him a visit thereand give him a surprise. then on one saturday morning, u suddenly have the urge of checking his email, u know that if he were to find out, that's it.. end of everything.. but heck, u just took the risk and enter his yahoo mail. nothing to be suspicious of coz all junk mails.. On the day of his arrival, u have this very strong sense again.. and this time is even stronger urge.. so u entered again and found out that this girl in that country emailed him and said how much she miss and love him and cried after he left... and he repiled to her saying that he love and miss her too even it is such a short stay...<br><br>the next day, both of u met up and u confronted him.... but u didn't mention any names or email or anything...u just said u feel something and finally he confested to you.. BUT&gt;&gt;&gt;BUT not with that girl... he tells u about this other girl (local) that he has been with for 4/5 years.. which means now u become the 3rd party... how sad... u pleaded him not to leave u and even suggesed to trat nothing has happened... but from the tone and what he said, u feel that he loves the girl more than u and is being protective over her...he evn told u that he told himself that he would't leave that girl.<br><br>the second day u met him agian and he reallt treats nothing has happend.. so happliy u spend the whole day with him although deep down u knew that it's not going to last... u end up having sex with him... and after sex u told him to take back his words yesterday and he said somehting like they are all truth and i can't take back... so u comfronted him about the other girl overseas but he said it's just a fling only and he flared up coz u checked his emails... and today he deleted all his mails.<br><br>What will u do if u were me.. u know that hey u go to wake up yr idea, this guy here is not worth yr love and such... but the thing is i rather die than to leave him... u dun want to act heroine here and "cheng quan" them... but u dun wan him to suffer in such agony also.... how???  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

Before I throw my words, you have to realise one thing, which is years together is not an issue at all. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>From what you had gathered from the beginning till now, he have finally realise that his love is not what it seemed to be - this relation is build upon the foundation of lies, which ultimately will bring the downfall of this relation. How it begins, it shall die (Relation born of lies, will die from lies.) Many a times people doesn't want to let go because they love them, but just think about this question: it is just a massive powerful force of love from you, but a moderated giving on his part? In short, does he really feels the SAME way as you do? You don't want to let go is BECAUSE you can't believe this is happening as it has never occurs to you in such a way and you are taken aback so suddenly that you become defensive and wants to cling on him. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>All I can say is you are very silly to engage sex with him because you can't win him through phyiscal pleasure. IF you want to fight over him with that girl, which is highly stupid, you have to do it the emotional ways + mind games. By giving yourself to him, you have not only lose all your chips on the board but also him eventually, because MOST guys, sad to say, don't really treasure girls who are 'easy' to get. Don't have to play hard to get, but be yourself, mind of your own and rational - In this way, they will respect you for WHO you are, not because of anything else.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Think about this - he has another girl for 4/5 years and why didn't he break with her? This shows one thing: He wants to have the best of both world and obviously his love for you is much lesser than that lady. He retain you BECAUSE you are 'in use' for him, either<br><br>1. Sex<br>2. Companionship, or<br>3. Money<br><br>Look, you have already made ONE wrong move by saying that you treat as nothing happen, when things are actually happening years ago - which means he already knew that you can't leave him. He is standing on the higher advantage ground and whatever he wants, you succumb. ARE YOU GOING LOSE the last thing you could salvage right now: your dignity and principles? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Obviously he is not for serious for relation since he two time and flings at the same time. There is no such thing as CHENG QUAN in your case because you are the victim, so there is no heroine or craps. You are entitle the RIGHT for the kind of guy who will treasure you and treat you genuinely because he loves you, not one of the several flower on the road. You DON'T have to compromise and try to work for a win-win solution because you are at NO FAULT. He kept truth and lied, which means the trust is gone. A relation with no trust is like nokia phone with no SIM card - can't work. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I know things are happening to fast and you are unable to let go, which means you HAVE to do this: Take a break of 2 months or something because I sense you are very hurt by his actions. Short break cannot make you forget or anything, but it allows rational thinking to step in and you could make better decision. If you wants to continue this relation without break, rational thinking and reflection, good luck - because you have CHOOSE to allow him to hurt you once more next time. During that time, you cannot blame anyone except yourself, and I can bet with you, 10 years down the road, you will be wondering why the hell did you fall so head over heels with him. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Prays</div>
