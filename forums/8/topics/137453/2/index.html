But she herself led men on to think she is free and available and almost dated them. She refused to wear her wedding band and I know she is a player and she really talks sweet in front of the men.  Behind the scenes, she laughed at them and tell me her stories of how she "conquered" them. Actually, if you ask me, her character is really flawed and also selfish type but what can I say, she's the one who people likes mah. She can talk also lah and know what to say that people like to hear. Anyways, the men just got played over and over, one after another. So to me, its their own stupidity to get played and become bitter and blame all women.  But luckily there was also an office kaypoh who dragged these stupid morons aside and tell them to cut the crap cause she's already married. Their ego were shattered and some even don't believe.<br><br>BTW, these are real thing I relate to you guys. And I am not kidding. People tell me stuff cause I am not the office snitch but its many years not. So its a story for you people. I am sure she don't change her spots even after all these years. She is who she is and she told me even, she is not sorry for doing what she did. She feel proud to feel attractive and to play with the men's hearts.<br></div>
