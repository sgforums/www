This mean, he is awake and alert. Not putting on a sun glass and skiving. Which mean he is doing his job and the pool is safe.<br><br>2) His approach might be rough, but he did apologize. If he is rude only, he wont even bother to say sorry. My bet is that he get a lot of mischievous kid whom dun know how to swim playing and risking their life in the deeper pool. Hence the mistaking u for one of those. I bet u look very young. Dun think he will talk like that if u look 25yrs+.<br><br>3) Ppl in the service industry have to put up with lot of sh1t daily, so i can only hope that we can at time be a bit more forgiving and be more understanding.<br><br>Just my 2 cent.
