Any other concepts are for the living to create and fantasize.<br><br>If you kill an ant, do you think other ants will care if they will be killed as well? They will continue crawling around and freak others out. If you are dead, whether your work is finished or not doesn't matter. If you have a child, whether he/she can fend for him/herself doesn't matter. You can try to provide as much as possible but it's finite.

            <div class='col-md body'>I often have bad dreams of this particular topic because there is life after death and everyone, even those who live in the primitive world revive from their dead bodies and all members of humanity gather and tested on how they lived their lives. Life has a begining but I heard this secret poem hidden in a music track in the Halo 2 Soundtrack. 'Time has no begining, no end, no purpose'.<br><br>This topic kept me thinking of my crimes, deeds being good or bad and seek for forgiveness for my sins. We better repent before we recieve the harshest punishment we could ever get.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>imo, theres no life after death. the purpose of our existence is merely to populate and crowd the earth and after we breathe our last - that's it - "bye bye". i think of it as much as you do, and it does get frustrating at times. i mean, you get furious when you realize that our existence is that "cheap" and "meaningless". none of us are "special" as to be freed from death.<br><br>but on the other hand, theres still those theories and concepts about "life after death", with the "ghosts", "reincarnation" and so on ... but imo, they are most probably mere fantasies we dream up of to assure and console ourselves. we don't see ghosts of dinosaurs stormin around, do we?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">*not that i don't believe in ghosts though*</span><br><br>anyway, don't think too much. countless, billions of humans like us, have died and ceased to exist. you, or i, or someone else may die in the next second, be it via intentional or unintentional means. but what's the point in looking into the future and worrying about it? you can't prevent it anyway.<br><br>be happy and fulfill yourself now  ^-^<br><br>all the best.</div>
