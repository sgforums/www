              <p>One of my friends took Chef course at Shatec years ago. Many people told him that Chef is useless and you he would not find a job in Singapore. But he was really intereseted in cooking and it was his passion. He worked in a small food outlet though with low singapore salary for a few years but last year he applied for PR in Australia and got it because there was a sudden shortage of Chefs and cooks in Australia since last year. Now he;s earning close to 50k AUD per year in Aus.</p>

              <p>Like SplitSecond said, follow your heart. Don't fellow your friend or worse still come to forum to listen to ppl you never meet, never know personally.<br><br>Ask yourself what your strength vs weakness; like vs dislike. If you don't know where to look for or don't know how to start, draw a line and contrast your attributes like the egs below. The column with more attributes is your positivity.<br><br>weakness    vs     strength                                                         like   vs   dislike<br><br><br><br>Not everything is solely based on academic grade. Some occupations are not academic based. Also, your interest change as you grow older and more mature.<br><br><br><br>  </p>

              <p>anyway seriously there's not much link between O level subjects and Degrees in Accountancy or Business..</p>
              <p>In Accountancy you too have to do mathematics modules such as statistics and so on.</p>
              <p>View the degree as a stepping stone and not like "I do accountancy so i have to go into accountancy field..." As somebody mentioned earlier, if you are the kind who looks at a lot of data and get turn off, then accountancy may not be very suitable for you unless you can overcome that..</p>

              <p>It is O's mah lol. There's also private courses if you don't know and it's recognize..I already confirmed with ITE.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I just don't know which course to take only..I just want to maximize and take advantage on the area that I am good at and hopefully get a good gpa.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks, but I do not have any interests. I actually thought going into the F&amp;B line but after a while, I was thinking perhaps it's not actually what I really want? Just because my father is a former chef and F&amp;B manager, I have to follow suit? Nah.</p>

              <p>I see that u do not have any interests. So u do what u are able to do and is easy for u.</p>
              <p>Sometimes u get remarks such as " So u  do not know what u want in life?" from others. Ignore them. Its beause there are 2 types of people in this world</p>
              <p>"the Specialist" and the " Jack of all trades but master of none"</p>
              <p>U belong to the second category. But it is not a bad trait because u are a broad learner which means u know more things than someone who is a master of one. If i am a employer, IMHO, i will employ you rather than someone who has a PHD in one field because most likely he/she has devoted all his life into one field and has zero or minimal knowledge of others.....</p>
              <p>In a country like Singapore its better to be a broad learner. In countries like Aus , its better to be a specialist.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Case study: In my company, if i have 2 employees:-</p>
              <p><strong>Employee 1</strong>: A driver who is an expert  and delivers his goods with accurate precision but has zero knowledge of other work in the company</p>
              <p><strong>Employee 2</strong>: A milder scaled down version of employee 1 but not as proficient, slower but knows more work relating to the company. he may not be as proficient as employee 1</p>
              <p>I would rather have employee 2 because he/she knows the bigger picture of the business. When employee 1 is not around, i can still use employee 2 to keep the business running though not in top form. But when employee 2 is not around, i cant depend on employee 1.</p>
