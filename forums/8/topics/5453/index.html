            <div class='col-md body'>Sam,<br>I am trying to be objective here and i know all you have been going thru. Actually I admire your perserverance and tolerance for this guy. He is so lucky and he doesn't know it.I mean I am sure he knows you like him..(quite obvious)maybe he is waiting for u to tell him directly, or he is leading u on. i just hope that he will not hurt u in the process.(or I will bash him up.)I would not want to seemy friend hurt for sure. I mean if he does not appreciate u, I bet there are other guys would. Love is not bound by any external factors but internal factors. SO the final decision lies with u.I want u to be happy and loved by the right guy.<br><br>i just hope that i have the courage like u if I met a guy I like.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>You will always be my good friend ever <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Thanks for everything!<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are 2 problems i find in your relationship..<br><br>No.1)<br><br>Hmm seem to be a very one sided affair..you love him for all he is worth but does he feel the same for you?<br><br>No 2.)<br>Education level..i was dating a NUS grad one period of my shit filled life. All was well except her parents keep saying that one day we'll argue abt difference in life and eventually it'll boil down to the point that we'll balme it on the educational difference.<br>Of course being in love and all we brush that comment aside and just kept on going the funny thing is that her parents were right and it (the eductaion diff) was brought up in a arguement and life wasn't as fun as before.<br><br>I don't expect you to listen to my advise. Its because when you are in love you cannot think rationally. I know ! Been there done that. No matter what people tell you will not listen and most likely end up being hurt. So whats the point of telling you this... well the most important is to pick urself up after that and keep on going with life.<br><br>Good luck.<br><br>------------------<br>+++++++++++++++++++++++<br>Guns don't kill People<br>People Kill People<br>+++++++++++++++++++++++<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree with wat tictac-toe say... tell him... since u are much more educated than him, have u ever thought that he might feel inferior to u? he might feel that he does not deserve someone like u because of social differences and though he likes u, he might want you to have a better life with someone more compatible? dat could be one possibility why he hasn't expressed his love for u... so u really have to tell him... and if he does turn out to be a player... i know Rinoa can take him out with well-placed kick to the groin <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>UBA:<br>I'll say upfront that I'll end this message with something along the lines of you have to decide.<br><br>I can totally understand the feeling of not wanting to give up. I have never been in a serious relationship, heck, any relationship, but I went after this caucasian girl (I'm asian). It didn't turn out the way I wanted probably because of that difference, although I never had the courage to ask.<br><br>My point is, no matter what love is supposed to be, some people just can't live with differences, be it race,  education, etc. So, you can wait longer and shower him with your affection and hope for the best. Or, you could comfort yourself that at least you have loved someone, but realize that it might not be worth your while waiting and move on to people who like you in return. Speaking for myself I did the former, but nothing is happening but I'm not willing to forget it.<br><br>Why?! Why is fate so cruel?!<br><br>Hope you do what is good for you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i can understand your situation. My girl will be doing her As next year and I will still probably struggling with my higher dip in some private school!<br><br>I thought of that too but if you can have enough faith and trust in each other to be together, then GO FOR IT! You never know if it will work until you try it out.<br><br>My auntie married a swimming coach whose pay is about 3 times lower than hers(accidentally saw it) though another guy is MADLY chasing her for years, giving her money and BMW! They are still together. Some more my auntie is a divocee with a daughter, and she can't have kids anymore due to some reasons.<br><br>So what do you think? It can still work out. His side are all the national swimmers except him. Probably he will also feel inferior in some ways but still get to marry my auntie.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes Killjoy, you're darn right about the possible problems arising from disparities between education levels. Reality bites. But as an added note, I personally feel that "education levels" itself should not do harm to a relationship, a mature one that is. It is more of the difference in wavelengths and intellectual levels that impede communication and create problems, therefore cause a relationship to break down. In other words, different education levels may not be the prime evil. Poor communication is.</div>
