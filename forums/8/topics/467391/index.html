              </p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is Unlicensed Moneylending?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Moneylending in Singapore</strong></p>
              <p>Under the Moneylenders Act 2010 (Revised Edition), Chapter 188, anyone who wishes to operate a moneylending business is required to apply for a Moneylender’s Licence from the Registrar of Moneylenders. Licensed Moneylenders are required by law to abide to the provisions under the Moneylenders Act and its Rules. For more information on Moneylending in Singapore and how one can apply for a Moneylender’s licence, the public can visit the Insolvency &amp; Public Trustee’s Office (IPTO) website at the following link.</p>
              <p><strong>Verifying whether a moneylender is legal</strong></p>
              <p>To verify whether a moneylender is licensed, the public may access the IPTO website at the following link to check against an updated list of licensed moneylenders maintained by the Registry of Moneylenders.</p>
              <p><strong>What are loansharks?</strong></p>
              <p>Loansharks are unlicensed moneylenders, who illegally give out loans when not licensed to do so by the Registry of Moneylenders. Loansharks often lend money at unfair terms, such as at exorbitant rates of interest as high as 20% and 1018% per annum, frequently to people who are desperate for money and unable to get loans from legitimate sources.</p>
              <p>Because they operate outside the law, loansharks resort to unscrupulous and often violent harassment acts to ensure repayment from their debtors. These include splashing paint on the front doors’ of debtors and innocent bystanders; scrawling graffiti detailing debtors’ personal details on walls; sending “Hell Notes” to frighten debtors; locking the front doors of debtors’ units; damaging cars belonging to debtors and innocent residents; and even setting fire to the front doors’ of debtors.</p>
              <p>Loansharks are also known to outsource their illegal business by employing the vulnerable for their operations. These may include forcing debtors who are unable to repay their loans to conduct acts of harassment on other debtors; offering youths quick cash in return of committing acts of harassment; and offering money to people who open bank accounts to facilitate in their illegal money transfers.</p>
              <p><strong>What constitutes loansharking activities</strong></p>
              <p>Those who may dabble in loansharking activities of any nature are warned, as Police take a serious view on such offences.</p>
              <p>Anyone who contributes or facilitates a loansharking operation will not escape the law. Persons carrying out any of the following acts are deemed to have participated in loansharking activities:</p>
              <p>    Carrying out acts of loanshark harassment (eg. splashing paint, scribbling on walls, setting fire; locking gates; sending hell notes); </p>
              <p>    debt collection; </p>
              <p>    providing funds or allowing premises to be used for loansharking business; </p>
              <p>    providing or selling prepaid SIM cards to loansharks; </p>
              <p>    opening bank accounts to facilitate fund transfers of loansharking syndicates; </p>
              <p>    promoting or advertising loansharking activities; </p>
              <p>    giving instructions to carry out harassment; </p>
              <p>    provide transport for runners; or </p>
              <p>    acting as a lookout or verifying harassment on behalf of the loansharks.</p>
              <p><strong>Punishments</strong></p>
              <p>Assisting loansharks:</p>
              <p>    First-time offenders – fine between $30,000 and $300,000, jail up to four years, liable to six strokes of the cane </p>
              <p>    Repeat offenders – fine between $50,000 and $500,000, jail up to five years, liable to 12 strokes of the cane </p>
              <p>Conducting acts of harassment:</p>
              <p>    First-time offenders – fine between $5,000 and $50,000, jail up to five years, liable to six strokes of the cane </p>

              <p>anyone got duped by those mass send sms loan services?</p>
              <p>i actuallly believed that this company is licensed so i asked for them to let me know the company details (he say email me later, but gave some excuse to drag and did not) , later took up a loan of $1500 with them and agreed interest at $400, total repayment is $1900 split into 5 installments. This guy by name of Alan, transferred me on sunday, but i been calling him to ask for the email details, 3 days later i feel uncomfortable about this whole thing , so i called again to say i want to clear everything and he said to transfer him the $1900 in  30mins, which i managed to do so, and he's attitude changed, became like a typical loan shark, he called to say he recieved but now he is not happy and wanted me to resume the 5 installments again on this sunday., or else i wait for him to come harass my home. and told me to go to the police because he is not scared.</p>
              <p>straight after this, i lodged a police report and provided the police his details. </p>
              <p>hoping that i dun get any harassment this sunday.</p>
              <p>anyone is in the same situation?</p>

              <p>yea, the police asked me to inform them if this sunday they sms to say they coming and extort payment, and the police will have plain clothes to ambush.</p>
              <p>actually, im just thinking, will they really come? or is to scare me only, by saying that, because the total amount and interest is already paid up..</p>
