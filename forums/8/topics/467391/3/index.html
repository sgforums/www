              </span></p><p>The police issued an advisory on Thursday morning, advising the public to be vigilant about loanshark harassment scams.</p>
              <p>Police have in the last month received several reports of harassment 
              involving SMS messages that were purportedly sent by loansharks. In such
               cases, the victims would receive SMS messages from unknown mobile phone
               numbers threatening to harass their homes unless they pay up their 
              loans.</p>
              <p>When the victims called the phone numbers, the culprit would tell 
              them that their "particulars" had been used to borrow money from 
              loansharks. These loansharks demand payment and threaten to harass the 
              victims' families by locking them up, splashing paint or setting fire to
               their homes if payment is not received.</p>
              <p>A few victims would then transfer the money to bank account numbers 
              given by the culprit out of fear for their safety. The public are 
              advised to not reveal their personal particulars to unknown individuals 
              and to keep their SingPass login details confidential. They are also 
              advised not to give in to unknown and unsolicited demands for loan 
              repayments and not to contact the senders of these SMS messages. If they
               receive such a call or SMS, they should also make a police report via 
              the Singapore Police Force website or at their neighbourhood police 
              centre.</p>

              <p>More than 180 cases of intentional 
              harassment made via SMSes purportedly sent by loansharks have been 
              reported to the Police since early March 2013.</p>
              <p>Police said at
               least 10 victims have fallen prey to the scam, and that at least 
              $18,000 was transferred from the victims to the perpetrators.</p>
              <p>They
               said the victims received SMSes from unknown mobile phone numbers. The 
              SMS sender would threaten to come to the victims' homes unless they 
              repay their loans.</p>
              <p>When the victims called the phone numbers,
               they would be told by the culprits that their particulars had been used
               to borrow money from loansharks.</p>
              <p>The culprits would also 
              demand payment from the victims and threaten to harass their families by
               locking, splashing paint or setting fire to their units if they did not
               pay up.</p>
              <p>Police said the victims in most of the cases had no dealings with loansharks.</p>
              <p>But some of the victims fearing for their safety had transferred money to bank account numbers given by the culprits.</p>
              <p>Police
               are advising the public to be wary of such scams and take preventive 
              measures. These include not revealing one's personal particulars such as
               name, NRIC number, residential address, SingPass log-in details to 
              unknown individuals.</p>
              <p>Members of the public should also not 
              contact the sender of the SMSes and not give in to unknown and 
              unsolicited demands for loan repayments. They should contact the Police 
              if they receive any call or SMS of such nature.</p>

              <p style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Healthcare Financing Philosophy<br> </strong>Singapore offers universal healthcare coverage to our 
              citizens, with a financing system anchored on the twin philosophies of 
              individual responsibility and affordable healthcare for all. Through a 
              mixed financing system, use of market-based mechanisms to promote 
              competition and transparency and the adoption of technology to improve 
              the delivery of healthcare services, we have secured good healthcare 
              outcomes for our population. We have done so with a national healthcare 
              expenditure of about 4% of our GDP, which is low among developed 
              countries (although this is expected to grow with an ageing population).</p>
              <p style="font-size: 12px;">These features of the Singapore system have 
              been recognised in various international assessments.  We intend to 
              continually evolve and improve our policies over time.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Universal coverage, multiple layers of protection<br> </strong>We have evolved a mixed financing system, with multiple tiers 
              of protection to ensure that no Singaporean is denied access to basic 
              healthcare because of affordability issues.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12px;">The first tier of protection is 
              provided by heavy Government subsidies of up to 80% of the total bill in
               acute public hospital wards, which all Singaporeans can access. The 
              second tier of protection is provided by </span><a style="font-size: 12px;" href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/home/costs_and_financing/schemes_subsidies/medisave.html">Medisave</a><span style="font-size: 12px;">,
               a compulsory individual medical savings account scheme which allows 
              practically all Singaporeans to pay for their share of medical treatment
               without financial difficulty. Working Singaporeans and their employers 
              contribute a part of the monthly wages into the account to save up for 
              their future medical needs and this is portable across jobs and after 
              retirement. As at </span>31 Dec 2010<span style="font-size: 12px;">, the average Medisave balance is <a name="1"></a>S$16,900</span><sup>1</sup><span style="font-size: 12px;">. This is sufficient to pay for about 9 to 10 subsidised acute hospitalisation episodes. </span>Click here<span style="font-size: 12px;"> for more information on bill sizes for patients in public hospitals)</span></p>
              <p style="font-size: 12px;">The third level of protection is provided by <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/home/costs_and_financing/schemes_subsidies/Medishield.html">MediShield</a>,
               a low cost catastrophic medical insurance scheme. This allows 
              Singaporeans to effectively risk-pool the financial risks of major 
              illnesses. Individual responsibility for one’s healthcare needs is 
              promoted through the features of deductibles and co-payment in 
              MediShield. <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/home/costs_and_financing/schemes_subsidies/ElderShield.html">ElderShield</a>,
               a severe disability insurance, is also available for subscription by 
              Singaporeans to risk-pool against the financial risks of suffering a 
              severe disability. Many middle and higher income Singaporeans have also 
              supplemented their basic coverage with integrated private insurance 
              policies (“<a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/home/costs_and_financing/schemes_subsidies/Medishield/Medisave-approved_Insurance.html">Integrated Shield plans</a>”)
               for treatment in the private sector.  Singaporeans must subscribe to 
              the basic MediShield product before they can purchase the add-on private
               Integrated Shield Plans. This industry structure preserves the national
               risk pool and guards against ‘cherry picking’ of healthy lives by 
              private insurers. Similarly, “<a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/home/costs_and_financing/schemes_subsidies/ElderShield/ElderShield_Supplements.html">ElderShield Supplements</a>” allow policyholders to enhance the disability benefits coverage offered by the basic ElderShield product.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 12px;">Finally, <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/home/costs_and_financing/schemes_subsidies/Medifund.html">Medifund</a> is
               a medical endowment fund set up by the Government to act as the 
              ultimate safety net for needy Singaporean patients who cannot afford to 
              pay their medical bills despite heavy subsidies, Medisave and 
              MediShield.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Organisation of service delivery<br> </strong>Singapore today has a mixed delivery model. The public sector 
              dominates the acute care sector, delivering 80% of the care in this 
              sector. The primary care sector is dominated by private sector 
              providers, which account for about 80% of the market. In the step-down 
              care sector (e.g. nursing homes, community hospitals and hospices), 
              service provision is mainly provided by voluntary welfare organisations,
               most of which are funded by the Government for their services rendered 
              to patients.</p>

              <p style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Promoting competition and transparency<br> </strong>In 2004, the Ministry of Health began to publish <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/home/costs_and_financing/HospitalBillSize.html">hospital bill sizes</a> to
               show the variation in costs among our hospitals, with a view to push 
              our hospitals on this effort to “do more with less”.  There have been 
              some successes since then in spurring improvements, e.g. LASIK prices 
              dropped by more than S$1,000 per eye and the competitive price wars 
              continue to this day, at great benefit to consumers. The Ministry has 
              also progressively published health outcomes on the website to encourage
               further improvements and help patients make more informed choices.</p>

              </span></p><p>Notorious loan shark Ah Long San's driver was sworn to secrecy.</p>
              <p>But the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) needed Ah Gee's help to track down the wanted criminal.</p>
              <p>Several investigators had tried to speak to the chauffeur, but he refused to reveal any information about his employer.</p>
              <p>In the end, a resourceful CPIB officer, Deputy Director Teng Khee Fatt, spoke to Ah Gee and gained his trust.</p>
              <p>Moved after being called a "good man" by the officer, Ah Gee finally gave the CPIB details that helped force Ah Long San's hand.</p>
              <p>The case involving Ah Long San is one of 18 cases highlighted in 
              CPIB's coffee table book titled The Journey - 60 Years of Fighting 
              Corruption in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The 120-page publication was launched on tuesday on the bureau's 60th anniversary commemorative ceremony.</p>
              <p>Besides the Ah Long San case, other high-profile cases involving 
              offenders from all walks of life are also included, such as former 
              ministers, policemen, football players and senior executives of 
              companies.</p>
              <p><strong>Feared criminal </strong></p>
              <p>Ah Long San was an infamous moneylender and criminal in the 1990s.</p>
              <p>He owned a number of legitimate businesses like karaoke pubs, but he was also involved in illegal moneylending.</p>
              <p>Despite being a feared criminal, he was not caught for a long time.</p>
              <p>That was because those who had information about him preferred to 
              keep mum, fearing for their safety and the safety of their loved ones.</p>
              <p>And Ah Long San had moles within the police force who tipped him off to raids.</p>
              <p>In all, he managed to bribe nine crooked cops, all of whom ended up behind bars.</p>
              <p>The highest ranking was a former assistant superintendent of police, 
              who was 29 years old when he was jailed 18 months on Jan 11, 2000.</p>
              <p>The former cop, who used to work as an air steward, first met the loan shark at a 24-hour Geylang food stall in 1994.</p>
              <p>Ah Long San later became aware of the younger man's desire to join the police force and encouraged him to do so.</p>
              <p>He also sponsored the ex-policeman's education in law.</p>
              <p>Before he joined the police force in October 1997, the former cop had accepted various sums of money from Ah Long San.</p>
              <p>This included a S$20,000 advance in 1995 to complete his law studies 
              in Britain after he failed his second-year external law examination 
              here.</p>
              <p>The younger man remained in close contact with the loan shark through the years.</p>
              <p>It was the former cop who introduced his other colleagues to Ah Long San.</p>
              <p>The ex-policeman was convicted on four corruption charges - for 
              receiving three bribes of S$1,000 each and one of S$5,000 between 
              November 1997 and January 1999.</p>
              <p>He took the money and used his office and contacts to influence the outcome of investigations.</p>
              <p>And when the loan shark's brother was arrested, Ah Long San used his 
              moles in the police force to check on the status of the case.</p>
              <p>The crooked cops were also told to treat Ah Long San's sibling nicely.</p>
              <p>Ah Long San was later convicted and sentenced to 18 months' jail for bribing a then-police officer.</p>
              <p>Knowing that he could be serving more jail time, he went into hiding 
              after failing to appear in court when the appeal against his 18-month 
              sentence was heard.</p>
              <p>But The New Paper managed to score an exclusive interview with him in June 2001 while he was on the run.</p>
              <p>Speaking to TNP then, he said: "My jail term is 18 months. But I 
              still have several cases pending.... I will be in jail for a long time."</p>
              <p>But he was arrested on July 9, 2001, after he surrendered to the authorities.</p>
              <p>He was jailed for 10 years on Oct 4, 2001, when he was 45.</p>
              <p>It was then the heaviest sentence meted out by the courts for graft.</p>

              </span></p><p><strong><span>By Tan Kee Yun</span></strong></p>
              <p>THEY wear designer clothes, Rolex watches, drive around town in their flashy cars and splurge on nightclubs and lounges.</p>
              <p>Welcome to the world of the 'Ah Long Lieutenants', the 'inner circle' of the loan-shark leaders in Singapore.</p>
              <p>"If you look at the loan-shark organisation in terms of five levels, 
              they are probably at the third or fourth level," said 66-year-old Lionel
               de Souza, an ex-police officer, in an interview with The New Paper on 
              Sunday.</p>
              <p>Mr De Souza, who has more than 25 years' experience in the police 
              force, is the managing director of LJ Investigation &amp; Consultancy 
              Services.</p>
              <p>While the ages of these 'Ah Long Lieutenants' span a wide range, from
               their late 20s to 50s, they often share the same demographics.</p>
              <p>Lowly educated ('many left school at Primary Six or Secondary Two') 
              and with a long criminal history, they usually build up criminal 
              affiliations during their time in jail.</p>
              <p>Mr De Souza said that because of their connections, they become the 
              'big fish' of the Ah Long leaders after they are released from jail.</p>
              <p>Money comes easily to them, as they take a large slice of commission off the earnings of their bosses.</p>
              <p>A good example would be the assistants of brothers Chua Tiong Tiong, 
              now 52, better known as Ah Long San, and loan-shark king Chua Tiong 
              Chye, 44, who headed a multi-million illegal moneylending syndicate 
              before they were busted in 1998.</p>
              <p>The younger Chua, notoriously known as Lau Ter Kor, which means old 
              maniac in Hokkien, reportedly took in $300,000 a month at the peak of 
              his loan-sharking business and was often seen zipping around in his 
              swanky Lexus.<br> <strong>The loan-shark hierarchy</strong></p>
              <p>He worked on a 'profit-sharing scheme' with his lackeys, police told 
              The New Paper then. He gave $50,000 to each of his senior assistants and
               it was their responsibility to loan and collect the money.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, it was an incentive plan for the assistants. Out of the 
              $50,000 given to them, if they made back the same amount, Lau Ter Kor 
              would let them keep half the amount.</p>
              <p>In reality, these loan sharks are taking a loan from the 'kings' but pay less than the usual 20 per cent interest.</p>
              <p>So when they loan money out themselves and the debtors are slow in 
              repaying, the pressure is also on the assistant to squeeze the debtor. 
              Otherwise the 'kings' will be hounding the assistants themselves.</p>
              <p>According to Mr De Souza, in recent years, some of these 'Ah Long 
              Lieutenants' have become more ingenious with their moneylending tactics.</p>
              <p>For one, they only use prepaid mobile numbers registered by their 
              debtors, many of whom are forced to become runners when they cannot 
              repay their debts. So when police arrest a debtor-turn-runner and trace 
              the mobile number, they end up with another debtor.</p>
              <p>Another trick up their sleeve is to use debtors to open bank accounts
               but to hand the ATM card and the access number to the loan shark.</p>
              <p>Debtors credit money into their own account and the loan sharks make an ATM withdrawal, again covering their tracks.</p>
              <p>Mr De Souza added: "There is a group of them who will even get their 
              debtors to gamble on ships. They'll tell their debtors, oh you don't 
              have money to return us, never mind, we'll take you to gamble on 
              international waters.</p>
              <p>Those in debt will end up in greater debt, added MrDe Souza.</p>
              <p>Loan sharks typically give loans with a flat interest rate of 20 per 
              cent. For a $1,000 loan, the borrower only receives $800 because $200 is
               immediately kept by the moneylender as interest.</p>
              <p>If $600 is repaid the next week, it is still short of the $1,000 and 
              the moneylender will only count it as $400 having been repaid, taking 
              another $200 as further interest. That's how some borrowers end up 
              paying 100 per cent interest.</p>
              <p><strong>Fearful of big bosses</strong></p>
              <p>For all the bravado and arrogance they display, these sidekicks of the Ah Longs are extremely fearful of their big bosses.</p>
              <p>And it often shows upon their arrest, said MrDeSouza.</p>
              <p>While the runners are nabbed and jailed for offences ranging from 
              vandalism to illegal moneylending, the lieutenants face the tougher 
              penalties.</p>
              <p>These men are detained under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act, also known as detention without trial.</p>
              <p>The Act is applicable only when a serious crime has been committed 
              and prosecution is not possible because witnesses are not willing or 
              afraid to testify in court.</p>
              <p>Only a minister can sign the detention order, which is valid for two years and renewable.</p>
              <p>"As the saying goes, when you throw a stone, you hide the hand," said Mr De Souza.</p>
              <p>"The sidekicks know the Ah Long leaders wield a lot of power and they
               do not want to divulge the identity (of their bosses), for fear of 
              reprisals.</p>
              <p>"So, they are willing to sacrifice themselves instead."</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Community Involvement - What You Can Do To Fight Loansharking Activities<br><br><br><br><br>Community involvement<br>An important part of Police’s strategy in the fight against loansharks is the involvement of the community. Police officers cannot be omnipresent; however, residents and those working in the housing estates are constantly present and can effectively help the Police as well as the community.<br><br>How you can play a part<br>Stay vigilant, report loansharking activities<br>The public can help the Police with their vigilance and immediate reporting of suspicious persons and loanshark harassment activities in their neighbourhoods. Police seek the public’s assistance to provide detailed descriptions of such persons and to work with the Police to solve the case. The public should however avoid doing anything which would put them in harm’s way.<br><br>To provide Police information on loansharking activities, members of the public can call the Police Hotline at 1800-255-0000 or to dial ‘999’ if urgent assistance is required.<br><br>Alternatively, persons who may not want to approach the Police directly may call the National Crime Prevention Council’s (NCPC) ‘X Ah Long’ Hotline at 1800-924-5664 (1800-X-AH-LONG) (9am to 5pm from Mondays to Friday) to provide the information which will be channelled to Police to assist us with our investigations. All information will be kept strictly confidential.<br><br>Victims of loansharking activities<br>Victims of loanshark harassment are advised to lodge a Police report at the nearest Neighbourhood Police Centre or to dial ‘999’ if urgent assistance is required. Police will investigate into all reports of loanshark harassment. They can also consider installing CCTVs at their residence to deter harassment and to provide Police with footage capture to assist with our investigations.<br><br>Get into the act of keeping your neighbourhood free from loansharking activities<br>Citizens on Patrol (COP)<br>COP groups have been established in many communities and neighbourhoods in Singapore, and is one of the initiatives under the Community Safety and Security Programme (CSSP). COP groups are trained by Police on safety, observation skills and crime prevention measures. COP help augment police patrols by being the 'eyes and ears' for the Police during their patrols. COP will alert the Police when they see suspicious activities or persons loitering within their neighbourhood, thus helping to detect and prevent crime and security threats. Volunteers under the COP scheme would be encouraged to pay attention to HDB void decks and other HDB common areas in their routine patrols. During COP patrols, should they notice any crime in progress or any persons behaving suspiciously, the volunteers would call for the Police.<br><br>Neighbourhood Watch Groups (NWGs)<br>Residents have taken the initiative to assist Police in the forming of Neighbourhood Watch Groups (NWGs) at affected locations. Neighbours living beside, below and above affected units are engaged to form NWGs, informing the Police at the onset of any suspicious activity. This is critical in the early detection and intervention before the harassment can cause any injury to persons or damage to property.<br><br>How to join<br>If you are keen to play a part in making your estate a safer place to live in, you can participate in the NWG or the COP initiatives. Please contact your Neighbourhood Police Centre to find out more on these initiatives as well as on how you can join.<br><br>Engaging the Community<br>Educational posters on the consequences of loanshark harassment or borrowing from loansharks have been displayed at locations such as the notice boards of HDB lift lobbies, and advisories against loanshark harassment are also distributed to residents to create awareness amongst the public. Officers from Neighbourhood Police Centres (NPCs) have also gone house-to-house to engage residents and to give them advisories by hand to encourage them to do their part against this scourge. Police have garnered the support from the grassroots and community and embarked on various CSSP Projects to combat the UML situation. The essence of these initiatives involves engaging the community to be the extra eyes and ears of the Police, reporting cases immediately when any suspicious activity is sighted within their neighbourhood. The involvement from the residents and constant vigilance to look out for suspicious persons/activities would ensure that their neighbourhood remains safe and secure. Grassroots organisations, schools, and town councils other agencies are also encouraged to engage the community to educate them on the consequences of borrowing from loansharks as well as in the dissemination of crime prevention materials. If required, the materials can be obtained from the Resources section in this website.<br><br>Parents too, have a part to play<br>A worrying trend observed is the increase in the number of youths (seven to 19 years) caught for their involvement in loansharking and harassment activities. In the first half of 2011, 98 youths, about half of whom were students, were arrested for loansharking activities as compared to the 78 youths arrested in the first half of 2010. Amongst those arrested, investigations revealed that most were recruited by the loansharks to conduct acts of harassment, while others had assisted the loansharking syndicates by providing bank accounts for their illegal operations. Some of them were also involved in the distribution of namecards, pamphlets and flyers advertising ‘easy-loans’ for illegal moneylenders.<br><br>Youths are easy prey for loansharks who dangle easy money as an incentive and provide false assurance that if caught, they would only be punished with probation. This is a myth, as youths may be sentenced to Reformative Training Centre, even for their first offence. Also, Under the Moneylenders Act 2010 (Revised Edition), it is also now an offence for persons who cause or procure persons under 16 to engage in such acts of harassment. This is punishable with imprisoned up to seven years, a maximum fine of $300,000, and a maximum of 12 strokes of the cane.<br><br>Police seek the public’s continued cooperation in our fight to stamp out the scourge of loansharks from our community. Parents should also be mindful of their children’s activities and to educate them so that the youths do not fall prey to these unscrupulous criminals. They can do so by reminding their loved ones about the severity of loansharking-related offences and intervene promptly should they display tell-tale signs of being under the influence of bad company.</p></div>

              reported. While the number of cases have fallen, continual community 
              partnership coupled with Police’s resolute crackdown on all levels of 
              the loansharking syndicates and on all persons involved in loansharking 
              activities of any nature have resulted in a 31% increase in arrests -

              persons have been arrested for loanshark harassment in 2011. This is an

              and harassment has been on an increase over the last three years. This 
              is testament to Police’s relentless commitment in tackling the 
              loansharking situation until the menace is eradicated. </span></p>
              <p class="miccontenttext">Police take a 
              serious view of loansharking and related harassment cases and will

              of enhancing legislation, strengthening enforcement and collaborating 
              with strategic partners. The amended Moneylenders Act came into effect 
              on 11 February 2010 allowing us to deal with loansharking syndicates as 
              such criminal organisations, so as to target financiers and masterminds,
               disrupt flow of money and resources and ensure that leaders do not

              <p><strong>Meet-the-People Sessions (MPS)</strong> is the name of a
              feedback/redress system developed in Singapore for citizens to meet
              their member of parliament. The MPS are usually held once a week.
              Many citizens see the MPS as an opportunity to resolve problems
              that they are having with the bureaucracy.The MP will write a
              petition letter to the relevant ministry, statutory board or any
              concerned parties to appeal on behalf of the resident. The letters
              are accorded a higher priority by the Civil Service as they come
              from elected representatives.<br> <br> Cases deal with a wide range of problems. These include, but are
              not limited to, family financial problems (e.g. health-cost issues,
              jobs, financial assistance), CPF matters, various licenses, HDB
              related problems (e.g. subsidized rental housing, obtaining a
              subsidized HDB flat), immigration issues, and appeals for school
              admissions and school fee subsidy.<br> <br> Most sessions last past midnight to help residents effectively due
              to waiting time.</p>

              <p>The process of meeting the MP or Ministers varies from
              constituency to constituency, but they follow a general
              pattern:</p>
              <p>1) Registration and take queue number</p>
              <p>2) Constituent meets the petition writer who pens the letter
              (either hand-written or via PC) on behalf of the MP</p>
              <p>3) Wait and queue to meet the MP</p>
              <p>4) Meet the MP in a separate room, constituent informs the MP of
              his/her problems one-to-one.</p>
              <p>5) MP assures the constituent that they will look into the case
              and send the letter. For urgent cases, the letter will be typed
              out, sign by the MP and hands it to the constituent immediately.
              For normal cases, the letter will be vetted through by the MP’s or
              Minister’s Personal Secretary and sent out within three working
              days.</p>
