Her background was selling hamburgers and french fries.<br><br>In last than 1 year, the Singapore Zoo paid her $180,000 to do an Executive MBA with University of Chicago.  Then the zoo also bought her a car.<br><br>Recently, because she was a divorcee, she couldn't live with her husband's house, the zoo built a bunglow behind Night Safari for her, her son and a maid to live.<br><br>Not bad huh?  The Zoo is the probably the best place to work.<br>Where does the moneycome from?<br>But where does the animal adoption money, direct donation and animal conservation fund go to?<br><br>How much money make/raise actually go to the well keeping of the animals?<br>I wonder. </div></blockquote>Sound like a repeat of the NKF saga - the Singapore Zoo style ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I personally dun like fanny lai's style of management, give me harrison any day, but i kinda feel that its not really her fault that the zoo has turned into a flashy mall of sorts.<br><br>Blame the gahmen for pulling the plug on funding. Last time the zoo received substantial gahmen grants, but not any more, so the zoo has to find ways to make its own money. F&amp;B is the least controversial way for the zoo to earn revenue.<br><br>I agree the drink prices there are murderous, so its best to pack yur own drinks when you visit. As for admission fees, you really have to take a look at zoos overseas for a quick comparison. Believe it or not even night safari admission is cheap compared to say Crocodile hunter's zoo in australia.<br><br>And for $15 zoo admission, you are getting serious value for money. $15 lets you spend up to 9.5 hours at the place. All the shows are free. I dun see anyone complaining when paying $9 for a 1.5 hour movie.</div>
