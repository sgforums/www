Without hesitation, a big no and she turn away...  I only get the discount after, like any other Singaporean, complained !   But I must say the overall service there is good la ... then hor, it really hurt the pocket man...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, it murders your wallet like no tomorrow.<br><br>But, if you save up and go there with the sole intention of having a good time and don't think about the money so much, then I can say you will have a pretty cool experience.<br><br>I went there with my girlfriend recently. It wasn't bad. Bring a bottle of water and stroll around. Catch the tribal dance! It was better than most of the animal exhibits. The shows at the amphitheatre are half-decent.<br><br>Going to the Night Safari or the Zoo is a once in a few years kinda thing, sheerly because of the financial cost and if you go more than once a year, the novelty will wear out alot faster.</div>

I knew it is going to be expensive but never expect it to be that expensive ...  Anyway, the last time I was there, there was a Burger King there...  but no more .. instead got this Bongo thingy selling burger, well it cost me some $30 for two burgers and a drink...  and the tatse was horrible ...<br><br>On the whole it was a nice experience ...  my son enjoy it and I had my excerise too ... it was fun ...  but pocket still hurt sia ... So pretent that we went to restuarant for dinner ...<br><br>I was thinking, if the whole Safari thingy price itself out of reach of normal Singaporean's pocket, will it not be a shame that only tourist got to enjoy it ???</div>
