ISO 1600 is the most ideal now(if i'm not wrong) for prices below sgd500-600. Of course you have to sacrifice it for the increasing noise lvl. However, with naked eyes and after resized to smaller resolution.. this is not a problem.<br><br>finepix is also can also use up to 1600iso. i think it's cheaper than your casio 600 right? the casio i had previously about 5-6 months back is 5 series one i think but sold it away after comparing with the finepix v10 cos it has lower iso. Maybe the one you have now is also good since it comes with 1600<br><br>dslr can go 2000 and more<br><br>i can't say v10 is one of the best for day shots la...but night shots is very good for the price you pay for. day shots are like any ordinary good camera.<br></div>
