However if anyone had work up to this century, and expect a woman to continue playing housewife while working full time  to contribute equal share to the household. Then these guys deserve to have their gene pool end there and then. So guys gripe about everything they find unsatisfied with women, from spening $ which we earn, to cooking, housekeeping to even s3x. There is nothing under the sun the men are ever grateful for towards the women. Then I say that these men should denounce their mothers and stop finding gf/wives and spare us the endless, baseless mindless complains. On the contrary, the women had not complained why men are so insensitive, so moronic, so stupid, so unhelpful, so stingy, and blah blah blah. Until men become perfect people for which we women can model after, then that is the day where the men can tell the women what they should do. Until then, every piece of sour grape female bashing will never be credible and just some loser making a big fuss over nothing. But I also know this : guo jiu le zhang bu chu xiang ya </div></blockquote>Ha we men are so stupid?Whatever you gals say.We still rule the whole,like it or not...<br><br>If you think women have not complained,u should go to the "Aunty Agony"columns of all the female magazines etc you will see women bitching about men.You ladies talk as if you don't complain.You women are always whinning and grumbling,that one you want,this one you want,blah blah...you laides should sit down and examine your attitude towards men.I am saying this in general.Many women are good but there are too many who are not.<br><br>Like it or leave it women are more ungrateful these days."So stingy" you think we are atm??we wish we can buy castles for you,but frankly a lot of you are not worth it.Better to save it in the banks....at least they appreciate over time.<br><br>You are just the opposite....<br><br>By the way 3/4 of Singapore educated women can't cook for shit...how "to be unsatisfied" according to you, when there isn't anything to be satisfied about....<br><br>PS By the way,I don't expect my wife to work and be a housewife at the same time bec I can fucking afford it.I am rich.<br><br>Suckers!!!<br><br>Hahahaa!!!</div>

Also, if they don't like it, they can return it and that's the end of that.  Whiners like you are the sort to keep calling and asking, "Why don't you like me anymore?".

The posters who know me will know what a fool you've just made of yourself.  Hell, the last guy I had an argument with on the forum even looked up and confirmed the fact of my doctorate to everyone, little man.  Unless you can prove that you've got at least an associate professorship, don't even think about sizing up. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>If you're thinking that money and education are all that you've got to bring to the table, you're the one who's dumb.

You said you are rich...my question is how you use the money you own? Did you do anything worthwhile with your 'richness', or do you juz throw money to women in hope for a perfect wife?<br><br>Sometimes, the harder you look for something, the harder it will come......Love...Money....Career....However, through my knowledge, if you want love, give love, if you want money, give money...if you want a great career, give up your current career for a beter one...<br><br>Lastly, girls looks for charater b4 money...you might say they are looking for wealthy guys to marry....trust me...in the long run, they still need love. They still need someone to look up to and want that someone not looking down on them.  (obviously you need to change this part)</div>
