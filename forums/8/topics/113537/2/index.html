            <div class='col-md body'>Its just your personal view that all women should be like our mothers and continue to mother the guys. However if anyone had work up to this century, and expect a woman to continue playing housewife while working full time  to contribute equal share to the household. Then these guys deserve to have their gene pool end there and then. So guys gripe about everything they find unsatisfied with women, from spening $ which we earn, to cooking, housekeeping to even s3x. There is nothing under the sun the men are ever grateful for towards the women. Then I say that these men should denounce their mothers and stop finding gf/wives and spare us the endless, baseless mindless complains. On the contrary, the women had not complained why men are so insensitive, so moronic, so stupid, so unhelpful, so stingy, and blah blah blah. Until men become perfect people for which we women can model after, then that is the day where the men can tell the women what they should do. Until then, every piece of sour grape female bashing will never be credible and just some loser making a big fuss over nothing. But I also know this : guo jiu le zhang bu chu xiang ya</div>

Then its their choice.  Not all women want an equal. If men want a partner. then its also their choice. There are women who are willing to be a partner. Anyways, most men are disappointing.<br></div>
