            <div class='col-md body'>lovetonight, what makes you think all women are alike? Women spend $$ becoz they are more emotional than guys(thats the reason why retail outlets mostly target women)...And guys who gave $$ for them to spend are juz showing their ego...So who is worse? the one who is too emotional or the want who is too egoist? I did rather have my women more emotional than egoist.<br><br>From the post above, you filled it with ego and fear...What you said either online or offline say alot about your education level...and the way you think...If i am not wrong, you have been cheated more than once...true? You said men need to make women submidsive, fear us, respect us...I say in a relationship we need communication, communication, communication....<br><br>Lastly...you have a negative view on women...here is what i can offer you...CHANGE YOURSELF....only that can you change your view of women....Often times, ppl dont realize they juz need to change themselves in order to change others...Save yourself 1st  b4 you save the world.....</div>

Have you seen what happens after you have a baby? Kids are not everything - it's a lifestyle choice - get over it. Then again the reader could have a lousy son that's why he thinks kids are parasites. - he has his right to his opinion.<br><br>We all started as replicating cells - like cancer cells - except most of us turn out to be human beings ( and a few still remain a cancer on parental wallets).Have you ever heard of a hydatid mole? Choriocarcinoma - fun eh? That started when an egg was fertilized but somehow cells forgot to switch off.<br><br>Addendum:  I am not having a son so that Singapore  can take away for national service stuck with  the risk of him getting drowned because of some morons .<br><br>Some families have 2 working parents. Who are you to judge them on their lifestyle choice ? Sometimes people have no choice but to go out and work in order for their children to have a better future. Singapore is not a cheap place to live in - the pay is not that crash hot either. May I note that there is a minimal welfare system in singapore , so don't condemn working parents who have no choice but to leave their kids to nannies. Sometimes those nannies are grandparents who are bonding with the kids - it may be positive. Maids - I am not so sure.</div>

Right now , you exposed your weakness - your self esteem. Yes , some women have worked hard for a good education in order to make the money. They do get ahead in their careers . You probably had a female boss talking down to you . Get over it and move on.  Your statements stink of self loathing and self pity.<br><br><blockquote> <strong><br><br>My personal experiences tell me that women can talk so good about themselves but once they get F-U-C-K-E-D,their yours.<br><br>The key is the pussy...make sure you pump them nicely,they will be begging for more,educated or not...Start young....look for virgins if possible.<br><br>It's a physcological thing man...once they lose it they want it more.That's why guys you should build up your sex skills,go out and meet as many women as possible(with protection).Women want sexual confidence...In or out of bed...<br><br>Once you make them beg for more,,they will want you naturally,you don't need to be a handsome guy...<br><br>Am going out with a good looking chick with nice tits....was a b-i-t-c-h when I met her...when I f-u-c-k-e-d her up nicely and broke her hymen,her attitude completely changed...<br><br>She became submissive...and my slut too... </strong></blockquote>In  BDSM , the submissive is the controlling partner .<br><br><blockquote>[/b]<br><br>Always gain the upper hand in a relationship.Assert your authority.Many singapore men are sissy(no offence),they let women do everything,I have seen my neighbour give his wife the whole month's salary..Basically she is the general..THAT IS A NO NO.GUYS you are the commander in chief...always remember that.<br><br>Of course not to the point of abusing her physically or sexually.<br><br>You must be the man about the house...know everything,from sewing to housework and cooking,make her feel like she does not know anything,then she will slowly wake up and do as she is told.<br><br>We cannot depend on women to do all our stuff.We have to be independent.<br><br>Once they get too much say..thst's it,they will climb over your head...<br><br>MAKE HER WANT YOU INDEFINITELY....MAKE HER FEAR YOU BUT ALSO RESPECT YOU.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">LOVE AND FEAR ARE THE MOST POTENT WEAPONS IN A RELATIONSHIP.</span> [/b]</blockquote>That's why I like people to fear me , not love me.

Marriages break apart because people , like you, are around , filled with self loathing and jealousy.  People who cannot take partnership.  How would you know how people think? Are you psychic?</div>
