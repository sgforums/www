            <div class='col-md body'>I have to agree that the first question you should ask yourself is 'Do you love her' and pls dun say 'Mai Hiam Buay Pai'.<br><br>What if you just talk to her? I mean its the easiest way instead of trying to second guess her.<br>Talk about what she want out of a relationship, about what kinda BF she wants at this point of time...then postulate with the guys around her that you and she knows.<br>I.e.) Wah if you want XX kind of Bf, then what abt YY? (insert name of a guy whom you both know)<br><br>Just my Â£0.02 worth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well....I feel that you should not assume anything....(ASSUME - ASS TO U AND ME). Have a heart-to-heart talk with her (should be ok since you're quite close to her rite?)<br><br>I agree entirely with Fey. The most impt thing is to know exactly what you want in your relationship with her, platonic or romantic or fringe, and where do the 2 of you stand.<br><br>Likewise, hopefully, her feelings on the matter.<br><br>Don't ruin a wonderful friendship by doing the wrong thing. It's not worth it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i have to admit it is rather difficult to assess whether she likes u.. some time when a girl is good to a guy, she may be just treating u as a very close friend, hence u can be confused at times. however, she may feel the same like u. she may think u're treating her as a close friend too.<br>hence, to have a clearer picture, i'm afraid u must tell her.. probably that's what she is waiting for</div>
