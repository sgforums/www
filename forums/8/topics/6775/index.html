            <div class='col-md body'>Happens to come across a rather interesting yet questionable article in the New Paper just now...<br><br>Heres the story goes...<br>*********************************************<br>A WOMAN he met on an Internet chatroom had one British man completely hoodwinked.<br><br>So much so that he was prepared to leave everything - his wife of six years, his job as a promotions executive and even his country to chase her.<br><br>He finally found out that she was a married 35-years-old mum of three children.<br><br>"I gave up everything for her and lost everything,"Mr McLean,33, said.<br><br>Perhaps, he was hooked by her string of sob stories, beginning with the one about her being "Gang-raped" at the age of 16.<br><br>Maybe it was the tale of how she lived pff the streets in "dirt-poor" conditions.<br><br>And it was all made worse by her late nite phones calls, where she screamed for help because she said she was having flashbacks about times when she had been sexually tormented.<br><br>Something snapped in Mr McLean and he seems to have lost all his senses over this woman, whom he had met only on the Internet.<br><br>He hung on to the image of a stunning woman in the US waiting for a hero, such as himself, to come to her rescue.<br><br>Then last Nov, her prank took a new twist. She asked him to marry her. He sold his furniture and carpets to buy engagement rings and an air ticket to the US. The ring cost him $8,100.<br><br>Despite having no address for her, he managed to trace her phone number. Then he found out that she was not the stunning beauty he imagined her to be. And it was all a prank on her part.<br><br>"I dun know what I'm going to do. I'm penniless and jobless. I feel a real idiot," siad Mr McLean.<br><br>(Article extracted from The New Paper dated 28th March 2000.)<br><br>*********************************************<br><br>Back to Singapore, althought this incident happens in US...<br>But do U pples think that it can be happening to anyone here in singapore?<br><br>Do U think that U might be in such situation ???<br><br>Think again... Whos to be blamed here ???<br>The poor guy who was taking this issue so seriously ??? or that lady who right from beginning was just playing a fool with him???<br><br>Well... I guess this incident itself taught us not to believe so much in IRC... U'll never know what U gonna get.<br><br>Sorry for the long posting... hope I wont get sticks for this !!! Hehehheee.....<br>Cheerios !!!<br><br>*********************************************<br>"Irc is for us to enjoy &amp; have fun... not for us to suffer &amp; regrets...."<br>*********************************************<br></div>
