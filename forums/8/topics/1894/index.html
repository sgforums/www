            <div class='col-md body'>taken from CNA website<br><br><strong>Police arrest Indonesian maid for Bukit Merah murders</strong><br><br>The police arrested on Monday an Indonesian maid for the gruesome Bukit Merah double murder of her employer and daughter.<br><br>If the 22-year-old maid is found guilty of killing the woman and her daughter late last month, she faces the death penalty.<br><br>It started out as a tragic tale of a working mother, her two children and their maid being trapped in a fire at the woman's office.<br><br>34-year-old Angie Ng, and her 3-year-old daughter Crystal died. But her Indonesian maid and 1-year-old son Leon were rescued.<br><br>The maid Sundarti Suporiyanto and the boy suffered burns and were warded at the Singapore General Hospital burns unit.<br><br>But within hours, the plot took a very sinister twist. The fire was nothing more than a smoke screen -- for a double murder.<br><br>The woman had slash wounds on her arms and had been stabbed in the neck, while her daughter was stabbed in the chest.<br><br>The woman's husband - Mr Drake Poh - who is behind a 5-star hotel and casino in Myanmar, was away on business.<br><br>Then came reports the maid was caught on a surveillance tape at a petrol station buying a can of petrol just before the blaze.<br><br>She was arrested when she got out of hospital. The maid will be charged in Court with two counts of murder on Tuesday.<br><br>When Channel NewsAsia contacted the family of the murdered woman, they said that they were relieved by the arrest.<br><br>They said the maid was new, and they did not know what motive she had. They hope this will become clearer during the trial.<br></div>
