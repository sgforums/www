              <div class="post-body entry-content"><strong><span style="color: #6600cc;">SHE WRITES:</span></strong><br><strong></strong><br>I'm often confused what's the difference between a stingy person and a thrifty one. I don't know what's the line that separated the 2 kinds of persons. I'll give you a case and from there, you tell me why you say it's being thrifty or why it's being stingy.<br><br>Person A is pregnant and all her pants are too tight on the waistline because of her bulging tummy but she decides not to buy new ones thinking that after her pregnancy, she won't be able to use her clothes that often. So what she does is simply wear it, open the button and zipper (to prevent it from falling she uses a belt), and wears long blouses to hide that unpleasant look :o)<br><strong><em>Stingy or Thrifty?</em></strong><br><br>Person B was very, very hungry. She went to an eatery and found out that the food costs 5 times the food in the restaurant near her house. However, from where she was and where the restaurant was would take about 20 minutes travel and she was already having a headache due to hungry. But because she's <em><strong>thrifty or stingy</strong></em>, she decided to travel 20 minutes and ate at that place where the food was cheaper. She had a good meal but almost fainted when she had her meal.<br><br>Help me out here guys...<br><br>A. Is Person A thrifty or stingy? Why?<br>B. Is Person B thrifty or stingy? Why?<br>C.

              <p>actually you need to factor in the income and expenses, basically the financial conditions of the person involved too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for example, giving a very small tip in a resturant that requires tipping.</p>
              <p>If you have no financial commitments and comfortably earn 100k a month for the next 20 years, most people would call it stingy.</p>
              <p>but If you live foot to mouth, it can be considered thrifty. (let's assume he has to eat there)</p>

              <p>well at least to me its how its applied, when i see people trying to take a cent off here and there i think they're thrifty no matter how extreme.</p>
              <p>when they treat me one cent less then is stingy liao <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>anyway most of the time i see someone call another person stingy is only when the other person don't want to treat haha<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> know a guy back from army times and ocassionally we meet up to have a meal. he's extremely thrifty, whenever he buys his food and drink he'll comment on the price and how its not worth it to eat here and we're talking about comparisions of maybe 10-20cents but he still insists on treating and doesn't put a cap on what you want him to treat .so maybe he's more of a thrifty guy.</p>
              <p>another guy i know from work likes to think of how to save money all the time, when you treat him $1, he'll only treat you back max $0.90 or best if he don't treat at all. and he thinks you're stupid if you're generous with him, this type i label stingy.</p>

              <p>How about...</p>
              <p>Thrifty = reducing wastage<br>Stingy = reducing expenditure</p>
              <p>It's all about how a person thinks. A thrifty person's mind revolves around reducing wastage, but a stingy person's mind simply largely revolves around "I-don't-want-to-spend".</p>
              <p>But yeah, being too thrifty will eventually lead to being miserly... just like me - Miser MooKu.</p>

              <p><br>Thrithy is only spending on things that is neccessary. Stingy is not even willing to spend when comes to even moral responsibility. I give u an example. A pregnant women wanted to buy maternity clothes as her tummy is getting bigger but knowing she need it for only few months. She decide to ask from friends or buy second hand clothes to prevent wastage of money. This is call thrithy. Some may even irk at the idea of wearing others uses clothes thinking its dirty or insulting. But after a few wash, I bet it can be as hygiene as new one. It just those stupid elite thinking that second hand clothes are dirty.</p>

              <p>A old mother visit her rich son who drives. Knowing that the way back for her mum is long and tiring. He don't even bother to send her home thinking he can save a litre of petrol. This is call stingy!</p>
