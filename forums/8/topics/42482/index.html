            <div class='col-md body'>People,<br><br>do you notice nowadays that Police, ambulances and fire engines will switch their emergency lights (strobes) on even they are not in emergency?<br><br>How do i know it is not emergency? well.. just they way they drive relaxingly thru the streets.<br><br>anyway, who knows why they are doing this? like what good does it do?<br><br>To me, it is really confusing as i dunno whether they are in a real emergency.<br><br>In my first experience, a police car switched on his strobes behind me. I kept to my left and stopped. Only to be horned by ppl behind me. THe police car.. drove past me and stopped at red lighted intersection.<br><br>My second experience, the lights turned green in an 4-way intersection and there is an ambulance who is turning right and i am heading straight opposite me. It switched on the siren only after it wants to turn right. in this poitn of time.. i am already accelerating... and later had to jam my brakes as the ambulances assumed i would stop for them.  for me, i thought it wasn't an emergency as the siren wasn't on but only switch it on when the lights turn green.<br><br>Bottomline is... shouldn't they just keep the lights off just to prevent ppl from being confused?</div>

I mean.. a police tailing 5m behind you switching on its lights means 3 things.

There is a difference.</blockquote>well.. i take it now that if sirens are on, they are really in a emergency. But if it is not on.. they shouldn't keep the strobes on either. it confuses and eating into our tax money as strobes last for 50,000 flashes only and a bulb costs $30-50. More importantly, like i said above, a police car behind you with strobes on can mean 3 things.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>part of the reason why i made this topic is because of two things.<br><br>I was absent from singapore for 5 years. before this period, emergency vehicles do not switch their strobes on while on normal driving. even my short visits back to singapore during these 5 years.. i never noticed this practice.<br><br>while i was away from singapore, rules on handling with emer. vehicles are quite particular. Ambulances there will horn as much as it can to get you out of the way. In singapore, ambulances in emergency tend to be stuck in traffic as if there was no emergency their sirens fall into deaf ears..<br><br>more importantly, it seem that "suddenly" emer. vehicles seem to have this policy of keeping their strobes on. Was there a "law" enacted sometime during my absence that strobes must be kept on?<br><br>Because i know some 2-3 years back.. some ambulance pick up a patient, drive too fast got into another accident. Resulting in that patient dead. Then LTA or some authority say emergency vehicles shouldn't exceed speed limit even when in emergency.<br><br></div>
