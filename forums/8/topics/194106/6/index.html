I know so many PRCs here in UK, some have been here 4 years. FOUR years and they haven't picked up on english well yet! Its not that they can't do it. My mom had a PRC student in her school whose went from non-english speaker when he arrived in Sg aged 15, to a B3 when he was 16. In one year! He even made the jump from normal academic to express stream. By his A levels at 17, his english was at lest A2 standard.

They have this supremacist attitude about being chinese, as tho its beyond a chinese's duty to learn english. Which is just so wrong isn't it?

            <div class='col-md body'>I shall refrain from the bickering between you and 101 since this has to do with another thread which i do not intend to pursue at this point...<br>But your view that <span style="font-style: italic;">"And why can't they pick up on english? Simple. They have this supremacist attitude about being chinese, as tho its beyond a chinese's duty to learn english. "</span> is skewed to the extent that it is shouting for a rebuttal.<br><br>If anything you must know, learning English is a fervent business in China (and other non-English speaking countries like Japan and Korea). People have a strong motivation to grasp the language well due to the currency English attains in today's world. Now the truth is most Chinese, Japanese and Koreans do not possess good command of the language, even they have resided in UK or US for an extended period of time. My question is: Does this imply that Japanese and Koreans and also guilty of the "supremacist" attidute you are accusing the PRCs of?<br><br>The real reason they cannot grasp the language well is due to the inherent complexities of foreign language acquisition for adults. For an non English speaking child to be relocated and live in the US/UK and even Singapore, s/he easily pick up the language. For adults it's a totally different story. There is this critical period hypothesis, which I shall not belabor here, since it's unrelated.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HENG@:</div><div class="quote_body">personally, if its about the PRC's english, then yes im inclined to say their english generally is not good.

Simple. They have this supremacist attitude about being chinese, as tho its beyond a chinese's duty to learn english. "</span> is skewed to the extent that it is shouting for a rebuttal.<br><br>If anything you must know, learning English is a fervent business in China (and other non-English speaking countries like Japan and Korea). People have a strong motivation to grasp the language well due to the currency English attains in today's world. Now the truth is most Chinese, Japanese and Koreans do not possess good command of the language, even they have resided in UK or US for an extended period of time. My question is: Does this imply that Japanese and Koreans and also guilty of the "supremacist" attidute you are accusing the PRCs of?<br><br>The real reason they cannot grasp the language well is due to the inherent complexities of foreign language acquisition for adults. For an non English speaking child to be relocated and live in the US/UK and even Singapore, s/he easily pick up the language. For adults it's a totally different story. There is this critical period hypothesis, which I shall not belabor here, since it's unrelated.<br><br></div></blockquote>I have to disagree. 1stly, the issue here is on the PRCs. From the many PRCs I personally know, and the sort of attitude they display towards english, I say its very fair to say they have a supremacist attitudes. I won't comment about Japs and Koreans since I don't know many, but the few japs I know here speak damn good english (one sounds like a californian even tho he only stayed in cali for 3 years)<br><br>The truth is, many of these PRCs show little or no interest in picking up the language. And yes, they have a supremacist attitude about their language. Its not like they can't speak it, but they refuse to. As a result it doesn't improve. Like I said, they have the talent and ability to. I've known several PRCs(not childs certainly) in singapore who picked the language up from scratch in a matter of months in singapore. They are also not relocating to Singapore permanantly. Furthermore, being in Singapore, they can get on fine just knowning mandrin. Why would they need to learn english? For PRCs in UK, they have to get on by on english, so whats the justification for not picking it up well? Especially considering many of them also have plans to work here long term.<br><br>Personally, from observing the PRCs i personally know here, seeing as they do have a ruddmentary grasp of the language, they can always try to mix outside their own PRC social circles. Many local born chinese i know do speak english and mandrin or some chinese dialects. PRCs can always mix with them as well. But they do pretty much look down on most chinese not born within PRC. Which is quite silly really.</div>
