He holds the monochromic view that only proficiency in English equates true attainment of literacy. What a laugh. He must have metamohposed into a white man in his fantasy world. </div></blockquote>hey i don't blame trendz for standning up against 101. isn't it equally stupid to assume anyone who speaks good english, studies in a western country, is sucking up to whites? U have extreme prejudice of one order, naturally u get extreme prejudice of the opposite order arising to counter it. Trendz's views about mandrin might not be the most correct ones, but its a natural AND understandable progression from the sort of opposite extreme attitude.<br><br>So who to blame?

If u can't tolerate it, thats totally fine. Understanding shouldn't be that hard.<br><br>I'd like to point out also that this discussion wasn't much sensible to begin with.
