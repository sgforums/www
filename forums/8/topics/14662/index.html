            <div class='col-md body'>Roosters have nothing to do with egg-laying. Hens lay eggs no matter what. (When they are 6 months or older) Roosters do play a part in baby chicks though. If a hen doesn't mate with a rooster then the egg will just be an egg, and could never possibly be a baby chick. If a rooster mates with the hen, the egg the hen lays can be incubated or sat on, and it will hatch. Only when a rooster mates with a hen is there a baby chick in the egg the hen lays.<br><br>the eggs that you buy at the store are not usually fertilized. Commerical poultry farmers keep the chickens in small wire cages usually with several other hens. They don't keep any roosters, because they are of no use, unless you need to hatch some baby chicks. I have heard of some store bought eggs being fertilized, but they are probably from a small poutlry farmer, and not commerical. If you are to buy eggs "home-grown" they will probably be fertilized, because the people who raised them probably have a rooster.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeh you guys are knowledgeable but you guys dont even come any close.<br><br>do you know how chicken mate?  I BET you guys never seen before - I HAVE seen chicken "having sex" before because I used to live in Kampong which raises chicken.<br>Do you know how chicken sleep? - I tell you something you might not believe - <strong>chickens can actually fly and they sleep on tree-tops </strong>! Believe it or not, IT's TRUE.<br><br><strong>I have seen with my own eyes </strong> python swallowing up a rat, how chickens fought for popularity, chameleons change its colour [LIVE!] and bats eating their lunch.  I have even seen owl turn its head 180 degrees, tadpoles becoming frogs, centipede mother with her 10 over kids on her back. I even encounter 2 times GIANT RED centipedes which are 18cm long and I enjoyed catching many colourful earthworms which are blue, black, red and white. There's one giant earth worm which I caught before, was also 18 cm long which is very strong like a fish, keep struggling to get out of my hands.<br>Have you guys ever play with a baby chick before? or baby duck?<br>I even caught tubifex worms before in rivers. They live together like a bunch of sea weeds. And there're giant black-monitor lizards out there about 1.5 meter long which feeds on eggs. I used to chase them and throw stones at them.<br><br>Teens like you guys brought up in HDB SURE missed out a lot of things.

            <div class='col-md body'>hey why u laugh? I am telling the truth. Chickens cant fly long distances. But they sure fly high for short distances, and they can fly up the tree too, i mean those very very tall trees.<br><br>Those chicken you see nowadys already too tamed to fly. They cant fly anymore when they are locked in cages everyday.<br><br>[This message has been edited by obigood (edited 11 May 2002).]</div>
