              <p>That is not true. Rather, there are guys who have perhaps half of what you all mentioned. Isn't it more realistic that way, having some traits instead?</p>

              <p>Here my reply:</p>
              <p>1)  Of course I think of them that why I am entertaining customers</p>
              <p>2)  The money is part of non-operating expenses.</p>
              <p>3)  Use condom and very careful.</p>
              <p>4)  I do this because the competition is too tough. what is right and what is wrong is a subjective definition.</p>
              <p>So how?</p>

              <p>If you have only two choice: 1) rich, manly, good body,

              womanize for social and business purpose.</p>

              <p>Simple... the thrill of the chase? </p>
              <p>What you don't have sometimes seem more desirable than what's definitely yours.  Maybe that's what drives them.  Some men miss the flirting and dating and the sex that occurs before the 'boredom' and routine of marriage and parenthood sets in.   Isn't it common to see people taking things for granted until they are at the verge of losing everything?  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>Sometimes, when I look around me at married couples, you don't really blame the guy either.  I'm not condoning extra-marital affairs, not at all!  But I can't  help thinking of my Greek neighbour who yells at the top of her voice, scolds her husband loudly in the backyard without giving him 'face', and is very rough and uncouth and walks like a gangster ... I often am amazed that her husband is STILL with her!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>
              <p>Remember Social Geography and the topic of Push and Pull factors?  Sometimes, it's not just the Pull and lure of other women who avail themselves to men, but also, the Push factor of girlfriends / wives irritating their boyfriends or acting meanly to them.</p>

              <p>I always remember what one of my china buddies said:</p>

              <p>It's an primitive instinct to ensure the perpetuality of human.  The caveman go around fight ing for woman and impregnant them.  The cavewoman will take care of the baby, because if they also go and find man, then who is going to look after the baby.</p>

              <p>Wow... never thought so....</p>
              <p>Ok there is an article online on why man irritate woman. Or I should say 8 things she hates about you. Pretty american, but there are some points in there we should look out for.</p>
              <p>http://men.msn.com/articlemh.aspx?cp-documentid=6804752&amp;page=%20%20%20%20%20%201</p>
              <p>After reading it, I might have been able to salvage my previous relation, if I just try hard enough. I was just not trying anymore....... Personally I like this:</p>
              <p><strong>ANNOYANCE #3</strong></p>
              <p>You talk to us as if we're one of the guys.</p>
              <p>.....................................................................................................................................</p>
              <p>Also, for those who wish to remain single, just a gentle reminder. We all get old. Older. Before you know it, we are somewhere near the middle of lifespan. I have seen some older ladies/men who are very brave. Single, no kids, normal income, have parents, paying for housing loan etc .... Would it be better for him/her to share the burden? It might not turn out well, but at least you tried and have something.</p>
              <p>Anyway, have a good weekend to all.</p>
