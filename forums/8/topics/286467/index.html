            <div class='col-md body'>Are you in a Job Search? Beware of the Glorification/Mis-representation of Job titles<br><br>Dear all, I can be considered a fresh graduate considering that I graduated in April 2007. Subsequently, I worked in this MNC research house for 3 months but then decided that the culture and workload didnÂ’t suit me. I have yet to tender my resignation, but I am actively on a job hunt now.I discovered some innate truths which I would like to share with current fresh graduates who are also in their job search.<br><br>1)	I am disturbed by the usage of titles such as <strong>Â“Management AssociateÂ”, Â“Management TraineeÂ” or Â“Management AssistantÂ”. </strong>Such programs usually stipulate that itÂ’s a 2 years program; you will be rotated to different business functions within the company, learn stuff and eventually be posted to fixed position in the company at the end of the program. However, be careful in applying to such positions. There are scrupulous companies who hire graduates in such titles, <strong>simply to exploit you and get themselves a cheap temporary labor. </strong>Usually, a good gauge is to look at the pay they are paying you. For instance, I applied to this XXX Airline Management Trainee program. There were 3 rounds and I got through to the 2nd round. In the 2nd round, I told the interviewers that my expected salary is $2.5K. And subsequently, I was rejected. I called up my UniversityÂ’s career office and asked then to find out from the Airline why I was rejected. Hmm, indeed, in the end, the Airline said that they <strong>were only prepared to pay S$2.1K. This sum, is simply too little and reflects the AirlineÂ’s intention to hire cheap labor yeah?</strong><br><br>2)I am also disturbed by the glorification of job titles. I applied to one of our local banks, the position for Â“Branch relationship Manager, Consumer Banking GroupÂ”. In the job advertisement, the job scope description was insightful; it talked about nurturing relationship with your customersÂ’, understanding their needs, and then recommend the various innovative financial instruments and also provide in-depth financial expertise to help our clients. When I entered the interview, I had a rude shock. The interviewer said, <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Â“Look in essence, this is just an insurance agent job, period. There is no such thing as being based in a branch. This is a mobile job. Can you do it? Yes or No?Â” </strong></span>I retorted and said the advertisement states it is a branch relationship manager, meaning I will have a desk, serve walk in customers etc etc. The interviewerÂ’s reply was, <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Â“Sure, it is just a fancy name. I can also call it personal banker, or privilege banker, or ultra supreme banker; but the job scope is still the same; sell insuranceÂ”. </strong></span>I was thinking how serious can this misrepresentation be!?!?!?! I guess, on one hand, I am glad the interviewers are candid and upfront; in fact, I left moments after this question was asked. On the other hand, I am a little pissed that I made a wasted trip to this bank due to a misrepresented job advertisement.<br><br>3)Lastly, you know the thing about all these online Job search websites such as jobscentral.com, or jobsdB.com or jobstreet.com etc. I am especially skeptical about certain dubious postings which gave really generous job description, but they merely state apply to Â“The advertiserÂ”. My concern is that, some graduates may actually apply by sending in their resume and cover letters. But little do they know that <strong>their resume could be harvested and resold online by just changing the name on the resume. You will never know</strong>.<br><br>4)I also replied to a job interview call from Jobscentral.com. The company had a name and a legitimate website. It looked really impressive especially when the website says we are located in Tanjong Pagar area. I know a lot of big office buildings are in this area. So the day before the actual interview, I decided to do a little recon and checked out the office address. To my shock, <strong>this so called, Â“MEGA-reputableÂ” company is merely located in a small shophouse (2nd storey), and worst of all, it is beside this sleazy massage shop house where loads of PRC and Thai prostitutes walk in and out</strong>. This company looked really dubious, and if it were reputable, I do not know how the female staff can put up with that location? Imagine leaving office late at night and they might be recognized as one of the whores?<br><br>So yup, sign. Job hunt is hard. I still remember the press said that it is a booming job market now, and Jobs are plentiful. What they fail to report is that, it ainÂ’t that rosy for fresh graduates.<br><br></div>

No harm done bah. I mean employers are also not stupid lar; more or less they will know that there is always some form of exaggeration in every candidate's resume. It is just of matter of glorifying your CCA positions within reasonable boundaries k?<br><br>There is this memorable incident which my current boss shared with me. He said he interviewed this graduate a month ago; and he claimed that he is some events director in this club. When asked what was the typical budget he assigns to events in his club, he quoted a figure of $300,000. You know. er.. even establish banks like CITiBank.. will not spend so much on an events. Hence this dude was so busted.</div>

However, be careful in applying to such positions. There are scrupulous companies who hire graduates in such titles, <strong>simply to exploit you and get themselves a cheap temporary labor. </strong>Usually, a good gauge is to look at the pay they are paying you. For instance, I applied to this XXX Airline Management Trainee program. There were 3 rounds and I got through to the 2nd round. In the 2nd round, I told the interviewers that my expected salary is $2.5K. And subsequently, I was rejected. I called up my UniversityÂ’s career office and asked then to find out from the Airline why I was rejected. Hmm, indeed, in the end, the Airline said that they <strong>were only prepared to pay S$2.1K. This sum, is simply too little and reflects the AirlineÂ’s intention to hire cheap labor yeah?</strong><br><br>2)I am also disturbed by the glorification of job titles. I applied to one of our local banks, the position for Â“Branch relationship Manager, Consumer Banking GroupÂ”. In the job advertisement, the job scope description was insightful; it talked about nurturing relationship with your customersÂ’, understanding their needs, and then recommend the various innovative financial instruments and also provide in-depth financial expertise to help our clients. When I entered the interview, I had a rude shock. The interviewer said, <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Â“Look in essence, this is just an insurance agent job, period. There is no such thing as being based in a branch. This is a mobile job. Can you do it? Yes or No?Â” </strong></span>I retorted and said the advertisement states it is a branch relationship manager, meaning I will have a desk, serve walk in customers etc etc. The interviewerÂ’s reply was, <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Â“Sure, it is just a fancy name. I can also call it personal banker, or privilege banker, or ultra supreme banker; but the job scope is still the same; sell insuranceÂ”. </strong></span>I was thinking how serious can this misrepresentation be!?!?!?! I guess, on one hand, I am glad the interviewers are candid and upfront; in fact, I left moments after this question was asked. On the other hand, I am a little pissed that I made a wasted trip to this bank due to a misrepresented job advertisement.<br><br>....<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>That's why always check the rank scale.<br><br>For your para 2, on the bank, can I know which bank? PM me if u dun wanna post here.<br><br>thanks.</div>

I still remember the press said that it is a booming job market now, and Jobs are plentiful. What they fail to report is that, it ainÂ’t that rosy for fresh graduates.<br></blockquote><strong>It ain't rosy for you when you quote your pay too high.</strong> I would just go in and get the relevant experience and move out for a higher paying job.

You don't have the practical experience to solve the problems that comes up . Textbook university experience does not count.<br><br>Get your experience and practical skill in the workplace first before you start negotiating for higher amounts. Trust me , once you hone on your skills and they are in demand, you can start negotiating for alot more or other employers will offer you more than what your current employer will offer. I know because this is my experience now. I started in a new career path with a very low pay a year ago (took a 1.3k paycut per month ) - got my skills and used the old skills in nursing, learnt through mistakes and improve my skills. A few months back I started a bidding war between 2 sections of my employing organisation - I moved to the highest bidder. Now I am moving again because another employer offered to take me in with a better offer and a scholarship. Mind you , I had 3 offers - all external bidding and all willing to up the other until the limit is reached.<br><br>So moral of the story : just get the experience. Don't call it cheap labour.

Hmm, and yup, i didnt really get a fantatstic degree grade; cant even qualify as outstanding and sure as hell, i wun be able to move out of comfort zone bah.<br><br>I understand your point about the need for fresh grads to acquire the experience and doing so at a low pay until they are good enough to move on. Hmm it just irks me that considering inflation in SG is gg at 2% per annum per year; and i recall during the times when i was in Secondary 4, I heard the PM then (which was in 1997), that a uni grad can at most earn 2.5K. But its been like a decade now, (2007), and we still have companies offering 2.1K or below 2.5K per say? Thats like really sleazy for some companies to quote such a price?</div>

I got these pay estimates from my classmates who are already hired in such positions.<br><br>Hence, i think for MA positions, it is ridiculous for it to be like 2.1K? And considering the above estimates, i only quoted my expected salary at 2.5K.. (considering they are a Bleedy rich airline, which ranks like 325 out of fortunes 500 companies)?<br><br>At least for me, i do recognize that money do not fall freely from the sky, and i was trying to ask for a fair value for my work done. In this case, i asked 2.5K cz it was a rich airline. I mean of course if i attended an interview in a FMCG company for a marketing executive position, of cz.. i would quote a lower expected salary of say 2.2K.<br><br>;-)<br></div>
