              <p>Hey everyone..</p>
              <p>I'm currently studying into my 2nd year at NTU. It's been my dream since I was young to study abroad, but I couldn't do it because of an illness that a family member was plagued with unfortunately.. But she has passed away recently, and I no longer have any wish to stay here to study anymore.. </p>
              <p>I've been considering studying Law in the UK, and I've consulted my family about this. However, they've been quite discouraging as they say I'd be wasting my 2 years of education so far. To be honest, I really do not mind starting over as a new undergraduate overseas, because I feel that I'll be able to learn and grow more as a person if I make full use of the 4 years of university life over there. I don't really see my giving up my studies here as a waste. I don't know if you all think so? </p>
              <p>But the crux of my problem I feel is my personality. I'm rather introverted and quiet, and I don't usually speak up in class. I know that Law school is very intense and students there, especially students in the UK, are very passionate about what they're studying, and they're very outspoken. Also, Law school is known for it's back-stabbing and cut-throat environment. My sister thinks that I won't be able to survive there, but I really am very interested in doing Law. I don't want to waste another 2 more years of my life studying something that I'm not interested in and dreading going to school everyday. </p>
              <p>I'm really in a dilemma now and I'd appreciate any insights or advice about this.. I know I really want this! Thanks guys..</p>

              <p>Why don't you do Law in Singapore?</p>
              <p>If what your sister says is true, I think it's better for you to finish your course in NTU first then proceed over to UK to study your law.</p>
              <p>It's always better to have a degree in your hand first before you move on to another. Because IF you were to really fail over there as what your sister said, then you will end up wasting another few years without a degree.</p>
              <p>It's better to be practical then to follow your dreams sometimes.</p>
              <p>Just my point of view.</p>

              <p>getting a degree, no matter how irrelevant, is not wasting time. After getting the degree, you can go overseas and study some more if your family can afford it or you feel like it. Heck, you can do what you want if you work for a couple of years and save up the money to study abroad.</p>
              <p>Can't you finish your course in 3 years, or is it a direct 4 years course?</p>

              <p>one thing to point out.</p>
              <p>should u get a foreign degree in law, you cannot practise in singapore unless you go for a ''conversion or bridging course''. i not sure about the exact term, but i have a friend who went to London to persue a degree in law.</p>

              <p>Hey peeps,</p>
              <p>Thanks for all your replies.. I'll try to address everyone.. </p>
              <p>Well, it's been my dream since I was young to study law in the UK.. It isn't my parent's wishes to do so but mine just to make it clear :) and why not in Singapore? Okay, see here's the thing.. I've been studying here for 2 years already, and maybe it's just me, but I feel really, really stifled here.. After studying in S'pore for 12 year, I think I need a change in environment.. Plus after experiencing the death of my loved one, it just makes me wanna do what I want to do like what HyuugaNeji said.. </p>
              <p>Hmm.. And my course isn't a one with direct honours so I'll have another 2 more years to go.. I think I'd just peng san with the thought of going to school everyday for 2 more years here.. Haha.. And I've already checked with the Law Soc, you can practice law here in Singapore as long as you study law in one of the recognized universities stated under their list, and if you graduate with 2nd upper honours.. </p>
              <p>Another reason why I wanna go overseas is to gain more exposure, and to grow up.. I've actually worked as an intern at an accounting firm last year, and there were many Singaporean interns, and a few others from UK and the Middle East.. And boy you can actually see the vast difference.. From what I can actually see right, I feel that Singaporeans don't really have much passion in what they're doing.. Sure, we're competitive and all, but from seeing these overseas interns, they're really passionate about life and their job and they have so much ambition! </p>
              <p>I've also spoken to friends who've studied in the UK, and the environment there is amazing.. People are very passionate about what they're studying and also there's much more interaction and discussion.. I feel going to school here is just about taking in facts and such and then going to sit for exams.. Im sure many of you disagree with me, but that's just my point of view.. </p>
              <p>I know my mindset is just so fixed already right.. Haha.. To the extent that I actually feel I'm causing my own dilemma! But thanks alot guys for all your input I really do appreciate it.. I guess I really have to think this through myself and with my family.. Hey, do feel free to give me more input okay!</p>
              <p>Btw, plastic bag or driftingguy, that article you posted is really funny haha.. Is it really real?! But that really made my day though heh thanks!</p>

To be honest, I really do not mind starting over as a new undergraduate overseas, because I feel that I'll be able to learn and grow more as a person if I make full use of the 4 years of university life over there. I don't really see my giving up my studies here as a waste. I don't know if you all think so? </p>
              <p>But the crux of my problem I feel is my personality. I'm rather introverted and quiet, and I don't usually speak up in class. I know that Law school is very intense and students there, especially students in the UK, are very passionate about what they're studying, and they're very outspoken. Also, Law school is known for it's back-stabbing and cut-throat environment. My sister thinks that I won't be able to survive there, but I really am very interested in doing Law. I don't want to waste another 2 more years of my life studying something that I'm not interested in and dreading going to school everyday. </p>
              <p>I'm really in a dilemma now and I'd appreciate any insights or advice about this.. I know I really want this! Thanks guys..</p>

              <p>Hi</p>
              <p>It has been my dream to study overseas too and studying in NUS or NTU has been something I wanted too. However, due to poor results and financial issues, I wasn't able to. I got my degree ultimately through part time studies at SIM. I didn't regret or feel bad about it because ultimately I got my bachelor and that allows me to move higher in my career path. </p>
              <p>For your case, I feel that dream is one thing, reality is another. Studying in UK is not cheap, financially are you able to afford it? How long more to go for your course in NTU? If you are completing your course soon, why waste the 2 years of effort invested? why not go UK after you graduate? Having double degree allows you more options in your career choice.</p>
              <p>Is good to have dreams but perhaps you should see long term and what kind of future u looking towards. I have no doubts that you can survive in UK but have you give a thought to what ifs? </p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents</p>

              <p>go for it , provided if it's within your financial means to do so, like wad hyuuganeji mentioned.</p>
              <p>overseas exposure is great, widens up ur perspective of the world. let u realise how small sg is, and there's so much out there for us to learn and see.</p>
              <p>but of cos, i say it again, do it within ur financial means</p>
              <p>wadever choice u make, just go ahead without any regrets =)</p>
              <p>all the best!</p>
