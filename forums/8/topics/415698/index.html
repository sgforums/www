              <p>I am in my mid 20s.</p>
              <p>A diploma in accounting graduate from local polytechnic. been doing accounting jobs for a couple of years. feel that I am not really suitable for accounts job as I find it very boring and tiring to be always looking at figures.</p>
              <p>My results are not good enough to go NUS, NTU, SMU etc so my only option is to go to SIM.</p>
              <p>There are many courses in SIM and some are affordable too but these courses do not seem to have much prospects as in the amount of jobs taht are available for you to work after you graduate are very limited.</p>
              <p>For example, a degree in marketing graduate will probably end up doing some sales job etc. A degree in business administration graduate will probably end up as a admin executive or at most manager in the office.</p>
              <p>I am the type that is not good in hands on stuff so IT, Electronics, Engineering course etc are not suitable for me.</p>
              <p>I can only think of social work, hair stylist, counselling and nursing course which have good prospects and these graduates are high in demand.</p>
              <p>For nursing, I have tried to apply for sponsorship but was not selected. I can't go back to nanyang polytechnic to take a diploma in nursing as I have already completed my diploma in accounting from polytechnic before. I will no longer be egilible for the poly tution grant and I will have to pay the full course fee which is around 20k for 3 years plus say a average of $400 living expenses a month that will be a total of around 35k to get the diploma which is too expensive and I can't afford it.</p>
              <p>I can't take a degree in nursing too as I do not have a diploma in nursing which is the prequistic to take the degree course.</p>
              <p>Another alternative is to go to ITE to study NITEC in nursing which course fee is cheap. 2 years course fee is around $700 only plus living expenses of $400 a month I will spend about 10k in total.</p>
              <p>But isn't it weird for a diploma holder to downgrade himself to go to ITE to study a NITEC in nursing?</p>
              <p>For hair stylist, the course is not available in SIM, only in ITE. The same question is that it is weird for a diploma holder to go to ITE to study and downgrade himself.</p>
              <p>As for counselling and social work, SIM do offer such programmes.</p>
              <p>But I look at the requirements to be a social worker or counsellor, other than having a degree, there are still many other requirements such as completing a few hundred hours of hands on experience etc.</p>
              <p>So what other courses in SIM can I take that when you graduate from the course there is high demand for employment?</p>

              <p>You should try to find out the reason why are you not selected for the nursing sponsorship.</p>
              <p>Could it be that you did not meet the requirements eg no Chemistry or Biology or you have failed in the subjects ?</p>
              <p>If the reasons are due to you do not meet their academic requirements, try to re-take these subjects and re-apply after you have passed these subjects.</p>
              <p>Once Nanyang poly accepts you into its nursing diploma course, you will not have much difficulties to get the sponsorship.</p>

              <p>Nursing is a farked up job, considering the fact that if you wish to remain in singapore, your payscale is going to be crap unless you sign a bond or something otherwise you are directly competing against your pinoy and burmese counterparts who are willing to take the same job, and do the same crap for 1/2 your asking salary.</p>
              <p>Another thing to note is that if you really want to go far in nursing, you need to specialise in one field, and only an advanced diploma can provide that. A nursing degree is almost like a duh, jack of all trades, master of none. Just ask around who makes more money, the nurse with the specialist diploma, or the nurse holding a nursing degree.</p>

              <p>Nursing is a farked up job, considering the fact that if you
              wish to remain in singapore, your payscale is going to be crap
              unless you sign a bond or something otherwise you are directly
              competing against your pinoy and burmese counterparts who are
              willing to take the same job, and do the same crap for 1/2 your
              asking salary.</p>
              <p>Another thing to note is that if you really want to go far in
              nursing, you need to specialise in one field, and only an advanced
              diploma can provide that. A nursing degree is almost like a duh,
              jack of all trades, master of none. Just ask around who makes more
              money, the nurse with the specialist diploma, or the nurse holding
              a nursing degree.</p>

              <p>Even sales, office job you also get scolding by your boss. Even you set up your own business and be your own boss you will still get scolding by your customers.</p>
              <p>It all depends on individuals.</p>
              <p>I do not have family committments and do not have much friends to go out with. So whether I work on shift or weekend doesn't make much difference as I am at home on my off days most of the time..</p>
