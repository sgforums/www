            <div class='col-md body'>IMO, playing online or offline games is alrite for adults. Some play to relieve stress, some play to get their mind off vexing things. some play just to monitor their kids and so on. theres always a reason for them playing games.<br><br>But if a person is playing a free game, then he/she must understand the meaning of free, and not buy purchasing point reload cards spending $10 on it for some cash items. And frankly speaking, there is no such thing as a free online game. think about the internet bills ur have to pay for and the PUB bills u have to pay for. its alrdy making payments to play the game liao.<br><br>Overexccess of discussing about a certain game in ur daily life is quite a common sight in SG nowadays. Especially when the WCG makes it's appearence in SG, many kids and even adults have started to pick up gaming. SOme have even made it their career. Its just like last time, when gaming wasnt that popular, what will the adults and teenagers then be discussing about?? Girls, movies, food and the usual stuffs that we still do discuss about now. Gaming is just another new topic of discussion here.<br><br>I'm not a fan of maple btw, but i'm only stating these ponts to those of u who finds gaming for adults is bad, that actually gaming is for ppl of all ages, its only a matter if u like it or not. Just like some ppl like to play soccer, whereas others might think its stupid for 20 ppl trying to chase and kick the ball and the remainig 2 trying to catch the ball.<br><br>If u think a person can't possibly live off by just playing games, then u are quite wrong. Many adults for the past 5-8 yrs have started earning money by just playing online games, they play, they hunt and they sell their rare loots. Some experienced players are even invited to a certain company to work for them as a developer or game master where they can play at work. My frds have opened up a Lan shop and now, he's enjoying what he likes most which is gaming, and he still earns money.<br><br>So those of u guys who thinks gaming for adults is childish, pls think otherwise.<br><br>Lastly i would like to include, <strong><span style="color: red;">MAPLE SUX</span></strong></div>
