I'll give u a brief discription on each of the games i've mentioned,<br><br>Khan Online : A good range of charecter classes with a good amount of skills, big maps to explore, PVP enabled game with a PK system.3D graphics. correct me if i'm wrong, maple doesnt have PVP system.<br><br>FungWan Online : Very stratigic gameplay on charecter development. 1 wrong move and ur charecter is goner. huge maps to explore, has wasd controls and point and click controls. has camera angles. super wide range of skills to learn, has skill chaining ability at high lvls. party lvl-ing is adviced during mid lvls of game. alot of rare items to be found.Game has Clan and guild system, where by 5 different clans will go head on with each other for at least 4 times in a week. clan wars in this game is damn fun where u really see huge amount of ppl defending their own clans or attacking other clan for their clan relic.<br><br>RYL 1 &amp; 2 : more or less like FWO, only that it has a limited range of skills, but this game has a unique gameplay which is their attacking style, its fast compared to maple and u see numbers fly as u attack ur enemy. Has a good and fair PVP system whereby theres is no such thing as a perfect class. Guild war is enabled too.<br><br>Trickster Online : English version just came out recently, kind of like an RO rip off but still has a Wide range of charecter classes and class upgrds are available. Unique part of this game is, it has a drilling system, whereby u can drill to find pots or any other items. the better ur drill is, the better ur items gained. PK enabled too.<br><br>Hero Online : 5 classes to choose. 3D gfx. big maps to explore. tamable pets which takes part in battles. u can ride certain pets too. example a Dragon. game is set in the ancient chinese martial arts period. equip enhancements availble. PK enabled Guild war enabled.<br><br>Last Chaos : average range of classes. wide range of skills. huge maps to explore. equip enhancements. 3d gfx. PK enabled. Guild war enabled. unique features of personal dungeons.<br><br>RO A.K.A. : Ragnarok Online : Very good and advanced class enhancements. equip upgrds are available with a unique card slotting system to equips to enhance ur items. wide range of skills. different charecter developements for a same class. E.g. A Lord knight can be agi+crit or Dmg+Vit. theres always a differnt build for each class.<br><br>So pls compare these games with maple and u know how bad maple actually sux.</div></blockquote>The maple is different from other games you mention not because it sux. because it design for the young to play. I also think it a good tool for young children to communicate with their parents. btw you have not right to say it sux until you urself can create games 1st then go ahead and say all those sux and your creation is superior.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just my input on this thing.<br><br>firstly, dota is a totally different thing from all the maple, wow or any MMOPRG game that u have out there. it is a game where you get on it, finish one game by one hour or so and then everything goes back to normal. you don't get your levels with you eternally. it's just like a game of chess. u play, u win or lose, get over it and begin a new game.<br><br>one reason why it's so addicting it's because there are too many heros in the game to choose from. let alone master all of them. there are like over hundreds of spells, and 60 over heros? i think that is the reason why people can play the same game over and over again. onlookers may view the game as repitive and always the same, think about it like chess, (it does look very stupid if you don't know how to play and you will think people are doing the same thing over and over again)..., but truth is, there are millions of possibilities, outcomes etc in a game. and everything you play you have different teammates using different heros and you can buy different items each time. it's a same game but you're playing it totally differently each time.<br>to add on, it's not only a chess game but it's like a team chess game with 5 per side. when to push? when to defend, it's all a team's decision.<br><br>i don't play regular dota, neither do i play maple. i have played till level 13 in the past for like 1 or 2 days and i got bored of the whole thing. my friends they all went to level 20 plus and got sick of it and decided to quit soon after. my clique of frens do not play maple, and i really don't understand why people do. if people have the free time, why not? but for pple like me, i think it's lame to level up ur char to such a high level..? for wad? show off?<br><br>to me you go to a lanshop and get multiple godlikes in dota (like 20-0) or smth is glorious. maple, u need time, patience and persistance. for dota, you need skill, reflexes (??). there are countless bengs in the lanshop that play soo frequently but i can say that not many of them are actually pro despite playing for sooo long. it's a game that requires alot of talent...and natural ability. in contrast, u invest time and money into maple, u get results..<br><br>both are very different games. dota is actually a good game, but it has downgraded because of the people playing it. everytime i hear on the lrt and mrt, a group of youngsters to middle age men talking about dota. what happened yesterday in their pub game, how they owned and they were like blabbling and bragging. im not saying it's bad, but it certainly spoils the image of the game, and i usually form the image that they are noob.usually when they spill out something that evidently proves n00bness, i usually give them a diao and smile at them. it's really funny that these people can speak so loudly about stuff they aren't good at. and when outside, i think it's best not to talk about this kind of stuff. in fact, ive realized many people are not really fond of avid gamers?? (true or false?)...gaming just dun get the right attention in SG?<br><br>anyway, talking too much about dota isn't good, esp in public. it's the bad image i guess. i think it's alright to use lingo like double kill! first blood etc. i think it's perfectly fine. it's quite funny to some extent (or cool?). and when another of my fren makes move on a girl that another fren likes we always like to use the term " KS " which means kill steal. there are plenty of other lingos which are quite fun to use. but to me, blabbing n bragging in public are really irritating and r noise pollution. not many people ( even friends included ) dun like pple braggin about how they DK-ed or got a 5-0 or smth in a public game.....or how they call others noobs. true pros don't talk too much. they just quietly play their own game.<br><br>thats my take. i have not much to comment about maple. honestly i think it's stupid.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I play online games coz they're a form of entertainment to me and they're free ^^<br><br>i think maple sux, and btw, criticism can come from every1 not just those who makes game. So what if the game makers say the game is perfect blah blah but then end up no1 in the market wants to play?<br><br>Btw, i don't remember simon cowell singing that nice and why the fuk is he the judge for american idols, not to mention those idols really shi li pai wor.<br><br>Lol, i think maple wont get u repetitive strain injury la, not so bad de but u wanna get repetitive strain injury, by all means go try gunzonline and i dun mean just go in and spray like amateurs but actually perform those moves lol<br><br>For 1st timer sure tired v fast 1 lol.<br><br>Neways, I like Dota coz it's a thinking game, not just a stupid no-brainer-grind to win game, same like Gunzonline. It's not how long u play, coz i dun have much time to sit down and grind like those hardcore mmorpg players.<br><br>That's the reason why i've sworn off MMORPGs, those are games whereby u pit to see who sit in front of comp longest then who win, coz it's all about grinding.</div>
