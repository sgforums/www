But this kinda rejections very fast recover one. Personally I kanna more than 6-10 times before i start learning. The impt thing is that guys, you must learn from your each mistakes. Also learn to improve yourselves. From learning from mistakes plus improving oneself, you will actually become a better person and a better person will naturally attract girls.<br><br>What TS said is very very true. So how do you identify a potential gf from a normal lady fren? You will have to pay attention to the eyes. Pay attention to how the girl look at you. If it is just a normal lady fren, her way of looking at u will be like your guy fren looking at you. If she's really interested in u, she will look at u straight in the eyes... or her eyes will look dazed while looking at u... machiam like got alot of things to say but dun dare to say like that. Pay real attention to the eyes guys, not the bre@sts.<br><br>And lastly guys, get in touch of ur feelings. Don't always think that the girl likes u or she could be the potential. If she really likes you, u will be able to feel it one.</div>
