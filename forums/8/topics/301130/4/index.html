            <div class='col-md body'>i used to do so too. in the past, i really had the desire to get into a relationship and would try ways and means to create the conditions for love to blossom. after 2 rejections, my mindset somehow changed.<br><br>in fact, the girl that rejected the second time round has now became my best platonic female friend. and i really treasure such kinda friendship with her because with her, there's no expectations involved. she could even joked around with our friends on how i used to try to ask her out on a date and etc. in fact, i didnt really expect that we will come thus far.<br><br>so my point being, i think i've become the reverse. i'm starting to lose faith in bgr and love in general. like love is so overhyped and too much of a guessing game for me. instead, why not just be plain good friends when you dont need to be wary of boundaries.<br><br>then to speak again, maybe i have never been in love before and in singlehood for so long that i dont know what's in store for me in a relationship.<br><br>ha.</div>

Does he act protective because he truely concern for you as a fren and worries you kanna peeped at OR he's seeing you as a potential and becomes a little possessive. When a person, no matter man or woman is dealing with the feeling of love, there will be a slight level of possessiveness.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thats what you feel. If God created us, then he also created love right? If he created love then when you love someone you pray to him then you get your love alr wat. So why are there so many people who suffer in love? Believers and non-believers of God likewise. If theres a God, can i hear what is his job on love? He made the guys feel so dejected when he created women, let man get cheated of his money by women. He made girls unable to defend themselves at the most critical point of life. Since he is the creator, he is responsbile for everything that happens. People are starving in many parts of the world because God made them so. If God is so merciful and compassionate, believers or non believer, he would embrace all and impose equality for all. But sadly thats not the case.</div>
