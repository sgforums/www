            <div class='col-md body'>After reading the posts about Annabel Chong, it reminded about someone I knew of.  There is this girl was raped by someone whe she dating.  I don't know know if it is the first date she got raped or is she got raped after a few dates with this accused named David.  According to a source, she refused to have sex with David.  As a result, David raped her.  She must have felt depressed and self-wortheless after that, since after the rape incident, she was really "loose".  She would go around and sleep with guys that she hardly knows - the one night stand kinda thing.<br><br>I do not understand why she would do that.  Is there some sort of a severe psychological impact that causes the person to behave in this manner?  Can someone explain?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rape in a way is an cruel assertion of power and control over another human being. Imagine something that might have meant something to u was taken by force away from u. Probably the only form of "retaliation" is by going around with other people and feeling a sense of power. And also to reconfirm her attractiveness.<br><br>For some, going around with other people would only strengthen their own mis-belief that they are as worthless as they think they are and the vicious cycle continues.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well...In cases like those, there are often 2 effects...<br>1.The ger will never want to go near man cos it has caused her too much traumatic effect...<br>Usually gers of this type are usually more reserved, conservative and shy in nature<br><br>2.The ger feels "contaminated"...and she is wallowing in self-pity and tries to feel dominant where sex is concerned...Have u heard of a ger raping a guy/.?Well, this might be the type of revenge the ger is seeking.<br><br>Well...the nature of type 2 ger is basically...she is more to the wild character and she is feeling repressed and she want to let it out at one go. She dun care anymore and she wants to just forget what is called values and moral. Most of time, there are horny by Nature.<br><br>In the case of Annabel Chong, she might want to be famous in the wrong way but nevertheless she has the brains and intellect to boost...I mean..without her sex feat, she is going to be only one of the smart geeks pursuing some good studies.<br>So her way of doing things might be different. We dun have a lot of gers who went haywire just becos they got raped. A lot of raped victims went to a lot of counselling and theraphy to help them to lead a normal life.<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One of my JC mates went over to the US for her degree. While she was there, she got drunk and date raped by another Singaporean. She felt very upset about that. Then dunno how she became his girlfriend. So strange. Am I missing something here? (Heard it from another friend.) Or did she feel so worthless about herself that she became the creep's girlfriend. (Also heard he's not a nice guy from another Singaporean studying over there)</div>

I mean she will be too traumatised(someone pls advise me the right spelling) already, and what is the best way to help?<br><br>This is just a qn, not that I'm facing it rite now... lets say the guy is very close to the girl(not BF though), and the girl got raped.

            <div class='col-md body'>Agree with rinoa.. love and patience.. but then again it might backfire sometimes.. too much of "concern" in every matter might make her feel that u're being condescending and that make her more apparent of the situation that she is in.. she might end up hating u or sth..<br><br>I dun know.. i'm not a professional so can only offer my 2 cents worth of comments..</div>
