              <p><strong>Forum Owner's Rights and Responsibilities.</strong> Forum Owners have additional capabilities and responsibilities in regard
              to the members and Content of a Forum. The Owner of a Forum decides whether
              a Forum is restricted to certain members or accessible to the public
              generally, and the Owner may change the access to the Forum at any time.
              In restricted Forums, the Owner decides who may be a member of the Forum
              and can access and change the membership list in his or her sole discretion.
              A Forum Owner may, at any time, transfer his or her ownership of a forum
              to another sgForums.com user. In regard to Content, a Forum Owner shall
              be responsible for the maintenance and monitoring of the Content in the
              Forum, including deleting any Forum, Content or archived Content at any
              time and in his or her discretion.</p>
              <p><strong>Forum Owners Must Mark Sexually Explicit Content.</strong> If you create a Forum
              containing sexually explicit Content that is not suitable for minors,
              you agree to mark the Forum as such. If your Forum contains Content that
              is sexually explicit and you do not mark the Forum appropriately, Jeyel
              shall have the right to delete your Forum, including all messages Posted
              to that Forum.</p>
              <p><strong>Jeyel's Rights.</strong> You acknowledge that Jeyel does not pre-screen, control,
              edit or endorse Content made available through the Service and has no
              obligation to monitor the Content Posted via the Service. If Jeyel discovers
              Content that does not appear to conform to the Terms of Service, Jeyel may
              investigate and determine in good faith and in its sole discretion whether
              to remove the Content. Jeyel will have no liability or responsibility
              for performance or non-performance of such activities. You acknowledge
              that certain Forums available through the Service are available only
              through the Service and others are available both through the Service
              and other sources, such as Usenet, over which Jeyel has absolutely no
              control.</p>
              <p><strong>Content Removal and Archiving.</strong> If you are not the Owner of a Forum, you
              may (1) request removal of a message that you have Posted yourself or
              (2) prevent archival of your message. (For more information about preventing
              archival, please see our
              <a href="http://sgforums.com/info/faq">FAQ</a>.
              You agree to resolve directly and exclusively with third parties any
              disputes you may have about messages that they posted or you may contact
              the Forum Owner to request a removal. In this regard, you understand
              that Jeyel does not monitor or control the content of information Posted
              by others, and instead simply provides a service by allowing users to
              access information that has been made available.</p>
              <h2>6. Appropriate Conduct</h2>

              with
              the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to its 
              conflict
              of laws provisions or your actual state or country of residence. The
              parties agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of

              of Service will continue in full force and effect. You shall not assign 
              these
              Terms of Service or assign any rights or delegate any obligations 
              hereunder,
              in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without
              our prior written consent. Any such purported assignment or delegation
              will be null and void and of no force or effect.</p>
              <p>Without limiting the foregoing, under no circumstances shall Jeyel be
              held liable for any delay or failure in performance resulting directly
              or indirectly from acts of nature, forces, or causes beyond its reasonable
              control, including, without limitation, Internet failures, computer equipment
              failures, telecommunication equipment failures, other equipment failures,
              electrical power failures, strikes, labor disputes, riots, insurrections,
              civil disturbances, shortages of labor or materials, fires, floods, storms,
              explosions, acts of God, war, governmental actions, orders of domestic
              or foreign courts or tribunals, non-performance of third parties, or
              loss of or fluctuations in heat, light, or air conditioning.</p>
              <p>These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and Jeyel
              with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede and replace
              all prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written or
              oral, regarding such subject matter. Any waiver of any provision of the
              Terms of Service by a party will be effective only if in writing and signed
              by a party.</p>
