The purpose of the Bar, i believe, was for more mature adult conversation... i'm sure all of u have at least visited a topic in Bar and u have definitely seen one or two characters who act completely out of immaturity. I do not know what kicks they derive from posting lame and extremely stupid topics. Can forums moderators please do somethin about the bar??? Lets try keepin the bar a place for mature conversation not meant for the ears of lil ones..<br><br></div></blockquote>Examples of weird and lame topics please?<br><br>Or are you as a farmer too used to doing dirty things with animals?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i see a war erupting in here anyway... hey chill.. all of u...<br><br>yea i understand the need for FOS esp in this country of ours... and i understand the limitations mods have when they face such dilemma... i'm not against nonsensical threads (esp being the starter of a couple myself) but i get annoyed, having to sieve thru really tasteless and meaning less threads, often expressions of desperation on the part of the starter of that thread. Just look at all that nonsense in bar..<br><br>but having said all that and having seriously considered the mod's position.. i guess i have to admit.. that if i was a mod myself, i couldn't do much either...<br><br></div>
