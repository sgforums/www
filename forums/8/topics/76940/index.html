            <div class='col-md body'>Before any relationship that turn sour, there is always a triggering factor. This factor is not of one event, it's buildup over a period of time.<br>Every relationship start out sweat, if not how to be a couple. Sometime its this sweatness that blind our sense.<br>Over a period of time, when the couple knows each other better, they get to know their bad side, their way of life, their habit and the abilty to handle complex relationship etc. Anyone of these can became the triggering factor. Over a priod of time, more of this set in thus creating a catalysis effect and the relationship turn sour faster with more qurrel and fight.<br><br>In a successfull relationship, there are always + and -. You take some, he give some or He take some you give some. If anyone of the couple keep taking, the giving party will be very very tired and this turn out to be the couple cannot compromise and failure step in.<br><br>So to give up or to contiues this relationship, it depend on both of you. If either one give refuse to compromise after a <strong>peaceful</strong> talk, my advise is give up, if not, the longer it drag, the more bad feeling is been bottle up and the ending will become very ulgy</div>
