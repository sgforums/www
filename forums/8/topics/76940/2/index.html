Though there are a lot of points i can see upsetting your relationship, there is one i would like to point out.<br><br>Refering to your quote above, i guess that he did listen. It is just that man listen in a different way compared to how woman listen. I feel that most woman use ourselves as a reference, becos when a woman listen, she will feel empathy and validates the feelings of the speaker. A woman who listens do not interrupt the speaker and reply the speaker with responses like "ya, i understand" or "I'm sorry that you feel upset".<br>But a man who listens likes to give solutions (eg. it's no big deal lah, just relax lor, you shouldn't feel upset cos that's not what i mean....) and most of the time, man do not like to hear how upset their girlfriend is because they will take it personally and feel that they are being blamed. Thus, their reply will be very defensive. In this way, a woman will never feel that she's being heard because the response is not the same as what a woman expects when she's heard.<br><br>Actually, there are a lot of couples facing these problems, so you are not alone...<br></div>
