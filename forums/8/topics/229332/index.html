            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Mr Teo Wan Kah, who owned car-parts shops in Singapore and Johor, is believed to have been set upon by three or four masked Chinese men when he drove his 19-year-old girlfriend Â— a mother of one who had recently left her husband Â— back to her apartment after a night of partying.<br><br>At about 4am, Mr Teo and his girlfriend, who works as a nightclub singer, arrived at the car park of the five-storey block of flats in Taman Permas Jaya where she stayed. As the couple walked towards the boot of his modified Mitsubishi sports car to retrieve their belongings, a group of men wearing ski masks approached them with parangs in their hands.<br><br>The couple spilt up and ran off in different directions. The attackers chased Mr Teo while his girlfriend fled to the third storey, from where she witnessed the savage attack.<br><br>According to Malaysian Chinese-language daily Nanyang Siang Pau, Mr Teo's pursuers caught up with him after 50m. He was slashed repeatedly as he ran for another 300m before collapsing on a grass patch.<br><br>The attack continued until the commotion alerted the neighbours. They shouted at the men, who escaped in a blue Malaysian-registered Proton Wira.<br><br>By the time Mr Teo's girlfriend got to him, the back of his head was badly wounded and his left arm had been nearly chopped off.<br><br>She got his lifeless body to the car and drove to a nearby hospital. But Mr Teo was pronounced dead on arrival.<br><br>The fact that Mr Teo's girlfriend was unhurt and their valuables Â— including those in the car Â— were untouched led to speculation that it was a revenge killing.<br><br>The Malaysian police reportedly ruled out robbery. Johor Baru (South) OCPD Assistant Commissioner Shafie Ismail told local newspaper The Star that the case was being investigated as murder.<br><br>After receiving the news yesterday morning, Mr Teo's parents, who live in Yishun, went to Johor to claim the body.<br><br>Speaking to reporters outside the mortuary, Mr Teo's mother said that although their only child Â— who lived on his own Â— seldom visited or called them, he sent them a regular allowance.<br><br>She added: "He had a bad temper, but he is very filial and he cares for the elderly."<br><br>At least three other Singaporeans in the past 13 years have been killed in Malaysian crimes.<br><br>In 1993, a youth having supper in Johor Bahru died after he was attacked by a gang.<br><br>In 1998, a 56-year-old businessman was shot while fending off two robbers in Kuala Lumpur.<br><br>In 2004, IBM executive Patricia Wong Bao Bao was bound and stabbed to death in a hotel room in Kuala Lumpur.</blockquote>Its a gang related crime i suppose. It can happen anyway. If revenge was the motive, even when he was in Singapore he could be murdered.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>The Singaporean who was murdered in Johor on Wednesday in contract-killing fashion was himself suspected to be involved in a murder case here four years ago.<br><br>According to the Singapore police, "the deceased might have been able to assist in an investigation for murder reported in 2003". Sources in the police believe Mr Teo Wan Kah, 29, may have been one of five men sought for the February 2003 murder of a Temasek Polytechnic student in a Chinatown shopping centre.<br><br>Yesterday, the Johor police also suggested that Mr Teo, who owned car spare-parts shops here and in Johor Baru, was a fugitive.<br><br>"He has no documents. We believe he came here illegally. We believe he didn't want to stay in Singapore for certain reasons. He's been here for quite some time, about three years," Johor Criminal Investigation Department chief Ahmad Roslan told TODAY. "To us, he's no businessman."<br><br>However, substantially less information about the killers was available. All Mr Roslan had to say about them was that "they covered their faces. They went prepared".<br><br>Mr Teo was set upon by three or four attackers early on Wednesday morning after a night of partying. He was dropping his 19-year-old girlfriend - a nightclub singer - home, when a group of parang-wielding men attacked the pair at the foot of a five-storey block of flats in Taman Permas Jaya.<br><br>According to the forensics report, Mr Teo had at least 15 knife wounds to his upper body. The back of his head was also badly wounded and his left hand nearly severed.<br><br>Yesterday, a former girlfriend as well as his latest one turned up at the morgue to claim his body. The two women, both Malaysians, wailed at the sight of the body.<br><br>Mr Teo's ex-girlfriend, who had ended their relationship three months earlier, told Chinese newspaper Lianhe Wanbao that the Singaporean was "bad-tempered" and "could have offended some people".<br><br>But relatives at the wake painted a rather different picture of the "Aaron Kwok- look-alike". One of his aunts said he was an "obedient and filial son", while his sister said he had always been there for her.<br><br>Meanwhile, Johor police chief Hussin Ismail told TODAY the reports of crimes in Johor showed just one side of the story.<br><br>"We want cooperation from the public. We are intensifying operations to nab culprits. We're improving our rate of solving. Like any other city of the world, there are crimes, but our response is always quick. Just today, we successfully arrested 14 robbers involved in 30 cases. If you come to our courts, you will see criminals being charged," he said.</blockquote>Wow.. he look like aaron kwok..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>But im very disturbed by the last paragraph...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
