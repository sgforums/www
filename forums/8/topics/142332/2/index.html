There are many kidney patients out there who are not beneficiary of NKF, who needs financial assistance NOW, and who would be very happy to receive our donations.

They have more efficient use of your money than NKF.<br><br>Until Mr Khaw restructures NKF and address the issue of the reserves and admin costs, I'm not giving a cent to NKF.</div>
