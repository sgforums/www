            <div class='col-md body'>put it this way...i understand the need for reserves, saving for that stormy day, or week for that matter, and concerning reserves, the more the merrier. but, what i feel the public is upset about isn't really the reserves, its the transparency, and the use of funds.<br><br>for years now, i've always wondered. in those annual shows, wouldn't it be better to simply donate the amount of money spent on prizes directly to the foundation, instead of using them as gifts in lucky draws? in that case, simple economics would lead you to wonder just how much of your donation dollar actually ends up doing the intented deed. i mean, the cost of production is not cheap, add that to the cost of the prizes, and all the rest of the overheads? i guess you all know what i'm driving at.<br><br>i believe it would be good for the average man-on-the-street to be able to at least know how much of his money is reaching the patients, and how much is spent on overheads. also, as for the salary issue, this may be non-profit, but i still believe in paying as well as possible. it's an added incentive to the workers, and so if we can afford to, lets pay them well as a way of saying thank you for the things that they're doing, and for the sacrifices they make, and you don't get to see. nothing over-the-top, but at least average, or better still, better than average. we tend to have an out-of-sight-out-of-mind mentality...lets change that.</div>
