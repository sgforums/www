Unless he could prove that someone else threw it down the hill instead of him.

He cannot use this as evidence.<br><br>Moreover, what the prosecutors gathered has been a disadvantage to him.  Witnesses saw him talking to her on the night she was missing.  But nobody saw her walking away from him after they talked (He claimed that he only told her to go home and gave her two mangoes).<br><br>Hey, let's talk about this in Huang Na's topic or open a new topic leh.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote></div>
