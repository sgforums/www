So I was responding to that question.<br><br>Is a paedophile supposed to have a paedo look?  Anyway, a person needs not be a paedophile to molest a small girl.  You may ask, then why a non-paedophile chooses to molest a small girl.  Well, it's simple.  Small girl is so young that she may not dare to scream and has little ability to struggle off the attacker.  Besides, even if she struggles or screams, it is so easy for the molestor to finish her off because of her small build.   This is what I believe has happened to her.<br><br>But of course, what I believe is not the verdict lah.  That's why I look forward to the trial to see the outcome.</div>
