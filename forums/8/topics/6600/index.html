            <div class='col-md body'>Ok by Request of Mr. Ng Kai Hoe, I will surmmarise what we the 5 Buayians have discuss this morning over some kopi teh, at Lau Parsat.<br><br><strong>Shitology</strong><br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">I AM A PIECE OF SHIT!</span></strong><br><br>This is what we gathered that you should say to yourself every morning. Why? You might wonder...why should we make ourself go so low to be a piece of shit? Well....if you are a piece of shit...you got nothing to lose...you will be the most formidable....and most invulnerable....for you got nohting to lose! And when that happens...you will do everything within your means to improve your situation....you will be desperatwaye...you will be a savage. That is the type of fighting spirit, the undying nature of a person who adopts <strong>Shitology</strong>. The moment you feel that you are successful...you have everything to lose...you will not want to lose it all...and thus you will no longer fight so hard....you become more or less stagnant in life. For you now have everything to lose. A person who feels that he or she is successful in life will just mean 1 thing. He or she sets to low a target for themselves. Thus no matter what...you must feel like a piece of shit everyday...great people all feels like a piece of shit...and that is what make them the great man they are.<br><br>So remember....Tell yourself, <strong>"I am a piece of shit"</strong> everyday. And be the pioneers in adopting Shitology!<br><br>[This message has been edited by Callan (edited 16 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mr. Ng, I think it would be better if you put up the thesis for the art of seduction. I have yet to totally adsorb what you have said yet. So I can't really put it down in words. So I hand it over to you, to educate the forumites.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Callan (edited 16 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>interesting shit.<br><br>i have some observations.<br>firstly, shitology says that to be successful, u must tell yourself u are shit. but it does not follow that only if you are shitty then you will successful. nor that if u are successful u will be shitty. all it says (i presume) is that shittyness is one impt way to being successful. i hope this delineates the scope of shitology.<br><br>i must be very free.<br>cos here comes another observation.<br>shitology is both flawed and a revelation.<br><br>how is it flawed? only if u are a normal human being will it be flawed. but if you are neurotic and delusional, it works like a charm. for shitology to work, we have to assume global (and not just selective)amnesia. that is, we have to have no long-term nor short-term memory nor can we be lucid in our relations to other people.<br><br>here is what i mean. take an analogy (not a perfect one but just sufficient to make my point):<br><br>for shitology to work, imagine that you are a turtle. from the starting line, you walk (or rather crawl), hoping to get further along, and maybe even reach the finish line (whatever that may be). but if shitology were true, then the turtle has to tell himself that each step he made was really no progress at all. he would have to assume he was still at the starting line (since shitology assumes that you have to be rock bottom to want to make any significant progress) even after taking the first step. at the fifty metre mark, let's say, the turtle would still have to imagine it hadn't moved one step.<br><br>this would mean that tammy the turtle has lost both long-term memory (that the starting line was fifty turtle metres away) and short term memory (that he did indeed take an extra step forward just after lunch).<br><br>with all the encouragement and all the clapping going on at the side lines by fellow turtles and jessica rabbits, tammy would also have to be self-delusional, neurotic and paranoid to think he hadn't moved one step and that all the turtles and rabbits around him were just plain nuts to clap so hard, making mountains out of turtle-pooh.<br><br>in other words, for shitology to work, it would assume a significant disability in normal psychological functioning and thought processing. it would also assume an adversarial model of human (or turtle) relationships.<br><br>so then how is shitology a revelation?<br>well let me try it for two weeks and i'll let you know if it works. but how can it not work? if i report no progress, because i take shitology seriously, then it remains possible that it was a success (but i won't remember it). if i report progress then shitology will naturally be a success (tho i have to quickly forget it is a success once i report it). so shitology is a success because either way it really works! shitology really can lead to success you'll never know about - literally!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>tell me what you think of this load of crap.<br><br>[This message has been edited by ray (edited 17 March 2000).]</div>
