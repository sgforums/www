            <div class='col-md body'>I would love to challenge the idea of 'diploma is the minum in SG'. Seriously, who said that? The most basic thing that one need to succeed in any career is their attitude....If your attitude sux big time...even if you are a NUS grad, I dont think anyone will employ you. Besides, do you know why now even a diploma cant get jobs? Simple, they are simply choosy....They just 'think' that with their cert, they should get a better job...not knowing what age they are in now...(infomation age btw)<br><br>If you really have no intrest in study, I advice you to get a job you really like, work on your skills you are intrested in and most importantly your attitude....<br><br>Lastly, The 'study hard, get good grades so you can get a better job/pay' simply is outdated...acadmic grades has nothing to do  with how far you really go in life...Attitude does.......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Apple. Well actually you want to find a job with an ite cert is possible. The downside is that it will be more difficult and the prospect and the pay will not be good.<br><br>Some "people" of course are just contented with three meals and a roof over their heads. But I personally feel that this is the wrong kind of mindset to have. Because if you accept your "fate", your children later in life will have to suffer for it. Unfair advantages and I don't think I need to go into details. You will end up not having done anything for "yourself" or your next generation.<br><br>A diploma seems to be the minimum but don't forget more and more of our population is jumping on the degree bandwagon. I will soon too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> So from a realistic viewpoint, the employers will definetely choose degree holders if they think "they can get away with it". Its a mindset problem too actually. They have I also want. And of course there is aslo the fact that they have the no degree sure cannot do the the job mindset. The question is how many entrepreneur start off with degree!!!!! As long as society denies you the chance to gain experience and learn, you are pretty well "stuck".<br><br>But the downside again is that if this kind of trend continues, who can say that by 20 years down the road we won't end up like "certian" european countries. Degree holders also cannot find jobs and end up being sales people or cleaners! By then everyone in SG will suffer but it will be too late.<br><br>So yes I think you NEED that paper if you want a "better life" for yourself or the other alternative is to set up your own small enterprise. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Destinyapple:</div><div class="quote_body">hmm guys ask u hoh..isit realli even a dipolma also veri hard to find a job ah??hmm then if nitec cert isit much more worst..cant find any jobs??i now jus gradutate from ITE..my result not tht gd and i hav no interest study but alot ppl tell mi to study more..cos diploma is the mininum in singapore..but i heard from u guys with dipolma also cant find jobs..haizz..sg damm sux..</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Then what to do??? How??? How??? How to survive??<br><br>Remember,<br><br>Making money is not abt getting good education n then your life is set.<br><br>HAving a brain washed mindset of "Depending on education, to get a job for money", u r deemed to be a failure in life.<br><br>U don't even need PSLE to spot opportunities to make money.<br><br>Make all kind of moneys everywhere.<br><br>Can u repair computers? freelance?<br><br>R u well networked? Find buyers n sellers? Make a small commissions in between.<br><br>The minute u can force your brain to stop using education to earn money... u will start to feel life is easier.<br><br>To be successful , depends alot of your network. What type of families n environment do u come from?<br><br>U see, even degree holders who come from poor families, may get a job .. but he will end up a nobody sooner or later. becos of his poor friends working class network.<br><br>If u want to be rich , network with the rich. U see, when rich kids who got only "N' level, but he end up making millions.. becos of his rich ppl network.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the new wave is online business. Tap your money from overseas. U don't need a degree to do business. Work for food temporarily, but don't forget your journey is to able to survive on your own, n not depends on others for a job.<br><br>Those still hiding in the cage (office n jobs), wait till the employers kick them out on the streets... then they start to learn how to live on the streets. Learn to be a stray dog , once u master the art of a stray... n able to survive  on the street... U will hav a peace of mind.<br><br>Attend seminars n network with the ppl.<br><br>Ppl go to sch spending yrs to get a cert..  becos they need a security of a cert to LOOK for JOB. the ppl u find here r workers mindset.<br><br>PPl who spend money to attend seminars, want results not certs. They attend to learn, so to apply immediately on setting up business  or find partners..</div>
