              <p>the australians are too glad to get me in...............they said i had leadership and could solve complex problems in australian production lines.even the female and male vietnamese saw me repair their machinery that was spoilt for 6 months and the aussies could not fix it. yes,i fixed the machinery in front of 4 vietnamese ,2 aussie safety officers,1 aussie supervisor and 2 aussie workers.i fixed it and it worked well and they were so glad and happy.even the chief engineer in australia cant solve it for many months!!it took me only 20 minutes to take out 7 components,,,check all the electrical problems and replaced the suspected component back.everyone was happy,,,the vietnamese guys smiled at me in relief as they had to pull the extremely heavy machine up with 3 other guys.the vietnamese chiobu helped me turn on power and think i made a few good vietnamese galfrends too....the ang mo were very happy with me!!!if this was a simple nut n screw problem then the ang mo might just be able to fix it!!!!this is more than a screw or mechanical job.as in spore....if u were to fix a screw n nut job...most probably u would have lost that job a long time.</p>
              <p>I AM A great PROBLEM SOLVER BACK IN SINGAPORE AND IN AUSTRALIA.AND IF U WANT TO MOLD ME AS A PROBLEM MAKER.....U CAN DRINK YER NEWWATER OR PISS WATER AND TRY TO CONSOLE YERSELF THAT U ARE THE BEST!</p>

              <p>we would notice it as the months come into progress. weather would be changed theoretically.people would burn or freeze as from experiments done in space concerning planet.</p>
              <p>from the earthquakes done so far on earth it managed to shift the orbit slightly but if the force equations are correct in the first place it would mean a bigger impact if an explosion of matter was done in space which would mean another kind of force will be made if the nuclear bomb was big enough.however another new set of unknown space physics might happen too from creation of black holes which would be more dangerous than an island thrown onto planet earth from above to perhaps total failure of  earths orbit system.</p>
              <p>the above is just a good theory not something to lock a person up in IMH in some mental hospital.if that were to be the case then all the scientists over the world would be crucified on stakes by singaporeans and the world would be as primitive as the stone age.</p>
              <p>ah well.....most people here only want to be spoon fed with evidence.....facts thats above state oif the art.</p>
              <p>thank god i immigrated.......and im more happier in oz but i still complain due to lack of progress.THAT SIR! IS THE WAY OF THE WARRIOR!TO COMPLAIN ,TO ENSURE FEEDBACK AND IMPROVE.SO I SIT BACK IN OZ...COLLECT MY MONEY AND WATCH THE SUNSET AND CONTINUE ON MY OWN UNFINISHED SCIENCE PROJECTS.</p>
              <p>THE REST WHO WANT EVERYTHING TO BE SPOON FED AND THOUGHT OUT FOR THEM ARE INVALIDS IN WHEELCHAIRS....HAWKINGS IS DIFFERENT...HE HAS A BRAIN ON A WHEELCHAIR.</p>

              <p>OH WELL...I GUESS IM LUCKY.I DONT NEED TO WORRY ABOUT MY MONEY OR FOOD ......AND THE PEOPLE IN OZ SMILE KINDLY AT ME ESPECIALLY THE ANG MO GIRLS AND THE PAY HERE IS $50K/YR .HMMMMMM.....DOES THAT SOUND LIKE LIKE A THIRD CLASS CITIZEN?ACTUALLY IN SPORE I FEEL WORSE THAN ANYTHING......DUE TO THE UGLY RUDE PEOPLE THERE.I ONLY HATE THE PEOPLE I WERK WIV IN OZ......LIKE I HATE THE PEOPLE IN SPORE I WERK IN SPORE.NOTHING NEW!</p>
              <p>SO WHY WOULD SOME ANIMAL SAY IM TREATED LIKE A THIRD CLASS CITIZEN?IM AS HAPPY IN OZ AS THE OTHER EX SINGAPOREAN P.R.S WHO WERE FROM INDIA.THEY THREW AWAY THEIR SPORE P.R. STATUS AT CHANGI AIRPORT RUBBISH  BIN.I JUST WANT PROGRESS.....JUST LIKE MY SCIENCE THEORY.</p>

              <p>but considered that .....</p>
              <p>to generate an artificial compression in space create an artificial gravity by pulling others space objects into the temporary distortion gravity and the new orbit will also distorted the current path of planets and moons, space rocks orbiting the solar system.</p>
              <p>We might in the process escalating an unintended consequences of near Earth Asteroids collide with the Planet.   </p>
              <p>Although astronomical time planet Earth is stil relatively young there might be the big one that has Planet Earth names on it. I do not think we fully understand the knowledge in the Universe to understand some of the consequences of moving the Orbit.</p>

              <p>to move an object in space ,,,a initial force seems to be the case as in asteroids and space shuttle experiments in space.and seems like there is some kinda solar winds in outer space that tend to push metal onto space stations</p>
              <p>as the various planets orbit around the sun.....there might be some magnetic pull around it...but what if this force was initiated from the beginin of time and the force so great its still rotating,,,whats n where is the source of this orbit motion?its like some kind of wave motion thats pushing the planets in space.we know the moon has not much gravity and its still orbitin so the main source of  orbit is  posiibly like a water basin filled with ice cubes and each moving in its direction from the  gentlecurrents thats pushing it.but where does this waves or currents come from??the wind?circulation of air currents due to atmoospheric action which in turn depends on space rotation onto planet.so it all depends on space....if we threw a ball into basin with the ice..it will shift and depending on force direction made...it will be nearer or further away from the sun as to centre of the basin</p>
              <p>astronomically earth might be young but it can be accelerated into a dead planet with knowledge in hands of buffons and mad men.</p>
              <p>in outer space experiments done by astronauts.....alot seems to resemble where a body in space seems to float in intended path unless acted upon by another force.so it would apply if a nuclear explosion happens to space.as such we know very little about space and only theories can be made as not enough experiments have neen done in outer space.but if outer space was to be like water and if we were to explode a bomb under water,,,,,air bubbles would be seen along with tsunamis.the mass thats created to form air in water by seperating hydriogen and oxygen in water would give a replica of the atmosphere like conditions under water .but what about space....its essentially a vaccum with no hydrogen or oxygen to seperate......so how do u seperate a vacuum in order to propel something like a planet in space thus changing its orbit as well?</p>
              <p>if a vaccum was like a bed mattress,,it would be seperated  by a great force and push stuff away.....but a vaccum is less denser than a mattress so it should by right would need less force to propel it...rather like a negative force in space in order to propel stuff out there!then that would mean a vacuum bomb in order to have a negative force effect in order to change a orbit of a planet effectively..............</p>
              <p> but then from the above.....what about air??could i move effectively in the air by a bomb that implodes a force than explodes a force out in air?</p>

              <p>so if i were to put a vaccum cleaner and a  ping pong ball.....it would move harder as that would have less of a medium to work......as a same blower power to push it.</p>
              <p>but i bet they would work well in denser mediun such as water</p>
              <p>but space has no air or anything to push it...so hows the force going to be made on it apart from  powerful; rockets to push tons of materiasl.??</p>

              <p>needs a matter engine thats able to push densematter and propel me at rthe samed time in outer space.</p>
              <p>the current propulsion on earth is actually pushing molecules of air from a thrust source which seems inefficient.source may be just less dense air....however if the air became denser like ice or water at that spot then there would be more speed as it would be pushed on that layer of dense material every step of the way.so a jet on that material every mm would propel it very fast like a magnetism on a meagnetic train.only difference is the magnet is ice and the force is still rocket in nature at a very close rangebut the dense material could be forced denser material from a water source or some readily availiable source.</p>
              <p>hmmmm...just to change the orbit.</p>
