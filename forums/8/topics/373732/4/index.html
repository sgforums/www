              <p>I say it is not worth it for you to take a degree from local
              university as it takes 5 years from JC to university and you lose 5
              years of income during these period and you spend alot of
              money.</p>
              <p>But if you take WDA degree, it is around 2 years time which is
              very short and cheap too so is a different scenario all

              <p>TS, you do noe that some careers you need paperwork(at least a diploma) rite?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>An example of this is the industry of Public Relations... An O leveler would NOT be able to do this even if he/she were to go to WDA, coz PR is a course taught in Poly and specialised in Uni.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When one comes out of a PR course in Poly, and goes to the industry, working in a blue-chip company, his average starting pay w/o bonus would be $2.5K(+ -$300) in Singapore Airlines and $2.4K(+ -$200) in Singtel.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That compared to the three years of increments if starting from the figure u stated on the first page($1.7~K), would still beat that payout.</p>

              <p>i think its best to study while you work</p>
              <p>like you enter the workforce after your olevels and take those private courses (those can very easy to get in ) and within  5 years, you be armed with a degree and in the same time, you still get paid and workig experience while mugging for that degree</p>
              <p>Many olevel holders have pursued degrees not simply for job sake but to have higher income earning capabilities and to climb the corporate ladders, not just to get the paper qualifications</p>
              <p>I dont see any difference between olevel holders and degree holders , just that the latter gets more while the former would need to work more years to reach that level (unless midway, they decided to upgrade their skills)</p>
              <p>nowadays, very few people will stick to their olevel certification and refuse to upgrade for the rest of their working life. Some who cant afford to do a degree or dont have the capabilities would also go and get a diploma or higher diploma or something.</p>

              <p>Automator, I share with you about myself</p>
              <p>Because I went through the JC route, I could teach tuition well
              during army and uni.</p>
              <p>So right after uni,</p>
              <p>Salary is not $2.2k. It's &gt;$3k. And do include year end AWS
              and bonuses into calculations.</p>
              <p>And because of my uni degree, I can charge a slight premium for
              tuition, especially when I teach JC. Currently, tuition income is
              on average &gt;$4k. Only thing is, I started this year only,
              because I need to make sure my job scope, etc, before I start
              anything as major as this.</p>
              <p>During uni, because I focus on getting a first class, I didn't
              teach so much. Varies between $400 to $1k for the first 2 years cuz
              the courses were easier. Then did industrial attachement, which
              pays about $800 per month for a semester.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, study well and you can be like me to achieve a
              scholarship as well, so uni fees are paid plus get allowance as
              well.</p>
              <p>Also, do take into account that transport fees paid by a student
              is likely lesser, not to mention many student discounts when you go
              eat at places. In fact, travel fees in Europe are also discounted,
              especially when you go travel because of student exchange
              programmes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So with the above, I graduated with about $50k in savings, of
              course with $24k debt in CPF loan, cuz I didn't use the scholarship
              money to pay the CPF debt. Not a lot though... Forumers like
              soul_rage managed $100k I believe.</p>
              <p>With the savings, I put into certain blue chips which yield me
              nearly 6~7% p.a. in dividend yield, instead of paying back CPF,
              which charges interest of only 2.6%. Earn from the interest.</p>
              <p>And now, after having graduated in May 08, I'm almost reaching
              my first 100k in savings and equities (exclude unrealised gains)
              soon. I'm now aiming for the 2nd 100k by end of next year. But with
              $17k debt of CPF loan left at the moment... Clearing at about $1k
              to $1.5k a month after my tuition income took off...</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>And again, what is the possibility of that?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>More likely, you realise you have a cock for a boss and go somewhere else to look for a job in ur industry that suits you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are you really going to stick wif a boss u dun like becoz he doesn't ever give u a raise? Singapore is performance-based economy. I'm very sure employers give raises on performance. You seem quite out of touch with the industry.</p>

              <p>Sometimes I still get into contact with my ex ploy classmates, cousins etc and many of them say that they chose the wrong course in poly/university.</p>
              <p>It is just a general meeting between old classamtes who drink coffee to catch up with each other. It is not a job interview where people give politically correct answers.</p>
              <p>Why should they lie to you?</p>
