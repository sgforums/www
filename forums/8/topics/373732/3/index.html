              <p>Hi TS</p>
              <p>What you said is very true. I agree with you whole 101%.
              The 5 mins browsing through your posts had enlightened me, much more
              than the many years spent studying. You have made your point.</p>
              <p>My friend only Primary 8 education (The old system, where there are primary 7 and primary 8). He's now 34, driving a merc, owns 2 zi-char store, and submitted income tax of about $11K per month. Just how many people who studies deg, etc earns that kid of monies at 34? However he is stupid now, pushing his two kids to tuition after school, wanting them to proceed to university and even higher if possible. I think cooking too much sambal fried rice had fried his brain.</p>
              <p>You are right TS, my friend. We should not study. Those who are in JC, poly, ITE, uni, please quit. You're wasting time studying and incurring debt losing the opportunity cost to O level graduates.</p>

              <p>Hi TS</p>
              <p>What you said is very true. I agree with you whole 101%. The 5
              mins browsing through your posts had enlightened me, much more than
              the many years spent studying. You have made your point.</p>
              <p>My friend only Primary 8 education (The old system, where there
              are primary 7 and primary 8). He's now 34, driving a merc, owns 2
              zi-char store, and submitted income tax of about $11K per month.
              Just how many people who studies deg, etc earns that kid of monies
              at 34? However he is stupid now, pushing his two kids to tuition
              after school, wanting them to proceed to university and even higher
              if possible. I think cooking too much sambal fried rice had fried
              his brain.</p>
              <p>You are right TS, my friend. We should not study. Those who are
              in JC, poly, ITE, uni, please quit. You're wasting time studying
              and incurring debt losing the opportunity cost to O level
              graduates.</p>

              <p>I heard later he went to do some other business, and sold the chicken rice business to one of his employee.... Months later, I see this employee turned boss driving another merc...</p>

              <p>Okay lah, it all depends on which industry you want to excel in.
              Certain industry you can succeed career-wise without a
              diploma/degree, while some requires that niche knowledge you gain
              from a University laden background.<br> <br> Btw, please continue studying kids, but if opportunity jumps at
              you, grab them!! <strong>Don't ever stop educating
              yourselves</strong>, which this thread title might be 'mislead' or
              'misconstrued' to believe against, but if you're like me, do grasp
              with an open mind (whereby there's no right or wrong answer..) the
              rationale of TS's idea, and probably then you'll 'see' the lighter
