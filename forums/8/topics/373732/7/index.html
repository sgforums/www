              <p>i think in todays business enviornment and cost of higher education. A basic degree is enough. Unless you want a drastics career changed than perharps a Master will be a way out.

              <p><br>I think MBA or PhD is for credential sake, most end up in teaching or lecturing, hardly are they able to suit into corporate business,..especially the PhD peoples. On the hand, with this credential, they can get a better loan for a start up. But after a PhD start to drive taxi, the banks will have doubt in them.</p>

              <p>10 Singaporean bosses in singapore, 5 are just o level or diploma, 3 got no formal education at all, maybe only 2 are degree or MBA and above. Our education system taught us to be workers, straight jacket adminstrator, they failed to train shrewd business people.</p>

              <p><br>I think MBA or PhD is for credential sake, most end up in teaching or lecturing, hardly are they able to suit into corporate business,..especially the PhD peoples. On the hand, with this credential, they can get a better loan for a start up. But after a PhD start to drive taxi, the banks will have doubt in them.</p>

              <p>10 Singaporean bosses in singapore, 5 are just o level or diploma, 3 got no formal education at all, maybe only 2 are degree or MBA and above. Our education system taught us to be workers, straight jacket adminstrator, they failed to train shrewd business people.</p>

              <p>Here is a simple comparison between a O level graduate, diploma and degree graduate to prove that it is not worth spending so much time and money to study.</p>
              <p>We shall take a starting pay of $1200 for O level graduate who work as Admin Assistant and give her a 1 month bonus and $100 pay increment every year.</p>
              <p>During the 3 years that you take to get a diploma from the polytechnic you will have incureed a cost of $6000 school fees (after government subsidy) and you will have lost 3 years of income as compared to a O level graduate who works during the 3 years that you are studying,</p>
              <p>The O level graduate who is a admin assistant will have earned this amount in the 3 years that you spend taking a diploma</p>
              <p>1st year: $1200*13 months(including bonus)= $15 600</p>
              <p>2nd year: $1300(assuming a $100 increment for every year that he works)*13 months= $ 16 900</p>
              <p>3rd year: $1400 * 13 months= $18 200.</p>
              <p>In 3 years time, she will have earned $15 600+ $16 900 + $18 200= $50 700.</p>
              <p>And in 3 years time due to outstanding performance she got promoted to Admin Executive and given a $300 pay increment and her salary is now $1700 a month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A fresh diploma holder starts off as a Admin Executive drawing a salary of $1700. Both of them earns the same amount of salary but the O level graduate has worked for 3 years and during this period she have earned $50 700. Plus the diploma holder have spended $6000 on her school fees.</p>
              <p>Note that this amount has not include the cpf portion of her employer contribution during the 3 years that she has worked. If we include in this amount it will be higher.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Clearly the O level graduate is at a advantage as compared to the diploma holder.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now we compare a degree holder who took 5 years to get a degree( 2 years in JC and 3 years in university) with the O level graduate.</p>
              <p>Starting from the 4 year onwards, the O level graduate who is now a Admin Executive earns $1700 a month.</p>
              <p>4th year: $1700*13 months= $22 100</p>
              <p>5th year: $1800*13 months= $23 400</p>
              <p>At the end of the 5 years, the O level graduate Admin Exceutive will have earned $50 700+ $22 100+ $23 400= $96 200. Her salary at that time will be $1800 a month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The university graduate let us give her a salary of $2200 a month. Wow not bad sia she earns $400 a month more than the O level graduate.</p>
              <p>But wait. during the 5 years that she took to get a degree, the O level graduate have already earned $96 200.</p>
              <p>You go and calculate how long must this university graduate work than she can earn back the loss of $96 200 income that she loss in these 5 years. Not to mention, she started off with a net loss of $30 000( calculated by using $10 000 a year school fee multiply by 3 years course fee. And $10 000 a year school fee is already considered cheap. Some university courses costs more than $10 000 a year).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So after this calculation, you say whether is it worth it to take a degree or diploma anot? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>it is possible to put forward a framework of reasons and values to justify almost any choice of lifestyle. if u choose your perception, choose your values and choose your information, you can defend almost any point of view.</p>
              <p>one of the prime duties that wisdom is call upon to perform is to cope with now and then.</p>
              <p>the youngster drops out of school to earns good money and to have a less boring time. that is now. later the earning capacity of that youngster is substaintially below that of his classmates who got more education. that is then</p>

              <p>i think the basic min is diploma.. at least diploma is better than O level.</p>
              <p>When you know what field you are interested then go for the degree. Than that is value for money and worth your time..</p>
              <p>Example. My brother failed his O level come out work.. feel so bad cos no one actually appreciate his hard work.. so take a HR diploma. Then he recognise that HR there is prospect and interest.. so he go for degree.</p>
