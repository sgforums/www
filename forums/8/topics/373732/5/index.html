              <p> </p>
              <p>More likely, you realise you have a cock for a boss and go
              somewhere else to look for a job in ur industry that suits you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are you really going to stick wif a boss u dun like becoz he
              doesn't ever give u a raise? Singapore is performance-based
              economy. I'm very sure employers give raises on performance. You
              seem quite out of touch with the industry.</p>

              <p>Possibility is very high because of office politics.</p>
              <p>Most bosses are not even in the office and they never see you doing your work. They get the feedback from your direct superiors and if your direct superiors don't like you than that is it.</p>

              <p>yeah but no income yet we do. As mention uni students can teach tuition, get holiday jobs, work in sch etc and earn abit of pocket money. Thats including the 4 months break which we can just teach tuition which is a few hrs a week getting plenty of rest yet still earn something and not be penniless like you if you were to not work at all.</p>
              <p>Its not hard for students to make money these days and more and more are working part time etc during their studies.</p>

              <p>education is still nevertheless important, it helps us to know things which we have not known of before. </p>
              <p>it is in college where we are exposed to a myriad of subjects which we would not be able to access if we are outside school. </p>
              <p>the main point of your argument, automator, is that you are arguing that it's pretty pointless to further our studies by bringing up the practical points, in this case, earning more money. </p>
              <p>i can say that if we were to study on our own time and through our initiative( as you pointed out earlier ), we would be losing the skills and innovation which is driving our local companies forward, and Singapore would spiral downwards to no end,</p>
              <p>our economy will subsequently lag behind our closest neighbours in terms of GDP growth, our National Budget will be nothing more like useless as there is no point in attracting MNC's which favour a highly educated workforce</p>
              <p>Singapore is highly dependent on these foreign companies which help to pump blood into the economy, even the companys we are all working for depends on foreign money to survive, and they require the skills and know-how, where the more valuable ones can only be gained through higher learning. </p>
              <p>Besides, i can see that you brought up this topic because most of what we learn from school cannot be applied to real life , yes / no? </p>
              <p>it is true in some cases, however, the individuals in question have at least attained a higher learning and their academic endeavour is for the employer to judge. </p>

              <p>Most degree holders just work their normal job and their only

              <p>Blue chips? Play safe way is to invest in dividend stocks like SPH... Won't grow much, but won't collapse. 6~7% yield is easy in this economic climate because prices are depressed. I put it here cuz the money is supposed to be for my sch fees. But now with a sufficient base in defensive dividend stocks, I'm slowly moving towards trading and growth stocks... I use a lot of fibonacci analysis, which is a lot of mathematical calculations.</p>
              <p>Expensive tuition? Some of my students were still telling me I charge too cheap... It's not expensive at all... How to earn is using this equation: time * money per hour * multiplication factor...</p>
              <p>My time * tuition students payment * number of students per group  (I teach grp tuition)<br>This type of thing, not necessary in tuition; there are many other ways in which you can do it... i.e. feng shui master, etc... It depends on your speciality...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course, I'm still holding a normal degree job like most other degree holders, to serve my bond, and to hope for an increase in income.</p>
