              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Here is a simple comparison between a O level graduate, diploma
              and degree graduate to prove that it is not worth spending so much
              time and money to study.</p>
              <p>We shall take a starting pay of $1200 for O level graduate who
              work as Admin Assistant and give her a 1 month bonus and $100 pay
              increment every year.</p>
              <p>During the 3 years that you take to get a diploma from the
              polytechnic you will have incureed a cost of $6000 school fees
              (after government subsidy) and you will have lost 3 years of income
              as compared to a O level graduate who works during the 3 years that
              you are studying,</p>
              <p>The O level graduate who is a admin assistant will have earned
              this amount in the 3 years that you spend taking a diploma</p>
              <p>1st year: $1200*13 months(including bonus)= $15 600</p>
              <p>2nd year: $1300(assuming a $100 increment for every year that he
              works)*13 months= $ 16 900</p>
              <p>3rd year: $1400 * 13 months= $18 200.</p>
              <p>In 3 years time, she will have earned $15 600+ $16 900 + $18
              200= $50 700.</p>
              <p>And in 3 years time due to outstanding performance she got
              promoted to Admin Executive and given a $300 pay increment and her
              salary is now $1700 a month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A fresh diploma holder starts off as a Admin Executive drawing a
              salary of $1700. Both of them earns the same amount of salary but
              the O level graduate has worked for 3 years and during this period
              she have earned $50 700. Plus the diploma holder have spended $6000
              on her school fees.</p>
              <p>Note that this amount has not include the cpf portion of her
              employer contribution during the 3 years that she has worked. If we
              include in this amount it will be higher.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Clearly the O level graduate is at a advantage as compared to
              the diploma holder.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now we compare a degree holder who took 5 years to get a degree(
              2 years in JC and 3 years in university) with the O level
              graduate.</p>
              <p>Starting from the 4 year onwards, the O level graduate who is
              now a Admin Executive earns $1700 a month.</p>
              <p>4th year: $1700*13 months= $22 100</p>
              <p>5th year: $1800*13 months= $23 400</p>
              <p>At the end of the 5 years, the O level graduate Admin Exceutive
              will have earned $50 700+ $22 100+ $23 400= $96 200. Her salary at
              that time will be $1800 a month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The university graduate let us give her a salary of $2200 a
              month. Wow not bad sia she earns $400 a month more than the O level
              graduate.</p>
              <p>But wait. during the 5 years that she took to get a degree, the
              O level graduate have already earned $96 200.</p>
              <p>You go and calculate how long must this university graduate work
              than she can earn back the loss of $96 200 income that she loss in
              these 5 years. Not to mention, she started off with a net loss of
              $30 000( calculated by using $10 000 a year school fee multiply by
              3 years course fee. And $10 000 a year school fee is already
              considered cheap. Some university courses costs more than $10 000 a
              year).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So after this calculation, you say whether is it worth it to
              take a degree or diploma anot? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Automator has some good points. The 'O-level' does has a head-start in the working environment, which includes networking early and amassing CPF early, but not limited to these two examples. Of course, the he/she will have to be a diligent worker and continually upgrading his own skills.<br><br>Definitely if the 'O-level' worker is someone who simply works without upgrading himself, then most probably he won't be able to attain the advantage as proposed originally by Automator -- it takes determination and hard work indeed.<br><br>Myself, I've met numerous people with barely any higher than O-level education background (some no O cert even) who are pretty successful in what they do and they can be anywhere in mid to top level management, due to the experience that they bring to the workplace, and most bosses value these people in high regards.<br><br>If there is one obvious flaw (I don't like this word but I can't find a better term at the moment..) that these 'no-higher-than-O-level-education' possess would be their grasp, or the lack of, of the English language / Mathematical understanding. But of course, there are academic graduates who amply fill up these gaps.<br><br>This is mostly evident in SMEs and family-owned businesses whereby experience and personal character are appreciated, and where most definitely you can't compare this situation within a highly skilled work environment such as a Biotechnology/Engineering firm where a Skilled Graduate would certainly be hand-picked with instead.<br><br>Anyway, to refrain from attaining the award of longest <strong>first </strong>reply post ever in SGForums (is there any???), I suppose I wouldn't be entirely wrong to assume that, based on Automater's 'ideal' scenario, an O-level worker would have already received an insurmountable financial revenue head-start if compared to a top-level cert holder in his initial working era.<br><br>Heh. Just my prolonged 2 cents~</p></div>

              have a better demand than someone without. The yearly statistics
              shows that uni grads have 80-90% hiring rate within the first 6
              months of graduation, can you find a similar high % for O's

              <p>Insurance, property agent etc earns depending on how well they
              can speak and sell their products. Not everyone is capable of that.
              If you want to talk about such minorities, why don't you talk about
              uni grads that earns 5k or more a month? $2.2k for a uni undergrad

              <p>Hi all, I would like to give my take also.</p>
              <p>The flaw in the calculations are as follows:</p>
              <p>1. O level's career/salary curve against time is very different
              from Degree's career/salary curve. i.e. one is linear and stagnant,
              while the other is exponentiallly up and then linear.</p>
              <p>2. O levels will be stuck at Asst. Manager as his/her max.
              potential usually, whereas Degree can be promoted up to close to
              Director/Senior Manager, this will provide huge salary
              differences.</p>
              <p>Salary structure for most organization are also exponential.
              e.g. Admin asst: $1200, Admin Exec: $1700, Asst Manager: $2200,
              Manager: $3000, Senior Manager: $4000+, Deputy Director: $6000,
              Director: $8000.</p>
              <p>From this example you can see that as one climbs in
              rank/position the salary is exponentially increasing. Same in army
              also, e.g. 3SG: $2200, SSG: $3800, LTA: $3200, CPT: $5000, MAG:
              $6000, LTC: $8000, COL:$10,000 etc.</p>
              <p>3. In bad times, those that get retrenched are always the rank
              &amp; file personnel, i.e. production workers, assistants etc, cuz
              the bigger shots holds more responsibility and is considered a
              talent.</p>
              <p>4. More opportunities abound when you are at a higher
              position/rank or with a good degree etc, people headhunt you, you
              get to travel overseas for meeting etc. Nobody will headhunt an
              admin exec/asst, or ask an admin asst to travel to Europe for
              conference.</p>

              <p>It depends on what type of jobs they apply for.</p>
