              <p>Here is a simple comparison between a O level graduate, diploma
              and degree graduate to prove that it is not worth spending so much
              time and money to study.</p>
              <p>We shall take a starting pay of $1200 for O level graduate who
              work as Admin Assistant and give her a 1 month bonus and $100 pay
              increment every year.</p>
              <p>During the 3 years that you take to get a diploma from the
              polytechnic you will have incureed a cost of $6000 school fees
              (after government subsidy) and you will have lost 3 years of income
              as compared to a O level graduate who works during the 3 years that
              you are studying,</p>
              <p>The O level graduate who is a admin assistant will have earned
              this amount in the 3 years that you spend taking a diploma</p>
              <p>1st year: $1200*13 months(including bonus)= $15 600</p>
              <p>2nd year: $1300(assuming a $100 increment for every year that he
              works)*13 months= $ 16 900</p>
              <p>3rd year: $1400 * 13 months= $18 200.</p>
              <p>In 3 years time, she will have earned $15 600+ $16 900 + $18
              200= $50 700.</p>
              <p>And in 3 years time due to outstanding performance she got
              promoted to Admin Executive and given a $300 pay increment and her
              salary is now $1700 a month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A fresh diploma holder starts off as a Admin Executive drawing a
              salary of $1700. Both of them earns the same amount of salary but
              the O level graduate has worked for 3 years and during this period
              she have earned $50 700. Plus the diploma holder have spended $6000
              on her school fees.</p>
              <p>Note that this amount has not include the cpf portion of her
              employer contribution during the 3 years that she has worked. If we
              include in this amount it will be higher.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Clearly the O level graduate is at a advantage as compared to
              the diploma holder.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now we compare a degree holder who took 5 years to get a degree(
              2 years in JC and 3 years in university) with the O level
              graduate.</p>
              <p>Starting from the 4 year onwards, the O level graduate who is
              now a Admin Executive earns $1700 a month.</p>
              <p>4th year: $1700*13 months= $22 100</p>
              <p>5th year: $1800*13 months= $23 400</p>
              <p>At the end of the 5 years, the O level graduate Admin Exceutive
              will have earned $50 700+ $22 100+ $23 400= $96 200. Her salary at
              that time will be $1800 a month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The university graduate let us give her a salary of $2200 a
              month. Wow not bad sia she earns $400 a month more than the O level
              graduate.</p>
              <p>But wait. during the 5 years that she took to get a degree, the
              O level graduate have already earned $96 200.</p>
              <p>You go and calculate how long must this university graduate work
              than she can earn back the loss of $96 200 income that she loss in
              these 5 years. Not to mention, she started off with a net loss of
              $30 000( calculated by using $10 000 a year school fee multiply by
              3 years course fee. And $10 000 a year school fee is already
              considered cheap. Some university courses costs more than $10 000 a
              year).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So after this calculation, you say whether is it worth it to
              take a degree or diploma anot? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>ya cannot compare. Working life of a degree holder cannot compare with life of an o level. As an O level u may have to slog ur life working 5.5 days per week to earn that precious 1200.</p>

              <p>And in 3 years time due to outstanding performance she got
              promoted to Admin Executive and given a $300 pay increment and her
              salary is now $1700 a month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A fresh diploma holder starts off as a Admin Executive drawing a
              salary of $1700. Both of them earns the same amount of salary but
              the O level graduate has worked for 3 years and during this period
              she have earned $50 700. Plus the diploma holder have spended $6000
              on her school fees.</p>
              <p>Note that this amount has not include the cpf portion of her
              employer contribution during the 3 years that she has worked. If we
              include in this amount it will be higher.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Clearly the O level graduate is at a advantage as compared to
              the diploma holder.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now we compare a degree holder who took 5 years to get a degree(
              2 years in JC and 3 years in university) with the O level
              graduate.</p>
              <p>Starting from the 4 year onwards, the O level graduate who is
              now a Admin Executive earns $1700 a month.</p>
              <p>4th year: $1700*13 months= $22 100</p>
              <p>5th year: $1800*13 months= $23 400</p>
              <p>At the end of the 5 years, the O level graduate Admin Exceutive
              will have earned $50 700+ $22 100+ $23 400= $96 200. Her salary at
              that time will be $1800 a month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The university graduate let us give her a salary of $2200 a
              month. Wow not bad sia she earns $400 a month more than the O level
              graduate.</p>
              <p>But wait. during the 5 years that she took to get a degree, the
              O level graduate have already earned $96 200.</p>
              <p>You go and calculate how long must this university graduate work
              than she can earn back the loss of $96 200 income that she loss in
              these 5 years. Not to mention, she started off with a net loss of
              $30 000( calculated by using $10 000 a year school fee multiply by
              3 years course fee. And $10 000 a year school fee is already
              considered cheap. Some university courses costs more than $10 000 a
              year).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So after this calculation, you say whether is it worth it to
              take a degree or diploma anot? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Here is a simple comparison between a O level graduate, diploma and degree graduate to prove that it is not worth spending so much time and money to study.</p>
              <p>We shall take a starting pay of $1200 for O level graduate who work as Admin Assistant and give her a 1 month bonus and $100 pay increment every year.</p>
              <p>During the 3 years that you take to get a diploma from the polytechnic you will have incureed a cost of $6000 school fees (after government subsidy) and you will have lost 3 years of income as compared to a O level graduate who works during the 3 years that you are studying,</p>
              <p>The O level graduate who is a admin assistant will have earned this amount in the 3 years that you spend taking a diploma</p>
              <p>1st year: $1200*13 months(including bonus)= $15 600</p>
              <p>2nd year: $1300(assuming a $100 increment for every year that he works)*13 months= $ 16 900</p>
              <p>3rd year: $1400 * 13 months= $18 200.</p>
              <p>In 3 years time, she will have earned $15 600+ $16 900 + $18 200= $50 700.</p>
              <p>And in 3 years time due to outstanding performance she got promoted to Admin Executive and given a $300 pay increment and her salary is now $1700 a month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A fresh diploma holder starts off as a Admin Executive drawing a salary of $1700. Both of them earns the same amount of salary but the O level graduate has worked for 3 years and during this period she have earned $50 700. Plus the diploma holder have spended $6000 on her school fees.</p>
              <p>Note that this amount has not include the cpf portion of her employer contribution during the 3 years that she has worked. If we include in this amount it will be higher.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Clearly the O level graduate is at a advantage as compared to the diploma holder.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now we compare a degree holder who took 5 years to get a degree( 2 years in JC and 3 years in university) with the O level graduate.</p>
              <p>Starting from the 4 year onwards, the O level graduate who is now a Admin Executive earns $1700 a month.</p>
              <p>4th year: $1700*13 months= $22 100</p>
              <p>5th year: $1800*13 months= $23 400</p>
              <p>At the end of the 5 years, the O level graduate Admin Exceutive will have earned $50 700+ $22 100+ $23 400= $96 200. Her salary at that time will be $1800 a month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The university graduate let us give her a salary of $2200 a month. Wow not bad sia she earns $400 a month more than the O level graduate.</p>
              <p>But wait. during the 5 years that she took to get a degree, the O level graduate have already earned $96 200.</p>
              <p>You go and calculate how long must this university graduate work than she can earn back the loss of $96 200 income that she loss in these 5 years. Not to mention, she started off with a net loss of $30 000( calculated by using $10 000 a year school fee multiply by 3 years course fee. And $10 000 a year school fee is already considered cheap. Some university courses costs more than $10 000 a year).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So after this calculation, you say whether is it worth it to take a degree or diploma anot? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
