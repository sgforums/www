            <div class='col-md body'>If memory serves, the samurai was not unfamiliar with firearms.  If I'm not wrong, a Portuguese by the name of Mendez Pinto first introduced firearms to Japan in the 1540s.  In the Battle of Nagashino of 1575, the word's first record of rolling volley fire happened when Oda Nobunaga lined up his 3000-strong gunners and compensated for his firearm's inaccuracy and shot-range through mass volume fire and careful timing.  His opponents were the legendary Takeda samurai cavalry and almost all were killed before reaching Nobunaga's lines.  Ironically after reaching the pinnacle of sucess, Nobunaga banned the use of firearms and Japanese samurais revered back to the use of blades and arrows.<br><br>The samurai caste had real problems with firearms.  Any peasant with decent training could now equal the best swordsman in the land and that eroded samurai prestige and prowess.  Incidently, many great warlords and their scions took up marksmanship as a sport for the elite and influential.</div>

But ok, siege engines aside. What those Samurai should have done, was line up behind a hill and lure the soldiers over, before unleashing volleys of arrows upon them.
