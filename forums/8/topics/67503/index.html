I only made the title so that I could attract attention + viewership and some decent replies, a.k.a communication <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I hated the military mismanagement of the fighting by the Samurai, they did not make use of guerilla warfare but chose open napoleonic style war, even though they lured the government troops away for a minor gain. They also did not make full use of their bowmen, nor siege engines that could have deliever lethal anti-infantry weapons, such as greek fire or mangonel stones.<br><br>Next. I hated the implications of the movie, that the last Samurai, was indeed a white Yank. The shoguns and old Japanese must be tossing and turning about in their graves, by the implication of the movie alone.

            <div class='col-md body'>firearms were new to japan when the Samurai were around...<br><br>in fact, their long range brought about the passing of the Samurai age... it took them a LONG time to figure out the advantages of the long rifle...<br><br>this one, seems like in the middle of it... in history, they have not learnt to use the advantages yet...<br><br>and there were 2 types of rifles then.. one with the burning rope thing, and the other was a flint-lock...<br><br>you are lost because you insist on thinking that they already knew of tactics which were not even conceived of then... sort of like you are telling the WW1 generals that their crude tanks should be used to fight a blitzkrieg when such a strategy of that sort was even thought of... telling them to use their Tigermoth and Camel bi-plane to do divebombing like the Stukas did...<br><br>then the other part which you are lost is: it's a movie!<br><br>enjoy the story, the plot, the acting.. not the technicalities!!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by men_@_arms:</div><div class="quote_body">How am I lost?<br><br>Yes, in the movie, the Samurai were fighting government troops who had rifles and howitzers.

            <div class='col-md body'>i not very sure about the history of japan but the movie itself had make the samurai look like are hero.

            <div class='col-md body'>I must say the acting and the cinematography played to the audience's hearts. Another typical good guy joins underdogs to fight for honour movie but it certainly played to the audience's emotions.<br><br>What i didn't like about the movie was how once again we are reminded of how westernization (i simply refuse to use the word modernization) has destroyed a society that was balanced....It wasn't perfect but nobody asked the damn white men to interfere.<br></div>
