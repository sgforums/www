"I might not be able to save all of them, but at least i managed to save one." The full scope of war might be just vast of any single human to comprehend, but if every single human does something about it, then things CAN change. Yes i am taking an utopian view of this world, but nothing is impossible.</div></blockquote>I'm here to tell u why war and aggression, unfortunately wil stay<br><br>If every human thinks like that as wat u said, it will be going against human's natural born instinct which existed from the very first day when u born as a baby. War is a result of fighting over resources, whether was it to protect or to take other people's possessions.<br><br>The aggression in whether to defend or to attack lies in the instinct for survival. This is true for animals, the ability to secure resources determine the survival of the entire group of people or animals. In nature this is wat they called as the "Survival of the fittest" If u're strong, u conquer, u live, if u're weak, nature will ensure that u will be destroyed.<br><br>Let's put an analogy, if in a far distant future, a massive famine broke out, and ur home contains the few remaining rations of food needed by ur family to survive, will u welcome outsiders with open arms to invade ur home and steal ur last remaining food?<br><br>Or let say every humans thinks, as u said, violence and aggression is NOT okay and they avoid competition with other groups of human over resources,  staying in one area until the resources there is depleted, refusing to move to other area (already occupied by other groups of people for the same reason) eventually becos no groups of people want to wage aggression to conquer other people's resources for survival, they will slowly die of starvations, thirst....etc. This will mean the extinction of the enitre human race.<br><br>A Utopian world unfortunately, as long as any life exists in this world, the day will never come. While we can't stop it, the most we can do is the limit the sufferings of war</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>they are too graphic to be posted on the forum publicly, like i said.<br><br>interested parties may PM me, however. pics are taken from a particular web page and they include pics of aftermaths of bus bombings, somebody's face splat in the middle of the road (granted, that may or may not be the terrorist's face), and many more bloody pics that make normal people feel sick.<br><br>the indiscriminate bombings of israeli targets really speak volumes about the people the israeli army is fighting against, and its neighbouring states... for harbouring and doing nothing about these organisations. in addition to them making lots of noise and using propaganda to win support and recruit young n dumb people (females included) to join their growing ranks of suicide bombers, some as young as 14 years old! wtf.<br><br>i think that im the only one who sees the wholesale slaughter of the israelis as a crime, and they are just doing wat they can. squabbling with terrorists wont work, and is beneath the government.<br><br>the israeli government has tried to pull out of the contested zones, however, Hamas take that as a sign of weakness unfortunately, thanks to their stupidity, and the whole vicious cycle begins again with the terrorists bombing CIVILIANS who want nothing to do with this protracted conflict.<br><br>lets say singapore gets bombed by JI every other day, resulting in massive casualties.<br><br>u want the govt to say, "oooh, im so sorry, lets be friends"  ?? ridiculous. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
