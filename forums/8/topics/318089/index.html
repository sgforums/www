              <p class="first">YANGON (AFP) - - Even after the twin catastrophes of the cyclone here and the earthquake in China, the outlook for Myanmar, and the rest of Asia, is not good for the remainder of this year, Yangon's revered astrologers agree.</p>
              <div id="adlrec">
              <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
              <tbody>
              <tr>
              <td align="center"><span style="font-family: arial;">ADVERTISEMENT</span><br></td>
              </tr>
              </tbody>
              </table>
              
              </div>
              <p>Across from Yangon's golden Shwedagon Pagoda, Khin Myint Myat sits under her newly repaired roof and sketches a star chart that she says explains both the cyclone in Myanmar and the earthquake in China.</p>
              <p>"This is the year with the combination of three bad factors -- the dangerous planet Mars, the dark planet Kotu, and the watery side," she said, drawing a diagram of the stars while thumbing through an astrology book.</p>
              <p>"There will be another wave of natural disasters -- either powerful storms or devastating earthquakes -- in the region again before the end of this year," Khin Myint Myat said, amid the din of hammers working to repair the home next door.</p>
              <p>Khin Myint Myat's own roof was blown off when Cyclone Nargis ripped through Myanmar on May 2 and 3, but she retrieved the tin sheets and hammered them back on.</p>
              <p>Less fortunate victims of the storm have been trekking to visit astrologers like her in the desperate hope of learning the fate of loved ones who were swept away in the storm, which left more than 66,000 dead or missing.</p>
              <p>Numerology plays an important role in the daily life of this devoutly Buddhist country, where people turn to astrologers to determine the most auspicious times for weddings, travelling or making business deals.</p>
              <p>Faced with the incomprehensible destruction of the cyclone, many people are now turning to astrologers to help start rebuilding their lives.</p>
              <p>In the town of Hmawby, north of Yangon, 70-year-old astrologer Min Theinkha receives at least 200 visitors a day at his "Full of Blessings" compound, including many who made the long journey from the hardest-hit regions of the Irrawaddy Delta.</p>
              <p>Min Theinkha has little comfort to offer them. He says the cyclone was part of the universe's karmic balance, a tragedy written into the nation's fate.</p>
              <p>"Disasters are unavoidable in astrology. All we can do is pray for the victims," he said.</p>
              <p>"Disasters like this can happen when numbers in the year add up to 10," he said, adding that after 2008, the next dangerous year is 2017.</p>
              <p>"There could be another storm this year, but it will not be a big disaster like this," Min Theinkha said.</p>
              <p>In Myanmar, years ending with an eight are particularly significant.</p>
              <p>In the year 888, ancient Burmese texts say that three kings died, ushering in a 20-year reign by a tyrant despised by the people for executing a group of Buddhist monks.</p>
              <p>Thailand-based Myanmar analyst Aung Naing Oo says many inside the country believe this ancient history has parallels with the current political crisis.</p>
              <p>Myanmar's previous dictator Ne Win was toppled during a pro-democracy uprising that began on August 8, 1988 -- a date now remembered as 8-8-88.</p>
              <p>The ruling junta, including the current leader Than Shwe, seized power during the bloody unrest that followed.</p>
              <p>Last September, Buddhist monks led new anti-government marches, which were again suppressed by the military as security forces fired on and beat the protesters.</p>
              <p>The historical similarities have raised cosmic concerns of new turmoil as August 8 approaches this year.</p>
              <p>"The year 888 symbolises the death of kings, the installation of bad kings," Aung Naing Oo said. "Than Shwe has been in power for about 20 years now, he has killed monks, he has been a bad king."</p>
              <p>Buddhist teaching lays out 10 rules for monarchs, including values such as compassion and impartiality, he said.</p>
              <p>"When a natural disaster like Cyclone Nargis hits Burma, or when there's an outbreak of disease, the Burmese blame it on the rulers," he said, referring to Myanmar by its previous name.</p>
              <p>"People always say the king or the rulers have not adhered to their principles of governance."</p>

              <p>You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are
