            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.behindwoods.com/images/AE_Rev3.jpg"><br><br>As I began to recollect my science teacher telling that white light is composed of mainly red, green and blue, I thought of what could have been on the mind of India's finest director.An examination of sociopolitics ,the movie oscillates from the past to present and in one point the flashback merges with the present event. This same thing if you deploy as three flashbacks which gets merged with the present through a common incident, you get Aayitha Ezhuthu. Mani Ratnam chooses to adopt a style of film-making which is still in its experimental state, at least in India. The basic rule for the screenplay is that there no rules<br><br>There lives in the slum streets, a man who seeks the gun to get big money and status. He serves the politicians ill deeds, spoiling his own hands.<br>There was this man who would challenge anything he feels is wrong. He would even challenge the dirty politicians by contesting in the elections as an opposition.<br>There, in the dim-lit, smoky, freaky discotheque, the guy syncs his hips and hops with beauteous babes. He dreams: no violence, no challenges, just girls, and fun, and US<br>and these are the three shades in the spectrum of today?s young men?the three shades of YUVA.<br><br>A ManiRatnam film: As every ManiRatnam film has its own tale to tell, AYUTHA EZHATHU (Tamil version of YUVA) tells about the strength of young men and how each guy can sum up to make a strong nation.<br>The climax of the film shows a strong young man sitting in the assembly hall. That shows, the end of the film is a start for young men in this country to take the ruling pride.<br><br>But  YUVA, the lifestyle of young men, runs fast. YUVA, the film, too runs fast. And ManiRatnam is the kind, who makes compact frames and leaves the rest for the viewer to understand. So some moments of the film look abrupt and absurd for a normal filmgoer.<br><br>The Last Line: It's nice to see a ManiRatnam film. It?s a fortune to listen to his story. And it's a Bliss to understand the inner sense of it.<br><br>As you stroll down the dark cinema hall to watch Aayitha Ezhuthu and if you are a few minutes late, you might assume that the climax is around. So begins the latest Mani Ratnam flick Aayitha Ezhuthu. And hey, you needn't worry for there is lot more to come and even if you miss this first scene, the scene repeats more number of times than the cost of your popcorn. Aayitha Ezhuthu is about serious cinema and not just for the popcorn eating cinema commoner.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://vasantham.mediacorptv.com/index/Deepavali%202004/ayutha.jpg"><br>Ayutha Ezhuthu<br>Cast: Surya, Madhavan, Sidharth, Esha Deol, Meera Jasmine &amp; Trisha<br>Based on a true story of three young men with varied backgrounds, aspirations and attitudes. 3 different youths with one similar motive- To take on the world the way they see it. Their paths cross over the Napier Bridge on a Thursday morning and their lives change irreversibly. Inba, the hired assassin, Michael, his intended victim, and Sidharth, the innocent by-stander caught in the cross-fire between the two. A horrific showdown results in their lives going in total disarray, changing their destinies.Directed by internationally acclaimed indian director Maniratnam, this movie is an innovative portrayal of the little explored genre of sociopolitical conflict, as to why the world is the way it is now..<br>Great stunts by Vikram Dharma, excellent music by AR Rahman and breaktaking cinematography by Ravi Chandran makes this one of the biggest blockbusters of the year</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>George Reddy from Osmania University? It was part of a case study for my course in the US which was what compelled me to see this movie<br><br>Here's the excerpt:<br><br><a href="http://the1bourne.fullhydblogs.com/" rel="nofollow">http://the1bourne.fullhydblogs.com/</a><br><br>"If you think you are beaten even before the battle begins chances are you can never win."<br><br>Do you know YUVA was a true story of a guy called George Reddy from Osmania University. Lecturers were afraid to teach because they weren't confident they could answer his questions, he was outstanding. Apart form being academically brilliant he was a prominent student leader and everyone was sure he would win a seat in assembly. George reddy fought against politically powered devils &amp; bureaucrats, to every one's shock George Reddy was killed by ABVP activists (another student group and inner organization of BJP) this happened around mid 80s. Students who were all educated in and around Osmania University limits know about the war of George Reddy. We lost a great student leader, whose dream did not come true until this day.</div>

In the past I have seen those featuring Hindu Gods and Goddesses, very interesting.  Some are quite funny.  But these days, those that you show in the forum are all the modern day stories.<br><br>I don't exactly like Indian movies (except the fairy tales one), but I love to see the dancing, esp the ladies.  You have any website featuring video clips of indian dance?  </div></blockquote>Yes long ago in the 70s and 80s have the fairy tales movies about gods and demons. Then they emerged again in the  late 90s and died out again. The newer ones came with  special effects that is found in Hollywood movies.<br><br>U have to get video clips  in P2p networks. i can upload some older ones</div>
