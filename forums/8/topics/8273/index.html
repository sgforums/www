            <div class='col-md body'>Compatibility will go hand in hand with the level of acceptance of the other party. What do I mean? A couple can be different in terms of what they like to do and their thinking but as long as both can accept who the other party is, then I think it is ok. If one likes to go outdoors for sports while another prefer to stay indoors for games, they can reach a compromise and therefore widen their area of activities and help each other learn and accept more things. Differing viewpoints between two parties will prevent a too narrow appraoch to handling matters.<br>Of course, it takes 2 hands to clap and it usually is not easy especially if the difference is really totally on opposite ends. What will make it work is the determination by both parties and their williness to recognise and accept an alternative lifestyle or viewpoint from their own.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>from my own experience,love is not enough. some times the amount of love is not enough to cover up all the differences in opinions and misunderstandings. a lot of couples broke up for reasons other than change of hearts. it's sad,but it's true.<br>however,u can also say tt it depends on how deep ur love for each other is.if u really love each other very much,then it may be strong enough to make things work.who knows? it really depends on the individual. if both parties want it to work and are willing to put in effort,it will.</div>

Its u and u alone.<br><br>Yet again, it can be so difficult precisely for the same reason. Coz each individual interprets love differently, there r bound to be conflicts here and there btw a couple in terms of perceptions of love.<br><br>Furthermore, individuals do change over time. For eg. when u were 14-15, u might go more for branded stuffs, but when u grow older, u might go more for practicability. The same goes for ur character, ur interpretations of love.<br><br>This adds on to the individual differences mentioned above and u get a whole mess. Of coz such differences and changes in one's own characters or preferrences might not necessarily lead to serious conflicts but tts where the highs and lows of relationship come in. Sometimes, both parties love each other just as much or almost just as much, sometimes one love more than the other(may still be together out of various reasons). When both parties' feelings for each other comes to a low, its time to say gdbye.<br><br>Its a matter of noeing how to manage and not anything else in my opinion. U may love someone so very much and promise never to leave him or her for the rest of ur life but who noes u will still be feeling the same say, 5 yrs down the rd? Especially when all the above sets in. But does it mean U lied? No, I wouldn't say tt for i am sure many ppl who broke their promises did meant wat they say when they made them. When u love someone deeply, u can die for him or her, but when the love subsides totally, u dun even give a damn bout wat happens to the other party.<br><br>So, how does compatability come in? Compatability including wat? age? educational background? financial background? race? religion? looks?<br>Lets take for eg. LOOKS. lets say if i am a super yandao and i happen to fall for a ger whose damn fat and ugly due to her other characteristics and decided to disregard all other factors such as peer pressure or any other pressure by ownself or others, of coz the relationship will work. It will work for as long as i can sustain tt degree of feeling for her despite any other factors. But who noes wat will happen thereafter? Perhapz I will succumb to the pressures over time, not to mention changes in her thoughts and behaviour.<br><br>Sorry, a bit too long-winded so i better stop, thanx for taking the time to read<br>Well, simply said:<br><br>To me,love is whoever, however, watever, whenever and wherever u want it to be.<br><br>------------------<br>For In Much Wisdom Is Much Grief, &amp; Increase Of Knowledge Is Increase Of Sorrow~~~</div>
