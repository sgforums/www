            <div class='col-md body'>well..... Finance_geek .. sigh.. actually I sent u a PM regarding to ur qn in Morgan Stanley thread. But nvmind... let me retype a little.<br><br>Quite a lot of pple go into I-Banking every year, its just a matter of which position you get into. My advice to you is to apply during the Sep-Dec period when I-banks will start knocking on NTU for recruitment talks. By the time interviews are over, it will be Jan, which is abt the start of recruitments by the Big 4. Hence you dun really need to "choose" get it? You can try for I-Banks and Big 4 at the same time.<br><br>Now as to which position to apply to.... thats the difficult part. As much as possible, attend EVERY recruitment talk by the I-banks and take note which positions they are recruiting. Generally though, Operations will be the biggest hirer. Dun blindly apply for Corporate Finance when that particular I-bank stated in their talks they dun intend to hire for it. My advice? Dun apply for Operations.... although its the easiest to get into... they are generally not called "I-bankers" and in terms of prospects not as good as front desks.<br><br>Now... abt going out to Big 4 to work first. It is possible to go into I-Banking from Big 4.. but generally.. its a bit hard to go into front office. Because you would have accounting experience already, the I-Banks sometimes would prefer to throw you into wat we call middle office positions, like Product Control and Financial Control, which typically requires pple well versed in accounting. But of course, it is possible to go from Big 4 -&gt; Product Control -&gt; Trader... but.. need quite a bit of relationships and luck.<br><br>Another thot.. certain positions like Merger &amp; Acqusition, Corporate Finance etc... is of little relations to auditing, hence even if you were to apply after a few years of experience in Big 4, you might not really gain much advantage, and generally I-Banks like to recruit pple fresh from Unis for such roles and train them from the start..<br><br>My final bit of advice... apply during the Sep-Dec period... most singaporeans have the misconception it is "kiasu" but what they are unaware of is that I-Banks only recruit once yearly(unless they have insufficient applicants) and once the recruitment season passes.. you gotta wait another 1 year.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In addition.. errmm.. dun think that just coz the chances are ultra low hence u dun apply ah? It doesnt cost anything to apply anyway. Just need to get some new shirt, buy a new tie etc etc and u stand a shot in getting that job just like everyone else. Besides, you also gain valuable interview experience(I-Banks interviews are very very interesting, especially for fresh grads)</div>
