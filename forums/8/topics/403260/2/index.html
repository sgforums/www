              <p>But you sounded like you had a good life and it's smooth sailing. I did plan but it just doesn't comes the way it should. Which part of that you do not understand?

              <p>Nevertheless, planning guides me in my life. But not everything is about planning. It's native to think that planning will help you get what you want.

              <p>How about planning <strong>with </strong>back-up plans? It's good to have something to fall back on. I believe you can consider going to a private uni that offers a tie-up from dip to degree. The diploma course can last only from 1.5yrs till 3yrs depending on which you choose. This will further enhance your learning in your higher education. </p>
              <p>And if like what you say, you don't know what to do, why not take a big step forward and gain some working experience first before deciding what you want in life? True enough with your A level certification, and not so stellar results, you won't be able to land yourself with a good job and pay, the experience might be what you are seeking for. </p>
              <p>Current situation now is that, even people with dip/ deg are not starting out with big cushy jobs either. So lower your expectations. Another way is to, intern in a real estate company or any company that has this department in it. Learn what you get to see if you do further in this route. Would you like it? If no, then how? Plan wisely okay. There are bounds to be failure, but if you fail, it is also going to be part of your plan.</p>

              <p>my plans are with back-up. But it's just that my back-up plans fails too. That's why I said my planning is no good. But i didn't say I didn't have back-up plans, right?</p>
              <p>Working first to gain experience is one option i should consider. I am very clear that a degree holder may not get a good and high paying job at the start since nowadays many people have degrees too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To TYING, thanks for your advice. Maybe I should consider working first.</p>

              <p>Hey, I've thought of what I would do if this happened to me, and I think it's a not bad option... (at least to me) So perhaps you would like to consider this route. </p>
              <p>Go to SIM or some private schools and take up accountancy... Then go ACCA to get your accreditations. Not sure if you need some working experience in between your degree and ACCA accreditations, if you are interested in this you can go research more. I feel that at least for accountancy, the school where you graduate from is not that important and I guess strong background in maths is not that important (since only min. o level a maths is required). </p>

              <p>True, all these steps require additional money, but I think it should be cheaper than going overseas? And I think taking accountancy is something of guaranteed job security, coz accountants are in high demand (although the fact that it is not an easy job must be taken into account before undertaking this path). It's better than taking some random courses...</p>
              <p>Snowchick2005, from now on you must really put in your 200% into all that you do coz you are spending more time and money than some of your peers in getting your degree... Hopefully this will serve as a motivation (:</p>

              <p>Sigh.... you think I had it all easy? I can go into a long melodramatic story about how my family fell into hard times when I was in both secondary and JC. But I don't want to bore you, and this ain't about me, anyway.</p>
              <p>You think I had a clear idea of what to do? No, I didn't. Back in JC I was vacillating between either Mass Comm or Engin in uni. And no one ever really told me on what I should do and what subjects to take. But I knew that I should at least look a bit further ahead and to find out how to keep my options open.</p>
              <p>It's all about <em>personal initiative</em>. Not everything can be taught to you or spoonfed to you. You yourself have to take charge on how to go on with your life.</p>
              <p>Anyway, bear in mind what I said: from this point on, whatever it is that you want to do, you should at least plan ahead a little. Never mind if you don't know what your final destination is; very few people do, anyway. I didn't, and I still don't. Rather, it is all about making sure you have enough open doors in front of you.</p>
              <p>In the end, it was your total lack of planning that did you in, and you should seek to at least plan such that your options remain open.</p>
              <p>So go forth and start planning.</p>

There are people like him out there who like to judge people harshly. Everyone lead different lives and thus have different views about issue like education.
