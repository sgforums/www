As for whether is it because of GP I am not sure about it. A friend of mine who got the same result as me got into NTU. Maybe is because he have H2 maths and I don't. Beside, I can't take H2 maths because I bear no interest, I'm weak in maths and I do not have A maths background before in secondary school. I tried taking h2 maths during my first 3 months in JC. I tried very hard and give in my 100%. But I just didn't do well in the end.</p></div>

              <p>Bai Chi... if u wanna take real estate in the first place, then why go JC??</p>
              <p>Go to poly take up a relevant course and you would have been in Uni real soon!!!</p>
              <p>I have many friends in NUS real estate making it via the poly route.</p>
              <p>My suggestion is to go to Poly and from Poly go to Uni... You just wasted 2 years of your life. You should have worked harder for your GP.</p>

                  Sry, to say this but your results sucks. Either you retake or you go to poly. 
                  I suggests you take up radiologist, or some other courses that requires A level qualification as a diploma course

              <p>Lokey, I think you mean radiography because a radiologist is a doctor. I think taking health sciences in poly is a good route because if I am not wrong, the cut off is lower than some uni courses and you just need another year in an overseas uni to convert it to a degree. However, I think that this year's intake has already ended.</p>
              <p>Snowchick2005, did you try appealing? I heard that 2nd appeal is also possible. </p>

              <p>1. This is what happens when you fail to plan ahead. You thought that Real Estate doesn't require maths, but as it turns out, it does. That's entirely your own fault for not at least having an idea of what to do in uni while you're choosing your subjects in JC.</p>
              <p>2. Yes, JC students are offered more places, but that is by no means a guarantee that you will get a place in uni. Come on, really, why would they give a place to a JC student with poor results when there's a poly student with good results?</p>
              <p>And yes, your results <em>are</em> poor. I've seen people with better results than yours fail to get places that they want in uni. Really.</p>
              <p>3. Sorry to say this, but really, your subject combination itself was already really weird. Come on.... two H2 sciences with no H2 maths? Do you know that to be a good scientist, you must be a good mathematician as well? Heck, do you know that even economics requires maths? </p>
              <p>As it is, by not taking Maths you have already ruled yourself out of all Science disciplines, all Engineering disciplines, Economics, Computing, Real Estate, Finance.... and a few other disciplines I can't think of. Dollars to donuts say that you didn't consider this fact. <em>That's</em> how important Maths is.</p>
              <p>If you're really bent on entering uni, you should either retake the A Levels (with H2 Maths this time), or go to poly.</p>
              <p>And this time, for goodness' sake..... please plan ahead a little.</p>

              <p>Some might think that you will be wasting a year by taking the poly route, but you will be given a chance to "redeem" your one year lost by taking up the same course for your degree. What I mean, is direct entry to the second year for related poly course.</p>
              <p>It doesn't matter which route you took, just make sure that you work hard for it and you will get what you want at the end of the day...</p>

              <p>By her own admission she didn't bother to think ahead about what to take in uni, and what subjects to take at A Levels to qualify.</p>
              <p>I have never really heard of anyone taking Science at A Levels without taking Maths. Every mother's son knows that if there's one A level subject that will open doors for you, it is A Level Maths. Without Maths, you are essentially restricted to FASS at NUS.... and not all courses, at that!</p>
              <p>In my batch there were like, 6 out of 798 people who didn't take Maths. All 6 were from the Arts stream. None were from Science.</p>
              <p>And everyone knows that GP is the one super-critical subject that can totally screw up everything even if you get straight As for your A Level subjects.</p>

              <p>Well... What's done, is done. I think it won't help much to flame her anymore for her wrong choice of subjects. What happened in secondary school was that perhaps she couldn't cope with A maths and resulted in her being unable to cope with H2 maths. Maybe she also didn't know that she need to have A maths for H2 maths. And I think most people won't know the JC system that well in sec 3. </p>
              <p>So I guess the main thing now is to give inputs as to how she can move on from here. I am pretty sure that she's regretting her choice of subject combinations too. I also had a friend (science stream) who really couldn't cope with H2 maths and dropped to H1, and got an A. She most probably wouldn't get an A if she kept going with H2 maths, so I think it was a good choice of her to drop to H1. Besides FASS, FOS also didn't have H2 maths as an entry requirement. E.g. to do Chemistry, a good H2 pass in Chemistry and at least a good 'O' level pass in Mathematics are required. </p>

              <p>For your info, after I read your topic, I went to do a little research about Dip/ Deg in Real Estate. Maths IS involved! If you don't want to waste another 4 years of your life knowing that you won't be able to excel in it, why not think of other route? </p>
              <p>Real estates modules consist of some financial studies, mathematics, and some engineering stuff which I recognize from engineering dip modules. Not much of geography related as you say leh. </p>
              <p>Anyway, if you are really interested in Real Estate, why not contact people who have gone through that path! They would definitely be in a better position to answer your queries. </p>
              <p>What's done is done. No use looking back at your results. Quickly decide on your next route and move on with life. </p>

              <p>1. Retaking should not be possible. Unless you have already registered for this yr's retake, otherwise you would have to retake next year, meaning you would have spent 5 years on JC education (coz u are a repeat student right?). </p>

              <p>In response to <a href="../../../users/62744">fudgester</a>, I can see that you are a person who knows very well what you want to do for your life. And you seems to have a pretty good life with not much major setbacks. But you have to realised that not everyone is like you who know what they want to do in life. Not everyone know what they want to do in life until they grew mature and understand more about life. I received many major setbacks in life that stop my life plan or even forces me to take another route. You maybe blessed with good friends and family who are able to give you proper advices to aid you in your life plan. I'll say GOOD FOR YOU!!!! But you must spare a thought for others too. Never assume everyone is like you ok? Nevertheless, thanks for your post and comments.</p>
              <p>To Wish: Thanks for your advice. I do not have money for oversea universities so i guess that is out of the option. You are right on the point that i didn know much about JC during my secondary school life. If i knew i'll had chosen the right subjects.</p>
              <p>In general, I am happy for all the replies. Thank you guys. For me, I am a student who worked my way up slowly from pri to jc in my education life. I don't come from a very rich family and I am not a very bright student from the start. My family didn't give me much advice on education in terms of subject combinations. I got to walk in the dark to feel my way around, learning every step through pain and hardship. But I never complain. I am not afraid of failure and i'm willing to learn. Just to say again. This topic that i started is NOT A CHANNEL to complain about my failure in jc. It's just to hear from the crowd on what is the next best route to take. I appreciated everyone's efforts in contributing. Thanks.</p>

              <p>In response to <a rel="nofollow" href="/users/62744">fudgester</a>, I can see that you are a person who knows
                      very well what you want to do for your life. And you seems to have
                      a pretty good life with not much major setbacks. But you have to
                      realised that not everyone is like you who know what they want to
                      do in life. Not everyone know what they want to do in life until
                      they grew mature and understand more about life. I received many
                      major setbacks in life that stop my life plan or even forces me to
                      take another route. You maybe blessed with good friends and family
                      who are able to give you proper advices to aid you in your life

              <p>Sigh.... you think I had it all easy? I can go into a long melodramatic story about how my family fell into hard times when I was in both secondary and JC. But I don't want to bore you, and this ain't about me, anyway.</p>
              <p>You think I had a clear idea of what to do? No, I didn't. Back in JC I was vacillating between either Mass Comm or Engin in uni. And no one ever really told me on what I should do and what subjects to take. But I knew that I should at least look a bit further ahead and to find out how to keep my options open.</p>
              <p>It's all about <em>personal initiative</em>. Not everything can be taught to you or spoonfed to you. You yourself have to take charge on how to go on with your life.</p>
              <p>Anyway, bear in mind what I said: from this point on, whatever it is that you want to do, you should at least plan ahead a little. Never mind if you don't know what your final destination is; very few people do, anyway. I didn't, and I still don't. Rather, it is all about making sure you have enough open doors in front of you.</p>
              <p>In the end, it was your total lack of planning that did you in, and you should seek to at least plan such that your options remain open.</p>
              <p>So go forth and start planning.</p>
