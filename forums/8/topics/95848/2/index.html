If you ever saw the movie "Wag the Dog", the president has sexual relations with a 12 year old. This information goes out to the media 1 week before elections. So, to get the publics mind off of the little Girl, the president stages a war with Albania. The moon shots were the same concept. People did not like what was going on with the Vietnam war, so, to get the publics mind off of all the bad things going on in Vietnam, the US faked a moon landing. If you check your dates, we abruptly stopped going to the moon around the same time the Vietnam War Ended. (<br><br>TO WIN THE SPACE RACE -- Back in the late 60's early 70's, Russia and the US were in a heated battle to see, well, pretty much who was better. Once the US realized that they couldn't send a man to the moon, they couldn't just say, "OK Russia, we give up." </blockquote></div>

Extracted from the website <a href="http://www.clavius.org/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.clavius.org/index.html</a>. NASA says they dun hv the technology right now, to go back to the moon, although they have the technology 30 years ago. Reasons are given below<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Question:</strong></span> <strong>Many people from NASA have said it would be difficult or impossible to return to the moon anytime soon.</strong><br><span style="color: green;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span> This, unfortunately, is probably true. But not because the technology never existed to go to the moon.<br><br>In the 1960s we had a clear mandate to go to the moon. Although NASA had an ambitious program of scientific exploration planned, the real motivation in the public's mind was to beat the Russians. After Apollo 11, interest in the space program dwindled rapidly. And consequently the budget was slashed and then slashed again.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Most of the people involved in the lunar landings have retired, and many have passed away.</span> That is a lot of expertise to lose. A lot of that has not been passed on to the next generation of engineers because the newer engineers don't need that knowledge. Landing on the moon required a specific set of skills that isn't much in demand in the space program anymore.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Most of the equipment is gone too.</span> A few lucky museums have command modules or lunar modules, or other significant chunks of Apollo hardware. But a lot of it has been scrapped. The manufacturers no longer have the specialized tools to build these spacecraft, and the detailed design documents have been thrown out. Not that we would actually use these machines, but today's engineers would study them to understand what their predecessors worked out for solutions to various problems.<br><br>How could these people throw out something so dear to the national heritage? Unfortunately these are private companies intent on making a profit. They are in the aircraft business, not the museum business. The plans and design documents for one lunar module take several thousand cubic feet of storage space.<br><br>NASA is, unfortunately, suffering a brain drain. While it was fashionable in the 1960s and 1970s to work for the space program, it isn't anymore. NASA is scrambling for talented scientists and engineers. There are probably two reasons for this. First, NASA isn't the same organization it was in the 1960s. Today it's more bureaucratic, more like the other government agencies. Second, much of what NASA does today is seen as routine and repetitive. The magical allure of space travel isn't what it used to be.<br><br></div>
