I was then given a lucky draw coupon to fill up all the personal info, i.e., Name, Address, Phone, Annual or Monthly Income, etc, and drop it into the box. Days ago, I received calls from this company call <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Exhibition Alliance</strong></span>, telling me that the lucky draw coupon that I have drop in at City Chain has not win their grand prize or any other prize, but I was selected to received a pair of free air tickets to phuket with accommodation to 5 days 4 nights stay as a gift from the sponsor company <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Garaway</span></strong>. He then told me that in order for me to received this free tickets and accommodation, I have to attend a previews of 90min organized by Garaway in return. I told him that I’m not interested, but the tele-marketing guy keeps pestering me. For 3 days, I have been receiving calls from them, asking me to consider and that it’s a waste for the tickets. All I have to do is to attend the 90min with no commitment and say thank you to the organizing company and I will walk away with the free trip to Phuket. I then called up City Chain. I spoke to the in-charge and organizer of the lucky draw event and asked her why is it that our personal info filled in for the lucky draw was used by others marketing company. What she told me shocked me and I told her to write me a mail and explain it in detail to me, this is what she wrote; </span></p>

I sincerely apologize for what have happened. Eliais World has approached us in Sept wanting to do a joint promotion by conducting a F1 lucky draw. They agreed to sponsor a return ticket to Monaco, in return; they would use the data collected in their marketing activities. They appeared to be professional and sincere in working with us and we have agreed to work together. I am sorry to find out that you were being disturbed several times on the phone after refusal in taking up their free holiday package offer. I have talked to Ms Jay Jaffri (who is also cc on this mail) the person who is in charge of the Lucky Draw about this issue. I have insisted that they should stop calling or pestering you to attend their 90mins talk on some holiday package and they have no right to make use of City Chain's name. I would like to assure you that City Chain is not involve in the selling or whatever marketing activities conducted by Eliais World. I will ensure that Jay from Eliais World taking proper action to stop the act. Lastly, please accept my sincere apology. It is never my intention to cause you such unpleasantness and trouble.</em> </span></p>

              there should be a law to stop these dispicable companies' monet making effort by selling away the personal info of customers to other companies.
              Normally there are tactics to such calls. 
              The call offering interest free loans I would tell them Im a poor student. No job yet.
              the call stated above I would say ok ok then fly them aeroplane haha
