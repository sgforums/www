We seek our passengers' understanding and patience.'<br><br>Its ez-link fares, 69 cents to $1.69, are five to 25 cents higher than existing fares on other MRT lines.<br><br>SBS Transit is changing nine bus services, beginning with Service 83 on Friday. Services 21, 22, 53, 70, 72, 125, 130 and 139 will be changed on Saturday.<br><br>These changes, it says, will provide better connections to stations, and it promises that if the result is a longer journey, commuters will not pay more than before.<br><br>More than 500 computer systems control everything from the trains to the power and signalling systems on what has been touted as the world's first fully automated underground heavy rail line.<br><br>This complexity partly explains why there are still glitches, such as when the exact location of a driverless train momentarily eludes the system and the brakes automatically stop the train.<br><br>'We'd rather be late than be unsafe,' said Mr Ong. He said that the Land Transport Authority (LTA), which built the system, is committed to fine-tuning it over the next 12 months.<br><br>The commuters and MPs interviewed said it was good that SBS Transit was upfront about the glitches, but it should not be an excuse for poor service.<br><br>MP Charles Chong (Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC) said: 'It would be better for them to spend more time to fix the defects than to ask passengers to live with them. Commuters can't be expected to accept a lower standard when they are paying higher fares.'<br><br>Mr Stephen Foo, a 53-year-old lecturer who lives near Kovan station, said: 'The glitches should not happen any more after so many months of trial runs.'<br><br>To reassure commuters, a customer service officer will be on duty on each train for at least the first three months.<br><br>Separately yesterday, Transport Minister Yeo Cheow Tong spoke to reporters about commuters' worries about fare increases:<br><br><span style="color: blue;">He said: 'As the rest of the MRT fares go up, we will try to ensure that the North-East Line fares do not change very much, so over time, the rest of the MRT fares should catch up with the NEL.' </span><br><br></div>
