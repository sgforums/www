            <div class='col-md body'>For a long time, wise men have known that, just like all the other living creatures on this glorious Earth, human beings were meant to eat raw foods. Raw = Healthy, Cooked = Toxic.<br><br>Now that you've an A' level background in Chemistry and Biology, you are in a better position to understand why.<br><br>One principle reason is FATS - raw (healthy and needed) vs cooked (unhealthy and carcinogenic). Those interested can email me for more details on this.<br><br>But there is another reason - Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs) caused by the biochemical process known as Glycation (the 'evil' counterpart of Glycosylation, a natural, precision process which occurs under the careful guidance of enzymes).<br><br>Glycation is the non-enzymatic (ie. haphazard) process of covalent cross-linkages that, under heating (ie. cooking), form between carbohydrate molecules and proteins or fats. This process is totally unnatural (ie. does not occur in raw foods), and as a result, eating cooked foods (especially deep fried, fried, baked, grilled, bbq'ed, etc) causes and exacerbates diseased conditions in the body of all kinds, from kidney failure to cancer to lowered IQ/EQ.<br><br>The higher the temperature and the longer the exposure (hence, deep fried foods is obviously the worst!), the more extensive the glycation process. Boiled/steamed foods are the only category of cooked foods that are safe to eat.<br><br>There is more to the story.

            <div class='col-md body'>Someone (Betson) replied my post to share an experience of hers :<br><br><blockquote>Is the part (on that link) about the berries clearing metal also an aspect of the glycation process? I know that berries do clear metallic waste due to an experience I've had--<br>Once when I was young I had a nickel to spend and was very hungry. But nothing was available for a nickle so I got rather angry and self-destructive and ate the nickle.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br>For probably about ten or more years after that, whenever I ate berries a strange after taste of metal followed. Now I see it wasn't pollution in the berries, it was the metal in me.<br>This word 'glycation' is a new one for me; does it relate to glycerine somehow?</blockquote>Thanks for sharing your experience, Bets. The glycation process (described above in my edited original post) is a separate matter from raw berries clearing metallic toxins from the body. The exact mechanism for raw berries clearing metallic toxins is not known to me; it was Hilarion who advised this in one of his channelings. I suppose if a biologist or chemist wanted to research more on the exact mechanisms, he could do a Hilarion Reading to ask.<br><br>However, Hilarion did add that in order to allow the raw berries to do their work of clearing metallic toxins, you will need to consume sufficient raw fats around the time (to clear out the waste), otherwise most of the metallic toxins will settle back in the body.<br><br>I've recently located a source of raw fats (well I haven't checked with Hilarion on exactly how raw this source is; I actually asked Hilarion years ago, in a personal Reading on how raw was my source of raw cow's milk from a farm I regularly purchased from; Hilarion did a quick psychic scan and broke the news that the milk I purchased wasn't always truly raw; the farm owners/workers partially pasteurized the milk (on the sly, since I asked for raw milk) at times, depending on several factors, including the owners/workers' perception of the state of health of the cows being milked); and this new source of raw fats I've recently located, which is (thankfully!) available internationally (I've had several shipments of this raw coconut butter from USA to Singapore), thus far, tastes and feels (sufficiently) raw to me :<br><br>Artisana's raw coconut butter (click on link to see image) :<br><a href="http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Heart.Of.God/ArtisanaRawCoconutButter.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Heart.Of.God/ArtisanaRawCoconutButter.jpg</a><br><br>The manufacturer :<br><a href="http://www.premierorganics.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.premierorganics.org</a><br><br>An online retailer who ships internationally :<br><a href="http://www.sunfood.com/cgi-bin/order/index.cgi?d=single&amp;item_id=1036" rel="nofollow">http://www.sunfood.com/cgi-bin/order/index.cgi?d=single&amp;item_id=1036</a><br><br>Suggestion : add raw chocolate to taste :<br><a href="http://www.sunfood.com/cgi-bin/order/index.cgi?d=single&amp;item_id=1004" rel="nofollow">http://www.sunfood.com/cgi-bin/order/index.cgi?d=single&amp;item_id=1004 </a><br><br>You could follow Aajonus Vonderplanitz's suggested formula (though I personally leave out lemon juice which makes me nauseous) :<br><a href="http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Heart.Of.God/AajonusVonderplanitz_LubricationFormula.gif" rel="nofollow">http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Heart.Of.God/AajonusVonderplanitz_LubricationFormula.gif</a><br><br>Note : the raw eggs in the formula refers to free-range (or "kampong" as we say it in Singapore) chicken eggs.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Regarding how raw berries help clear out metallic toxins, I expect that there are helpful compounds naturally present within most species of raw berries, that act as polydentate ligands (aka chelating agents, due to the fact that they chemically bind to transition metals in a manner resembling a claw or 'chele'; "polydentate" means that the compound has several/poly donor atoms, each with an available lone pair of electrons that can be donated to the metal ion to form coordinate/dative covalent bonds resulting in stable complex ions).<br><br>"An example of one such polydentate ligand or chelating agent, is the ethylenediaminetetraacetate ion (EDTA), that is used to treat lead poisoning. Six donor atoms enable EDTA to form a very stable complex ion with lead. In this form, it is removed from the blood and tissues and excreted from the body." - Raymond Chang, "Chemistry" 9th Edition.<br><br>This is, incidentally, part of the H2 'A' level Chemistry syllabus that I teach.<br><br></div>

These foods are possible to obtain (especially in a fortunate society like Singapore), it's just a matter of whether you're willing to make the extra effort, or not.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have no problem with boiling and steaming, in fact they are my favourite cooking methods.<br><br>They can retain alot of natural aroma and flavor. Easy to chew and swallow also. Feel very clear.<br><br>My favorite is boiling or steaming, with no sugar/ salt/ spices/ sauce of any kind.<br><br>Just natural taste, and later sprinkle Olive Oil (good oil with very little bad cholesterol), plus white rice, guaranteed it is very nice.<br><br>Btw the suggestion to eat raw.....<br><br>Ya to some extent, raw nut is possible, and raw vegetable of course is possible..., BUT....I think people will not eat raw beef/ raw chicken/ raw prawn.<br><br>So...instead of suggesting eating raw....I think boil/ steam is better.<br><br>Meat Pao.</div>
