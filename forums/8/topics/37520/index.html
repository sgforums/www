            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>We met in a favorite night scene in Singapore. I was pretty much enjoying myself with a few friends when he tapped my shoulder.<br><br>Being petite, I was stunned to see a towering figure asking for my name. I was lost for words as being picked up isn't in my list of hobbies. He leaned nearer to me as he asked my name again. With the booming music, I raised my voice a little and gave him my name.<br><br>Awkward and shy, I didn't dare to look at him in the eye. He asked me a few questions and I wasn't even concentrating due to the fact that my friends were looking at me. He was actually asking if I frequent the place. Not long after we had to go our separate ways as the night's partying is ending. He asked if he could have my number as he wants to treat me a coffee. I hesitated and exchanged our numbers.<br><br>The same night he called me and we chatted til the wee hours in the morning. I found out quite alot about him and to my surprise we had a lot of similarities. After that phone conversation, we exchanged a few SMSes and a few calls. Through some messages, he revealed that he took a liking in me and wanted to progress a little further than friends. I did not reply as I did not know what to reply. I was attracted to him and the fact is I have a lot of choices. I didn't want to commit and jump into any relationship.<br><br>One day, he asked me out for coffee and I agreed. After much rescheduling due to my commitments, we finally met for the second time. We had some soft drinks at a shopping mall and chatted about our day at work. He popped the question again. I shut off the topic by suggesting to take a stroll at the nearby park. Sitting down near the waterfront, he took my hand in his and asked me the question again. I gave him a non committed smile, and took my hand away. I told him about my insecurities. He shared his pasts with me and I can say I know him better then he know me.<br><br>We changed to a lighter topic. With no wind and rain clouds looming over our heads, he suggested us to go back to his place. I hesitated. He confirm my insecurities and reassured me again and again. I gave in.<br><br>We had coffee and played a game or two on his PC. The lights were dim and his place comfortable. I knew things went a little far when I realised we were kissing. I pushed myself away from him and saw a few car mags on the coffee table. He started telling me how he love cars and I thought I was safe. Whether if it is the cosy environment or that magnetic force in us, I found myself in his arms and ended up making out.<br><br>He wanted a relationship out of this, where as I was totally angry with myself. I knew that I shouldn't have gone to his place. After that we had a talk over it and he asked me to reconsider the situation. I was appalled by the fact that he was solving the problem when I wanted him to empathise with me over the issue. He wasn't keen into listening to me and I was kind of pissed.<br><br>I told him I wanted to go home and he sent me to a taxi. On the way home, I recounted the events and I wouldn't deny that I've enjoyed the romancing part. The part I hate is the way he treated the whole issue.<br><br>I decided to close this story as I get myself ready for the rest of my life's journey. One event like this will not defeat me, and I know I can stand up again. He may have won the battle but I won the war. He won my time but I won his heart. Though I do not what the future will lead me to, but this is definitely the end of a chapter of my lfie.<br><br>To him, he may have love me with all his heart. To me, this is a fling not a relationship, as I don't see him making effort to understand me. He wanted so much of someone to understand him that he jolly well forgets my feelings.<br><br>As i analyse the situation once again, we both needed someone so much that we misplaces our emotions on the wrong person.<br><br>A seduction that kills, a temptation so irresistable, a love so real yet unable to realise, what can we do but let our wounds heal in time?<br><br>Good bye and I mean it</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Natty:</div><div class="quote_body">We met in a favorite night scene in Singapore. I was pretty much enjoying myself with a few friends when he tapped my shoulder.<br><br>Being petite, I was stunned to see a towering figure asking for my name. I was lost for words as being picked up isn't in my list of hobbies. He leaned nearer to me as he asked my name again. With the booming music, I raised my voice a little and gave him my name.<br><br>Awkward and shy, I didn't dare to look at him in the eye. He asked me a few questions and I wasn't even concentrating due to the fact that my friends were looking at me. He was actually asking if I frequent the place. Not long after we had to go our separate ways as the night's partying is ending. He asked if he could have my number as he wants to treat me a coffee. I hesitated and exchanged our numbers.<br><br>The same night he called me and we chatted til the wee hours in the morning. I found out quite alot about him and to my surprise we had a lot of similarities. After that phone conversation, we exchanged a few SMSes and a few calls. Through some messages, he revealed that he took a liking in me and wanted to progress a little further than friends. I did not reply as I did not know what to reply. I was attracted to him and the fact is I have a lot of choices. I didn't want to commit and jump into any relationship.<br><br>One day, he asked me out for coffee and I agreed. After much rescheduling due to my commitments, we finally met for the second time. We had some soft drinks at a shopping mall and chatted about our day at work. He popped the question again. I shut off the topic by suggesting to take a stroll at the nearby park. Sitting down near the waterfront, he took my hand in his and asked me the question again. I gave him a non committed smile, and took my hand away. I told him about my insecurities. He shared his pasts with me and I can say I know him better then he know me.<br><br>We changed to a lighter topic. With no wind and rain clouds looming over our heads, he suggested us to go back to his place. I hesitated. He confirm my insecurities and reassured me again and again. I gave in.<br><br>We had coffee and played a game or two on his PC. The lights were dim and his place comfortable. I knew things went a little far when I realised we were kissing. I pushed myself away from him and saw a few car mags on the coffee table. He started telling me how he love cars and I thought I was safe. Whether if it is the cosy environment or that magnetic force in us, I found myself in his arms and ended up making out.<br><br>He wanted a relationship out of this, where as I was totally angry with myself. I knew that I shouldn't have gone to his place. After that we had a talk over it and he asked me to reconsider the situation. I was appalled by the fact that he was solving the problem when I wanted him to empathise with me over the issue. He wasn't keen into listening to me and I was kind of pissed.<br><br>I told him I wanted to go home and he sent me to a taxi. On the way home, I recounted the events and I wouldn't deny that I've enjoyed the romancing part. The part I hate is the way he treated the whole issue.<br><br>I decided to close this story as I get myself ready for the rest of my life's journey. One event like this will not defeat me, and I know I can stand up again. He may have won the battle but I won the war. He won my time but I won his heart. Though I do not what the future will lead me to, but this is definitely the end of a chapter of my lfie.<br><br>To him, he may have love me with all his heart. To me, this is a fling not a relationship, as I don't see him making effort to understand me. He wanted so much of someone to understand him that he jolly well forgets my feelings.<br><br>As i analyse the situation once again, we both needed someone so much that we misplaces our emotions on the wrong person.<br><br>A seduction that kills, a temptation so irresistable, a love so real yet unable to realise, what can we do but let our wounds heal in time?<br><br>Good bye and I mean it</div></blockquote>sounds so much like u leh.. heheh.. u sure its not u??</div>
