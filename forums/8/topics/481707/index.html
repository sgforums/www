              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">I'm due to do NS soon, but lucky me have both an overseas citizenship and a Singapore citizenship. Dual citizenship rocks!</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Let's
               say if I AWOL/ default/ desert NS after the 1st 2 weeks confinement 
              period of BMT, will the homeland security and borders protection 
              authority sieve me out if I am going to use my overseas citizen passport
               to travel to Malaysia to transit/ transfer connecting flight back to my
               overseas country where I belong without getting caught at Malaya?</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">I am not stepping foot to Singapore soil ever again in the rest of my life after my current Exit Permit expiry.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">For
               my sake, my parents honourably paid a $75,000 NS security bond, their 
              retirement fund. But I heck care my parents' money. It's their 
              retirement money. It is not going to me after they passed away anyway. 
              Apparently, they can only get the money back AFTER I ORD from NS. Good 
              game and smart move, Singaporean government.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">My motherland home country is Canada, the maple country, so I am wasting my time "doing time for this Lion city".</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">I emigrated out of Singapore when I was around 7-8 years old, so I am already pretty liberal for no conscription.</p>

              <p><strong>Those who require exit permit of 2 years or longer will

              Guarantee must be furnished. The amount of the security bond is
              S$75,000 or 50% of the combined gross annual income of both parents

              their NS responsibilities.<br> <br> <strong>Will young males aged 13 to 16.5 who fail to apply for an
              exit permit be sentenced to imprisonment?</strong><br> <br> The penalty for exit permit offences of young males aged 13 to 16.5
              will be a fine of up to $2,000, with no custodial sentences. They

              applying for an exit permit would have committed an offence under
              the Enlistment Act. They will be liable upon conviction to a fine

              <p>Controversy arose when the penalties were increased in January

              Tan</a>, who was born in Singapore, received a fine for defaulting

              later acquired British nationality.

              punishments defaulters would face:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the default period exceeds two years but the defaulter is
              young enough to serve his full-time and operationally ready NS
              duties in full, MINDEF will press for a short jail sentence.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the defaulter has reached an age when he cannot serve his
              full-time NS in a combat vocation or fulfil his operationally ready
              NS obligations in full, a longer jail sentence to reflect the
              period of NS he has evaded may be appropriate.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the defaulter has reached an age when he cannot be called
              up for NS at all, a jail sentence up to the maximum of three years
              may be appropriate.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Each year, a small number of people are convicted for their
              failure to enlist or refusal to be conscripted. Most of them were <a title="Jehovah's Witnesses" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a>, who are usually
              court-martialled and sentenced to three years' imprisonment, but
              they are usually held in a low-security detention facility and
              separated from other conscription offenders. The government does
              not consider <a title="Conscientious objector" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientious_objector">conscientious objection</a> to be a legal reason for
              refusal to serve NS. Since 1972, the publications of Jehovah's
              Witnesses have been outlawed in Singapore. This is commonly misinterpreted to mean
              that Jehovah's Witnesses themselves are outlawed in Singapore.</p>

              <p>It was to be a decision many Singaporean boys who have grown up 
              overseas, would have to make – whether to return home to Singapore and 
              serve National Service (NS). Not necessarily an easy decision for any 
              19-year-old Singaporean; not when you’ve lived the last 11 years of your
               life overseas. </p>

              <p>For Sherman Pay, home had been in the Chinese city of Xiamen in Fujian 
              province where he lived with his family. They would return twice a year 
              to visit their relatives, often during Chinese New Year and the summer 
              holidays. Save for his relatives, Sherman had hardly any friends in 
              Singapore. Not surprising, given that he had spent most of his growing 
              up years away from Singapore.</p>
              <p><img style="width: 380px; height: 318px;" src="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/IMG_2290%283%29.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><em>Sherman is ‘focused and ready’!</em></p>
              <p>His parents had made known their preference for the family to remain as
               Singaporeans. He recalled his mother signing him up for tours that took
               him around Singapore’s landmarks during his visits back as a child.</p>
              <p>While serving NS, Sherman lives with his uncle. However, being away 
              from his immediate family does take its toll: “Sometimes I really miss 
              them. I have learned to appreciate them more, especially  when I am 
              feeling lonely. There would be times when I feel really down. But for 
              me, my mom had brought me up to be independent and that really helped”.</p>
              <p>‘<strong>What-Ifs’ and ‘How-Woulds’</strong></p>
              <p>Prior to Sherman’s decision to return home to serve NS, his parents had
               concerns. Their uneasiness rubbed off on Sherman as well: “My mom was 
              worried that I might get bad influence as there were people from all 
              walks of life serving NS. She was also afraid that I couldn’t blend in 
              and it would be hard for me to make friends. I was worried that I would 
              be quite alone as I didn’t have friends (in Singapore) to begin with. I 
              didn’t know how physical it (NS training) would get as I didn’t have my 
              physical education here, so I didn’t know how (physically) fit I was 
              compared to Singaporeans here. I didn’t know if I could keep up with the
               physical standards. My mum was worried about cultural differences 
              because I don’t interact with Singaporeans that often. She was also 
              worried I may not adapt to it.”</p>
              <p><img style="width: 410px; height: 250px;" src="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/MVI_2531.jpg" alt=""><br> <em>All geared up behind the ROS</em></p>
              <p>As for his father, he was worried as to whether Sherman was both 
              physically and mentally strong enough to endure the training and demands
               of a soldier and if he might be bullied by his platoon sergeants. “I 
              think it was because he believed Army trainings mean harsh treatments by
               the sergeants, but in reality, the trainings are carried out 
              professionally with safety as a priority,” Sherman says with a grin. It 
              helped that Sherman had Singaporean friends he’d grown up with in Xiamen
               who’d returned ahead of him to serve NS and they were able to cope well
               in NS.</p>
              <p><strong>Flying High In Many Ways</strong></p>
              <p>Sherman has been doing well in NS since his enlistment two years ago. 
              The well-respected officer with the Republic of Singapore Air Force 
              (RSAF) is addressed by his men and superiors in the 128 Squadron as ‘2LT
               Sherman Pay’. He makes no qualms about aspiring to be an officer prior 
              to his enlistment. “I have a few cousins who went to OCS (Officer Cadet 
              School), so they told me, ‘If you can, try to be an officer as the 
              experience would be more enriching.’ Therefore that was my goal during 
              BMT; I was very motivated.” Despite the initial anxieties, Sherman felt 
              that serving NS has been a good and positive experience for him and it 
              has made him mature from a boy to a man.</p>
              <p><br> It wasn’t just a positive attitude and hearing about success stories 
              that got Sherman geared up for life in military fatigues. He credits his
               superiors who were very supportive and maintained an open communication
               channel with him during his Basic Military Training (BMT): “My 
              supervisors did a good job. My OC (Officer Commanding) in BMT (Basic 
              Military Training), he tried to engage us overseas Singaporeans, on 
              enlistment day and told us that if we had any problems, if we couldn’t 
              blend in, to look for him and he would help us. When we’re down, he’ll 
              always motivate us. Although your family is not around, but during the 
              time in NS, you have your so-called ‘brothers’, your bunkmates (and) 
              they’ll also motivate you.” Yes, training will get tough, but the 
              recruits will have to support each other to spur on and pull through 
              together.</p>
              <p><img style="width: 440px; height: 290px;" src="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/IMG_2307.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><em>Setting up the ROS</em></p>
              <p>These days, Sherman literally has a bird’s eye view on things through 
              the videos by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), which would be fed back 
              to the Receive-Only Station (ROS) that he operates with his team. The 
              video feed, when relayed to the ground commanders, provides better 
              battlefield situational awareness and enhances mission effectiveness.</p>
              <p><strong>Appraisal to be Well-Adapted</strong></p>
              <p>Sherman’s immediate supervisor Major (MAJ) Sam Ong, the OC in charge of
               ROS for 128 Squadron, says that Sherman has adapted very well in the 
              Squadron. He believes Sherman’s positive experience in BMT and how those
               who had returned from overseas to serve NS were actively engaged by 
              their superiors, set the foundation for a smoother transition for the 
              recruits. “Those things are very important because the initial phase is 
              when these overseas Singaporeans will need to adjust to the change in 
              environment and that’s when engagement must come to the forefront. When 
              Sherman came to the unit, I didn’t feel that he had any problems 
              adjusting to the operational requirements of 128 Squadron. That 
              foundation served him well and enabled him to adapt to the operational 
              tempo without any difficulties” says MAJ Ong.</p>
              <p><img style="width: 400px; height: 277px;" src="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/IMG_2347.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><em>Sherman with Major Ong</em></p>
              <p>MAJ Ong regards Sherman as “a very outstanding NSF who’s not just able 
              to lead when he’s required to, but he’s also a very capable team player.
               Sherman’s positive attitude and his willingness to take on challenges 
              and overcome them will serve him well in the future”.</p>
              <p>Does MAJ Ong feel that Singaporean youths who return from overseas to 
              serve NS are disadvantaged in some way? He doesn’t believe so as 
              information is readily available in this age of connectivity and ease of
               access to the internet, where “you’re able to sift out information 
              pertaining to NS. It’s this sense of wanting to find out what’s ahead 
              that makes the difference. Perhaps years ago when information was 
              limited, that would have made it more difficult for overseas 
              Singaporeans to find out more about NS”.</p>
              <p><strong>Seeing Significance in NS</strong></p>
              <p>The most memorable event for Sherman was when he was commissioned as an
               officer. “My parents came back to attend my commissioning parade and 
              they were very proud of me. After being commissioned as an officer, you 
              will take up a leadership role. So, you’ll need to exercise a lot of 
              your leadership skills. When you have to inspire people to be more 
              capable beyond their normal abilities, make them go an extra mile, 
              that’s when it feels very rewarding,” he says, beaming with a sense of 
              accomplishment.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 450px; height: 300px;" src="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/IMG_2376.jpg" alt=""> <br> <em>Posing beside a UAV</em></p>
              <p>How this contrasts to his initial scepticism of how serving NS would 
              help in the defence of a small nation like Singapore. That faded after 
              Sherman underwent the National Education programmes conducted by his 
              supervisors. It then dawned on him the crucial role each serviceman, 
              himself included, played in national security and the defence of 
              Singapore. MAJ Ong believes that the key to creating a positive NSF 
              experience is to make sure the NSFs understand and internalise their 
              role in national defence”.</p>
              <p>But it is easy to think that two years serving NS is two years too 
              long. In Sherman’s perspective, “If you think of your career, your 
              studies, it’s a postponement of two years. So before I enlisted, I was 
              also thinking, ‘You waste two years of your life. People already get 
              their degrees and you’re still studying. People are already working’. 
              But after I enlisted, I realised I learnt a lot during NS. I learnt 
              about leadership, having a positive mindset, how to overcome hardship – 
              these kinds of things. The experience was enriching in many ways, and in
               the end I felt I’ve become more mature and better equipped as a person.
               My two years in NS wasn’t wasted”.</p>

              <p>When we hear of National Service (NS), it is often assumed that it 
                                relates to the time spent with the army or the SAF, but that’s not 
                                always the case. “Growing up, my father always talked about the SAF and 
                                his time there, so I always thought that I would be joining the SAF. So 
                                when I received my enlistment letter and found out that I was to join 
                                the SCDF, I was definitely surprised!” Such was SGT (Sergeant) Raphael 
                                Tan’s initial response when the enlistment letter indicated that he was 
                                to join the Singapore Civil Defence Force for two years of NS. In this <a href="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/articles/d/ns-through-the-lens-of-an-overseas-singaporean-part-1">second issue </a>of
                                 ‘NS through the Lens of an Overseas Singaporean’, we met up with 
                                Raphael Tan, a Singaporean who lived abroad and came back home to serve 
                                NS in the SCDF.</p>
              <p>Since his birth, Raphael has had to adapt to both Western and Asian 
                                cultures due to his parents’ commitments in missionary work and overseas
                                 businesses. “I was born in Cardiff, Wales and spent a couple of years 
                                growing up in the UK and in Sweden before coming back to Singapore for 
                                pre-school. Following that, we left for Bangkok, Thailand in which I 
                                spent 13 years there.”</p>
              <p>When it was time to return for his NS stint and not knowing what to 
                                expect, a nervous Raphael went on to find out as much as he could about 
                                the Singapore Civil Defence Force. “Despite being a little worried, when
                                 I found out that they train fire-fighters, I was actually quite excited
                                 about it,” revealed the young sergeant. For those unfamiliar with the 
                                SCDF, this uniformed organisation belongs to the Ministry of Home 
                                Affairs and plays a critical role in Singapore by providing 
                                fire-fighting, rescue and emergency ambulance services. They also 
                                oversee the implementation of fire safety and civil defence shelter 
                                matters.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 620px; height: 363px;" src="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/photo%203%282%29.JPG" alt=""><br>  <em>SGT Raphael Tan (left) demonstrating a training drill with two of his trainees</em></p>
              <p>When enlistment day arrived, a sense of uncertainty could be felt among
                                 the new recruits, “I was quite nervous but I wasn’t the only one 
                                because on the first day, you see many other nervous boys as well.” He 
                                was quick to reassure though, saying, “The instructors were quite kind 
                                and understanding as they were once in our shoes as well, so it wasn’t 
                                too bad actually.”</p>
              <p>What helped Raphael was that his overseas experience allowed him the 
                                opportunity to meet different people from diverse backgrounds. This made
                                 interacting with others in the SCDF much easier for him, especially 
                                when certain situations force you out of your comfort zone. “We had a 
                                training stint at Outward Bound in Sabah,” recalls Raphael, “and did 
                                hiking treks into dense jungles. A lot of us were placed out of our 
                                comfort zones and because of that, you could really see what people were
                                 really like. It was a real eye-opening experience where we learnt a lot
                                 about ourselves and of each other.”</p>
              <p>Following his basic training phase, Raphael is now a Fire and Rescue 
                                Specialist trainer. “I’m in the fire-fighting branch, so I instruct 
                                trainees on how to fight different kinds of fire.” Fires like flashovers
                                 and backdrafts are just some of the many thermal accidents that 
                                fire-fighters encounter and have to deal with. One of the ways to do 
                                that efficiently is to ensure that they are well-versed in their drills,
                                 in which our trainer/resident expert and his team will give you a sneak

              <p>Having almost completed his two-year NS stint, Raphael now looks 
                                forward to becoming a Physical Therapist in the field of Sports Sciences
                                 and will take the skills that he has learnt from the SCDF with him 
                                wherever he goes. He reflects, “There are many things that I’ve gained 
                                from the SCDF and a lot of what I’ve learnt can be used in most 
                                emergency situations in our daily lives. I’ll bring along all these 
                                knowledge with me and touch wood, if I need to draw upon them one day, 
                                at least I’ll be mentally well-equipped.”</p>

              <p>While there are some who might still feel that NS is a hindrance, both 
                                to their career and study plans, to Raphael, NS is an opportunity to 
                                continue learning new life skills in an environment that is unlike any 
                                other. “You’re going to go through a lot of new experiences so take it 
                                all in and you’ll learn a lot of new things. Embrace it because a lot of
                                 what you will experience here, you won’t get a chance to do so outside 
                                of NS. Once you leave, you might just miss the time you’ve spent here.”</p>
