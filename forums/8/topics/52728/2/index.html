            <div class='col-md body'>Utter bilge.<br><br><blockquote>We feel that the teacher's words have been taken out of context.</blockquote>If anything, the writer is taking things out of context by reducing the focus to simply encompass the teacher's words.  The issue here is what was said <strong>and</strong> how it was said.<br><br><blockquote>We ask those aggrieved to download and watch the clip. We are convinced that it will speak for itself and present an accurate account of what transpired.</blockquote>The very fact that the teacher's behaviour was in a public place to be filmed is what truly speaks for itself.<br><br><blockquote>Watching it brought back warm memories from our school days. </blockquote>Warm memories?  I cannot imagine what fresh hell their lives must be these days to look back at such things fondly.<br><br><blockquote>Teachers serve as surrogate parents to impish youth. To keep a "professional distance" and maintain the sterile propriety that this requires inevitably sacrifices the care and concern that students need at that tender age. Parents cannot be "professional" with their children.</blockquote>Teachers are their parents?  Are all the students of RJC orphans?  Who, quite literally, died and put them in charge?  If there is a parenting role to be performed, it is for the <strong>parents</strong>.  These are teachers we are talking about - they do this as a job and are under obligation to conduct themselves in a professional manner.  Also note how the writer starts by talking of teachers as surrogate parents and ends the paragraph by dropping the "surrogate" part - what a sham.<br><br><blockquote>Are we raising our children to be so emotionally fragile that tearing up their poorly-done homework in class constitutes abuse? Is this how we insure our collective future?<br><br>We wish to halt the trend that is turning our teachers into customer service officers. Teachers need an empowered hand to carry out the difficult task of grooming the next generation. </blockquote>This is an irrelevant point.  Regardless of the effects on the student, the teacher's conduct was unprofessional.<br><br><blockquote>None of the undersigned has any qualms with enrolling our children in the teacher's class. We are gratified that there is someone who cares enough about each student to take a personal interest in them.</blockquote>They obviously do not like their children very much, if they are going to subject them to a teacher who behaves in this manner.<br><br>This is a ridiculously poor attempt at spin control.  These misguided individuals hold the warped view that teachers ought to hammer their students into shape, rather than mould them.<br><br>The irony here is that if you look past their rhetoric, there is no substance to their argument.  They were obviously not taught very well.<br><br>I was a substitute teacher for a few months before I started university, and from that perspective I have to say that I am not at all impressed with this RJC tutor.<br><br>Those of you who have served national service would be familiar with the concept of command and control.  If things have gotten out of hand, it is a lack of command and control on the teacher's part.  That was the attitude I took when I was teaching and today, years later, the students that I run into still recall how I always stayed on top of things.  A key element of command and control is earning the subordinatesÂ’ respect by doing things the right way Â– this has pretty much been covered in the Â“respect for the ranksÂ” thread.<br>Another element is making sure that you remain a step ahead of the game.<br><br>The first question I would ask is, Â“What on earth was she trying to achieve by berating the student in front of the class?Â”.<br><br>If she was trying to get him to improve his work, certainly her training as a teacher would already have let her know that this approach would not work; speaking to him on a one-to-one basis, without the distraction of having other students around, would have worked much better.<br><br>Alternatively, she was simply venting her spleen at the student.  In that case, her actions were plain wrong and she was rightly exposed.<br><br>The Education Minister's assessment of the situation as an invasion of privacy is pure bunkum.  Had she spoken (and I use this term very loosely) to the student in a private setting, the video would not have been taken.<br><br>An even more important question is, "What does the teacher's behaviour say about the state of the situation?".  Had things gotten so far out of control that she was compelled to do that?  Let us examine the implications if the answer to that questin is yes, and also if the answer is no.<br><br>If the teacher was compelled by the circumstances to speak to the  student in that manner, it is a sign of failure on her part.  She has had at least six months to exert an influence on the student's work behaviours (up to eighteen if he was a JC2 student).  Within that space of time, did she neglect him and allow his to go down what she claims to be a slovenly track?  Did she attempt to correct the situation?  Either way, the simple fact, reflected by the result, is that she failed.<br><br>If the teacher berated the student in such a manner without compelling reason, she should seriously consider changing professions.  My suggestion would be that she audition to be part of the audience at Jerry Springer.  If this was the case, she has simply lost the plot.  She is there to do a job, and that job is to teach.  If she were to teach, she would be attempting to impart knowledge to him of what he should be doing, instead of only attempting to pillory him with what he should not be doing.  She has committed a cardinal sin in teaching - offering a complaint without suggestion of a solution.  None of her actions were within the scope of what she was paid for.<br><br>The delicious irony of all of this is that the teacher was caught on film doing what she was not supposed to do, all the time harping on about the student doing what he was not supposed to do.<br><br>The equation here is simple.  If the student chose to do improper work, his marks would be reciprocal to his efforts.  If he had a genuine problem, berating him would not have helped - why flog a dead horse?  The effort put into the teacher's histrionic performance would have been much better used in identifying the source of the problem and guiding the student to a solution (which, as I understand it, forms a key assumption in the teacher's employment contract).  If he was simply recalcitrant, he is the one who would have to live with his results.<br><br>The teacher's conduct was unprofessional and it was irresponsible.  Whatever the circumstances were, they form no mitigation whatsoever, and she had no business acting the way she did.<br><br>There is nothing at all wrong with the other student filming the event.  This being a supposedly democratic society, transparency and accountability must be maintained.  The ban on PDAs in classrooms is a step backwards to an archaic situation in which the students are gagged.  Personally, I would have given the student a medal for keeping the teacher honest.<br><br>The bottom line is simple.  She was caught misbehaving, and when the film was released, justice was done.</div>

Vijayan </strong><br><br>HOLY Innocents' High teacher Neo Shiea Chee, 25, who died after she was run over by an MRT train in January, was most probably reading her students' homework when she unwittingly stepped off the platform and fell onto the tracks.<br><br>Engrossed in reading, Madam Neo walked off the platform.<br>Madam Neo was run over by a train at Ang Mo Kio MRT station shortly before 7pm on Jan 11.<br><br>A district court heard last week that Madam Neo was seen engrossed in reading shortly before 'she walked straight off the platform and fell onto the tracks'.<br><br>In recording a verdict of misadventure, State Coroner Malcolm Tan noted that she had fallen when the train was approaching the station.<br><br>'There was nothing the MRT officers could have done to further ensure the safety of the passengers on the platform,' he said.<br><br>Although the train driver applied the emergency brakes, the train was unable to stop in time and ran over Madam Neo. After the accident, mechanical checks on the train showed that it was in proper working order.<br><br>The train driver was also cleared of any wrongdoing as medical checks showed he had not taken any intoxicating substance at the time.<br><br>In arriving at his verdict, the State Coroner also ruled out the possibilities that someone had pushed Madam Neo off the platform or that she had been electrocuted.<br><br>The platform was not crowded at the time, he said. No one could have pushed her because she was alone and there was no one behind her.<br><br>Her body was found some distance away from the part of the track where a live electric wire ran, he added, and she could not have been electrocuted.<br><br>Describing her death as 'tragic', the judge said: 'In these circumstances, I find that no one had been criminally concerned or has been negligent in causing her death.'<br><br>Calling Madam Neo a dedicated teacher, he concluded that she could have been reading her students' tutorials, which were found at the spot where she had fallen off the platform.<br><br>The State Coroner also offered his sympathies to Madam Neo's family, pointing out that the teacher had probably been unconscious when the train ran over her.<br><br>'The next of kin, family and friends can take some cold comfort from the fact that it is likely that she had been knocked out cold... she was motionless throughout the period that she was on the tracks,' he said.<br><br>At an interview yesterday, Holy Innocents' High principal Pauline Wong said the verdict confirmed what she had always suspected.<br><br>'Given who she was and what she was, how else could it have happened but in that way?,' said Mrs Wong.<br><br>In addition to being a form teacher, Madam Neo taught mathematics and was also the school's pastoral care coordinator.<br><br>'She was a very pleasant and sociable person who would take time to greet people, to make conversation and to write notes to cheer people when they were down.'<br><br>Students remembered her fondly, said Mrs Wong, with some even writing about her when assigned to write an essay titled Fate a few months ago.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No, Xcert, it is not nothing.  Let me put it another way.

I certainly have had plenty of teachers that I have absolutely no gratitude towards.  At the same time, I have been fortunate to have had a fair number of teachers who have made left things in a better state than when they arrived.  These are not the ones who coerce - they do a much better job by convincing and inspiring, and they understand the difference between assertiveness and aggression.<br><br>If you have never had a teacher who you afraid of letting down, who got you to keenly feel where you went wrong by making sure that you understood precisely why it was wrong instead of letting out their frustrations on you, I pity you because you have never had a real teacher.<br><br>A clear example of the kind of teacher that I am talking about is Brother Michael Broughton at SJI - the Josephians on this forum will know who I am talking about.  We had some students who would make saints swear, but I never saw him lose his cool once.  At the same time, I do not know many of his students who were not deathly afraid of disappointing him, because to do so would be a crime against themselves.  Big Mike is always a step ahead of the game - nothing we did shocked him, and he always had an answer for the situation.  He has a way of putting his point across in a manner that brooks no argument, not because he screamed louder than anyone else but because his logic was airtight.  Many of his students are now professionals, and many of still look at him and say, "I want to be like that when I grow up".</div>

It is a matter of common sense (which is unfortunately uncommon) that if you push someone by yelling at him in front of the class and tearing up his homework, betting odds are that he will push back.  Think about your own experiences Â– if you screamed at someone, would he fall over and do everything that you told him to, or would he tell you where you could stick it?  Even if the student did not fire back at the teacher, he would most likely resist passively by not doing what he was told.<br>There is nothing in the teachersÂ’ job description that says that they have to scream at students and Â“wake up their ideasÂ” Â– that is the self-imposed duty of tin-pot dictators.  What teachers <strong>do</strong> have an obligation to do is make the utmost effort to bring out the best in the students Â– this cannot be done if the student does not cooperate with the teacher.   The teacherÂ’s actions were most likely to ensure that the student would not cooperate.  Without the studentÂ’s cooperation, the teacher could not bring out the best in the student.  Ergo, the teacher was not doing her job.  Quod erat demonstradum.<br>This is not a soft approach that we are talking about.

I chose to respond to the professionals who passed the knowledge along clearly and thoroughly without histrionics, and to ignore the amateurs.<br>[quote]True...I also have teachers whom I feel had not taught me well...but if U really think back about it...have they really taught us nothing?Despite the scoldings and all...we learnt something...at least that is what I feel...<br>----------------------------------------------<br>I had a teacher and a lecturer like that...but then the point is whether I want to study what they taught...not because of the approach they use... </blockquote>So you are saying that the teachers are an irrelevant part of the equation.  After all, the subject matter is something you could have gotten by reading the textbook.<br><br>There is a difference between teachers and the halfwit hacks that stumbled into the teaching business because they could not cut it in the real world.  The teachers understand that their job is to generate your interest in the subject, if you were not already interested.  The hacks would take the easy path and ignore the uninterested students, only stopping to go apeshit at them when the results affected their own performance reviews.  This slack attitude is why they could not cut it in the real world in the first place, and they have chosen to defile an honourable profession in the interests of taking an easy paycheck home.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are only 3 issues at stake here:<br>1. the behaviour of the teacher and PRC student in the video clip<br>2. whether the student should have released the video clip on the Net<br>3. whether such recording devices should be allowed in the classroom<br><br>None of us know what really transpired; we only see the teacher scolding the student. We do not know what his standard of work was like, his previous conduct or whether he has a track record for misbehaviour. We do not know whether the teacher has a track record for such outbursts. (I was from RJC and have encountered the teacher; I can safely say she isn't the easiest teacher to work with or stay awake in classes for, but is harmless if you stay in her good books.)<br><br>The whole incident has been sensationalised by the press. They've managed to cast it into a student vs. teacher battle which only polarises the opinion of the public. The ST hit paydirt with this story because it has a lot of capacity for drama and for people to show their worst sides. (Teachers siding with teachers, making hypocritical comments; students siding with students, indignantly defending their right to rebel. Wonderful mudslinging stuff.)<br><br>On the issue of privacy, I guess I have a dangerously biased view. I would agree that whatever happens in front of a whole classroom isn't considered 'private' anymore. On the other hand, posting the clip on the Net is the ultimate form of democratic dissemination. ANYONE can see it. As opposed to, for instance, if the student had just shown it to his friends around school. This is what caused the matter to blow up so spectacularly.<br><br>I'm on the side of The Truth coming out and prevailing, but I can't deny a slight feeling of unease at the way the video clip could spread so fast to so many people. (But you could also argue that if anyone is responsible for throwing the matter wide open to public eyes and violating the teacher's privacy, it's the Straits Times. They printed video captures on page 3, for goodness sakes. I thought that was inexcusable. The teacher was clearly recognisable in those graphics.)<br><br>Finally, on the issue of recording devices in classrooms. There is no need for any policy review by MOE on this matter. It is already adequately covered by the existing policy regarding handphones, beepers and other electronic devices. They are not supposed to be used in classes, even if they're allowed in school. This is a pretty clear-cut rule. A Sony Clie is larger than a handphone. If a teacher is able to spot students illicitly using handphones during class and confiscate the devices, the same can be done for PDAs and camera phones (which are still bloody huge and chunky at this stage of development).<br><br>Public hue and cry is healthy to some extent, and certainly great entertainment, but I think this story has outlived its value. There are a lot more newsworthy school-related dramas to report -- what of the ACS boys who filmed themselves beating up another boy? We haven't heard anything more after the initial microscopic news article on it. They didn't even mention the school name. Don't take everything at face value in our Pacific Area Newspaper of the Year.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Starkindler, you are missing the point here.  The fact of the recording is relevant only inasmuch as it serves to bring the issue up for public debate.  To say that it is all about the recording is to attend to the symptoms and ignore the core of the problem, tantamount to slapping a Band-Aid on the KS lesions of an AIDS patient.<br><br>Recorded or not, the teacher's behaviour is still unacceptable.  It is not good enough to have a harmless teacher - what is required is an effective teacher.</div>
