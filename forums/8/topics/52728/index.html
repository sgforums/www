            <div class='col-md body'>While I apperciate the stress teachers have to go through putting up with those little monsters called students, I can't help but notice some teachers go around with a chip on their shoulder or something. It's one thing to lose it, it's another to pick deliberately on a student or have a shorter fuse on them because they are different or based on some irrational reason.<br><br>Basically, I was one of the students who was a victim of such a system. For some bizzare reason, this teacher kept giving me a hard time in my secondary school, as if she dosen't like my face or something. Well, I wasn't the only one... the other students which were not considered "hip" also recieved the same horror treatment, getting amazing punishments for the slightest fault, some even unintentional. Sure I was no model student in any right, but I was relatively sure that I kept myself out of the problem category.<br><br>On the other hand, this teacher seemed to like the popular students, even the ones with obvious problems just because they were hip? She even let them go for obvious violations and stuff which would have gotten us flogged by her. Or maybe she enjoyed the attention. I shall not speculate, but being on the recieving end of such negative attention from a teacher on the few unlucky students goes a long was to damaging their self-esteem.<br><br>Anyway, long story short. Teachers are human too, in a human system. I don't really hold it against her for treating me like that, and I never really figured out the reason why, but I understood these are the failings of a failed world. I guess this is the best light to view this whole thing in. I guess my very existence, the very idea of who I was and what I stood for just rubbed her the wrong way. I can't really help that.<br><br>Basically, as an grad of the system, I have this advice to all students who kenna this kind of thing. Pay little heed to it (unless of course the critizism was constructive) and try to get through the system unscathed. No point running into trouble again and again... it's more efficent to just grin and bear it.</div>

Hard handed tactics are effective sometimes for some people.<br><br>Anyway, next part is a bit biased but juz let me rantle a bit. The guy is a PRC student. Mentioned in the clip. PRC means Peoples' Republic of China. Quite a few come over and study before going on to NUS or NTU. So poor command of english seems pretty likely. And heck, think he deserves it. Darn PRCs deserve some humbling and cultivation.</div></blockquote>abt deserving it, i tink only its cuz he was late in handling in his work, i picked tt up, tardy in handing in work all the time.. but content wise, its up to individual experience in writing, it wasn't fair to whack him on that. esp in literature, its a complicated subject lor..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

The first is the use of the phrase "crafty old rat" to describe the student. The second is the tearing up of his homework.<br>.<br>We studied the video clip, heard every word spoken and the tone which was used. We feel that the teacher's words have been taken out of context.<br>.<br>Her remarks on the student's craftiness were immediately followed by the words "...that is using the literary language from my training as a literature student".<br>.<br>This was spoken in a critical tone, but one clearly devoid of malice. She was composed in dealing with the matter. We thus cannot consider this an unqualified personal attack bordering on abuse.<br>.<br>Secondly, the homework was apparently handed in late, out of point, against instructions and with supporting articles clearly outside the assignment's ambit. All these were in breach of a promise to maintain good conduct made by the student just one week before. The teacher said that other students had no problems complying with her directives.<br>.<br>We ask those aggrieved to download and watch the clip. We are convinced that it will speak for itself and present an accurate account of what transpired.<br>.<br>Watching it brought back warm memories from our school days. We have all been guilty of misdemeanours and have received various punishments, including staying back after school, standing outside the class during lessons and the occasional "invitation" to the headmaster's chambers.<br>.<br>And who can forget the fireworks displays that always followed the annual parent-teacher meetings?<br>.<br>We are now serving in a wide variety of professions, including those of business, law, medicine and the civil service. We clearly see the relevance and importance of the discipline that was fostered in us by our teachers.<br>.<br>Teachers serve as surrogate parents to impish youth. To keep a "professional distance" and maintain the sterile propriety that this requires inevitably sacrifices the care and concern that students need at that tender age. Parents cannot be "professional" with their children.<br>.<br>To spare the rod is to spoil the child. Can our small nation afford to pamper its youth?<br>.<br>Are we raising our children to be so emotionally fragile that tearing up their poorly-done homework in class constitutes abuse? Is this how we insure our collective future?<br>.<br>We wish to halt the trend that is turning our teachers into customer service officers. Teachers need an empowered hand to carry out the difficult task of grooming the next generation.<br>.<br>As former students, we know just how mischievous we were. Condoning slovenly attitudes to work would have ultimately compromised our character.<br>.<br>None of the undersigned has any qualms with enrolling our children in the teacher's class. We are gratified that there is someone who cares enough about each student to take a personal interest in them.<br>.<br>The video clip is an eloquent display of a good teacher's disciplinary process. We applaud her for her devotion to her students and wish her well as she continues her tenure as one of our respected teachers.<br>.<br>In closing, we wish to apologise to the teacher for our delayed response. I guess we still haven't learnt to hand in our homework on time.<br>.<br>Sanjeev Kumar<br>.<br>This letter was co-signed by 23 alumni of Raffles Institution, Raffles Girls School and Raffles Junior College.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aiyah, I suspect the reason why this thing got blown up and the students crucified is because this involves the royal school of Raffles... given any other school, we'll probably get a more level headed approach then the witch hunt.<br><br>Basically the message being sent out to all students, and ultimately Singaporeans appears to be "If you are not happy with us, shut up, and if you do speak up, you'll be lynched."<br><br>I don't mind teachers getting tough with the students, but a level of moderation has to be reached when dealing with them. I don't think assualting the person's character cuts it, there are many other ways and words to use that will probably be more effective.<br><br>Basically since we don't know the facts, and they RJC is on damage control mode to protect its reputation, naturally. One can only speculate what happened. But basically it ain't pretty.</div>
