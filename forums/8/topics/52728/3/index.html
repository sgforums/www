            <div class='col-md body'>Gedanken, I did not say it was <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> about the recording. In my first point, I mentioned the conduct of the teacher and students involved, and was trying to give some background on the teacher's past record, which I am somewhat acquainted with.<br><br>I do see your point that inappropriate conduct by teachers should be brought to public attention and not condoned by the school administration. As a student myself, I naturally wish for accountability from teachers and find incidents such as the videotaped outburst unacceptable.<br><br>However, the point I wished to highlight was the way the newspapers swooped upon the story, and the way the public has responded. Of course I cheer for the student whenever I read a letter defending his actions, but from some responses, you would think that the student had been expelled while the teacher was given some Best Disciplinarian award.<br><br>On the contrary. The student was 'reprimanded'; the teacher 'counselled'. If you think about it, students are reprimanded daily. It's certainly less severe a 'punishment' than detention, suspension or expulsion. However, to a teacher, even being called to task for such an incident is a major blot upon her record. The fact that Hodge even <span style="font-style: italic;">publicly admitted</span> fault upon the teacher's part stunned me. This has been unheard of previously.<br><br>I'm not saying that the teacher should have been let off without a word, nor that the student should have been punished severely. I had no great love for the teacher in question during my years at RJ and frequently found her overbearing, long-winded and resistant to change. However, I also knew her to be honest, hardworking and willing to admit error and apologise for it. I think that, without full knowledge of all the facts of the case, the public shouldn't be making such strident judgements. Stop cruficying the teacher (and the students).</div>
