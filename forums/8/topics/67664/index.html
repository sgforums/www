Chitter and chatter standing right smack in the middle of a corridor while people who are walking back have to shuffle to the side to get past them? And dont stereotype either, everyone (all races/nationality/age group/sex) I have seen do it.<br><br>2) as forementioned, chiong into the mrt when the doors open before letting people inside get out. And besides chiong for what, if the thing you are rushing to is THAT urgent, you would have taken a cab.<br><br>3) the reverse of the above, people inside taking their own sweet time to get out-most of the time cus they are too busy talking/saying last goodbyes to friends, sometimes chiong out at the last minute when its the people outside's turn to come in or when the train doors are closing.<br><br>A very long way from being gracious when it actually becomes second nature to being considerate to others first.
