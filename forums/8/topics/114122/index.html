Besides trashing your place, they do invite a lot of nonsense and perhaps ilegal activities to your house and if your neighbour complain about it, you might lose your house.<br>My landlady does spot checks on them to make sure they are not creating issues. However, its never ideal.  If you ask me, renting out to prc, is really a no brainer - never do it unless you are willing to risk it and collect lots of cash from them before they chop you.</div>

If you are lucky, you get good honest students. However, there are some prc students are here to become escot and pros in order to get $ and marry a local idiot and become a Singaporean (This was told to me by a prc herself and it already happen in China's major cities). My landlady complained these group is the most likely to trash up the place, spoil whatever they can spoil most roudy with their friends that neighbours actually complain to the landlady and lastly they always walk around the house in their underwear claiming they feel hot in Singapore (aye, they have air con in their rooms and they are still hot... so something is not right). Plus most of them, register with school but don't go there and lend books or do whatever and never return so you will receive all sorts of warning letters for their misdeeds all logged to your unit cause they don't bother. Under this circumstance, they just want entry to Singapore to better their lives.<br><br>Employers want cheap staff and can only rely on MOM/SIR to provide the paper.

My advice is that, if you can't handle them on the streets, do you want them in your house?<br><br>I would prefer Malaysian although it does not mean they are good either. My last Malaysian girl threw a tantrum and broke the sink and other things unmentionable. But shes a heavy weight and I was very afraid she would beat me up while she bossed me around and drilled holes and spoilt things, so I had to bear with all the grivences even though I paid a higher rent and is the main tenant. The landlady also took the issues out on me so I was badly trapped and frustrated. Then after each stupid tenant from PRC to M'sian, I had to clean up after them and pay all the bills they chalked up. My landlady always lied to me that she will pay the bills once she get the cash. Now I am paying for the whole house because the landlady kick up a fuss that I am difficult to find a suitable tenant.  But if she were in my position, she'd had a heart attack dealing with all the problems these people bring in for you to "put sai"<br><br>truth is I am looking to move out as well.
