But you know that money is in safe hands. Risk is minimal, and when you cash out eventually, profit is made. SMRT is certainly not a punter's counter. Minimal time factor involved too, since I don't monitor this counter. I simply let the money grow slowly and steadily.<br><br>There are counters that I monitor every hour of the day, and set the mobile stock alert to.

            <div class='col-md body'>I can't think of any either. SMRT will yield good rewards in the long run. 2 years or so.<br><br>I meant an accurate speculation when I mentioned hot tip. As for insider trade, there are "legal insider trade" and illegal insider trading. Let's put it this way, say, if I am a VC, and I invested in a hot IT startup. I then cash out during IPO. In my opinion, this is a form of "legal insider trade"... and its definetely more lucrative than playing in the open market. Hee.. more on that some other times.<br><br>I feel that investment should never be exciting. (If NUS was really trying to get students to feel the excitment of trading). When you invest, you study the company, the industry and calculate the risk involved. You then decide whether to take the plunge. This is boring work, never exciting. Those who felt the excitement are nothing more than punters or gamblers. Personal opinion only.. coz I know I will be slaughtered by many for thinking this way.<br><br>Most of my time is spent scooping laksa at my stall. The real me (hee) do not enjoy speculating the market. My portfolio consist of secure and safe investments which will _hopefully_ finance my early retirement.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
