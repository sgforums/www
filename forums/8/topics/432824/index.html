              <p>Long time ago during Qin Shihuang time, he already know that confucius teachings are craps so he made the very wise decision to burn all confucius books and even buried the confuscius scholars alive.</p>
              <p>But than after the Qin dynasty, the future emperors and dynasties belived in the crap that confuscius wrote and even made the imperial exams based on confuscius teachings.</p>
              <p>of course, it did not cause much damage to china at that time even though the people were all studying nonsense written by a person who tried to act smart because at that time China have not come into contact with the rest of the world's civilisation yet so they did not know how backwards and a total rubbish confucius teachings are.</p>
              <p>When it came to the late Qing dynasty, China came into contact with the western worlds. Finally, they worke up from their dreams and realised that confuscius teachings were all rubbish and useless.</p>
              <p>So in 1905 they made the very wise decision to abolish the imperial exams based on confuscius teachings.</p>
              <p>But it seems that after 100 years in today society when china is making alot of progress from learning from the west, it seems that there are now alot of those school lecturers etc who try to make money by teaching confucius teachings by making them into cds to be sold to make money. They even set up schools to teach confucius teachings</p>
              <p>It seems that the useless nonsense confucius teachings are being revived once again in our society trying to harm our society once again.</p>
              <p>This is going to cause alot of damages to our society just like how it damaged the Qing dynasty at that time causing them to become a backward country</p>

              <p>confucius's teachings were good and all but the problem is that it became a means to a way to success, such that people only learned it because then can they become officials to get their big fat bribes. they didnt buy it at all. </p>
              <p>Its not something that will make us third world but something that will give us moral values but it was never something that will govern a country. The legalists way was suited for this. And to be fair, confucius was not the reason of China's downfall to the west. It was the corruption of the government. As recent as Emperor's Qian long reign, china was still on par with the western in terms of weaponaries. </p>
              <p>Even during late qing, there was the Beiyang navy which had modern ships and weapons but it was not maintained and upgraded cause its funds were stolen by Empress Dowager Cixi. </p>
