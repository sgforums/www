              I just bought some goods in one place and want to sell it to a retail shop. Is it legal?
              
              Because I'm afraid only company(which has license) can sell goods to a retail shop, as a individual person, can I also sell the goods to a retail shop?
              
              thanks.

              <p>i dont think they will want to purchase yr goods at a profitable value unless it is something valuable or not found easily.</p>
              <p>Just put yr goods out on the open market  instead of retailers.</p>

              so seems no problem to sell the regular goods, because i'm just afraid of the strict rules in Singapore.
