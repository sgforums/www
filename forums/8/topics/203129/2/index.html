Simply a parking at the handicap usually cost him 3 digit fine. Anyway he did a right thing.  Unless of cause the car owner is a handicap. If everyone did their part in this world. It will be so much a nicer place. We just need to be more considerate towards those who are living around us. Imagine you are a handicap.  Don't you hate people like that.</div>

I had a good mind to snap photos of their cars and send them to Premas or the TP.  Didn't do it because I wasn't sure I wanted to get into confrontations with the owners. This thread just gave me the courage and the moral guidance. Next time, I'll post the photos of the parking cheats on parkingidiots.</div>
