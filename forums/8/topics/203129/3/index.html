            <div class='col-md body'>Excellent job, Schwing. Don't bother with people who accuse you of being a vigilante - they're completely baseless, and shows their ignorance of the definition of vigilantism.<br><br>A vigilante is one who takes the law into his own hands. If Schwing had indeed scratched the car or beaten up the driver, then he would certainly have been one. Instead, he did the converse - he reported the matter up to the relevant authorities. Far from taking the law into his own hands, he let the law handle things properly. What vigilantism? I see this as an act of civic-mindedness.<br><br>The rules are pretty clear on this - no handicapped decal on the windscreen means no parking in disabled lots, period.<br><br>Having a disabled passenger on board does by no means allow parking in disabled lots. If that were the case, then I suppose my father gets to have that privilege every time he drives my disabled grandmother around.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks to all who replied...i'm not asking for recognition or anything, since apart from a few here who really knows me in person, the rest of the forumites might not have seen me before...<br><br>what i am trying to convey is the message that it is time we stop turning a blind eye, we should stop having the mentality that "it's none of my business" or "one day, he will get caught"...from the title of the topic, you can see that i was one of those...and in my post, i told of how i always "gave" that guy a chance, deep down inside, i do not want to be a sabo king...but somehow, whatever happened, happened, and i'm glad that this morning, the handicap lot is vacant, and that neighbour of mine has parked his car in the normal lot...</div>
