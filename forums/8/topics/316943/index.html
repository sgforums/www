              <p>adam khoo's method is all NLPs. like all things, your child needs to be disciplined to excel. all the methods he taught will go down the drain if your child adopts a left in, right out attitude.</p>
              <p>you can borrow books of NLPs to understand its concepts better. i think it has its merits in some areas. however, i am no NLPã€€expert.</p>
              <p>like most singaporeans, we must pay in order to take something more seriously. like the classic slimming/dieting; in most cases, one loses weight if we burn more calories than we take. complement it with a healthy lifestyle like exercising and eating right, most should lose weight after some disciplined effort. but we are somehow more convinced if we part thousands. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"> </p>
              <p>why can't we instill self discipline and self-belief on our own? must we pay to let someone tell us what we already know?</p>

              <p>i was allowed to `sneak in' for his workshop as i have no business to be in his offsite. one of his signature tricks is to ask you to stretch... and then ask you to visualize stretching yourself further and voila, you find yourself actually being able to do so. then he will say that we can all achieve anything if only we put our minds into it. he is the best example.  this is a classic case of us shortchanging ourselves for not pushing the envelope in the things we do; and we have to learn it the expensive way....<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
