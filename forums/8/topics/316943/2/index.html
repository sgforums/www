              <p>Well, this kind of business is make money thingy. He is certainly a rich person for sure. With the high fee rates and fame he has, he certainly has more students than other motivators which is less famous.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have never went for such courses. One sure damn thing we can learn is that one way to get rich is to be like adam khoo, be motivational speaker who keeps rolling the same advice, with some modifications from time to time, that has only gradual improvements in most cases, and fast improvments in rare cases for audiences...</p>

              looks like comments are mixed and results are short-term, i used to get high for a day after a sunday church service when i was a christian...lol...think i'll save the money then and send the kid to grind up on academics....
              
              someone mentioned caning, i'm not one who's shy with the rod but it comes a time when you've got to stop...caning is only for disciplining bad behaviour, not because of bad grades....the kids are now a bit older, it's better to build the communication channels rather then have them turn to their equally unwise peers....thanks for the input....rgds

              <p>Ultimately, effective or not, it simply depends on yourself and nothing else. It may motivate you, it may not. But you choose whether to be motivated or not.</p>

              <p>Many of us already realised that the big part comes from yourself. While most of those who attended have experienced some short term influence, most just revert to their usual ways in life; the way that we have been very used to seeing in. A person can only change if he stop seeing in his usual perspective. And personal perseverence and a deep desire must be there in order to change those bad life habits that we have took years to build.</p>
              <p>Many working adults especially at executive levels also have attended expensive motivational courses. Get the feedback from this people and you will find at least 90% thought they were useless but yet thought what those speakers said were true. In fact, it is even more difficult for adults than teenagers to change because a lot of habits and social behaviour have already being deeply rooted.</p>
              <p>However, there is a difference between those who attended and those who have not! Those who have not attended do not know how to change themselves but those who attended knows somewhat but just lack that personal commitment.</p>
              <p>The first time when I read the "Habits of Highly Effective People" from Stephen Covey was about 10 years ago. But I didn't think much about it until 3-4 yrs ago when I could relate them very deeply in my work. I began to read the book again and have since read it at least 5 times to remind myself of what he say and apply them and even teach them to my wife, children and even my subordinates.</p>
              <p>Don't discard so fast what you have learned. Find reason in yourself and ingrain these reasons in your head! Because those reasons will keep that momentum strong and going for not just 1 month or 1 year but many many years.</p>
