Nowadays, there is no such thing as iron rice bowl.  Civil service also got retrenchment but of course relatively speaking they are more stable than most private firm.<br><br>Nowadays, the govt seem to be also hiring on contract basis.

            <div class='col-md body'>think its true, coz in my own situation one of my new staff asked if my contract has this sentence that says the job is of a contractual nature. I said no, and told her prob it applies to all new staff. coz recently my workplace has got a flood of new staff coming in, obviously there was an exodus of unhappy staff who decided to leave.<br><br>Yes I think even though it is not considered an ironbowl now, it is still far more stable. When I first graduate, I didn't consider I'll come to such a conclusion because I was aiming 'higher' to work in places where specialization is key, not just an inhouse worker.<br><br>But I was wrong, in such 'concentration houses', the company situation may not be stable as they depend on individual projects to feed the company's directors, before the money flows to the ant staff. I got even a friend who worked for a big company but recently downsized, also felt the pressure when she is given 2X the workload. So she kept asking if my workplace is hiring.<br><br>Depends on which ministry, if the job scope is not too sensitive then prob 'retrenchment' chances are higher. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

In fact, most US presidents in the late 20th century have very wealthy or well-to-do backgrounds unlike the ol' days.<br><br>I noticed you said 'serve' in your second para.  Are they our leaders or servants?  Would you be willing to serve for free for a term of office?  And we're talking about serving more than 3 million people here.  Also, you can't apply for the job as a minister.  You'll have to be chosen based on your merit.  I'm not sure if you've tried serving for free, but just give it a go without any form of compensation for say... 2 years straight and full time.  And I'm not talking National Service.

Being smaller, there is less of the "it is not my responsibility" kind of bullshit and also less of the "We got a procedure" or "Sorry, we cannot promote or increase your pay because you don't have a degree" kind of bullshit too. You get things done, you get appreciated, you get your pay increase, sometimes, doubling or tripling your pay easily.</div>

Are they our leaders or servants?  Would you be willing to serve for free for a term of office?  And we're talking about serving more than 3 million people here.  Also, you can't apply for the job as a minister.  You'll have to be chosen based on your merit.  I'm not sure if you've tried serving for free, but just give it a go without any form of compensation for say... 2 years straight and full time.  And I'm not talking National Service.  I'm talking stuff like social work.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div></blockquote>I don't think u get my point. No one is asking them to serve for free. But why are we paying them a million a year.

So they should have it around that mark ...not million dollars. Then again no one care...I also don't care lor ..<br><br>I just think the rest of the money could be better spent on helping needy singaporeans.<br><br>Feel free to vote me into office HAHAHHA....of course my asking salary will be standard....then again ..with a million dollars *drools*.

They are serving you, and doing a good job at it too if you want to compare them with other countries.  If you pay peanuts, you get monekys, right?  There are so many things that Singapore has attained that our neighbours wished they could.<br><br>A whole mill a year?  Dude, are you sure of your figures?  Even if you were right, how many of them are getting that wage rate?  If I remember right, ministers' pay are aligned with CEOs of top companies.<br><br>I agree with your example with the 'hire-and-fire' systems in corporations.  But even if a corporation dies, a country moves on.  And corporations have systems that allow them to adapt to shocks more easily than if a government changed hands just like that, even if it's 4 years.  Personally, observing historical trends and analysing our culture, we don't have mechanisms to adapt to immediate change.  Honestly, the price will be bigger than a mill a year.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>
