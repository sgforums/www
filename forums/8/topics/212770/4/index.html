The clock is worth S$1850, and JC2 students have to pay $2 each to cover the cost. The clock will be used to replaced the existing clock in the hall that was contributed as 1993's "farewell gift". Ignoring the chinese implication of giving a clock, we fast forward to present.<br><br>The school finally received the clock, and it was up.<br><br><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/471/320/PICT1227.jpg"><br><br>http://weikiatblog.blogspot.com/2006/09/lol-and-behold-18k-clock.html<br><br>Holy cow! This kind of clock worth 1.8K?<br><br></div></blockquote>Are you from the school? If so, I would only blame you and your fellow students for the utter stupidity you guys displayed. Apparently, the youth of this generation are too meek to even voice their disapproval upfront. But only choosing to whine and make sarcastic remarks in a forum.<br><br>Bright. Real bright.</div>

The first time we heard of it, we were promptly asked to pay up. Councillor says they already ordered it, and it is on its way. Just pay.

            <div class='col-md body'>targa4, what's wrong with airing one's view in online forums like these? and why are forums like sgforums,stomp,youngpap,hwz so damn popular?cos they are a platform for us to air our views...duh...<br><br>and like what some others had mentioned, the issue is with that j1 councillor taking things into his/her own hands without even seeking the opinions of the j2s,  esp when a big-ticket purchase like this is involved where the practicality of such an item is in doubt....and not about the school admin per se<br><br>here is a guy who is trying to improve the welfare of his fellow schoolmates(go his blog and checkout his entries about possible improvements to his school's facilities...) so please quit saying that he is only an empty vessel trying to tarnish his school's reputation.<br><br>We need more people like him that dare to raise such issues so that there are check and balances in our society to prevent more NKF scandals from happening...or i guess u rather be bo chap and not know where did ur money go to?<br><br>Btw,complaining to the school admin is just like u trying to complain to the government like that, u think they really care to even bother about small frys like the students? Try complaining to the government and tell us when u're successful...lol even though there are feedback channels in schools and singapore alike...u seriously think that you alone can make a change happen?[/b]</div>
