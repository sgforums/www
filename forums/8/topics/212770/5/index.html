Try complaining to the government and tell us when u're successful...lol even though there are feedback channels in schools and singapore alike...u seriously think that you alone can make a change happen?</strong>[/b]</blockquote>I'm not even argueing on why the clock is justified.

            <div class='col-md body'>Believe it or not, December is in my class.<br>And beware, do not write his name on yr blog. He searches google regularly for blogs mentioning his name, and if you say bad things about him, your blog kana spammed.<br><br>I would also like to mention an interesting story.<br><br>Once there was this physics timed practise. He never study, so "consulted" one of the girl in my class (and the only one who don't actually detest sitting next to December) for answers by stealing glance at her answers, then making his own answer. Interestingly, he failed that test, and blamed the girl. When the girl looks uneasy, he said "Can't you take a joke?" The girl gave a standard reply, "Depends on what kind."<br><br>December went home and scolded that poor girl a bit3h on his blog.<br><br>When I recounted this incident objectively (without insulting December) on my blog, December went to the teacher.<br><br>I also heard that his name in secondary school was Racheal.
