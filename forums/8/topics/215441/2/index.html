It is based on a scale devised by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to provide a way for broadcasts and newspapers to report air quality on a daily basis.<br><br>The PSI is reported as a number on a scale of 0 to 500 and is the air quality indicator. These index figures enable the public to determine whether the air pollution levels in a particular location are good, unhealthy, hazardous or worse. The PSI is used in a number of countries including the United States and Singapore. <span style="color: red;">[b]However since 1999, the United States EPA has replaced the Pollution Standards Index (PSI) with the Air Quality Index (AQI) to incorporate new PM2.5 and ozone standards.</span></strong>"<br><br>It is stated in NEA's website:<br><br>"Note:<br>Hourly updates of 3-hr PSI readings are provided from 6am to 12am.The 3-hr PSI readings are calculated based on <span style="color: red;"><strong>PM10 concentrations only</strong></span>."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> [/b]</blockquote>I believe they are right.<br><br>There are 5 pollutants designated as 'criteria pollutants' in the reporting of the PSI. They are:<br><br>dust or particulate matter of 10 micron in size (PM10),<br>sulphur dioxide,<br>nitrogen dioxide,<br>carbon monoxide and<br>ozone.<br><br>The recorded levels of these pollutants are used to produce a single index (PSI) on a scale of 0 - 500. The <span style="color: red;"><strong>highest</strong></span> reading of only any one of the criteria pollutants when converted into its corresponding PSI values shall be reported as the air quality level for the day.<br><br>Remember PM10 is invisible. If you can see the haze, you are actually looking at the larger particulates. The available equipment only measures the concentrations of particulates at invisible sizes. So thick (visible) haze need not necessarily correspond to high PM10 (invisible) readings all the time.<br><br>Also remember smoke comprises condensation and vapours as well as dust. In the morning, there might well be mists as well. These also add to the reduced visibility. Condensation and vapours are not measured by the equipment because the air is dried before it is passed over the sensor.<br><br>PM10, being smaller and lighter than the bigger dusts, can also travel faster and further. Therefore it is also possible that a thick (visible) haze which is a few days old contains only the bigger and slower moving particulates. Most of the (invisible) PM10 may have already blown away, especially if there are no fresh new source of the lighter PM10.<br><br></div>
