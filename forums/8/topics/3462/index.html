            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Mr. Seak<br><br>THE INTELLIGENT NOKIA 8310<br><br>I would like to commend on the fascinating features of the Nokia 8310.<br><br>In all the years that I have been using mobile phones, no other phone has given me the opportunity to take so much time-off from my work in order that I can pay your service center a visit. This routine of visiting your service center has certainly given me the chance to get acquainted with your staff. I can even recognize them by their faces now!<br><br>My Nokia 8310 is an intelligent phone designed way ahead of its time.<br><br>Firstly, the intelligent auto-off system that Nokia has incorporated into my phone has enabled me to look at the people in my surroundings by constantly allowing me to take my eyes off the phone to remind me that I am not living in my own electronic world. The term "connecting people" certainly makes more sense now.<br><br>Secondly, it has even got a built-in self-organizing phone book that has assisted me by erasing all the phone numbers in my phone book. That way I do not have to erase numbers that are no longer in use.<br><br>Next, it has even provided me with a good excuse not to return missed calls by not showing any missed calls and blocking access to the missed calls function of the phone.<br><br>Last but not least, I would like to commend on the cost savings function that you have incorporated into my new motherboard. Occasionally, the phone will restrict incoming/outgoing calls and outgoing text<br>messages. This new added feature will definitely reduce my phone bills, as charges are applicable only to callers who send me text messages. Oh yes, it is such joy that I am able to receive text messages!<br><br>Today marks the occasion of my 7th visit to your service center in the 5th month that I've owned the phone. That will shortly be followed by the 8th when I collect my phone. I am really looking forward to sitting in the waiting area again and looking at the nice posters that you have put up for our viewing pleasure.<br><br>I do have a small request that you would put up new posters for my 9th and 10th visit which I am anticipating as it is not within your company policy to change the S$600 + 2 years contract lemon that I have purchased from you.<br><br>Thank you for your time in reading my mail and you can be sure that I will do my utmost best to tell my friends about the wonderful features of my Nokia phone.<br><br>I do wonder if Ericsson phones have such features; guess the only way to find out is to make my next purchase an Ericsson.<br><br>Yours sincerely<br>ipowersia &lt;-- replace my name<br><br>------------------<br>[Join #love_solver in galaxynet, where your love problems can be solved by our emotional experts...][No risk No $$]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yes it seems the newer nokia phones have an alarming rate of protest against their users.<br><br>Blame it on their highly addictive plan to corner the market with so many new models that they trade quality with quantity.<br><br>FYI, Ericsson phones nowadays are free from auto-offs and frequent hanging since their merger with sony. Technology has blossomed since their move to sub-contract out the production processes and focus solely on R n D.<br><br>That plan at least seems to be working.<br><br>Hope Nokia doesn't commit the same error.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I wonder if thereÂ’s forward marketing planning stuffs from h.p. companies???<br><br>For example, nokia is selling 32XX now and their head honchos are planning for next few year's 33XX, or 34XX etc etc....<br><br>I presume that to save cost on all these 3XXXs models they will be using the same circuit board(rect shape)and cover designs and by just adding different programs or chips to each models and packing it with different external designs and they have a new model.<br><br>just like undercarriage(platforms) for cars, car manufacturers are cutting cost by sharing the undercarriage for saloons, coupes and hatches and are saving billions of dollars every year.<br><br>so by using the same rect circuit board the nokia pple have ordered, produce and stored them in large bulk, for the next few years different models, and they can sit back and watch the dole rolling in.<br><br>But letÂ’s presume that the current nokia circuit board does not support color displayed screens, which is raging in other countries now. Our current hp now is in black text like 70s black and white TV, and when the color TV came onto the market everybody wants one and the black and white became obsolete.<br><br>Nokia's quick dumping of "new" models may still have a few bugs in them as there are running out of time and thinking of it, if we buy current phones with the nice nice discount....when the color display come out, say....end of this year.... we will have a 2 yr contract on our hands.<br><br>Call it peer pressure, Kiasu-ness or "what pple have I must have" mentality. I think pple who buy nokia phones now, may be duped into by nokia head honchos who got their marketing plan wrong.<br><br>Or I might be wrong; the color display may just fall flat.<br><br>Peace<br><br></div>
