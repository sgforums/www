            <div class='col-md body'>Thank you SixSentinels for sharing this valuable insight with us which I fully agree. Quantums physics and modern science has been making many discoveries lately and as people examine further into the fabric of reality they'll find that it dissolves. It is true that the entire universe is empty, all phenomenas are empty, and only our illusions and grasping that thinks otherwise.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/index.html</a> - Click on Emptiness to see the various aspects of Emptiness<br><br><strong>The emptiness of matter.</strong><br><br>The ancient Greeks believed that matter is composed of indivisible small elements with certain characteristics, such as the characteristics of earth, water, air, and fire. They called these elements atoms and they held that atoms were solid and fundamental, like microscopic billiard balls. Ernest Rutherford invalidated the billiard ball theory by conducting an experiment, which suggested that atoms have an internal structure. He established that atoms have a nucleus containing most of its mass and that electrons orbit the nucleus. Moreover, he established that the nucleus of an atom is only about one ten-thousandth of the diameter of the atom itself, which means that 99.99% of the atom's volume consists of empty space. This is the first manifestation of emptiness at the subtle level of matter. Not long after Rutherford's discovery, physicists found out that the nucleus of an atom likewise has an internal structure and that the protons and neutrons making up the nucleus are composed of even smaller particles, which they named quarks after a poem of James Joyce. Interestingly, quarks are hypothesised as geometrical points in space, which implies that atoms are essentially empty. This is the second manifestation of emptiness at the subtle level of matter.<br><br>The terms "quarks" and "points in space" still suggest something solid, since they can be imagined as irreducible mass particles. Yet, quantum field theory does away even with this finer concept of solidity by explaining particles in the terms of field properties. Quantum electrodynamics (QED) has produced an amazingly successful theory of matter by combining quantum theory, classical field theory, and relativity. No discrepancies between the predictions of QED and experimental observation have ever been found. According to QED, subatomic particles are indistinguishable from fields, whereas fields are basically properties of space. In this view, a particle is a temporary local densification of a field, which is conditioned by the properties of the surrounding space. Ergo, matter is not different from space. This is the third manifestation of emptiness at the subtle level of matter.<br><br>An important class of phenomena in the subatomic world is defined by the various interactions between particles. In fact, there is no clear distinction between the notions of phenomena, particles, and interactions, although interactions can be described clearly in mathematical terms. For example, there are interactions between free electrons by means of photons that result in an observed repelling force. There are also interactions between the quarks of a nucleon by means of mesons, interactions between the neighbouring neutrons or protons, interactions between nucleus and electrons, and interactions between the atoms of molecules. The phenomena themselves -the nucleon, the nucleus, the atom, the molecule- are sufficiently described by these interactions, meaning by the respective equations, which implies that interactions and phenomena are interchangeable terms. Interestingly, the interrelations of quantum physics do not describe actual existence. Instead they predict the potential for existence. A manifest particle, such as an electron, cannot be described in terms of classical mechanics. It exists as a multitude of superposed "scenarios", of which one or another manifests only when it is observed, i.e. upon measurement. Therefore, matter does not inherently exist. It exists only as interrelations of "empty" phenomena whose properties are determined by observation. This is the fourth manifestation of emptiness at the subtle level of matter.</span><br><br>----------<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Likewise, since it is a group of fingers,<br>The hand itself is not a single entity.<br>And so it is with fingers, made of joints;<br>And joints themselves consist of many parts.<br>These parts themselves will break down into atoms,<br>And atoms will divide according to direction.<br>These fragments, too, will also fall to nothing.<br>Thus atoms are like empty spaceÂ—they have no real existence. - Shantideva</span><br><br>I would also like to share another insightful and interesting article: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=178391" rel="nofollow">The Universe as a Hologram - Holographic Reality</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br>If I didn't exist then would I still be here to type this thing?<br>[/b]</blockquote>I think you misunderstood it. It means that ultimately there is no independant inherently existing entity. Therefore in fact it is not you who are typing this thing, and only appears that it is an entity called 'I' that is typing. There is no contradictions. Then how can typing occur without someone typing.. there is no why, it simply is, and appeared to be an I typing. In reality there is only typing and no typer. It is really simple but only appear difficult to understand when you are attached to a particular idea or concept. We are too often obsessed with our thoughts and think that there is truly an existing self. But it does not mean that everything is a void, emptiness does not mean non-existence. It means all is dependantly arisen with no inherent existence.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">...As individual selfs, we only perceive our own thoughts... or rather we are these thoughts.<br><br>My opinion is that all of us are individual containments within a vast/infinite 'body' of All that is. We are all one... and are different expressions (reciever) of the ONE.<br><br>When thinking, we perceive ourselves as separate beings. When the thinking mind is stilled (no thoughts/Now), we realised what emanated the thoughts... It appears to me as a 'bright' energetic vastness. This infinite vastness is us... we all meet here.<br><br>Suffering appears to me to be the thoughts... that creates a 'personalised sense of self'. It is the personalised sense of self that gave 'meaning' to the invisible vastness. In the vastness, there appears to me ... 'no meaning'.<br><br>I must say... I have not entered into these experiences long enough to give more concrete answers....<br><br>so these are just my understanding at current stage... - longchen</span></div>

Getting rid of all this illusions is to become liberated and experience this bliss.
