But why not 'Do I exist'? Because if you ask 'do I exist', there is still a conceptual answer 'YES' or 'NO'. During realisation it is intuitive and direct, no need for conceptual answer, the realisation will reveal to you the innermost reality that trascends the self and all conceptuality and perceptions. Logical reasoning cannot lead to an answer, it only leads to assumptions and self delusion.<br><br>You need to find out what this "I" is, the practise of constantly investigating the koan eventually it will bring the mind beyond conceptuality and a breakthrough, and you will realise that the ego is illusional. Am I the body? If the hand is me, then if I cut it away where is the I? Keep on investigating, you will realise the 5 senses and the mind you use to perceive, there is no I, no perceiver, only the awareness remains.<br><br>This is just one of the zen approaches and you need to receive instructions from a teacher. For me I do not practise this particular method.</div>

It is ungraspable, from the day you start walking you are taught your name was "... ..." and everytime identify yourself with the name. But -<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Life (Self) is nothing other than the continuous flow of the Now Moment.<br>The Now Moment ceases as it arises. This moment must completely ceased<br>and serves as the CAUSE for the next moment to arise.<br>Therefore Self is a process of series Self1, Self2, Self3, Self4, Self5, Self6...etc<br>A fixed entity 'Self' does not exist, what really exists is a momentary Self.<br>Under deep meditation, one is able to observe and sense the karmic and mental factors from moment to moment,<br>it is these factors that are succeeded from moment to moment and life and life but not a fixed entity.<br>When the karmic and mental factors subsides, it is known as "The True and Only (and Inherently egoless) Conscious Light (Itself)".<br><br>- Thusness</span><br><br>Similarly, you might think there is really a thing called an "ICE CUBE". It has a definite shape of a Cube. It looks very real and solid - like its a seperate entity from the rest. Let's do an experiment. Put it the ice cube into the water, after some time, help me find back the Ice Cube. Is it somewhere in the water? Where is it? Can you find it out for me now? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Written by longchen too:<br><br><blockquote>In one 'awakening' meditation, I came to a state of no thoughts. Such experiences are very hard to describe. This is because the explanation process itself, is within the medium of thoughts and concepts. It is impossible to describe a state of no thoughts using thoughts! <strong>Anyway, in the void of no thoughts, one naturally assume that everything must be an unconscious blank. However, that was not the case! What came next was quite a revelation to me. In the void of no thought, I realise myself to be an omni Presence... Here's how I will describe him.</strong><br><br>"The Presence is all pervasive, yet un-intrusive. IT seems to be in all things and observes with utter passiveness. IT exists beyond concepts, beliefs and do not need any form. Therefore, I understand IT as eternal. IT also seems to be the subtler state of myself. I also got the feeling that IT existed in all my lifetimes or even more. If I were to name IT, I will describe IT as The Eternal Presence."<br><br>I believed the Eternal Presence is the God/Source Presence within oneself. This Presence is also called the Absolute, Dharmakaya. The paradox of it, is that is this not an object and is absolutely material-less.<br><br>About the Presence, it is ever present for it is us beyond the mind. You didn't see it doesn't means it is not there.<br><br>The God Presence is within us and more and IS us; always, even at this moment. This is the part that is simply pure awareness.</blockquote></div>

It's not a purely 'scientific' point of view, but rather a hypothetical one.... Likewise, there're many of such other articles which exist around... Nonetheless, I agree with you that it can be quite an interesting read... (provided that you don't get too carried away by the possible implications of it...?)</div>
