            <div class='col-md body'>After Dr Sun Yat Sen's Sin Hai Ge Ming, or the Chinese revolution, the Manchurians were over thrown. Dr Sun's Kuomingtang broke into 2, the communist and the democrates. Each side wanted to rule China their way. So the communist and democrates of Kuomingtang were fighting for power among themselves. Eventually the democrates lost, so lead by Chiang Kai Shek, they retreated to Taiwan island, and called that piece of land the Republic of China.<br><br>Are Taiwanese Chinese then? Taiwan has been fighting for indepedence for decades now, and at the end of every election, the kuomingtang loses more seats as more taiwanese opts for a government who will lead them to true indepedence. The taiwanese are in favour of indepedence, but would not risk a war against China for it. Taiwanese are ethnic Chinese like ourselves. They are certainly not chinese nationals and are not interested to become one and the reason being the fact that Taiwan is a truly democratic nation while China is a communist country who has embraced capitalism.<br><br>Hehe.. so that's the brief history probably distorted a bit here and there. But if you watched Song Sisters, you will realize that Song Qing Ling is the wife of Dr Sun, while her younger sister Mei Ling is the wife of Chiang Kai Shek, and this period of time, the two sisters are torn between politics and bloodties.<br><br>Singaporean chinese are ethnic chinese, like Malaysian chinese, Thai chinese, or even Hong kongers who migrated to LA. Essentially, other than having the same skin color and speaking the same language as chinese nationals, similarities are far and few. In a couple more generations, the gap will widen furthur. Then it becomes like caucacians in the US, in UK and in Australia. They too speak the same language, but no American will claim to be an Englishman.</div>
