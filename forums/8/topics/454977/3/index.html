              <p>I beg to differ. The Bible talks about God creating the heavens and the earth, yet the focus is on man's relationship to God on planet Earth. Jesus said that if God even cares for the sparrow or knows the number of hairs on our heads, that really shows how much God values us. Only man is made in God's image. We may be an insignificant speck in the entire physical universe, but size is not the measure of significance. Consider how a rich man may value a piece of rock (diamond) and create a huge building or fortress fortified with security features. Compared to the building in terms of size the diamond is insignificant. But yet it is of great worth to the owner, so much so that the construction of the entire building attests to the worth of the diamond. Perhaps we can also think likewise with regards to the earth and the universe?</p>

              What's wrong with bringing Christian concepts into my arguments? And why must we narrow the explanation to only the secular sense, which basically means only naturalistic explanations are allowed? This is your philosophical basis which I do not share. The issue isn't whether the explanation is secular or Christian, but whether it is true. Of course I do think that the Christian explanation is true compared to the secular anti-theistic one.

You can die of thirst pretty soon if you don't quench it, but you can also wander about meaninglessly your entire existence. So why wait until thirsty or when, as is usually the case, life crisis happens and then one thinks about more eternal or spiritual matters?"</span></p>

              <p>"<span style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;">Dude, your dictionary definition listed 7 meanings and you expected people to know you were referring to 1b? </span><span style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;">It has nothing to do with lack of initiative on my part, but your lack of clarity in communication and lack of courtesy. So my opinions of you does not matter yet you feel free to rant your opinions of me as if it mattered to the discussion? Double standards again? In any case, you failed to show how my earlier understanding was in anyway conflicting with your 1b definition.</span><span style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;">"</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;">I knew its gonna be hard for you but I don't wanna concern myself over anyone's inadequacies. I did not even imply your understanding is contradicting. Since you feel your understanding did not contradict with my definition, how was I not clear?</span><br style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;">Enlighten me, what was my opinion about you when there is none worth mentioning?</span></p>
              <p>"<span style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;">Your moral of the story is flawed simply because it confuses a physical need which must be met for survival with a cognitive one which would inform how one should live his life. You can die of thirst pretty soon if you don't quench it, but you can also wander about meaninglessly your entire existence. So why wait until thirsty or when, as is usually the case, life crisis happens and then one thinks about more eternal or spiritual matters?"</span></p>
              <p>Hehehe... whatever. My point is completely lost on you.</p>

The dilemma is yours, not mine. I believe in free will. In fact, I am conscious of it every moment. Your denial of it places yourself in a very awkward position, so awkward that you cannot even be coherent to defend it. The moment you CHOOSE to defend the view that no free will exists you have already affirmed free will. "</span></p>

              <p>Well its only through Jesus that one finds God. Nothing hidden here. I mean, who would search for a god with godly hidding powers who chose to hide?</p>
              <p>"What weakness are you accusing me of being blind to? Please relate this to the "God reveals Himself" issue we were on."</p>
              <p>Your weaknesses are not worth mentioning but I like to put emphasis on being blind. Being blind to something is different from something yet to be revealed.</p>
              <p>"As to how I know? Are you asking me a general question of epistemology or what? Are you agreeing with the statement "The moment you CHOOSE to defend the view that no free will exists you have already affirmed free will"?"</p>
              <p>ok... How do you choose?</p>

              <p>Fact: I knew what the word "subjective" meant, in its common usage.</p>
              <p>Fact: It is common in dialogue to seek clarification when terms are used while also attempting to give a reasonable and plausible interpretation of the term as in "what you mean by XXX? Is it YYYYYY?" which is what I did.  If my understanding was correct all you needed to do was to agree. But you can't help it but had to go for a hit and insinuate that I could not grasp what you meant and berate me for not having initiative to check the dictionary. There is no obligation for me to check a word whose meaning I already know.</p>
              <p>Fact: You threw out a dictionary that listed SEVEN definitions and picked one (1b). Had I really did not know what the word meant, how can you honestly expect me to pick the same 1b as you? And if I did, which you admitted later, then why accuse me of not grasping it? Why not be upfront about your intentions that you were simply taking the opportunity, or making one, to go for a personal attack?</p>
              <p>Bottom line: All you needed to do was to agree or disagree with my understanding of your terms. If correct, say so. If incorrect, then just be kind and clarify what you meant. But your agenda of trying to always be superior and condescending of me got the better of you. Don't act blur and play daft concerning your personal attacks. Is that how you teach your....oops sensitive point, forget it.</p>
              <p>You don't even know how to use the word "solipsism" properly, LOL! I guess your ego just won't accept the fact that your analogy was flawed and busted.</p>
              <p>You still missed the point of John 14:6 and pretending to be the exegete that you aren't. That verse has NOTHING to do with God's alleged hiddenness at all. Your quoting of this verse is entirely out of context.</p>
              <p>You accused me of being blind to my weakness. When asked, you cannot point them out. You then emphasize I am being blind, but again you cannot explain. Looks like you just go personal attack for the sake of personal gratification.</p>
              <p>How do I choose? The same way how you chose to ask me that question. Duh.</p>

              <p>There's no need for agreement as its for opinions, just understanding of words definitions which you are failing to do. I know there's no obligation on your side, but pointed out that "no obligation" is lack of initiative and a mental block. I don't like to repeat myself but you are making me referring to what you posted.</p>

              <p>The fact is you assumed you understood "subjective" but did not know there were 7 meanings only show that you did not fully understand.

                              That's simply because you WERE being offensive in your postings. And you were relishing every bit of it. I extended the olive branch but you spit on it. So much for "raising communication standards". More like debasing your opponent and raising yourself to look good. Learn something from Oscar please. He shows more maturity in handling a discussion topic at 17 years of age than a father of five.
