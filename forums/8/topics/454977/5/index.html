              <p>Apparently you did not know the word "subjective" has 7
              definition thats why you seek clarifications. You just assumed what
              you think is "common" without self check. </p>

              It is common in dialogue to seek clarification when terms are used
              while also attempting to give a reasonable and
              plausible interpretation of the term as in "what you mean by
              XXX? Is it YYYYYY?" which is what I did."</span></p>
              <p>I pointed to you its 1b, what else do you want me to say? A
              simple thank you would suffice...</p>

              "If my understanding was correct all you needed to do was to agree.
              But you can't help it but had to go for a hit and
              insinuate that I could not grasp what you meant and berate me for
              not having initiative to check the dictionary. There is no
              obligation for me to check a word whose meaning I already
              know."</span></p>
              <p>There's no need for agreement as its for opinions, just
              understanding of words definitions which you are failing to
              do. I know there's no obligation on your side, but pointed out
              that "no obligation" is lack of initiative and a mental block.
              I don't like to repeat myself but you are making me referring to
              what you posted.</p>
              <p> "<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Fact: You
              threw out a dictionary that listed SEVEN definitions and picked one
              (1b). Had I really did not know what the word meant, how can
              you honestly expect me to pick the same 1b as you? And if I did,
              which you admitted later, then why accuse me of not grasping
              it? Why not be upfront about your intentions that you were
              simply taking the opportunity, or making one, to go for a
              personal attack?"</span></p>
              <p>The fact is you assumed you understood "subjective" but did not
              know there were 7 meanings only show that you did not fully
              understand. I don't have any expectations especially from you.
              Zero. Zilch. If you think its a personal attack, means you are
              taking it personally, which is not my concern.</p>

              All you needed to do was to agree or disagree with my understanding
              of your terms. If correct, say so. If incorrect, then just be kind
              and clarify what you meant. But your agenda of trying to always be
              superior and condescending of me got the better of
              you. Don't act blur and play daft concerning your personal
              attacks. Is that how you teach your....oops sensitive point, forget
              it."</span></p>
              <p>Its either you agree to the dictionary definitions or not,
              nothing to do with me. Unless you are disagreeing with my usage of
              subjective justifications. [Ignores other personal rants]</p>

              even know how to use the word "solipsism" properly, LOL! I guess
              your ego just won't accept the fact that your analogy was flawed
              and busted."</span></p>
              <p>Whatever... hehehehe. You say its wrong so its wrong to you.

              missed the point of John 14:6 and pretending to be the exegete that
              you aren't. That verse has NOTHING to do with God's alleged
              hiddenness at all. Your quoting of this verse is entirely out of
              context."</span></p>
              <p>You miss my point again. I'll just brush the dust from my
              feet.</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">You accused

              out. You then emphasize I am being blind, but again you cannot
              explain. Looks like you just go personal attack for the sake of
              personal gratification."</span></p>

              I don't claim to be infallible in the first place, so your question is rather absurd. The Bible teaches us to recognise our human frailty and in the book of Acts we have believers correcting each other, so your point that the Bible forbids admitting mistakes is a gross misunderstanding or ignorance of what it teaches.

              A lot of people would have thought Noah was trolling when he preached to them about the impending judgement of water. No one else agreed with him excep his family. The reat all perished save those on the Ark. And I did not end off everything with "you are an atheist." But then it seems to me pretty clear that YOU ARE ATHEIST.

                  You failed to get the point. Those who deny free will will act exactly the same way as those who affirm free will. It is the determinist who is inconsistent and self-contradictory. If you even say you choose A over B, how can you be using the language of free will and yet deny it exists?
