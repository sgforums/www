              <p>Firstly, I think the title is a bit off since only arguments can be considered fallacious, not things or entities.</p>
              <p>Secondly, it would be pretty evident to you that I am a theist. So from a theistic point of view, the universe, its orderliness, its intelligibility, the laws of nature, are all explicable within the theistic worldview.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, you said you do not believe in the existence of a personal God but perhaps a greater law can explain the existence of the universe. But surely the existence of life and personhood cannot be caused by mere laws, which themselves beg a cause for their existence.</p>
              <p>Oh, I should warn you upfront that this thread will probably be locked soon.</p>

              <p>The definition of fallacious is simply defined as 'something' that is logically unsound. A logic can be fallcious, a plan, view or perspective can also be fallacious. That being said so, thank you for your response to this thread. It doesn't matter if it's locked or not. I just needed a place to pen my thoughts down. I would engage in intellectual conversation with my friends but i'm not socially adaptable, and the few friend's i have are beneath the capablities to engage in any form of conversation greater than the simplistic and superficial matters which we face in our everyday life.</p>
              <p>Also, i used the term 'laws' because i could not think of a better word to replace it with. Should i use the phrase, "divine intervention" it would be begging me to concede that a god exists. While i do not explicitly deny the  possibility of existence of (a) god(s) [Atheism], i simply do not believe in one, until proof present's itself[Agnotism]</p>
              <p> And yes, life can be surreal.</p>

              <p>From what I know the only "things" that can be considered fallacious are arguments, or statements that contain an argument or a conclusion. Anyway I won't press this point further as I think I know what you are trying to say.</p>
              <p>Once the notion of a personal all powerful God is rejected, the universe becomes "illogical", or "fallacious" as you called it. It doesn't make sense for why the universe should exist, why things are the way they are. SOMETHING must have been the cause(es) of it all, but then again anything less than God would not seem to be an adequate answer either. Some people invoke aliens, but aliens (if they exist at all) are part of this universe and this universe itself begs a cause. So aliens are a no go at all.</p>
              <p>Many people require the existence of God to be proven. But have you considered that the cause of the material universe must itself be immaterial? If so, then you can only "prove" the existence of this cause from the effect. Just as a painting requires or presupposes a painter, so the universe requires or presupposes a Creator. The best explanation being that of a Personal God.</p>

              <p>Since we are talking about the universe as a whole, the cause of the universe must be outside of time, space and matter. As such it must be timeless, not bound by space, and immaterial, aka not made up of matter. Otherwise we end up in an infinite regress which does not answer anything ultimately.</p>
              <p>You are very right that the answers to these are ultimately philosophical, if not religious. It boils down to faith, not science. Belief, not empirical data. But it need not be a blind faith, but a reasonable one.</p>
              <p>I agree that this is not the best place to discuss this. Please feel free to drop by my forum here <a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/4245">http://sgforums.com/forums/4245</a></p>

              Pick up any book on philosophy and you will see that questions of existence, meaning and purpose are the stuff of philosophy. Are these the vain questions of prideful men throughout the ages or are these really the questions that matter and define who we are and how we should live? Who would not want to know the answers? Only those who think that life is not worth examining. Apathy has never been a good teacher nor a source of knowlwedge and wisdom.

              <p>I think he made a relatively good response, i would like to point out that philosophy is pretty entrenched in the daily doings of an average human. And to classify knowledge as "utilisable" is quite pitiful. Just because it wouldn't or couldn't be utilisable, it doesn't necessary imply that we should forsake the chance of acquiring it. Let's say you are a kindergardener teacher. There is no application or utilising value of you knowing anything beyond your scope of life, which is kindergardening, paying your taxes, grocery shopping etc.</p>
              <p>Would you then, switch off a perfectly good documentary about space or anything not pertaining to the scope of your life, and reject any unapplicable knowledge? I doubt so, if you were an intelligent being, that is. Can you see the point i'm driving across?</p>

We are living in a time where technological advances made discoveries that debunk "facts" to myth. Its really subjective when it comes to unfalsifiable information.

              <p>Obviously there is a superior force behind all this. We humans are so damn stupid and weak. Have you ever worked in an office? Where the co-workers seem to repeat the same stupid things or the bosses play politics and favor some blue eye boy or girl in the office when this favortism doesn't make sense and don't contribute to the unity of the office?</p>
              <p>Such is also the folly of the 1986 Challenger mishap. Engineers warned that the cold winter snap in Florida may weaken the O-rings, that may result in gas leakage at the solid rocket boosters of the challenger space shuttle. But no no, the politicians at NASA wanted the launch to proceed. Because they were pressured by the deadlines, the media and the budget constraints. So the politicians overide the engineers and gave the go ahead. The day challenger launched, moment it reached the limits of space, it exploded like the 4th of July.</p>
              <p>So i ask you, how do we humans are able to miraculously do things togather. How we build the piramids at Giza? How we managed to bring singapore into a regional economic powerhouse from a sleepy fishing island?</p>
              <p>There's got to be a superior being, working behind the curtains. Cause we humans are so egoistical, selfish and dumb, don't think we can achieve anything by our selves.</p>
