              <p>It is by coincidence that earth is situated between Mars and
              venus, not too near to the sun to cause searing heat of 700 degrees
              like that of Mercury, not too far like Mars where the summer is
              freezing -40 degrees?</p>
              <p>It is by coincidence that earth is tilted at an angle that
              results in changing seasons?</p>
              <p>It is by coincidence that earth has a metal core, when it spins
              it creates its own magnetic field that protects the earth and its
              inhabitants from the sun's dangerous rays? No other planet in our
              solar system has the amount of metal core earth has, that allows it
              to generate a magnetic field strong enough to withstand the
              sun.</p>
              <p>Is it by coincidence that gas giants Jupiter and Saturn is
              located just out of earth's outskirts, its gravity power pull
              comets and harmful asteroids from colliding with earth?</p>
              <p>Is it by coincidence that the presence of the moon creates low
              and high tides on earth?</p>
              <p>Is it by coincidence that earth is filled with rich gasses of
              oxygen and nitrogen that encourage life to thrive? Whereas its twin
              sister, Venus atmosphere is filled with dangerous sulphur dioxide
              that creates global warming, resulting in 800 degrees heat, enough
              to melt lead.</p>
              <p>Is it by coincidence that earth is the only world in our solar
              system rich with water resources? Scientist proven that Mars once
              had water but was drained off by the powerful sun rays because Mars
              lost its ability to create a magnetic field to protect its
              water.</p>

              Me getting personal? You sound hypocritical in saying that. You did not reread your postings carefully to count the ways you insinuate and belittle me and my replies. Was I badmouthing your kids? You were the one who first invoke them by saying that you were a father of 5 kids, as if that were some bragging rights to impeccable ability to spot fallacious arguments. You can ignore me and I am perfectly fine with that, since you failed to raise communication standards anyway. There are always more noble people around who can hold a good discussion.

              I know of no forum rules that say I cannot mention that you or anyone has kids when that information was first provided by that person himself. Anyway, you missed the point. It was not about your kids, it was comparing a 17 years old maturity to handle a discussion with that of a father of five kids and how the former was better at it.

              I know of no forum rules that say I cannot mention that you or

              person himself. Anyway, you missed the point. It was not about your
              kids, it was comparing a 17 years old maturity to handle a
              discussion with that of a father of five kids and how the former
              was better at it.</p>

              Then I submit that one cannot go from "the universe is complex" to "God is more complex than the universe" since the former is a physical entity whereas the latter is not. In fact, to speak of God as a complex being is most unusual. See http://creation.com/god-simple
              
              <p>While you share Dawkins' view as seeing no reason to postulate the existence of God, many people see a host of reasons to credit God as being the cause of the universe.  But I would like to hear from you why the current understanding of the universe means that there is no place for God.

              On the contrary, it is the atheist worldview that is scary and misguided. By removing God from people's thinking they end up removing the belief that man is made in the image of God. No wonder then life is cheap and we see millions of people killed in the last century alone under atheist communist regimes.
