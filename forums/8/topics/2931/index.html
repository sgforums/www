            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm ... I wonder how many ppl will agree with me on this.  If I really love someone, sex is not important at all.

            <div class='col-md body'>i dun believe in it at all<br>SEX affects a person physically, mentally and emotionally...not that i'm saying you should try it if you're stable. Here is my view which i hope might change the next person who reads this and is think of having BGR SEX. When it comes to sex, people think of pleasure...then the BIG question " what if i'm pregnant? ".....oh no no no, got condom what (yeah provided it's not 15% risky, which it is) what if you're the unlucky one to get pregnant?  then there is the abortion and yadadada..teh list goes on and on and on<br>BUT THE MAIN THING IS.....<br>SEX    =    AIDS (and all other STDs)<br>think abt it<br>my fren is only 15 and she already is suffering from herpes and incurable disease which can be passed thru kissing....think abt it your whole life is ruined and she just changed her bf..does he noe? no he doesn't and she is a victim becoz her bf sleeps ard and she din noe it... so trust me<br>dun do the real thing before you get married...if a person loves you<br>he loves you for the person you are and cares for your welfare at heart...he will not instigate you to have sex if he LOVES YOU.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The physical aspects of a relationship cannot be ignored. When u love someone, u want to feel close to him/her. Of course pple tok abt merging of the minds where 2 pple attain mutual understanding and share the same values. But the warmth of being close physically is also part of a relationship. When u like someone, u long to touch him/her , to hug and to kiss.<br><br>I am not trying to say that every relationship includes sex, but more importantly, sex is an expression of love as well. There are pple who have sex simply out of lust and those who do it out of love. Wat can I say? It's human nature?!<br><br>------------------<br>Have a break, have a TicTac...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well....when I like someone a lot and when we get to the holding hands kissing part...by then I will have already gotten damn horny...hahah...:-) it's true...I admit freely....the act of kisssing and holding hands, for me, is a sign of physical closeness and if I like the person then I will feel the need to get even closer....of course sex is good, but I think I dun think of it in terms of sex for the sex, but sex for the act of getting closer to a person...<br><br>To me, it's important...very important....not having sex in a deep relationship to me is like not being willing to share yourself totally with someone...<br><br>...and a small note....condoms have an error rate of only about 2 or 3%......not 15%...15 very high....and for peeple who think u can protect urself by double-backing the condom....please dun beleive...condoms are made to be worn one at a time..they are quite delicate and when u slip another condom over the first one, u increase the risk of both of them breaking by a whole lot more than if it was just one.......Something they taught us in school.....:-)...so u guys cisiting Geylang, dun go and double-back it...it 's far more dangerous....<br><br>hope it helped y'all<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's unrealistic to think that sex is not important at all if you love somebody.<br><br>This is to discount biology totally. Our brains are hardwired to reproduce so that there will always be another generation. Kissing and hugging will definetly not be enuff after a while. Having sex is just a question of when you want to do it- before or after marriage.<br><br>If sex is not important at all when you love somebody, then you should be able to accept it if your wife refuses to have sex with you totally even after marraige. Impossible rite?<br><br>Kissing and hugging has its place. So does sex. It's important to recognise that they are all equally important.<br><br>Nonetheless, I dun believe that people should have sex unless they are sure of their level of commitment (and their partner's as well).</div>

Sex is a very important part of life, be it for copulation or for lust...or for TLC, Closeness or wat ever, it is very important. As a male species I can understand we have 2 heads(sorry ladies), but try to use the bigger one to think not the smaller one...if after rationalising and u think its right to have sex...then go for it....married or bgr...think b4 action.....always the right thing to do....</div>
