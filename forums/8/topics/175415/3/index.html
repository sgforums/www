YOU are the frog in the well.<br><br>the "men" u speak of, are only a small bunch of people u know. I personally know a lot of people who do not have anything or any hate against butches. If u think the small amount of men u know is representative of men all over the world, u're sadly wrong. Only men who are insecure in their own sexuality and masculinity will never support butch. Im sorry to see u only have other men like u to mix around with. Are u actually attracted to them? Do they know u like them?</div>
