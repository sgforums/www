I know lots of families personally here who have gay children and are perfectly fine with it. Their views are certainly not more extreme than in SG. in fact its fair to say that Singaporeans have taken the socialogy left to them by the Brits from the 50s and stagented, while the Brit's have evolved further in their social views and thinking.<br><br>And Elton might have gone thru quite a lot of obstacles, but those were legal ones, because there wasn't any legislation concerning the union of a gay couple, and legislations aren't set in a day and a night are they? But hey, now that the legislation has been passed, they have no problems getting married. So there u go, proof that evolution has happened here and not yet in SG.<br><br>Finally, your trying to compare a Jihad is utterly ridiculous and makes no sense. The truth is, if u're straight, and secure in being straight, why would u be uncomfortable with gay people of any sort? I think deep inside, u know the answer to that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

And that would be your chance to finally understand what unconditional love is.<br><br>It's just shameful that u're viewing your son as nothing more than a 'decendent factory' really  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
