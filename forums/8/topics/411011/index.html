              <p>I have a friend, he was a fat guy in his sec sch. Always kena bully.</p>
              <p>So, he went to take up martial arts class and train himself.</p>
              <p>Years of training, he slim down and is quite a food fighter. Once a guy disturb him in sch, he cannot take it anymore, whack that guy nicely. Since then ppl respect him.</p>
              <p>Now, he is a martial art instructor. He take up fighting to protect himself and in the process, he discover his passion is martial arts.</p>
              <p>Im not joking, he is really a good fighter, everyday watch martial arts video to improve himself and now he teaches kids martial arts.</p>
              <p>So your friend might also be like my friend one day. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="icon_cool.gif"></p>

              <p>Your friend is right in thinking appearances aren't an accurate representation of substance - somebody who looks strong and rugged might not be trained or have the will to fight. However, there is no reason to avoid strength simply because of that. If he's even remotely interested in improving himself, strength is part of the package.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, it's a good enough reason to want to be trained in martial arts. At least he knows what he's living for, unlike most people. From my observations though, the average male who's interested in fighting isn't exactly up there in terms of maturity. Let's hope your friend doesn't turn out to be one of those.</p>
              <p>Strength is obviously important in a physical confrontation, but it isn't key. A properly executed stranglehold can render your opponent unconscious in seconds and doesn't require a lot of strength. Other similar techniques include submission holds, joint manipulation, force redirection (see: Aikido), etc.</p>

              <p>Most of the time in real street brawls.... strength is the key.... agility form and all that is more supplementary.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have seen fat and big beat muscly guys to a pulp due to sheer strength. Size also helps.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To be able to use form to overcome strength would require alot of hard work in grappling which is unrealistic for the avg Singaporean Youth nor is training easily available.</p>

              <p>Your friend is right in thinking appearances aren't an accurate representation of substance - somebody who looks strong and rugged might not be trained or have the will to fight. However, there is no reason to avoid strength simply because of that. If he's even remotely interested in improving himself, strength is part of the package.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, it's a good enough reason to want to be trained in martial arts. At least he knows what he's living for, unlike most people. From my observations though, the average male who's interested in fighting isn't exactly up there in terms of maturity. Let's hope your friend doesn't turn out to be one of those.</p>
              <p>Strength is obviously important in a physical confrontation, but it isn't key. A properly executed stranglehold can render your opponent unconscious in seconds and doesn't require a lot of strength. Other similar techniques include submission holds, joint manipulation, force redirection (see: Aikido), etc.</p>

              <p>venue also important. i encounter many this type of people. they luck happen in singapore. if other countries i straight away wack them already. here in singapore no need me to use brute force. see i got education, no poolice record can go anywhere do anythin i like. no point crossing sword for no reason against those tattoo no lifers got record one. but when war come i hope they cna really fight like men, instead of becoming gangs and rob pillage take laws into their own hands. but i hope war don;t come, because if war come no law i make sure they die.</p>
