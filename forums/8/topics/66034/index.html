Before the 9/11 attacks, there were just one or two requests a year.<br><br>'Most are professionals, or from prominent, well-off families. They usually pick the more established airlines as well. They will also have made some sort of financial arrangements for their children and spouses,' she said.<br><br>The parents take separate flights, dividing the children between them.<br><br>Mr Francis Telgallego, director of operations at Excel Travel Services, said three clients had made such requests last year. There were none two years ago.<br><br>He said: 'For long-haul flights, they may fly the same route but on different days.'<br><br>Mrs Margaret Oh, 58, insisted on her family doing just that when they flew Air Asia to Kota Kinabalu, East Malaysia, two weeks ago. The homemaker and her husband, a retiree, left first. Their younger daughter, Lorrine, 27, an air-traffic controller, followed the next day.<br><br>Said Mrs Oh, whose other daughter is 31: 'The chances of both planes crashing are very remote, so at least some of us will survive.'<br><br>However, going to such lengths seems unnecessary and a hassle to others. Fifteen other travel agents said most families still prefer to fly together.<br><br>Said accountant Ann Tay, 36, mother of two young children: 'By being together if disaster strikes, we'll have the chance to take care of each other and, if so destined, depart as a family.'<br><br>But for some, separate flights have been a way of life for years.<br><br>The last time Miss Chin Jit Peng, 27, took a flight with sister Jit Fong, 25, was a decade ago, when they were teenagers. Their businessman father couldn't risk losing both daughters at once.<br><br>'It was when we were about to leave for university and my parents realised what it felt like not to have us by their sides,' said the elder Miss Chin, an associate with a corporate finance company.<br><br>Like them, Mr J. Wong, a businessman in his 50s, has avoided travelling with his brother for the last 30 years, even by car.<br><br>'We agreed that if something happens to me, he will look after my family and vice versa.<br><br>'So we are never in the same plane or car,' he said.<br><br>He makes sure his three children, all studying in Australia, fly home on separate flights.<br><br>'If I had 15 children, I don't think I would care so much. But with two or three, I won't take such risks,' he said.<br></strong></blockquote>This is interesting...but sad... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
