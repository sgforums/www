            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there,<br><br>Well, specially dedicated to those who have been involved in the singles thread and all those poor guys and gals who have been complaining in Aunty Agony, this is what happens when a person was made to wake up because daybreak starts at 4 am in UK, so after 2 hours of intense reasearch. Studying how the Universe works can sometimes be a chore. As usual, a spark came to my mind while and I have come up with something that is outright provoking and sarcastic. Read the following in whatever manner you want. Please pardon me with my bombastic vocabulary and flowery grammar, and an Oxford (UK English) or Webster (American English) dictionary is highly recommended.<br><br>-------------------<br>Dear Venus,<br><br>I will like to issue a letter of complaint to your Ministry of Love. Since your son, Eros, or otherwise known as Cupid have been responsible for the arrows that would hit onto someone's back falling in love.<br><br>Of course, please pardon my harshness on the inefficiency and the useless of your organization and the blatantly use of statistics which I felt that I don't feel responsible. You can always get a devil's advocate (aka a lawyer) to sue me for defammation of your honour.<br><br>My letter of complaint stems from two fundamental observations in the modern day world : the first being that women are always made to fall in love with the wrong guys and the second that the decrease of expectations in women as they age.<br><br>Let me start with the first. Based on the assumption of inequality, no one is given fair treatment by Providence. You can always whine to the sisters of Fate in your realm about my complaint letter to you, but I suppose that your most moronic son is responsible for the social phenomena which is happening. Since the world is unfair, we have no choice but to have good looking Baldwins and bad looking Barneys. It works from the same for gals. Of course, when cute is used as a statement to praise someone, the connotation is always used to say that you are ugly but adorable. I look at the people around me and realized how many poor souls were deprived because your son's stupidity in shooting one arrow to one hunk and the many gals around and let them fall in love. Yes, I am sure that you are being so kind to this guy who could be a nice guy or a sad bastard. Of course, he has so many choices that he is not willing to give up such privileges to the rest of the poor blokes, who are the nice guys.<br><br>Take it from me, that it is not true that the guy who are trapped in this case is usually not the nice guy. Most likely that he is also the cool male model like Cheng E-kin with his motorbike and also his loyalty to his bunch of gangster friends. I am sure that many ladies would have such fantasy. What is happening, most men and women are attracted by superficiality. There is nothing wrong with superficiality, but there is something wrong with people which have no sense to see people beyond a certain value. There is only lust at first sight and not love at first sight. Because my dear Goddess of Love, pardon me if I know your manifestation well, love is something which is cultivated. Of course, when women reject someone based on superficiality, they used the most evil excuse "that it is because you are a nice guy and ......", and so forth. Similarly, before I am being too harsh to women, men too have the same problem, but luckily, they don't prefer the bad gals, maybe because they are stuck to their own model of sweet and nice gals with long hair.<br><br>One would ask why there is a perfect fit between people and yet a relationship cannot work out. Perhaps, it is the arrows of your son who seemed to be shooting on the wrong targets. People would call this arrows making  people falling in love chemistry. I find this whole love business is based on a criterion, being dumb and would like to call for a new standard to be set.<br><br>What is the second problem, your son is increasingly sabotaging the nice guys by letting them getting their brides (or vice versa) when they are 35 to 45. The mortal way of understanding women is so simple. Merely, it is the lowering of expectations and now after they have finished their fun with those hunks since looks don't really matter, they go for men who have the money and reputation. Such hypocrisy, in my opinion, are in the opposite spirit of what love is all about. A lot of times, people refuse to admit that it was not just out of love that they are marrying these blokes at an older age, but money and security, and how sad to hear them saying that they loved these men. What more I can say, the arrows of Eros are tainted with nothing but mere superficiality.<br><br>I wish that I can write a longer letter to make you feel really bad what this world is turning into. But I would be kind to spare those readers here to read another long essay .<br><br>I could be kind to offer you a suggestion to help some of the poor blokes in this forum, after reading so many sad love stories of theirs and also that include the ladies as well. I am sure that you are going to make my life difficult, and I am really not bothered. Perhaps, it is my humanity that I wished to speak up for the poor guys who are suffering in silence to the nonsense of Eros and you.<br><br>For your information and necessary action.<br><br>yours sincerely,<br>The Prodigal<br>05 June 2000 (0700 hrs)<br>United Kingdom<br>@Copyright 2000<br><br>---------<br>Hope you enjoy it and you can always give your valuable comments...<br><br>Good luck and good day.<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights. However, love is not about finding someone to relieve you, but love is about you devoting your heart and soul to love that someone, even if you know that someone do not love you the way you do."<br>- Prodigal</div>
