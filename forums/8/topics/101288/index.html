            <div class='col-md body'>This forum post is recommended for the three religions<br>Judaism, Christianity and Islam.  I am a young muslim.<br><br>Before quoting from any verse from any holy book, please get the approval of someone from the corresponding religion.<br><br><strong>Please correct me if I am wrong, anywhere</strong>.  This is a very sensitive issue<br><br>There were many prophets, the main ones add up to 25 (peace be upon them all).  There had to be many to suit the different times.  For example, we believe that all men come from Adam (pbuh) and Eve.  If God wanted to enforce that marrying your sister was a sin right away, then Adam's children would be the last people on earth.  The prophets were sent down to reinforce the laws of god, or to give new laws.  Hence the bible.  The prophet Moses (pbuh) recieved new laws, for example.  The ten commandments, and the Torrah.  All three religions believed that they were prophets to some extent.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The 25 prophets muslims believe </span><br>1) Adam<br>2) Idris (Enoch)<br>3) Nuh (Noah)<br>4) Hud<br>5) Salih<br>6) Ibrahim (Abraham)<br>7) Lut (Lot)<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Ismail (Ishmael)<br>9) Ishaq (Isaac)<br>10) Ya'qub (Jacob)<br>11) Yusuf (Joseph)<br>12) Ayub (Job)<br>13) Zulkifli (Ezekiel)<br>14) Shuaib<br>15) Musa (Moses)<br>16) Harun (Aaron)<br>17) Daud (David)<br>1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Sulaiman (Solomon)<br>19) Elias<br>20) Al-Yas'a (Elisha)<br>21) Yunus (Jonah)<br>22) Zakaria (Zechariah)<br>23) Yahya (John the Baptist)<br>24) Isa (Jesus)<br>25) Muhammad<br><br>The God we worship is the same god.  In fact, "Allah" in English means God.  If you say "I love Allah", it's the same as saying "I love God", just that Allah is in Arabic.  Te same applies for Judaists (something like Yahweh), if I'm not wrong.  Basically, we worship the same god.<br><br>The difference between us are more of the rules.  The Judaists are still holding on to the Torrah and Talmud and are waiting for their Last prophet.  The Christians believe that Jesus is God's son and believe in the Trinity (God +Jesus+Holy Ghost).  Judaists and Muslims believe that Jesus (pbuh) was a prophet.    Muslims believe that Muhammad (pbuh) is the last prophet (the one Judiasts were waiting for).<br><br><strong>Once again, I'd like to remind that if any information I have posted here is inaccurate, correct me immeadiately</strong><br><br>So, I've come to ask, why is it that the Christians believe that Jesus is the son of God?  Is there a prophecy in the bible?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, sensitive issue indeed. Hope I can answer you in a politically correct manner.<br><br>The bible did prophesied about him and even of the one who will first know Jesus to be the chosen one which is John the baptist. John the baptist then met him in person and identify/validate that he is indeed the one.<br><br>On Jesus authencity, think about the following :<br><br>Does all three religion that you mentioned recognise to a certain extent that Jesus Christ is a prophet?<br><br>If yes, then this prophet himself claimed to be the last prophet and the Son of God. Unless he is a corrupted prophet (Which seems ridiculous cos at least the other 2 would have condemned him and never recognised him!), then what he say must be true.<br><br>It comes down to whether u believe what Jesus said about himself. He himself said that he is the prophet and the Son of God. He claims to be the one that the bible prophesied about.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've never heard of Jesus admitting that he's the son of God...so that's why I need the verse.  I also need the prophecy verse.  Isn't he a God and not a prophet, according to Christians?<br><br>Take note that Muslims believe that the bible was changed, nevertheless, there are some nearly-perfect bibles today.I have to compare sources.  As they were translated, some of the meanings were changed, and certain points of timein history, bibles were ordered to be destroyed.  Well this is what muslims believe.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There u go<br><br>Matthew 16:13  Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say that the Son of Man is?"<br>Matthew 16:14  And they said, "Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets."<br>Matthew 16:15  He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"<br>Mat 16:16  Simon Peter replied, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."<br>Matthew 16:17  And Jesus answered him, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.<br><br>John 18:33  So Pilate entered his headquarters again and called Jesus and said to him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"<br>John 18:34  Jesus answered, "Do you say this of your own accord, or did others say it to you about me?"<br>John 18:35  Pilate answered, "Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered you over to me. What have you done?"<br>John 18:36  Jesus answered, "My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting, that I might not be delivered over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not from the world."<br>John 18:37  Then Pilate said to him, "So you are a king?" Jesus answered, "You say that I am a king. For this purpose I was born and for this purpose I have come into the world--to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice."<br><br>In fact, Christ in Hebrew means the Messaiah which is the One that they have been waiting for. That is why christians call him Jesus Christ.<br>A prophet means teh mouthpiece of God. When Christ was on earth with his physical body He also spoke what God told Him to and by virtue of that, He is also known as a prophet but His identity do not stop here and it goes further as He is part of the Trinity.<br><br>Hope this helps you.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes...you see I need to make sure that my evidences are correct...that's why a Christian forum.<br><br>Unless you meant issues like terrorism in the world today.  I do have something to say about this.<br><br>There are good and bad people in the world.  Some even dilusioned.  The terrorists are muslims, and they may claim that they are performing Jihad.<br><br>Islam almost never uses violence as an option (of course conditions apply).  I quote this from a website "The essence of jihad as defined by Islam is not to ruin countries or to kill people, but to propagate the religion, and at the same time to protect the religion, which is never done by destroying, burning or cruelty. Islam only commands defense and struggle against transgressors."<br><br>and<br><br>"If a Muslim, or his religion, is attacked he first tries to persuade the aggressor politely. In case his efforts are unsuccessful, he sues him. And the court gives the necessary punishment with justice. If he cannot get his right even through the court, he will retire either into his house, or into his place of business. He will remain a great distance from his transgressors. If his house, or place of business is attacked, he will move away; that is, he will leave that city. If he cannot find any city to move in, he will leave that country. If he cannot find any Muslim country to move to, he will move to any non-Muslim country where human rights are respected. A Muslim does not attack anyone with his hands or tongue, nor does he violate anyone's property, possession, chastity, or honor. Jihad means to communicate God's true religion to His created servants. This can be done by using the sword to eliminate cruel and devouring dictators, who hamper God's religion from reaching His servants. First, it begins with admonishing and moral preaching, and then in the case of disobedience or opposition, these obstructions are eliminated by other means. Jihad with force is done not by individuals, but by the Islamic state."<br><br>As you can see, violence is strongly advised against.  These terrorists are misguided.  You can't blame a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>whole </strong></span>religion for what a smaller group of people did.<br><br>Be careful with the media in the internet, there are some liars out there who try to twist the words of  Holy books and scriptures.  The devil can cite scripture for his own purpose.<br><br>One example is the following, an aetheist  <a href="http://www.singaporeatheist.com/rant5.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.singaporeatheist.com/rant5.html</a><br><br>Here is a good website that gives a short explanation for each commandment<br><a href="http://www.thetencommandments.com/tablet_i.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thetencommandments.com/tablet_i.htm</a><br><br>Do not be easily fooled, be careful when searching the net.  It's better to discuss issues like this with friends, false or inaccurate information may be displayed.  That's why I came here.  Normal people come here<br><br>If you have any misconceptions about Islam, visit this site:<br><a href="http://www.muis.gov.sg/websites/2002mabims/understanding%20Islam%20doc.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.muis.gov.sg/websites/2002mabims/understanding%20Islam%20doc.asp</a></div>
