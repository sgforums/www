            <div class='col-md body'>I dismayed by your comments.<br><br>Whether males/females having bad behaviour have nothing to do with ethnic background.  It may be that Sg girls are a little more conservative but this does not render them bad behaviour.  Actually, wat the hell do u mean that their behaviour turn u off, huh?  What kind of behaviour turn u off?<br><br>I used to have Sg female friends while they were here studying before returning to Sg.  I have never come across anyone of them having bad behaviour.<br><br>What a shame about ur comments!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is absolutely disheartening, and I for one, as a Native Singaporean Male, have to say sorry to the many females out there who have been offended by these ridiculious whimpers of the generally sex-driven population of the gene pool lacking that extra X chromosome that we call, males.<br><br>I know this is a forum board, and everyone is free to express their own opinions, but please, if you're not self-respecting people, at least respect the female gender.<br><br>Females are *not* objects that you can give and take, or exchange or demand refunds for. They're human beings, just like the MOST of us..  keyword here being "most".<br><br>Jap, Smap. Whatever the nationality, they're still female. I believe the most possible explaination as to why some percieve the "Average Japanese Girl" to be more sort after would most probably be due to their upbringing of good manners, courtesy and above all, culture of politeness toward all.<br><br>If the above is really the reason why guys seem to prefer "Japanese" Girls, then, I believe we can find these type of females, right here in Singapore..<br><br>Either you're not looking hard enough, or, you're looking at all the wrong places.<br><br>Believe you me. If you're looking for a "chick" who's well mannered, sweet, caring, gentle, blah blah blah blah, forget the pubs,  blow the discos.. and try the nice, serene parks. Or maybe just some common coffee joint...<br><br>My best advice to the average guy is, don't look.<br><br>You often find it, when you're not looking for it.<br><br>Once again, I apologize to the majority of non-ah-lianish females in Singapore out there.<br><br>As for the latter, please feel free to hang out at pubs and discos, making weird sounds of "Uuh-uuh" to the rythmn of "Canto" music.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chigau yo!<br>Kintaro, I must disagree of what u have said. I had been staying in Japan for quite some time (perhaps 6 mths). From my experience, I think basically they are the same as some average SG gals as u have seen on the street.(commonly, they r all gals what! neh?)But I must agree that most of them shown politeness even she don't like someone. It's part of their culture.<br><br>They can be very both open-minded(most of them)or conservative when comes to BGR.But really sad to say, there r also young gals, who r still very shallow abt relationships. They choose to become social ascort(sorry...not sure how it spelt..)just because of fun and cash. It's a society problem, and it's on the rise. I think Enigma's right, u r having too much disillusion from those j-pop/drama. I have Jap galfriends over there, glad that they r all very friendly and nice.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Konnichiwa , thank you guys , firewire ... etc . I can see there are some who agree with me hmm and there are those who don't . Yesh i agree with some of you that japan gals and sing gals are no difference . I am not a japanese mad but i impress by their politeness , in my whole life i never had some gals so polite to me (i had some japanese fr ) i am not saying or condemm all the sing gals but sad to say maybe all my life i had met gals who are bad to core it is beyond what you can imagine .And some did mention that japan had alot those "unchio" yesh i do agree with u but as i had said looks are secondary it is the inner beauty that counts .But maybe i shouldn't just say sing gals sucks it just too superficial i should have got into deeper . All the while in my school yrs i met up gals who are very proud (even though they are "chio"type ) .The hypo type i met alot . Now i am very sick and tired of them that is why i took in a anger manner .that is all folks thank you for ur guy's comments</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SO, i can see that the majority of the more "older" members agree with me .hmm and to subterfuge you shouldn't have said it is an act of immature as to speak i felt that only those like me who had gone through alot would agree with me .I had a friend he had his share of popularity among the gals .We had seen local gals whom had a pretext of "well , i am not into looks " but how true are they .For years i was despised by my looks and treated me cruel .Whenever i had tried to be friendly and nice to them they always had the feeling that i am trying to court her haizz . But i felt happy for those who had met good local gals hey that is good .And to money and power hey any average looking , normal japanese can easily make fall in love with her  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> .You had ask about what kind of behaviour turns me off ? hmm well take for one incident ok , i had seen on a crowded bus while i was standing on the bus and there was a empty seat infront of me , but i didn't wana take as there might be someone who needs it more than me , but i saw two young , local gals scrambling for the seats !!!! what is this and one more time a young poly sch gal fighting for a seat with an old man in a crowded bus but fortuantely the old man did get his seat . what is singapore is coming to be , still the pm is trying to promote courtesy in singapore . But i do see young boys giving their seats . So i thought to myself , heck what the f*** did we the singapore man get to deserve these kind of gals . Are they fit for us ?? do they deserve us ? And to enigma well i am not into their looks but more to their good culture and behaviour if you had read what i type earlier you will understand me more ^_^haha .<br>To firewire , it is not that i meant sing gals are not open enough but it is just their behaviour and their looks . They are ugly and ugly from the inside ! And by the way sing gals too are very superfical i have seen (my female "frs" ) well i ask what is their expectation of a bf , all of them wanted a wealthy one , handsome one , power , 5cs ..etc. HAH what do they deserve , do they think such man are attracted to them ?? .If you guys out there don't believe well go and try irc and say that you are rich and handsome well alot of gals will flood your toolbar trust me coz i tried b4 ^_~ .Well  to dumdum thank you for your advice , well let it be .... and to chosenone haha wheere you learn this from very bad ah whahahaha . sorry if i sound offensive but these are my views pls continue to express them ok ? ^_^ sayonara</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>kintaro: i think its an over generalisation on your part.  FYI, i've seen many Singaporean GUYS refusing to give up their seats even though there's an obviously pregnant or elderly person in front of them!  Its really quite an sickening sight.  this is really not a gender problem, but based on one's attitude.<br><br>i don't deny that there're probably a lot of materialistic gers around but hey, everyone's different right?  i'm sure you are much better off without them.  i have a friend who met her current bf from irc.  he doesn't score high in the looks category, and is definitely not rich, whereas my friend is very sweet-faced and pretty.  but guess what, my friend simply adores him, because of what he is, and not what he has or what he looks like.<br><br>do keep your eyes open.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kintaro man:<br><br>After reading your latter post, I can understand how you feel now. I apologize for the earlier misunderstanding I had of you.<br><br>I once had a misperception of girls. Why? I had the unfortunate experience of going after the type of girls who just wanted to go after guys with money.  There were a lot of those guys around my age here with money.  Most of their families came here with loads and loads of money.  Tons and tons of money!  Their parents were drving Mercs and they were driving Bimmers.  I was poor back then as I was still a student with no full-time jobs, no nice car, no shit to show for, no nothing man!  I was like you, angry and frustrated.  Whenever I saw a girl riding in a BMW with her bf, I thought these guys were bunch of suckers.  They think that when their gfs are fucking and sucking their cocks, the girls really like or love them.  In fact, those type of girls just wanted to fuck and suck their money.  Basically, taking the guys for a fucking ride!  Excuse my language! That's was my perception back then many years ago.<br><br>But now as I thought back, not all girls are like that.  Why?  I finally met a girl who only likes me for what I am.  She is not after my money.  Not that I after a lot of money anyway!  Of course, girls to some extent still want their bfs who have steady jobs or who career oriented.<br><br>So don't give up hope on Sg girls yet.  I am sure there are still plenty around who are nice decent girls.  Just be a little patience and keep your eyes open.<br><br>Good Luck!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorri, I wish to correct my typo, "Not that I have a lot of money anyway!" , not "Not that that I after a lot money anyway".<br><br>In addition, I would like to clarify that of course some girls who have rich bfs are the ones who really like their guys.  Not all are after money.  They are just fortunate enough to bump into someone whom they really like who have the money at the same time!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my my....KIntaro san...I think I agree with u Jap girls are more pretty..but Iknow lots of Jap girls here...and they are indeed polite...but most of them are quite open in terms of BGR..they can sleep with another guy though they might have a bf...but of cos not all..I am trying to say SG girls have the nice ones too...just that u might have not met them yet...I learnt Jap Language listen to Jap songs..love Jap food..had some Jap admirers ..so I know...Politeness is part of their culture and they are used to it...even though they might dislike u ..they still put on a "front:...do u want a person to be truthful if they dun like u ..or pretend they like u but curse behind u in their most profound Nihongo...life is not just seeing the surface...look deep...what may seems may not what it is....just dun generalise...<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 15 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So desu ne<br><br>I guess most of us here prefer jap gals? From what I saw told by a air stewardess, the common jap girls ain't that pretty. On street, you don't find girls that look like Speed or MAX etc.<br><br>But I dun deny my soft spot for jap girls!! It's been a dream for me to have one as a gf but sigh.......<br><br>I was so crazy for the language coz I want to PLAY TV GAMES and read those MANGA that I alwayz love!<br><br>I got so crazy over those manga that I GAVE UP my studies for. So regret now, that is why struggling with the stupid studies now. Sigh...wat to do, young and dunno how to think......<br><br>Anyone consider Korean girls? Very pretty and caring but they want MONEY! You have to hand all your earnings to them. So .....<br><br>Most SG girls I know of are okay. Never really complain anything abt SG girls. Only those who is surrounded by non-SG guys and those that went oversea to study. Some of these complain how lousy SG guys are.<br><br>I remember there was one big question of woman in singapore are getting more and more highly educated than guys. I remember my secondary school teacher told the class, many guys have the tendency to go to poly. And there, many stop going to University whereas girls continue on to University. So one day it will ended up that the girls are more educated than guys and guys WOULDN'T want a female for superior!<br><br>To prove her wrong, I SWEAR to go to university to studies but sigh...I disappoint myself!<br><br>------------------<br>why, bishamon? why bish?<br>coz he's God of War!!<br>But I'm a peacelover! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Eh, I have been to Japan lah and the last time was this June. The quality was most disappointing maybe because I was expecting Speed lookalikes to roam the streets.And oh! Money talks too!Those girls that I talked to seemed pretty materialistic. Thinking back comparatively, I quite missed the SG babes.<br>True, the average Sg girl may seem dao compared with the chatty Jap girl but really, I'd prefer a quieter, more reserved gf anytime!<br>Sure, they(SG lians) may sometimes not be as refined, but they're still a part of home and if you really have been to Japan, you will know that the average SG girl may even look better than their Jap counterparts.<br>Just my 2 cents</div>
