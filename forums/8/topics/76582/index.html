            <div class='col-md body'>UOB FAX BLUNDER<br><br>Woman still receives faxes after alerting bank<br><br># She gets eight taxes from UOB customers - with their personal information<br># Her and bank's fax numbers differ by one number<br># She claims the bank promised to solve the problem<br># But she receives two more faxes, including an internal memo<br><br>By Tan May Ping<br><br>SHE knows the embarrassing secrets of some customers of United Overseas Bank (UOB).<br><br>But Mrs Sarah Sim, 35, is not a bank employee. She just keeps getting faxes sent to the bank.<br><br>She has even got one of the bank's internal memos.<br><br>Faxes from the bank's customers started appearing on Mrs Sim's fax machine late last year. After receiving at least eight sets of faxes, Mrs Sim now has names, NRIC numbers, addresses, phone numbers, credit card, account and loan information, copies of various bills and even a CPF statement of people she didn't even know.<br><br>She claimed she got in touch with the bank in January and the bank promised to solve the problem.<br><br>But even after that, she received two more faxes, one of which was an internal memo.<br><br>Most of the faxes contained bad news.<br><br>They were sent from customers who were in debt and the faxes were meant to reach UOB's Credit Management Division.<br><br>Several were appeal letters proposing schedules of payment that were more manageable for them.<br><br>They naturally included personal details and sometimes copies of unpaid bills.<br><br>Security experts have warned that crooks can use credit card and account numbers to illegal make purchases on the Internet. And it will be hard for the credit card owners to dispute it.<br><br>FELT BAD<br><br>Mrs Sim said she felt bad looking at the letters.<br><br>She added: 'I looked at some of the documents as I had no choice, but it's not nice. I feel bad for them, especially when it's not good news.'<br><br>Mrs Sim said she received the first fax on Oct 31 last year. She said: 'I didn't do anything about it as I thought the person had dialled the wrong number. I noticed that the fax number written on it was very similar to mine.'<br><br>Mrs Sim and her family moved to their Bishan flat in June last year, and applied for a new number for their fax machine then.<br><br>She had almost forgotten about the episode until November, when she received several more sheets.<br><br>'There were suddenly a lot of faxes in November, but my husband said to just leave it,' she added.<br><br>There was a lull before another fax arrived on Dec 31.<br><br>Mrs Sim said she sent several faxes back to the senders and wrote on the copies that they got the wrong number.<br><br>She also called two of the senders on their handphones to inform them.<br><br>'They said they were given that fax number by the bank. I didn't talk very long with them as I felt funny that I had their information,' said Mrs Sim.<br><br>In early January this year, Mrs Sim felt she had enough of it so she called UOB's main line and her call was transferred to a woman, who told her to fax all the documents to her.<br><br>Mrs Sim said she faxed all the documents she had.<br><br>'When I was done, I called the woman and she said she didn't receive them. She said there could have been something wrong with that number so she gave me another number, and I had to do it all over again.'<br><br>Later, another woman from the Quality Management (QM) department contacted Mrs Sim and assured her that the bank would be more careful in future and that the relevant department had been notified, said Mrs Sim.<br><br>The woman also pointed out that the UOB fax number differed from Mrs Sim's in only one digit.<br><br>But Mrs Sim received two more faxes, on Jan 6 and 7, so she called the woman from the QM department and told her that if it happened one more time, she would alert the press.<br><br>ASKED FOR EXPLANATION<br><br>Mrs Sim also asked the woman for a written explanation, which she received by e-mail the next day.<br><br>The e-mail apologised for the inconvenience caused to Mrs Sim and assured her that the bank had 'taken the necessary steps to notify the department concerned'.<br><br>Mrs Sim thought faxes would stop coming after all this.<br><br>She said: 'I wanted something in writing, so that in case it happened again, they would be responsible for it. I also wanted them to know that I was taking it seriously.'<br><br>But on Feb 25, she received another fax. This time, it was an internal fax from one department to another, with Mrs Sim's fax number clearly stated on it.<br><br>She said: 'I thought to myself, what's going to be next?'<br><br>YET MORE PRIVATE FAXES<br><br>She found out on Mar 29, when yet another customer faxed documents to Mrs Sim's home. The faxes contained a lot of personal information from a woman who was heavily in debt.<br><br>There was an appeal letter, overdue handphone and utilities bills, and credit card statements in arrears from three other banks.<br><br>'This is very serious, just look at the amount of information,' said Mrs Sim.<br><br>But she decided she had had enough of calling UOB. She called The New Paper instead.<br><br>WHOSE MISTAKE?<br><br>Mrs Sim showed The New Paper all eight sets of faxes, and pointed out that five of them had her fax number clearly written on them, while only one had UOB's fax number on it.<br><br>She said: 'If it's once or twice then that's all right but how do you explain why so many people faxed to my number?<br><br>'And when I called two of them (the senders), they said they were given that number.'<br><br>UOB, however, did not want to be drawn into any speculation about this.<br><br>Four days ago, a representative from the bank called to say that it was changing the fax number in question so that people would not key in the wrong number in future, said Mrs Sim.<br><br>Will she herself now be more careful with faxes she sends?<br><br>Mrs Sim said she has always made it a practice to call and confirm that faxes she sends have reached those they are intended for.<br><br>And yes, now she will be extra careful, especially if there's any personal information involved.<br><br>Bank: Our numbers differ only by 1<br><br>UOB investigated the matter after it was alerted by Mrs Sim in early January, said a bank spokesman.<br><br>The fax number of UOB's Collections Department (which comes under the Credit Management Division) differs from Mrs Sim's fax number in only one digit.<br><br>Said the spokesman: 'Based on the faxes that were forwarded to us by Mrs Sim, we noted that one of the customers had correctly listed the Collections Department's fax number.<br><br>'Nevertheless, we immediately took action to follow up with these customers to advise them of the correct fax number.<br><br>'In addition, all our officers from the Collections Department have been reminded to inform our customers of the correct fax number.'<br><br>The spokesman did not reply to questions on how the problem came about or why the matter wasn't resolved as soon as Mrs Sim got in touch with UOB.<br><br>A senior banking lawyer said there would have been a breach of the Banking Secrecy Act if the bank did indeed give out the wrong number to its customers.<br><br>Said the lawyer, who declined to be named: 'It's quite a serious matter. It's a breach of the Banking Secrecy Act... information that was meant for the bank has now become known to the public.<br><br>'If I were them (the victims), I would... ask for compensation.'<br><br>Of course they would have to show that it was the bank's mistake.<br><br>Consumer advocate and lawyer Stephen Loke said that whether or not the bank was in the wrong, it should have addressed the problem as soon as it knew that its customers' faxes were not reaching it.<br><br>Mr Loke said: 'Why didn't the bank take... steps to stop it?<br><br>'They should have changed the number when they realised that their customers' faxes were getting lost, but it's taken them almost half a year to rectify the problem.'<br><br>Mr Loke highlighted the gravity of personal information falling into the wrong hands.<br><br>'There is no end to what someone could do with all the information, from making use of the credit card numbers to taking advantage of the victims' unfortunate situations.<br><br>'Customers' privacy is sacrosanct as far as any institution is concerned, and any kind of data falling into other people's hands is a bad breach of privacy,' he said.<br><br>SOURCE - TNP 20/4/04</div>
