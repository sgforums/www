              <p>it actually takes them 18 years just to have same standard of english as an average english speaking 12 year old singaporean boy.so they try comparing knowing fully well they cant compete with singaporeans!we have our english tested from ENGLAND,OXFORD!WHERR DID THEY HAVE THEIR ENGLISH TESTED IN???IN THEIR BARN???THEIR PADDOCKS??OR THEIR SCHOOL WHERE THE TEENAGE BREASTY TEACHERS WEAR LINGERIE TO WORK?</p>
              <p>IF THEIR TESTING SYSTEM ISNT FROM ENGLAND....BE IT YANKEE OR AUSSIES...THEN ITS A DILUTED IMPURE VERSION OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE.......BESIDES SINGAPOREANS GOT ENGINEERING AND HIGH TECH EXPERTISE TO COMPARE RATHER THAN ENGLISH WHICH IS USED TO BUY HAMBURGERS AT MACDONALDS!</p>

              <p>rofl.</p>
              <p>I wont even bother writing much. The racist guy sounded more american than Australian. I really hate how you people lump everyone together into "Asian" and "western". None of you are Asian, you are Singaporean, Chinese, Vietnamese etc or whatever you are. It's a really narrow category.</p>
              <p>So far i think we have not seen ANY good arguements here. Most critics can always find good arguements to insult anothers culture; some fo you have good points in pointing out that the majority of noble prize recepients and PHDs intellectuals are non Asian, although Kishore Mahbubani will certainly disagree and even quote numbers, but then the Japanese make good technology and the developing countries will develop.</p>
              <p>But i personally believe we "westerners" or "europeans" or (if i go more specific) "west european bloc" (even more specific) "Brits" have a right to feel superior only for past glories or past technologies or achievements. I believe europe has a monopoly on liberal ideas and human rights, back when "asia" (to use your own terms) did not have similar ideas; (with the exception of some classical Chinese philosophers; China is a great culture).  And we can feel superior; (well the Americans can haha) for inventing stuff like microchips and modern education and the rule of law; which many asian states are trying to emulate. But these issues are a matter of historical fact and are in the past, they can be used by people to "feel superior" and to make others feel inferior.</p>
              <p>But you guys should know that all that stuff does not matter... what matters is here and now. America is not all-powerful, USA cannot fight or take on all other states in war, nor can it survive on its own in the global economy, therefore, it makes no1 more superior or inferior. American soft power in itself does not make America superior. There is no genetic basis to claim one ethnicity is superior to another... yet =) But you get the idea right?</p>
              <p>I do think that the Singaporean school system is lacking in fostering creative thinking and decent sportsmanship. I remember PE in local schools was just army training, a lot of running and no games. Whilst in british schools PE were games and a lot of playing, fun, strategies and just simple playing the game; whatever it was basketball, rugby etc. PE in Singapore was just toiling training to prepare for IPPT and then for army, such a chore, already that is an element of a mechanized culture, which is inculcated since young.</p>
              <p>(Quite a sweeping statement for me to make, but i just want to air my views on the lack of PE in Singapore at a time; i think it may be different now, but still behind the so called 'west')</p>
              <p>When you are faced with such remarks, it is hurtful but exploding in a tirade of insults just does not do much. Instead, what you should do is look for stuff you can be proud of in your country. Also trying to ride on the bandwagon of "ASIA" is very shallow... i am sure that most of you Chinese Singaporeans are anti-PRC and try to think of yourself as not "chinese" so much so that you don't want to learn mandarin because you consider it uncool, but then if China sends China-man to Mars, you will immediately have no more reservations about your "chinese-ness", that would be very shallow and i predict that will happen in future =) But then Singapore might have its OWN nationalism and its own distinct culture by then.</p>
              <p> <br>Asia is not a union, it is just a region and it has no extensive ties similar to a federal American system nor the European Union, please don't use the term "Asian" as a generalizing picture, it is so shallow. I realize many Yanks make that mistake, calling a Chinese person "Asian." hilarious.</p>

              <p>These ang moh are nothing great, only teir top minds and scholars better the lives of the world, But asians all whether small or big, all work together to better everyone's lives.</p>
              <p>Ang moh are not great, they are sh%t anyway. Their country runs on selling raw materials and natural resources and giving the money to social security.</p>
