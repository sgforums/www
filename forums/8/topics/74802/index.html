            <div class='col-md body'>i have a malay family at my ground floor ( i live 3rd storey ,  above them). I think they're involved in some sort of malay wedding preparation and cook tonnes of food usually in the weekend in their kitchen. The problem is that they would cook for one whole day or more and the smell of fried chicken/curry just make us sick and our laundry suffers too. The whole flat would smell of oiliness.<br><br>I did write in to ministry of environment but proved useless because the officers claim that when they come and do spot check, they found nothing and just gave the family verbal warning.<br><br>What should i do? Confront the family with a chopper? Or call up env whenever they start cooking. They usually cook in weekends, so i guess no one will be around to conduct spotchecks.<br><br>I am not mean or stopping others from making money. But shouldnt they be considerate? This is a HDB block not a private bungalow.</div>

I think what they are doing is illegal just difficult for them to be caught red-handed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, i used to have a neighbour before i moved out (nothing to do with this incident). It's a malay family and they stay directly below me. Yeap, they cook every weekends and from 9am to 1pm, the aroma of chicken wings and curry would rise up and fill my house sometimes being too overbearing. One day, it happened from 8am to 5 pm, and my Dad being kinda pissed about this whole thing decides to confront my neighbour albeit with a kind intention  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>He found out that this Malay family cooks every weekend because they are volunteer workers with the Children Society and some mosques. Each afternoon, they would send food to these organisations and feed the hungry. They told my dad they have faced death threats and police complaints numerous times but they just continue with it because if they stop, many people would get hungry. My dad filled with regret in his mind approached our neighbours to show some tolerance towards that family and in the end, all went well until they day my family moved out. That particular family even cooked for my house warming party to show their gratitude.<br><br>This shows that neighbours are part of our life. Like the mortar and pestle in cooking or cement and bricks in the building, life without neighbours can never be be complete. Tolerance should be handled when you have such neighbours and because of misunderstandings, fights can occur.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alright, it's about time not to maintain my silence.<br><br>I've a solution.. but awfully wicked one.<br><br>If they are cooking to sell, check if they are officially registered.<br><br>If they are officially registered to sell food, make a complain to Ministry of Environment as they are supposed to manufacture and sell food within their stall premises. They will lose their license for 6 mths or more.<br><br>If they are not even officially registered, that's even better, lodge a complain to the police, Ministry of Environment and ROC. They will take legal actions. This will be usually more severe than the above-mentioned.<br><br>BUT then, are you really going to kill them off with that?</div>
