            <div class='col-md body'>Shopping for a girl<br>Spending my afternoon shopping is like watching a two-hour documentary on why birds migrate south during the winter.<br>My idea of shopping is to decide beforehand what I want and where to get a good price for it.<br>That would take me in and out of a shopping centre within 30 minutes.<br>But women donÂ’t see it this way because to them shopping is like fishing, where<br>they could chat and bond with people, while they troll for those big savings.<br>This  is  funny  because  the  only  people who want to bond with me at shopping<br>centres are the sales people.<br>"Boss, friend, friend lah. For you<br>special, I give you 30 per cent discount. I don't make money on this one lah."<br>He  knows  me for all of 30 seconds, says I am his friend and that he is willing<br>to  lose  money  for me. Guys like this should work for the United Nations' task<br>force on "How to get George Bush to become a friend of Saddam Hussein".<br>But whatever your inclinations,<br>shopping is an important part of a<br>relationship with a woman.<br>When  I  first  get  to  know  a  girl, I always make it a point to allow her to<br>suggest  what  we should do ? be it having dinner, going to a club or watching a<br>movie ? because I want to look like a caring and sensitive guy.<br>But  there'll  come  a  time when this approach wears off and I'll be sitting in<br>front of her and she will be asking me<br>this question: "So, what shall we do today darling?"<br>I've  become  quite  an expert on this and can tell you with some authority that<br>this is a trick question.<br>And it becomes trickier when she<br>follows  through  with:  "How  come I'm the one who is always suggesting what we<br>should do?"<br>Before you could tell her it is a man's thing to allow women to make these<br>decisions, she'll say: "Why don't you for once decide what we should do?"<br>As an expert, I keep in my memory a standard list for moments like this.<br>I  always know what she would say but to make sure there is communication in the<br>relationship I'll start off with: "Let's go to the movies."<br>To this she'll say definitely: "There is nothing interesting showing right now."<br>Then, I'll suggest: "Let's go to a club" and she'll go: "We did that last week".<br>Sometimes, I'll toss fishing into the<br>list to try my luck but I risk bodily harm for doing this.<br>But when I say: "Let's go shopping,"<br>suddenly I'm smarter than Albert Einstein. She'll say: "That is such a brilliant<br>idea."<br>Women think shopping is the best way for guys to know them better.<br>What  they really don't know is that in our spare time we write nasty letters to<br>developers cursing their ancestors whenever they put up a new shopping centre.<br>And we tell them that if they must, could they include a pub in it or a day care<br>centre with beds so that men could take<br>a nap or just bum around while their women shop?<br>Men  know that women love shopping and that is why you find us there: To try and<br>pick up girls ? not to go there with one.<br>And  there  is  another  reason  why I hate to go shopping with a girl: There is<br>always  a high chance that I'll end up in the lingerie department holding a pair<br>of panties high up because she wants to see how it looks from two metres away.<br>If  I  don't  look  stupid doing that, then I usually look like some kind of sex<br>fiend.<br>There will always be an old lady staring at me with her mouth gaping because she<br>thinks that I am either a cross-dresser or someone with a panty fetish.<br>I have to ask this question: Why do women love fancy underwear?<br>It's  not  like after buying one, they go around in the office with their skirts<br>up telling people: "Look what I just bought."<br>The  only reason I make sure that I put on decent underwear every day is because<br>I am paranoid. I am paranoid because<br>I might find myself in situations where I actually have to strip.<br>Like  if  I  am  in a bank that is being robbed and everyone is made to strip to<br>stop heroes giving chase to the crooks.<br>Can you imagine what the headline would read the next day, if you are<br>caught  wearing a "Saddam, kiss my butt" underwear? That, in my books, is a good<br>reason to die.<br>But guys, if you really love a girl and want to make her happy, go shopping with<br>her.  Usually  a dinner, movie or a romantic cuddle after this is well worth the<br>ordeal.<br>If not, at least you would have avoided World War Three.</div>
