Thats why i think the classicals are better. they never intended for their music to sell when they make them. they make them from the heart, as an expression of themselves and their geniuses. thats why its better. its a true work of art, of reflections of life, not a piece intended to make money.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Words of Andew Loyd Webber</strong><br><br><blockquote>After a couple of days, the music of one in every five<br>Bollywood songs was hitting not just me buy anyone who<br>heard the stuff. There had to be a common denominator.<br>This was their composer, A R Rahman. One look on the<br>net revealed that he was a phenomenon in Asia, where<br>he's known as the Asian Mozart. Rahman was born in<br>1966. His father was Hindi and a musician. Rahman<br>himself converted to Islam as a result of a family<br>tragedy. That is when he took his name. His scores<br>have been composed for some of India's most successful<br>films including Dil Se and Lagaan, which was nominated<br>for Best Foreign Film in the 2002 Oscars. With album<br>sales of over 100 million, his albums have sold more<br>than Britney Spears and Madonna combined. Soon my<br>house was full of them.

LOTR movies were still sucking tits when Star Wars movies were out pioneering special effects and laying the ground work for all special effects today. Sorry ARR can't even reach John Williams, much less Bach.<br><br>heres a tip. why don't u stop being narrow minded and accept that ARR's music is not the last word in music, and that not everyone has to like his music, and that those who don't like his music aren't "people who know nothing about music"? u're accusing others of being narrow minded when u're being the most narrow minded person of all here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Noted composer A.R. Rahman will score the music for the play �The Lord of the Rings� based on J.R. Tolkien�s famous novel by the same name. The theatrical London launch of �The Lord of the Rings� comes as Hollywood builds the author�s work into its biggest box-office hit series.<br><br>A scene from the film �The Lord of the Rings.�<br><strong>Kevin Wallace is producing the �8-million ($13.8 million) prestigious project</strong> of Rahman, <strong>meant to be London�s most expensive production ever staged in the city�s theatrical heart, the West End.</strong> While announcing the venture in London in October, Wallace said Rahman was needed to write �unique� music, with an �exotic quality� and �brilliant melodies.� The show will be taken around the world as a multicultural global stage performance. Rahman, affectionately known among the British as the �Mozart of Madras,� is to collaborate with Finish folk group Varttina for �The Lord of the Rings.� Rahman had also scored the music for Andrew Lloyd-Webber�s successful Hindi film-inspired London play �Bombay Dreams.� <strong>According to theater critics Rahman was an inspired choice to compose the music for Tolkien�s nearly 50-year-old epic story as Rahman is known to Wallace, who has produced several Lloyd-Webber musicals.</strong><br><br></div>
