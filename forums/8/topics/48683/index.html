            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>A while back, I received an email about our HDB blocks. It began by asking if anyone has ever heard marbles rolling above upstairs or furniture being moved late at night. Although I can't remember what the email said exactly, I remembered that the explanation was that marbles were placed in between the concrete slabs between stories to allow "them" to play with the marbles and not disturb living occupants. And that I was very spooked by that email because I had heard marbles rolling around from upstairs back when I was living in Jurong West. And what made it scarier was that it was a new estate (near Jalan Bahar and very few occupants-or at least living ones that I know of) and I knew there was no kid living upstairs. Just adults and either one or two teenagers. Besides, it didn't make much sense cos who would play marbles late at night and in this day and age? So my question is, is that really true? Do estate developers really have marbles inserted within a housing block itself, and if it does, is it common to every estate, or only selected ones? If this is true, it would seem as if it was driven by superstition, and again, in this day and age, it seems a little far-fetched? to still believe in such stuff. At the time, I told myself that there really was a kid upstairs just to reassure myself but I have to say, I'm really glad I no longer live there. Anyway, if you guys have time, I hope you can reassure me further with whatever you might know or find out.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yo, I heard of that before. But I don't think the constructors will get marbles for that. In addition, I don't think the walls are hollow. Maybe there are others different rumours about this spooky sounds <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
