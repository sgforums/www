The grammar will kill you.<br><br>As for TS, which language do you have a better command of? English or Chinese? (assuming your mother tongue is Chinese)<br><br>If Chinese, then there'll be one less hurdle for you in Japanese, which is Kanji. But you still have kana and the grammar (totally different from Chinese) to contend with. Bear in mind though, that not all Kanji in Japanese have the same meaning as in Chinese. I spent about 3 years self-studying Japanese and speaking Japanese around my friends who take it as a third language. And even so, my spoken Japanese is just passable, but it's quite fluent. My written japanese is tons better.<br><br>For Korean, they hardly use Hanja (Korean equivalent of Kanji) anymore, except in calligraphy. You'll need to master Hangul, which is an alphabet system of its own, and it's really not easy; I can tell from my experience. However, as you go deeper, you'll realize how similar some Korean words are used and pronounced as in Chinese. For any East Asiatic languages, Chinese helps a lot.<br><br>For French, keep in mind that English has borrowed a lot of words and vocab from French. However, the grammar is very complex compared to English, because you have case inflections, noun genders, article inflections. Moreover, the pronunciation is confusing, as the words are not spelt as they are pronounced, unlike English, which does that to a small extent.<br><br>As with any language, practice is the key. Listen to it more often. Speak it to yourself when you're alone. Write it often, such as when recording phone numbers or 4D. Read it online more often too. If you're better at it after a while, <span style="font-style: italic;">think</span> in that language.<br><br>It took me four years to get to H2 German standard(doing it now in JC), and three years to hold a proper conversation in Japanese. It's not an overnight thing.</div>

No point forcing yourself to learn 100 new words and later forgeting half of them due to underusage, I'm sure you will forget how to write some Chinese characters after 5 years in pure English environment. A lot of poly students picked them up only to give up altogether after their term.<br><br>Among the three, French is easiest to pick up, in our context. Although the conjugations may take some time to sink it. Pronunciation may be tough, but it is FUN when you get the hang of it.<br><br>Japanese has higher economical value if you are considering it as an employment asset. Plus the entertainment value from animes and dramas.<br><br>Focus on 1 language at a time. Don't give up too soon.

They're relatively easy to learn compared to the massive amount of kanji one will use in reading and writing Japanese.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Deutschsprecher(in), warum finden Sie Deutschlernen schwierig? Was finden Sie schwierig? Ich denke Deutsch ist leichter als FranzÃ¶sisch oder Spanisch... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> (German speakers, feel free to answer this question  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> )<br><br>In all seriousness, I don't think you could really compare the ease of learning phonetic languages with that of non-phonetic ones. That said, I don't think phonetic languages are that tough to master once you get a hang of how the lexicons and structures function for a particular language.<br><br>While I used to find the memorising of the noun's gender a chore when I started learning German, I personally can't say it's definitely tougher than Spanish as Spanish has other issues that trouble beginners unaccustomed to its structures as well. In essence, just embrace the language for what it is and enjoy the process as there really isn't any way of convincing yourself one language is easier than another.</div>
