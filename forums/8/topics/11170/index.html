            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Bangkok</strong>(Thailand):<br><br>A nice place to shop. Local goods are cheaper than what we can get in Singapore. Roadside stalls have interesting and exotic local dishes, but ain't for the weak-stomached. Restaurants' food prices are very cheap. The World Trade Centre there is much bigger than what we have in Singapore. The BRS(Bangkok Rail Systems, if I remember correctly) is worth a ride. Quite different from Singapore's own MRT. Leather goods are cheap too and you might wanna check those items with exotic skins out. Night activities are abundant. U can go and watch a Ah Gua Show or Tiger Show if u want and can take it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><strong>Tioman</strong>(Malaysia):<br><br>Food is similar to Singapore Zhi Char, unless u wanna have some western food, but sure taste better than a lot of places I have tried on local grounds.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Snorkelling near the Coral Islands is no longer that interesting as a lot of corals are dying due to pollution. The fishes however, are most interesting when it comes to feeding them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>Not much of night recreation though.</div>

Disneyland was an experience i won't forget.<br><br>Japan, was too boring for me. Walking around, freezing in the cold.

Yeah haha no amount of pretty girls would overcome the feeling of boredom...and well, there aint any pretty girls there at all.<br><br>Best bet for a holiday - HongKong, US.<br>P.S: Not honeymoon though.<br><br>The ultimate place i want to go:<br>Moon.<br><br>------------------<br>-=^Wynternight^=-<br>None as blind or deaf as those who refuses to see or listen.</div>

I ended up on a bus to thailand, it was lonely at first but later it got better. I made friends with a swedish backpacker and we were getting pissed drunk on the streets, i knew it's like a kid to walk out of home like that, but it was a good time to be out of touch with everything familiar, and sort my thoughts out. I met nice friendly people, nice friendly girls  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> it's a rubbish littered country but it always keep me running back, not for the girls but the water and islands.<br><br>The 2 most likable place for me will be Thailand and Australia, I enjoy being close to nature and driving in all these places. I get to see the culture, people and food.

            <div class='col-md body'>try ko samui before the develop it to another Phuket..<br><br>went there, basically just chilled out, drank a few cases of beer, ate their food, mingled with the other tourists (i think we 2 guys were the only asian tourists there) and had the most relaxing holiday ever...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mishima:</div><div class="quote_body">Have anyone travel alone before? I did. One time I had a big fight with my parents and i just walked out. I ended up on a bus to thailand, it was lonely at first but later it got better. I made friends with a swedish backpacker and we were getting pissed drunk on the streets, i knew it's like a kid to walk out of home like that, but it was a good time to be out of touch with everything familiar, and sort my thoughts out.
