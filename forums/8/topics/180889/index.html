            <div class='col-md body'>Location. Near Wilmore, Pennsylvania<br>Date: August 16 2005 Time: 2130<br><br>The main witness his son, his brother and nephew were fishing at the Wilmore Reservoir outside Portage in Cambria County. They had built a fire for light source even though they had a flashlight. They were sitting on the dock fishing when his son playing with the flashlight directed it towards the fire some 40ft from their location. Between 2 trees about 3 ft behind the fire the main witness caught a glimpse of something. His son then moved the light. His brother then grabbed the flashlight and shined it back; it was then that the main witness realized that he hadnÂ’t been the only one who saw it. What they saw was extremely terrifying. It was a 7 to 8 ft tall figure, its arms almost as long as its body. It appeared to be hunched over a bit. They didnÂ’t get a good look at the face, but it was definitely not human. It was bright white but not shiny like an albino and it moved as if its knees were in backwards.<br><br>Location. Seberang Jaya, Malaysia<br>Date: June 22 2005 Time: 1930<br><br>Mohamad Amirudin, 34, stepped out of his house with his 3-year old son after hearing a commotion from the children playing outside. He glance skywards and saw a large bird-like creature flying over the area. According to the witness it looked like an ordinary bird, flapping its wings but was much larger. However, he was unable to give an estimate of its height. The bird was black in color but there was red light on its front portion. The adult folks said that it was a mythological bird but the children said that it was a ghost. After looking at the strange bird for a few minutes, the witness went indoors since it was already sunset. Several minutes later he glanced out the window and saw the children still looking at the bird.<br><br>Location. Near Getafe, Spain<br>Date: January 9 2005 Time: night<br><br>A man and a woman were parked on an isolated road when the man noticed a strange shadowy figure moving nearby. His girlfriend also noticed the figure. It seemed to move around and appear in different places. At one point the figure apparently approached the vehicle and appeared outside from below one of the windows. Surprised the man stepped out of the car to investigate what was happening, suddenly he heard noises on the nearby grass and afraid he went back inside the vehicle. The noise seemed to originate from different locations at the same time, but before exiting the vehicle they had not heard any noises. He backed his vehicle away from the road and could still see the shadowy figure, that appeared to be of medium height and shapeless that moved around at very high speed. The headlights of the vehicle did not bring out any details on the figure. Since it had been a cold night the car windows had been covered in a fine mist. Once at home the two witnesses were stunned to see the images of two hands outlined in a perfect circle on the front windshield, the marks appeared to be totally dry and they could only see the fingers and half of the hand.<br><br>Location. Huay Nam Rak, Chieng Mai Province, Thailand<br>Date: September 8-9 2005 Time: unknown<br><br>Thai television reported that an entity was seen on a rice farm by four or five people. It had a large head and a yellow body. The Â“phantasmÂ” then stretched into the sky and disappeared. The new anchor called this a Â“jahn binhÂ” or flying saucer. Others added that it had a small body, a large head and didnÂ’t leave any footprints. It is reported that the creature wandered around in the field for about an hour without taking notice of the villagers. Sawaeng Boonyalak, 35, who was among who rush to see it, reported that the humanoid was about 70cm high and had yellow skin and a flat chest. Its mouth was very tiny; it had a large bald head with big eyes and big ears. The humanoid then suddenly floated to a treetop and after more villagers came to see it, it floated into the sky and into a bright light. District chief, Wisit Sitthisombat who interviewed the ten residents said they were consistent in their testimonies.<br><br></div>
