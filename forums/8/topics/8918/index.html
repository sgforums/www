            <div class='col-md body'>I was walking alone, going nowhere, in the wee hours about 4+am, at a place near a red-light district. It was a place dat I had never ever been and unfamiliar with. The road is wide and desserted yet with a steady stream of passing cars. Cabs made up most of the vehicles. There were alot of Indians on bicycles ready to deliver newspaper too. I juz wanted to go on &amp; on. Wasn't feeling very well, i stopped at a function. Was scared standing there so made a call to a frd. And by then, there were a few cars which stopped at the traffic light. Although i was toking to my frd, i had noticed dat a guy in a green convertible was looking at me. I ignored him all the same &amp; pretended not to c it. He then turned into the small lane. I crossed the road to the direction where i came from. I heard a car behind me (I was walking at the edge of the road instead of the pavement) and a man's voice saying 'hi' to me. i turned back. Saw him. He overtook me and stopped by the road in front. I walked up to the pavement and continue walking. I had actually furthered my distance away from the road but then changed my mind and headed towards him. He was still in his car, i bent down and ask him wat is it all abt. He asked me whether i want a lift. I politely declined, he took it well &amp; drove off.<br><br>Now, i'm wondering what was he thinking? Coz i wasn't in the rite frame of mind &amp; at first i had wanted to get in. Was oladi upset &amp; a bit tipsy, and further more made worse by an incident in my half-drunken state. But then, i dun look drunk at all. I can still walk steadily and tok properly when i made an effort too... if not, i will juz b a bit like walking on air &amp; slurring when toking (drinkers will know wat i mean). But i'm sure there wasn't even a hint dat i was drunk. I was tinking since I was going no where and dun care wat'll happened, i may as well get into his car.<br><br>Coming back to my senses, I'm glad i didn't, but I'm still curious.<br><br>Is he a good Samaritan who's worried 4 my safety or is he out for some thrills?<br><br>------------------<br><strong>The Three Wonders Of Women</strong><br>1.
