            <div class='col-md body'>Liverpool 3-1 Manchester United<br><br>Liverpool made it four successive wins against their arch-rivals and moved to the top of the table for the first time since September 1998.<br><br>Michael Owen scored twice to suggest United's grip on the championship is nowhere near as strong as it has been in previous seasons.<br><br>The visitors were bettered in every area of the pitch - but defensive mistakes from Wes Brown and goalkeeper Fabien Barthez made Liverpool's job that little bit easier.<br><br>Owen curled in a 32nd-minute opener before John Arne Riise made it 2-0 before half-time with a blistering free-kick.<br><br>David Beckham pulled a goal back just after the interval, but Owen was on hand to head in his second just 60 seconds later as United slipped to their third league defeat of the season.<br><br>Anfield assistant boss Phil Thompson made one change to his Champions League midweek team, restoring defensive rock Sami Hyypia to the centre of the backline with Jamie Carragher switching to right-back.<br><br>Defensive problems had hindered Sir Alex Ferguson's side, but further upfield he dropped Paul Scholes for Nicky Butt and brought in Quinton Fortune to replace the injured Ryan Giggs on the left. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer also making a rare starting appearance alongside Ruud Van Nistelrooy.<br><br>United's travelling fans were left speechless on 32 minutes when Owen scored a very special goal.<br><br>Smicer's through-ball gave Heskey the chance to dummy, confusing Brown and Silvestre and allowing Owen to scamper clear.<br><br>The 21-year-old coolly gave himself the space to strike the shot with his right foot, curling it superbly into the top corner with Barthez well beaten.<br><br>On 40 minutes it was two - and it was another cracker.<br><br>Owen was fouled on the edge of the box by Silvestre and, with the Kop singing his name, Riise stepped up to unleash a stunning left-foot drive from the free-kick that screamed past Barthez into the top corner.<br><br>United's response after the break was determined, and they had pulled a goal back within four minutes.<br><br>Irwin's cross from the left cannoned off the unlucky Riise and bounced invitingly for Beckham, who drilled the ball past an exposed Dudek.<br><br>It stunned the Kop, but not the Liverpool players. They were back at United's throats, and within seconds they had their two-goal advantage back.<br><br>Another Riise long throw, this time flicked on by the dominant Heskey, was flapped at by the unconvincing Barthez and the ball dropped into the six-yard box for Owen to gleefully head his second.<br><br>Liverpool caretaker boss Phil Thomspn said: 'I'm very, very satisfied - the boys were outstanding.<br><br>'Everyone worked extremely hard, which is what we asked, and I thought the players were fantastic.'<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
