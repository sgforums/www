Viewers of the movie "Gladiator" may have gathered that Emperor Commodus had incestuous feelings for his sister Lucilla, but that was never documented in official history.<br><br>In Greek mythology, there was Oedipus, the king of Thebes, who killed his father and married his mother without knowing his real parentage. This Greek tragedy inspired Austrian scientist Sigmund Freud to develop his theory on Oedipus complex.<br><br>Compared to incest, another practice implied in the movie "Gladiator" -- pederasty or the intimate relationship between a young adolescent boy and an adult man -- was more common in ancient Greece and Rome.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HENG@:</div><div class="quote_body">no. just like how most christians ignore the fact that the person who 1st compiled the bible is a pagan king who was baptised against his will only when he was dying n too weak to protest against it.<br><br>or the fact that many things like going for service on sunday comes from the worship of the sun god<br><br>how about the fact that many gospels are repressed because they don't serve the needs of the Church?<br><br>or that many factual gospels were declared "illegal" and burned because the history recorded in them is contary to what the church is saying?<br><br>or that the fact that many of the records in the dead sea scrolls don't match official church "history"<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>also, u have to wonder why many christians take the bible as a direct memo from god when it's actually ALL written by humans and coloured by human influences.</div></blockquote>correction, the bible isnt a full book, it was in fact many different accounts of different people from different regions that were compiled into 1 book thats why we have various accounts by matthew etc... secondly it was never a european thing..it originated from the middle east with jewish diciples spreading the gospel to pagan lands who later mixed and matched the original thing with their own pagan rituals. and yes, many so called "christian" practices are in fact pagan practices such as christmas, easter and good friday were all taken from the roman and nordic pagan cultures. and we have got to make a seperation because the only large scale institution which introduced all these pagan cultures was non other than the roman catholic church. it is true that also many documents and contradicting facts were hidden and until as reccently as the 20th century, all of us outside their sphere of influence were considered heretics, the very reason why the crusades was launched. today i think that there is hardly any book that can claim to be the "word of God" especially the hybrid new age versions of the bible such as NIV and NKJV, that is why we must always question and reason, never trust a single authority to dictate the rules and certainly not mortal men.</div>
