            <div class='col-md body'>from Channel news asia.<br><br>BANGKOK: Thailand and South Korea have boosted security after Seoul's embassy in Bangkok received a letter threatening terror attacks against countries supporting US-led operations in Iraq, diplomats and officials say.<br><br>The letter, received Wednesday from a group identifying itself as the "Yellow-Red Overseas Organization," threatened attacks on major facilities in Australia, Japan, Kuwait, Pakistan, the Philippines, <strong>Singapore</strong>, South Korea and Thailand between April 20 and 30, a Korean diplomat in Bangkok said.<br><br>"This is a serious problem. They threatened <strong>embassies, air flights and other interesting place</strong>s (in the eight nations)", First Secretary Ryoo Jung-Young told AFP.<br><br>He said Seoul had immediately demanded greater security for the embassy and the Korean community in Thailand.<br><br>Thai Foreign Minister Surakiart Sathirathai said necessary precautions were taken after the letter was reported to authorities.<br><br>"Embassies are entitled to seek extra security, and the Thai government cannot ignore those requests. We have ordered intelligence and security increased around the embassy," Surakiart told reporters in Bangkok.<br><br>Major General Tritot Ronnaritivichai, commander of Thailand's Special Branch police, confirmed that police were on alert at the embassy as well as around Korean tour companies and areas here where South Koreans lived and worked.<br><br>The letter, typed in English and sent by regular post from within Thailand, was being examined by Thai authorities, the diplomat said. The embassy was operating normally.<br><br>A South Korean foreign ministry spokesman said the letter was addressed to "all US alliance forces in Iraqi operations", adding that eight countries were mentioned by name.<br><br>"We are looking into the credibility of the letter from various points and also collecting additional information," the spokesman, Kim Sung-Chul, said in Seoul. "We have also been in contact with all related countries."<br><br>A security alert imposed in South Korea last month has been extended until the end of April in response to the threat, while South Korean embassies overseas have also been asked to step up security, he said.<br><br>In Australia, a spokesman for Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said the government was aware of the letter and trying to establish its authenticity.<br><br>"Australia has been targeted in these kinds of warnings for many years, back to our involvement in East Timor (when Australia led the UN-sponsored peacekeeping mission there in 1999)", the spokesman said.<br><br>In January, South Korean authorities stepped up security at airports after Korean Air's Bangkok office received a letter from an unknown group identifying itself as the "Anti-Korean Interest Agency" and warning of attacks on flights to the country.<br><br>Eight days earlier the group had warned Seoul's embassy in Bangkok of attacks on South Korean assets and aircraft in Southeast Asia.<br><br>South Korea heightened security last month following the terrorist bombings in Madrid that killed almost 200 people.<br><br>Prime Minister Goh Kun, South Korea's acting head of state, said countries backing the US-led war in Iraq were potential terrorist targets.<br><br>South Korea plans to send 3,000 troops to Iraq in the coming weeks to work on relief and rehabilitation projects.<br><br>Thailand's senate voted Tuesday to keep its contingent of some 450 troops in Iraq, but Surakiart insisted the threat to the embassy had nothing to do with Thailand's humanitarian mission in the Middle East.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Article from The Straits Time<br><br>APRIL 23, 2004<br><strong><span class="large">Eight countries on anti-American group's hit list </span></strong><br><br>SEOUL - A self-proclaimed 'anti-American' group is threatening new terrorist attacks against eight US coalition partners, including Singapore, before the end of the month.<br><br>The group, which calls itself the Yellow-Red Overseas Organisation, warned in a one-page letter sent to the South Korean Embassy in Thailand that it will launch the attacks by April 30, embassy spokesman Ryoo Jung-young said.<br><br>The group described itself as 'anti-American' and threatened to attack diplomatic compounds, airlines and public transportation systems in eight countries that are US partners or have plans to send troops to Iraq.<br><br>They are: South Korea, Japan, Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore, Australia, Kuwait and Pakistan.<br><br>Mr Ryoo said it was the first time the South Korean authorities had heard of the group and were investigating the threat's credibility.<br><br>The embassy notified South Korea's Foreign Ministry, the Thai government and police, he said.<br><br>The letter was received on Wednesday and Thai police said they were stepping up security around the South Korean Embassy in Bangkok.<br><br>'We can't neglect this kind of situation,' said Thai police spokesman Kasipong Kingsakklang.<br><br>The Pakistan Embassy in Bangkok had also received a similar letter, an official said on condition of anonymity. South Korean diplomatic missions worldwide were alerted to the threat.<br><br>South Korea plans to send some 3,000 more troops to Iraq, which would make it the biggest coalition partner behind the US and Britain.<br><br>The deployment, pledged earlier this year for the northern Iraq oil town of Kirkuk, was put on hold amid concerns it would involve combat operations in violation of a parliamentary mandate for peacekeeping. Seoul is now considering two other towns.<br><br>The Philippines has about 100 troops in Iraq.<br><br>Thailand has 445 non-combat troops in Iraq and has contemplated taking them out. Japan and Australia, which also have troops in Iraq, have pledged to keep them there.<br><br>Kuwait, a close US ally in the Gulf region, was used by US-led forces last year as a staging ground to invade Iraq.<br><br>Singapore has a special facility for US aircraft carriers and has been a strong supporter of efforts to fight terrorist groups in the region.<br><br>Pakistan has no troops in Iraq but has backed the US-led war on terror. -- AP<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Copyright @ 2004 Singapore Press Holdings.
