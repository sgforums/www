            <div class='col-md body'>Gitano Jeans	Female	Popular Jeans	1982	Gitano Jeans were very popular for girls. They were jeans that came in different colors on the pockets. Teil, pink, green, blue or just plain. They were the same width all the way down. Not straight legged, not flared or wide legged pants. Do you remember those?<br><br>Kangaroos		Tennis Shoes		Tennis shoes that had a zipper pocket somewhere on them. Mine were white and purple (of course) and the pocket was underneath the tongue.<br><br>BASS Shoes	M/F	shoes	Late 80's	The BASS shoes that were a slightly more modern version of a Top Sider. The trick with these shoes was to curl the laces on both sides so that you slipped into them and you had 2 little curlicues on either side. They were a unisex shoe.<br><br>Buckle boots	male	boots	1980s	We in the goth scene used to wear these boots with really pointy toes with lots of straps and buckles a bit of a heel on them. Usually a chain going under the boot and a strap over and across the back... way evil looking<br><br>Jelly Jacket	Both	Clothes	1980 onwards	See through plastic raincoat which came in many different bright colours and tended to have large thick rope cord through the bottom of the jacket and cord through the hood. Very popular in the early 80's and still around today<br><br>Sock Boots	Female	Boots	Late 80s	These were leather boots with faux socks sewn inside the top of them. They were often worn with one or more pairs of socks so it looked like you had on several. The "socks" usually matched the color of the boots.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I remember always wearing friendship bracelets! I never took them off. I remember watching the tv shows like Macgyver and Alf! Time flies so fast! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Ovaltine<br>Great Eighties Ovaltine commercial with upbeat guitar band music and a man singing: "I can't get over Ovaltine... It's so delicious now. It tastes fantastic, WOW! It's a whole new scene, O- O- O- O-val-time.... I can't get over Ovaltine, I can't get over O-val-tine!!!"<br><br>Fruit and Fibre Cereal<br>A commercial where it looked like they were interviewing people on the street. The people were eating bowls of cereal. The cameraman or voiceover would say "That cereal looks good. What is it called?" and the person would always say "Oh, it's Fruit and....uh...... fruit and....." And then the slogan at the end: "Fruit and Fibre. Tastes so good, you'll forget the fiber."<br><br>Cocoa Krispies cereal<br>"Let Cocoa Krispies fill your spoon, and soon you'll be gazing at a cocoa moon. Sitting under a chocolate palm tree, by the cocoa sea." There was some other stuff before that but I can't remember it all.<br><br>Pizza Hut--A Swede's first Pan Pizza<br>This commercial probably wouldn't air in today's PC climate, but in 1984, it was one of Pizza Hut's "Your Hometown Pizza Hut" ads, which would end w/ the singers saying "AAAAAHH" (remember that). Two young American males and three American girls walk into Pizza Hut with Sven, a blonde male friend presumably from Sweden (two of the girls are holding his arms). Guy #1 says, "bet you don't have Pan Pizza back in Sweden, huh, Sven?" Sven replies, in the thickest, most cliched Swedish accent possible, "Zeee pahhhhn Peeeezzza? No-oh-oh-oh-oh!" The singers sing: "your first Pan Pizza at Pizza Hut/Pan Pizza made with AAAAAAH! cheese..." Guy #2 says, "YOU are NOT going to believe this," after which Sven and the girls laugh before sitting down. The singers continue: "All your favorite toppings! Oh please, can I wait just a minute for that..." Guy #1 then says, "for you, Sven, we OR-dered: a LAAAAARGE!" Sven says, "oh-h-h-h-h-h-h-h!" The voiceover man says something like, "the first time is ALWAYS the best time for a Pan Pizza at Pizza Hut, whether it's a Supreme, Pepperoni, or whatever your preference, everybody loves Pizza Hut Pan Pizza." While the VO man speaks, the camera shows close-ups of Sven eating his first pizza slice w/ a goofy, Gomer Pyle-ish grin on his face, and the two guys and three girls smiling at him in wonder. Then, Guy #1 asks, "so, Sven, what do you think of American cuisine?" To which Sven replies (don't laugh), "goooood, YAAAAAAH!!!" The singers conclude the ad by chiming in: "at your hometown Pizza Hut! Yaaaaahhh!" (instead of "aaaah!" Get it? LOL!)Nowadays, people would complain about an ad like this, but it was hilarious back in '83! Classic!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS<br>Kenneth Grahame<br>Illustrated by Michael Hague<br><br><img src="http://www.toonhound.com/wind-6.jpg"><br><br>You must know that this is many people's very favorite book from their childhood. THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS is utterly timeless. Grahame once said of this work: "It is a book of youth, and so perhaps chiefly for youth, and those who still keep the spirit of youth alive in them." And thus it is for everyone who is, or has chosen to be, young at heart.<br><br>No less than 65 illustrations grace this book - which took one of our favorite artists, Michael Hague, several years to complete. This was Hague's great-grandfather's, grandmother's and mother's favorite story. He says he was the fourth generation to be caught in Toad's spell. You can be sure he has put his heart into it!</div>
