We like to think that we're a mature, cosmopolitan society but really, we're just well-educated, period.   Our social behaviour and trend of thought can sometimes be so backward.<br><br>A handful are open-minded but a small handful only.  Like I always say, education does not a responsible and mature member of society make.  In terms of social finesse and social responsibility, we're sorely lacking.<br><br>Look at how fast we condemn and generalise people.

But if she has nothing at all - well ....maybe much more difficult<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, the same can be sez'd for the girls.  I haf a v. gd-looking guy fren, who's nice &amp; all tt, but he's a divorcee.  Up till now, he still hasn't found someone to whom he can admit he was married before.  Yesh, he admitted to me, but there wasn't tt spark between us.  It's a pity tt he can't find someone yet, he's such a great person.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Rhonda:</div><div class="quote_body">Yup! Actually, conservative to a large extent.  We like to think that we're a mature, cosmopolitan society but really, we're just well-educated, period.   Our social behaviour and trend of thought can sometimes be so backward.<br><br>A handful are open-minded but a small handful only.  Like I always say, education does not a responsible and mature member of society make.  In terms of social finesse and social responsibility, we're sorely lacking.<br><br>Look at how fast we condemn and generalise people.  Look at how fast we look down on those we deem not as good as us.  I mean, you can have high level executives treating maids like slavedrivers of old.  Tsk! tsk!  And look at how fast poor female divorcees get condemned... and they don't even look at the context and individual unique circumstance.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Myopic society... what more can be said?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote></div>
