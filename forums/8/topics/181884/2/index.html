            <div class='col-md body'>It is not just about money, and work. It is about pride, committment and respect. Someone says 'no one gives a fark in the cooperate world' and I totally agreed. I think not only students faces such problems but many employees too have problems with their superiors. Thats why unions are formed for. At least employees can form up together and voice out their unhappiness but who cares about a student who only works for just 6 mths.<br><br>If all your hardwork, efforts and committment are not recognized, do you think as a student, you want your juniors to suffer the same fate as you? Even a foreigner who employers think are talented will also not be happy working in the company but they got no choice as they need to have a job if they want to stay in singapore. So please respect your IA students like your employees.</div>
