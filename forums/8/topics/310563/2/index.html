              <p>you can say that the first chinese emperor do that for all i care but i was just pointing out an example that religion brings people together......</p>
              <p>islam has made barbarians into men of peace......also there were many muslim scientists and mathematicians who made great efforts in the science community which nobody can deny......i'm just showing you examples of men with religious background who could think and have compassion......</p>

              <p>i have no doubt that religion may be a tool but in my case that i'm presenting, i'm saying that religion does bring men together.......</p>
              <p>the shiite and sunnis etc.....are just men who got confused as to who was appointed as caliph by the prophet after his death......seriously, at the end of the day, they come together to bow under one god in piece.....</p>
              <p>religion does close a person's mind to a certain extent but it opens their mind to things that people with no religion could think of and vice versa......</p>

              <p>Men have other reasons to fight doesn't means religion have nothing to do with the conflicts we see in tis world. From a micro scale, it do brings men together and at the same time seperate them from other groups. Muslims/christians r more bonded to their people than to people from other religion. From a macro scale, it seperate the people</p>

              <p>Aiyoh... lets make your scenario easier to understand.</p>
              <p>Suppose u r in a ship, through no fault of your own u have to come to a decision. Turn left and u will kill 2 people or turn right and kill 500. Obviously given the information, I should turn left and kill the 2 people which is obviously better than killling 500. Am I evil ? Do u classified me as evil ? I don't think so. I, in fact classified u as a hero and acted correctly at such a time.</p>
              <p>Coming back to your scenario, if the only chance to save the world is to kill a city of people, then the right decision is to kill the city.  Am I evil ? I don't think so. I have noble intentions and I have done a good deed.</p>

              <p>Religion has lost its way throughout history. Religion today is not what it seems to be when it was first founded. There are many con men around that industry and they have taken full advantage of it for their own benefits. However, religion is important. But morality outweighs religion. One could be a very religious person, but yet slanders,lie and all sorts of bad stuffs, then there is no point being religious. Rather, someone who does not know religions have morality like respecting parents, helping the poor and people in need etc, i consider him/her people of the people.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, those who need spiritual help, i personally believe that Philosophy is good. One person whom you can read his philosophy is Confusicous. People have nothing to lose from reading philosophy.</p>

              <p>I'm agnostic and identify myself as a secular humanist. I used to go to church and used to believe that religion is the only basis for morality. But having seen that religious men are just as (if not more so) fallible as non-believers, I now feel that ethics/morality/good behaviour is not dependent on  religious belief.</p>
              <p>As an alternative to religion, there is the philosophy of secular humanism that  rejects supernatural beliefs as being necessary for morality and instead assert that we as humans being social  creatures have within us the means to live morally on the basis of rationalism.

              <p>People who loose their faith are usually followers who were very devout in their beliefs....then they are let down by the inherent weaknesses in their belief systems. So it is not a matter of them loosing faith in themselves, but more of religion not being able to live up to the hype it initially generated.</p>
              <p>And the only reason why people dun understand religion is becos the ones who preach it dun understand it themselves....</p>

              <p>Loosing faith in one self is the root cause.How many ppl really understand religion?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>It seems to me tat there r people who suddenly convert to a religion because they face a difficult problem which they cannot solve in real life. I think these people r the one tat lose faith in themselves and tat is why they seek divine unfairness.</p>

              <p>He gather the tribed by fighting wars and winning them isn't it ? It seems to be more force than religion tat gathered the tribes</p>
              <p>No one say religious people cannot be mathematician or scientist. Is just tat a lot of wars r based on religion and a lot of people do irrational acts because of religion. U can see the car bombs etc</p>
              <p>Men have other reasons to fight doesn't means religion have nothing to do with the conflicts we see in tis world. From a micro scale, it do brings men together and at the same time seperate them from other groups. Muslims/christians r more bonded to their people than to people from other religion. From a macro scale, it seperate the people</p>
              <p>they fight against one another. Full stop.</p>

              <p>religion is just something made up to make people believe in something. So at least theres something after death( Like heaven or hell) .</p>

              <p>But if u think of it in a way that when humans die, we are just like any other living things (animals or insects). They just die and thats it. No such thing as sprits or heaven or hell. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
