            <div class='col-md body'>My bf seldom do romantic things for me. Even for the flowers he ever bought for me was when he passed by a florist while we were out shopping then he asked if I wanted and pulled me into the shop and bought one rose in front of my presence. Even the diamond ring he bought for my birthday also he go shopping with me that time buy for me one...for once, I really hoped he can be a little more romantic and give me little surprises now and then...at least on anniversarys lah. Almost three years liao lor, seldom get surprises from him...not even a card for birthday...not to mention romantic love letters. Hard to find romantic guys nowadays. Maybe only gals harbour thoughts of romantic things.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Haha. Maybe time for us gals to wake up...if not, then guys, should start to be more sensitive and romantic lah...nicer to gfs mah. I mean, before marriage already dun have such things like romantic night out, surprise gifts or flowers, after marriage worst lor...we gals can only dream on! Hehe.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is not that we gals like to complain alot...but when a relationship starts to go into the second year, the third year...everything we do is quite routine...even he will start to say 'where should we go? where to eat? huh...go there do what?'...if there's no something different now and then and surprises now and then, it's hard to give some spark to the relationship. I have been trying hard...recently bought a new oven...kept making biscuits and cakes and his fave pineapple tarts...secretly do then surprise him with it...even learnt how to make katsu don, lasagne, spinach quiche cos we both like and made a delicious meal for him...well...why must it always be the gal who tries to do things for her guy...well...maybe the guys should do something for their gals once in a blue moon at least. Is flowers or surprise little gifts or a little card too much of a request?<br>For the many things we do for our guys, we just want them to satisfy a little romantic need we have a times...isit too much? I dunno for you guys...but I think it won't kill you to do a little something in return. Being sweet to your gf will only make them love you even more and be even nicer to you mah. You dun lose at all...but just dun understand why they just dun understand that some gals have romantic needs. Ok...to be fair...other than not being romantic, I must say my guy is considered very good liao lah. So, I also never requested from him alot of things...but since the topic here is about romantic things our bf do...I just wanted to know why some guys find it a 'chore' to think of romantic things which they can do for their gfs?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Psycho V:</div><div class="quote_body"> complain, complain, complain.....</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hehe...then you are very wrong. After eating what I made, he kept asking me to make. His mom will even make special orders to ask me make sushi and mango pudding. So far, all those who ate my sushi and mango pudding only came back for more. Though I grew up with maids but I can proudly say my cooking is still not bad. My JC friend up till now still pestering me to make sushi for him. He even say his sister also keep pestering to ask me make. Hehe.<br>But one thing I'm not good at making is 'tangyuan'...haven't master the skills yet. My best are lasagne, pasta noodles, hamburgers (I make the beef patty myself), sushi, katsu don, butter cookies, pineapple tarts and mango pudding. Others leh...I'm still experimenting very day...anyway, I've lots of voluteerers to test my food. Hehe. But my friends all laugh at me say I 'huang lian po'...sigh...but maybe I do have a little interest in making nice dishes. Feel especially happy when I see those who eat what I make are happy with the food. Well...to get to a man's heart, we must first start by getting his stomach.

            <div class='col-md body'>I hope my gf will pick up cooking in the future.She's too busy now and she's not that interested in cooking too.She even hint i pick up cooking instead.haha....But i guess timing plays a part in creating romantic atmosphere.Maybe in S'pore is harder cause we are always tired after a days work or studies.But i definitely agree that sparks are required to keep a relationship going,even after marriage.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
