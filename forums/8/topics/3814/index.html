            <div class='col-md body'>The mighty Rafflesian family, spanning over of the three top schools in Singapore with a total of around 6000 students, is about to become weaker. Most people dream to have the chance to get into the Rafflesian family to be among the top minds and have a guaranteed future of success. Everyone works hard for the primary school leaving examination so that they can get into the school of their choice, namely Raffles.<br><br>However, this is not the case when it comes to junior college selection, those from schools like Anglo Chinese independent want to go on to Anglo Chinese Junior College, similarly for those from The Chinese High. Even Rafflesians are choosing alternate junior colleges because they feel that that junior college suits them better.<br><br>This trend has resulted in the weakening of the sporting arena in Raffles Junior College and even more so in the academic area. First let us look at the advantages of the through-train system.<br><br>The most obvious benefit is that this system will encourage students to maintain good grades throughout their years and allow academically excellent students to participate more actively in their core curricular activities in their secondary four year. Other smaller advantages include a stronger Rafflesian spirit and a more continued and complete form of education.<br><br>This is all well and good but how about the fact that this does not solve the problem of "brain drain" from Raffles Junior College, it only worsens it. The through-train system will obviously result in more students from RI and RGS entering Raffles Junior college, however, there will still be some who would rather go to another junior college that offers better programs. Just take the Hwa Chong Humanities program, for example.<br><br>Furthermore, the through-train will reduce the amount of "foreign talent" that will enter Raffles Junior College. Who wants to go to a junior college where a particular school makes up a clear majority?<br><br>By introducing the through-train concept, the elitism amongst the Rafflesian has been reinforced, but exactly how elite will they be? Clearly, by reducing the amount of new blood from other schools, Raffles has subsequently narrowed its perspective, and thus lowered the standard. All along diversity has been a major factor in the success of schools such as RI, which is why there is no Raffles primary school that is directly affiliated to the Rafflesian family. T<br><br>he through-train will create elitists, but what kind of elitists will the future Rafflesians be? In my opinion, they will be academic elitists, and Raffles will continue to slide down in the sporting world and also socially.<br><br>Looking from a broader perspective, that is, at education in Singapore. If ACS, TCHS and Raffles were to introduce the thru train program this would lead to increasing the gap between those who did not do so well in the PSLE and those who did. Those in neighbourhood secondary schools would thus have no incentive to work hard because they know that they will never get in to the top junior colleges. Subsequently, this will increase income disparity, exactly what the government does not want.<br><br>In conclusion, the through-train system is a bad idea because it discourages diversity and enforces elitism, characteristics, which do not support the democratic government of Singapore. The "o" levels should be a bloodbath where everyone has an equal chance of succeeding, not a comfortable train ride for those who succeeded four years ago.<br></div>

It is not true that if a person gets to a neighbour hood school, he or she does not have the incentive to work harder. The PSLE does not determine a person's future...how many people who did not succeed in the PSLE gone on the succeed in secondary schools and JC? Furthermore academic success should not be a measure of total success. As you said, the <span style="font-style: italic;">mighty Rafflesian</span> could be strong academically, but socially they are not adept.<br><blockquote><strong><br>In conclusion, the through-train system is a bad idea because it discourages diversity and enforces elitism, characteristics, which do not support the democratic government of Singapore.

Of course, there are early developers who can adjust to the rigorous schooling in Raffles. However, there are those who need the extra time to hone their capabilities in order for them to compete with the Rafflesians. These is where the neighbourhood schools come into play. Yes, the O level could be a bath bath, but getting into a junior college is not everything. There is no guranteed success even if you are a Rafflesian or if you enter RJC. This false sense of security could lead to a downfall. There are many forms of intelligence of which logical / academical intelligence is, but one of them.<br><br></div>
