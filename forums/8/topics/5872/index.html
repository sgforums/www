            <div class='col-md body'>With the impending V-Day looming, casting long shadows into this forum (what with the proliferation of r/s threads), I thought I'd share with you guys a different lifestyle...<br><br>This is a true story of a very pragmatic fren.<br><br>To quote :-<br><br>Work your butt off until you're 32. And I really mean working ur butt off. Don't be distracted and put as much spare time as you can into carving out a career niche and/or be entrepruenial and start a small business. Earn as much $ as you can.<br><br>At 32, devote as much energy as you would have put into your work and look for the chio-est 25 yr old around. Put the spell of romance on her (this is where ur $ comes in) and rock her world.<br><br>You see, guys, it's not very hard to be the kind of guy with the intangible qualities girls speak of i.e. humour, "connection", intelligence. You can work at that.<br><br>Even simple displays of devotion. All you need is some sensitivity and a little diligence and practise. Not very smart? Read more. How to be sensitive? If you can devote the same amount of attention to her "day in the office/home" as you would to her tits, you pass with grace and panache!<br><br>What is really hard for a guy is the amassing the moo-lah to DO IT!  :p<br><br>It's not the girls are "ka-ching!"... but to touch their hearts, you'll need the resources to do so.<br><br>To the girl, you appear to be financially stable, ambitious, hardworking, pragmatic and have a clear sense of the future. I'll be willing to bet a fiver that ALL gals in this forum want that in their partner.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>End quote.<br><br>This fren of mine is currently 29 and has 3 years more on his schedule to his utopia. He is working very very hard, juggling a full-time job at a publishing house, one part-time job as a supervisor at a bar in a country club on the weekends, and also gives tuition in A level economics to two groups of students. He keeps fit by going in to work at the country club early and using the gym for free. The next phase, according to him, will be the drawing up a plan to see him through the next 5 years through a private company endeavour.<br><br>You can say he has no life. But to him, this is his life - working actively towards the fulfillment of his dreams. He doesn't waste time to party. He doesn't moan and bitch abt SG girls. He realises that if he want the best girl, he'll have to be the best man.<br><br>Well...<br><br>I dun share every aspect of his attitude towards leading his life and I doubt everyone can. The discipline required is tremendous. But whenever I encounter guys asking on how to "kow char bor"... I think of him and I want to tell them this - this is the only sure-fire way.<br><br>cheers.<br><br>------------------<br>Cindy Crawford,<br>ON COURAGE...<br>"They were doing a full back shot of me in a swimsuit and I thought, Oh my God, I have to be so brave. See, every woman hates herself from behind."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>man...i'm sure you meant well by this thread...but after reading it, I feel that men are just put ont his planet to slave themselves silly just so that they can get a woman.....<br><br>Like that, I say "Hell no I won't go!"(firewire holding a pickett sign walking around in a circle chanting)<br><br>no way man....If life is just about that forget it then...at least for me.  I always thot that life was more than just making yourself marketable to girls....It's about making choices that weill fullfill yourself(in your friends case getting a girl is his fullfillment), but for me it's about being happy.  Having time for myself and for someone else.  If I were to work like a slave, then whats's going to stop me from continuing working like that even after I get the girl????  The fact is, people like this eventually love the job of working at the goal than getting the girl.  And even when they get the girl, most likely they have very little time for the girl anyway, so what's the diff...????<br><br>I want to make my Gf or wife happy...And that means I need to have enuff time to spend with  her...to let her know that no matter what I will make time for her.  And as for money, what I make will be hers, but it can't be the prerequisit for which she gets with me(it weill be a by-product of being with me).<br><br>AS far as stability is concerned, most people are quite stable...Even if you don't have the best job or the best pay, it shouldn't matter. the way I see it, it's become a job interview where u try and market yourself so that the girl will hire you for life because of your abilities....<br><br>I believe that it's the intangible that matters the most but this is also the thing that most don't see and don't care much about so you will have a hard time getting girls...<br><br>I'm NOT going to subvscribe to that idea of marketing myself...If the girl can;'t like me for who I am then F**** it....Dun need her anyway.  I'd rather have someone who can appreciate me no matter how off I am at everything......<br><br>I will never form my life to fit the will of women or other men....It shall be led the way I feel it should be lead...nto for girls and not for guys...but for myself........<br><br>yeah...sorry, at this hour after no sleep, one tends to jsut bableon and on about oneself...hmm..better sleep then and come and read this again to see what idiotic thing I wrote here during half consciousness...<br><br>whoohooo...<br><br>zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heya FW,<br><br>I guess the context is not abt marketing per se. I'm guessing his thesis on how to lead his life is unique to his own disciplined application.<br><br>I seem to recall you saying something like sometimes it gets so hard to trying to work and juggling the mating ritual at the same time. Yar, that's what he means.<br><br>In a way, he's willing to forgo all that useless mucking about, forgetting all that jazz abt pick-ups and ditching all those insecurities at being the "average" guy.<br><br>So the answer to any guys out there who want the chio-est babe is simply, if you want to be the best babe, you got to the best man for the job. Work at it.<br><br>cheers.<br><br>------------------<br>This guy walks into a bar with a duck on his head.<br>The bartender, who's seen just about everything says, "what can I get you?"<br><br>To which the duck replies "you can start by getting this guy off my ass."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, your friend's philosophy is similiarly to mine, but I am not that extreme yet, but I do believe in upgrading your own value, so that you are more sellable. *laffs* But I definitely would not mind a relationship should some gal interest me along my way to success. But of course, career is still at the top of my mind now.<br><br>For those who disagree, well I have this to say, what do you mean it is not worth slogging your life for a gal? Care to explain? It would be interesting to know what you meant by slogging. But personally, I think that I would slog so hard not just to get the gal, but so that I will not have financial worries, by then, and then that is the time I can totally devote my time and energy to my partner in life. Also what I meant by financially stable seriously means that I dun even have to work and money still comes in, basically I hope to retire by 35. (Yeah yeah, you guys must be thinking that I am dreaming, but I know it is possible.)<br><br>I want to live the type of life where I won't have to worry about money the next time I want to go on a holiday.</div>
