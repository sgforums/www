When it comes down to brass tacks, unless you're doing something as specialised as what Heng is doing, there's not much about one university's course that is intrinsically better than that of another.  Factor out the styles of specific teaching staff and the students' willingness to go the extra mile, and you've pretty much got a level playing field.<br><br>Ther real value of an overseas education comes in with having one's horizons broadened by being in a different culture.  After all, with globalisation moving at the current rate, it is increasingly likely that we will all have to deal with people from different countries and cultures at some point.  More than knowledge of a specific culture, knowing how to deal with people of other cultures is probably going to come in handy at some point.  Reducing that to the banality of work, this knowledge will of course be useful and therefore attractive to employers.</div>

UNSW is good, but not exactly worldclass i guess. Dun mistake my comments for uni bashing, just a personal opinion.<br><br>I guess world class unis would be Yale, Wharton, Harvard, and many more. Probably those in the Ivy League. The definition of 'worldclass' is subjective though, anyone wanna share their idea of what constitutes as worldclass unis?<br><br></div>
