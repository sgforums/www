We were always regarded as the weaker gender because there is definitely no competition when it comes to the brawn but that doesnt mean we dont have BRAINS.<br><br>For all the women(NOT MEN) in the past who fought to get us females what we have now, its something that has enabled us to prove our self-worth. We are not merely good at making beds, cooking and cleaning. Just because we have proven ourselves to be more apt when it comes to multi-tasking, it doesnt mean that we have to be on the receiving end of Men being complete assholes due to us trampling on their frail little egos.<br><br>BE A MAN. Your replies shows how much of a wuss you are. You're entitled to be angry sure, but reacting the way you did with such dramatic ungentlemanly flair?? Utterly GROSS... </blockquote>I am sorry hor..what happened in the past is the PAST. The men at present has nothing to do with what happened to the women years ago.  Besides if reincarnation actually exist some of the men here could be those women in their past lives lol. Same applies to the women. And by saying women tend to be more apt when it comes to multi-tasking, isn't that very sexist? what makes you think men can't do better? you got any proof?<br><br>I agree he seems a little bit overreacting but you are not much better yourself leh. Just because we suggest some things you overreact and insult him like that. You also cannot take things easy yourself, so what makes you think you have the right to criticize others.  Furthermore that girl is not his gf. Since you advocate gender equality, why should you insist on him must be gentlemanly and all that shit? then shouldn't the guys stereotype too and insist women must wear more femininely and behave more femininely instead of going round making lame comments?<br><br>Another feminist...pui. Ask for gender equality and yet expect men to behave the way they want to.<br><br>Anyway equality does not exist in sg anyway. Some people lives are too good liao, don't have to serve NS and have job priorities going for them n yet they still bitch about men.</div>

It is as good as male chauvinists expecting women to wear skirts and nothing else (including pants and jeans), act as the women they are, forbid them to say any words that are deemed to be unfeminine like arse, assholes, demand that women stay at home and learn to be housewives and bear children instead of going out to work, believing males are superior to females,e.t.c. Regarding to opening of doors, a website for you to read :http://www.jtest28.com/MenHated.html.<br><br>taken from the website:<br>5:00 pm: It's time to go home, and remembering what Amy had said a few minutes earlier, I decide to open the door for a woman and her friend. As they walk by me, one of them commented, "What a pervert, he probably thinks he's going to get my number for opening the door for me."<br><br>Thanks to sexist sterotyping feminists like you here, we can never have real gender equality<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote><br>Hmmm..

Anyway,  i do know of women that can't take rejection. Some time back (abt a few years ago),  newspaper reported of a guy who left a girl for another one. The girl got so mad and end up stalking him and his new gf. When confronted, he replied that his former girlfriend is possessive and was controlling every aspect of his life. It was taken to the small case tribunals ( not too sure if it is the small claims tribunal or meditation from lawyers). They reach an agreement whereby the guy have to return his handphone given by his former gf and pay back the money for the gifts his former gf had given him. Such pettiness...tsk tsk<br><br><blockquote>Always did wonder how females who wished they were more powerfully built, felt about guys..

Hmmmmmm</blockquote>Wow now women can't be independent like you said? do you need brute strength to live in Singapore? there are reports that nowadays women are beginning to say no to marriage and pregnancy and is happily living a single life.http://www.singapore-window.org/sw02/020927a2.htm. Saying women can't be  independent is a whole load of bullshiting crap. Women can't be more powerful than men? you should take a look at those weightlifting women in the olympic games.<br><br>Unfortunately, I have no interest to have this topic stretch to 9 pages here, which i see it as being pointless. Therefore i rest my case. I do have a website link for sexist sterotyping feminists like you to read<br><br>http://www.ifeminists.net/introduction/editorials/2004/0324roberts.html<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess many women who never had to fight for their rights and equality in the workplace are as clueless as men about gender equality. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Many (NOT ALL) gals in sg have very warped sense of equality, thereby causing this "heads I win, tails you lose" symdrome.<br><br>Based on personal experience, whenever I hold doors open for local women, I get snubbed. Why? Caucasian, indonesian and malaysian women on the other hand would smile and sometimes thank me for the gesture. For feminists and lower mentality ppl, no I did not sleep with them after that... sheesh...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I believe my table manners to be average for a modernised and civil society (ie no spitting, elbows on table, snorting, burping etc...). Many of my female friends are surprised when I wait for all parties involved to be present at the dinner table with their respective food before starting to dig in, yet some female friends of mine were appalled when I did not offer to cut their steak for them... (bear in mind that these female companions are/were not my gf)<br><br>Well dressed office women push, swear and elbow their way into the MRT trains during rush hour without allowing passengers to alight first, yet they expect men to give way to them. Passengers are supposed to alight FIRST. If a man needs to alight first, it is NOT common sense to expect him to give way to female passengers rushing into the train. This goes beyond govt propaganda, its manners, physics and common sense!<br><br>While women in sg are screaming for men to act like gentlemen and treat them as ladies, men like me are eager to treat a lady in a manner befitting her whenever we meet one...<br><br>If you are wondering why few men treat you like a lady, try asking yourself why... do you act like a lady?<br></div>
