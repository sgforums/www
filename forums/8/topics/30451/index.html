            <div class='col-md body'>If you're afraid to love a person because of friendship, you have 2 choices, either tell what you feel and let the love take place of forever or hide the feeling under a friendship full of pretensions.<br><br>* Sometimes i've asked myself, what would make me happy? To think that I have everything else, I get what I want... then I realized it was YOU, too bad 'coz it's you I can't have...<br><br>* Love can never be so beautiful without friendship...one leads to another and the process is irreversible...the best of lovers is the greatest of friends!!!<br><br>* Love doesn't have to have a happy ending,'coz love doesn't have to end at all.<br><br>* A man realized he wanted his love back not wanting to be hurt again. The girl said "no" the man cried out to God, "if it was meant to be,why did I lose her?" God replied, "You didn't lose her...you let her go!"<br><br>* When you love someone, don't expect that person to love you back the same amount. One of you will be ahead, the other behind. It's either you catch up or the other waits.<br><br>* WHAT IF SOMENONE TELLS YOU THIS: "don't believe in Courtship. It's just a waste of time,if I love a person, I'll tell her right away, but for you I'll make an exception...just love me now, and I'll court you forever!"<br><br>* Never be afraid to fall in love. It may hurt a lot, it may give you aches and pains, but if you don't follow your heart, in the end you will cry even more for not giving love a chance.<br><br>* I'm sorry if you can't love me the way you loved the one before me, so I'll let you go to find him/her and hope someday you'll see that the one true love you're looking for was the one who set you free...<br><br>* Ain't it funny we're trying to catch the attention of the one we think we love, we hardly notice the one we're really looking for was just there. You don't notice them 'till they are in the arms of someone else...<br><br>* Love is like standing on wet cement, the longer you stay the harder it is to leave...and you can never go without leaving your prints behind...<br><br>* THINK OF THIS: have you really cared for someone more than you expect? Have you ever tried to love him/her inspite of all the pain? Will you keep on loving him/her as he/she whispers someone else's name? Will you???<br><br>* True love hears what is not spoken, and understands what is not explained, for love doesn't work in the mouth, nor the mind, but in the heart...<br><br>* When you love, you must not accept anything in return, for if you do, you're not loving but investing. if you love, you must prepare to accept pain, for if you expect happiness,your not loving but using...<br><br>* I like you because you're my friend, and because you are my friend I care, and because I care, I love you, I don't love you because you are my friend, i love you because i do!<br><br>* FOOD FOR THE THOUGHT: it's better to lose your pride with someone you love rather than lose that someone you love with your useless pride.<br><br>* I can't choose who I'm gonna love, but I also can't just love who chooses to love me...and you can't blame me in choosing to love you as much as i can't blame you for not learning to love me.<br><br>* "How can i say goodbye to someone i never had? Why do tears fall for someone who was never mine? Why is that I miss someone I was never with and I ask why i love someone who's love was never mine?"<br><br>* It's hard for two people to love each other when they live in<br>two different worlds...but when these two worlds collide and become one, that's what you call..............magic!<br><br>* Don't love a person like a flower, cause a flower dies in season. Love them like a river cause a river flows forever...<br><br>* "Love may leave your heart like shattered glass, but keep in mind that there's someone who'll be willing to endure the pain of picking up the pieces so you could be whole again"<br><br>* The most cruel thing a guy could do to a girl is to let her fall in love when he doesn't intend to catch her fall!</div>
