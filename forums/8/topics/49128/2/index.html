            <div class='col-md body'>Yesh, the 24.5million pound paid by Real for Beckham is considered peanuts by his stature and somemore he's at his peak of his footballing career.<br><br>Moving to Real Madrid will be of a good cause for him. Playing alongside the likes of Zizou, Ronaldo, Figo and gang will propel him to even a better player. Could be dispatched to play in the middle of the RM park alongside Zizou with Makelele in the anchor role. Figo might play a deeper role than usual since Beckham might roam/drift to the right hand side and assist Figo.<br><br>We have seen Beckham won matches just with his freekicks around the keeper's box and now it'll do gd for Real Madrid. Carlos freekicks are packed wif power and the occasional swerve but no doubt Beckham's freekicks are accurate and bends around the opposition's wall. When the game is tight...frekicks like that might just be gd enuff to kill off any team.</div>

Apparently, their players come and go like a flash. The first eleven need more time to gel and stabilised rather than to hope for one or two player to win trophies.<br><br><blockquote><strong>looking at the roster, Real Madrid should have pulled away and won the Spanish championship long ago... but they have to wait until the very last week... that's not a very cohesive team, is it?</strong></blockquote>With their outta this world superstars...they could have laff their way to the championship but their concentration were disrupt by the ongoing Champions League(which finanacially is very impt to them) and the early transfer saga of Ronaldo not being hitting his form much earlier as expected. They still played some gd team football but everyone knows their defence sux...with the aging Heirro caught in nomansland many times before. And oso Raul was injured at some point of time.</div>
