            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Versatility:</div><div class="quote_body">Nope your so called many ways was to mark the strikers and allow Beckham to supply his crosses.<br><br>My point is Beckham does'nt get enough respect for what he does on the pitch.He gets more attention off it.Many tend to neglect the attacking options Beckham can give.His Crosses are good.So are his free kicks.In that sense,Beckham is under rated for what he does on the pitch.<br><br></div></blockquote>You kept going on and on about his crosses and his freekicks, what else is he good at? Tell me? Give me three more if you can? Can't you find yourself repeating it over and over again like an incesscent spoit radio? It does not take a genius to realise that Beckscum always failed against a defensively sound player. Against Liverpool, he is always played off the park by Jamie Carragher. It goes to show how limited he is. I give Beckscum one thing though, it is amaxing how a footballer as limited as him can achieve and earn so much.<br><br>I tell you just one of the many true greats with geniune qualities: John Barnes: Teams used to put two to three men on him, and even that they still struggle to shackle him. He averaged close to 20 goals a season playing as an attacking midfielder. He could score from direct freekicks. He is also a mean deadball specialist. He covered for his team mates when they are in the attacking third. He played as a defensive midfielder too. He had more skill in his pinkie toe than all of Beckscum combined. Now, this is a true player with class. Remember Barnes's solo goal against Brazil at the Maracana Stadium? Named as arguably the greatest goal scored against Brazil? Remember?</div>

Bekscum is not irreplaceable. The period that he is not in the team, Manure did not struggle. They will struggle when true quality players like Giggs and Keane are out. Maradona Jnr is too young right now, he is I think, only 15. But I agree with you that Real's defence needs working upon.</div>
