            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Anyagerger,<br><br>Can you post a photo of your mother here? Prefer is recent photo. I do a buddhist prayers for her continues in seven night.<br><br>Photo need to show her face clearly. Also prefer to have her full name.<br><br>During this prayers you can also help by sitting some where you will not be disturbed &amp; thinking of your mother. Your mother's image must be clear &amp; detail in your mind, bright, bathing in warm white lights &amp; feel happy. Do not stress yourself on projecting this image, because stress image is trancated. Let the image comes naturally. This image should be projected about 5 mins in your mind. Example you can project the image of your mother waking up &amp; getting out of bed softly, happily &amp; without help of others. After the 5 mins, you go back to do whatever you need to do for the night. During the 5 mins, advice not to think of anything else &amp; you body needs to at a relax &amp; comfortable state.<br><br>What I do is chanting, goes into mediations to projects your mother waking up &amp; helps your image to come to real life. My prayers always starts 10pm lasting about 1hr. I do not gurantee results, it's a chance to help.<br><br>You may have doubt on this, but this is not my first time doing this &amp; I will never accept anything by doing this. Because I belive in unconditional help will in turns help everyone everything. Previous cases shows results in 2~3 days it all depends on herself &amp; karma. If after 14 days there is no result it means my prayer did not help. I am very frank on this to you.</div>

Prefer is recent photo. I do a buddhist prayers for her continues in seven night.<br><br>Photo need to show her face clearly. Also prefer to have her full name.<br><br>During this prayers you can also help by sitting some where you will not be disturbed &amp; thinking of your mother. Your mother's image must be clear &amp; detail in your mind, bright, bathing in warm white lights &amp; feel happy. Do not stress yourself on projecting this image, because stress image is trancated. Let the image comes naturally. This image should be projected about 5 mins in your mind. Example you can project the image of your mother waking up &amp; getting out of bed softly, happily &amp; without help of others. After the 5 mins, you go back to do whatever you need to do for the night. During the 5 mins, advice not to think of anything else &amp; you body needs to at a relax &amp; comfortable state.<br><br>What I do is chanting, goes into mediations to projects your mother waking up &amp; helps your image to come to real life. My prayers always starts 10pm lasting about 1hr. I do not gurantee results, it's a chance to help.<br><br>You may have doubt on this, but this is not my first time doing this &amp; I will never accept anything by doing this. Because I belive in unconditional help will in turns help everyone everything. Previous cases shows results in 2~3 days it all depends on herself &amp; karma. If after 14 days there is no result it means my prayer did not help. I am very frank on this to you. </div></blockquote><span style="color: indigo;">If ger ger agrees to it...send it to him thru PM ba.  </span></div>
