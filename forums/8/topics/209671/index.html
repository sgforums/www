            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Somewhere in early August this year, i got to know that my uncle(my mum's cousin) had suddenly fallen into coma due to stroke. I had not seen this uncle,T for years.He is 39 this year. When i was a kid he was a teenager and he and his mum and sis would take care of me when my mum went overseas or was busy. Uncle T is a fat, sweet baby faced man who is soft spoken and kind and owns a pet shop.<br><br>For the next two weeks, everyday without fail i would go to the I.C.U to see him. My mum would be there too, she loved him like her own brother and doted on him. Uncle T's mum and sis were almost collasping as they had to take care of the pet shop and shuffle to the hospital. His sis also had 3 small kids to tend to.<br><br>2 weeks later, he was transferred to a normal ward with 7 other beds. His fever had gone down but he was still in coma.<br><br>On the 24th Aug, as usual i went to see him after work. I was the 1st one there. Shortly my mum and my grandma arrived. Then Uncle's sis and mum came. Although we went to see him everyday, usually it was at different times.  Did he sense we were all around? Because as we were all surrounding him, he opened his eyes...not as how you and me open our eyes of course, but he was trying hard. My mum were so excited and started to tell him:''Wah, you want to see us ah? Good boy, quick wake up ok?'' Maybe its a mum's intuiation, his mum for no reason put her finger to check his breathing and screamed:''WHY HE IS NOT BREATHING?"" His sister ran to the doc and he and the nurses pulled the curtain to relive him.<br><br>By this time, my mum, his mum and sis, my grandmother was all screaming and crying.I was in shock. There was this other young family who were visiting their Grandpa (opposite my uncle's bed) Throughout the whole commotion, they were still laughing and in cheers. It was plain to see that, just opposite them, a young man lay dying and his mum was in utter heartbreak. There they stood, talking loudly lost in their own world..<br><br>5min later, the doc came to tell his mum that he was brain dead and even if they could let him breathe on, he would be in agony. So she had to face a mum's worse nightmare, agreeing to let her beloved only son go. We were told to go and see him before he was sent to the mortuary.<br><br>I accompanied my mum and my uncle's mum to the mortuary. The 3 of us were huddled tight together. It was a 10min journey but its something i will never 4get. Walking down the cold, long corridors suddenly made me rethink what life is all about. Its so fragile that it can be gone in a second. The funeral was equally hard. My mum had a breakdown and had to be carried. Her own brother had died in a motor bike accident at the age of 18.<br><br>Please treasure your life. As for those people laughing and joking while Uncle T lay dying, rot in hell please. On a lighter note, its amazing how a person in coma can open his eyes to see his loved ones before he departs.. At least he was not alone...Cheers.<br><br>This is his beloved dog which i also posted in other thread<br><img src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g239/crystalll_photos/Image009.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah i mean seriously...we have to treasure life and live it to the fullest. We always hear the previous line like million of times, but who can deny the fact that anything can just happen at the split sec? Remember the RI boy who just fell dead when he got a simple flu? He just told his father he is losing his common senses and thats the last words heard. He has a bright future...and he is his parents only child but this kind of things can happen. So people, please do not live just to study or make money, do things that you enjoy at time to time.</div>
