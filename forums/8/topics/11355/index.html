            <div class='col-md body'>Some of u might have seen this before<br>Still...<br>Regardless of whether you are a guy or a girl....trust me, u will cry. If u didn't, I'll SHAVE my head bald.<br><br>A Beautiful Singapore Love Story<br><br>DOLCE VITA(French)---SWEET TIMES<br><br>I met her on the net, how?.. I can't remember. But it seems to me<br>that it is this 'little theoryÂ’ that I declared in the cyberspace that<br>caught her attention.<br><br>'If I have a million dollars, I would buy a house. Do I have a<br>million?<br>No.  ThatÂ’s y I dun have a house. If I have wings, I can fly. Do I<br>have wings? No. So I can never fly. If all the waters are drawn out of<br>Pacific Ocean, but it still can't put off the flame of love between<br>us.<br>Can all the waters of Pacific Ocean be drawn off?  No. ThatÂ’s y I<br>dun love u.<br><br>That's me, a typical science student. 1st u come up with an<br>assumption, then u fit a suitable conclusion. If the proposed assumption<br>doesn't stand at all, then everything is just bullshit. I guess this is<br>what they call 'unromantic'. But she is an exception. She actually<br>mailed me and said that IÂ’m an 'interesting' person. 'interesting'?.. What a<br>word to use on me, it's like using 'faithful' on Mr. Clinton. I thought<br>this gal must be a low-IQ organism, or suffering from serious brain<br>damage.<br><br>Anyway, her nick doesn't seems so bad- FLYINDANCE-<br>that's quite a unique one. but I was warning myself: hello, this is<br>the virtual world of Internet. Who knows what might be lurking behind a<br>beautiful nick. Talking from experience, most of the time it will<br>be a 'dinosaur' in disguise, the only differences will be whether it is<br>a carnivore or a herbivore. But, I know she is way different from a<br>'dinosaur', she is special.<br><br>So I guess its time for the appearance of FlyNDance. Ever since she<br>mailed to tell me that I m 'interesting', I was always wishing to<br>meet her in ajcrr(irc channel) but lady luck was just not on my side. So<br>I can only reply her letter to tell her that I will start to train myself to<br>become an 'interesting' person, just to show that she is far-sighted. She<br>replied my reply, I replied her reply to my reply, she again replied my<br>reply to her reply blah blah blah...<br><br>Oh no, I just started a chain-reaction. Actually what interested me<br>the most is this 'para' she wrote in one of the mails....<br><br>I dance swithtly, amidst the crowd.<br>your glance on me<br>be it surprise, be it admiration,<br>it ain't gonna stop my rhythm<br>'COs it's not your glance that made me dance,<br>it's my heart of youth.<br><br>I simply cannot relate this gal to any of the 'dinosaurs'. But if<br>she really is a dinosaur, I m willing to let her have her fill. Tye, my<br>best pal unfortunately, noticed my little affair with FlyNDance, and has<br>been perpetually warning me about this.... "HELLO!!!... u don't even<br>know what she looks like, y take the risk??.. maybe 'she' is a guy!!...<br>haha!!.." I can't blame Tye for his ignorance. Ever since he was<br>dumped by Sally in Sec4, he has become a renowned 'playboy'. As the saying<br>goes: "Once bitten, Twice shy", in this case, after Tye was bitten,<br>he has mastered the art of skinning snakes alive, and Make into soup.<br><br>But he got all the factors to be a playboy, I always think he is the 19<br>year-old version of Brad Pitt. Tall, handsome and got this tongue<br>that causes diabetes in every women he targets. I dun think he can even<br>remember how many girlfriends he had had.<br><br>I went online that night, log onto channel ajcrr and yesh!!... she<br>is there. Before I can get over the surprise and the daze, she sent me<br>a message.....<br><br>"hey slorr.. so late liao haven't slept ahh??"<br><br>Now what? Now what??!!.. okok, I had to calm down 1st.<br><br>I swallowed hard on my saliva, took a few deep breath. Now where is<br>that Tye when I needed him most at such crucial moment, somebody to tell<br>me what to say to her. How m I going to attract her with my pathetic<br>humour which has gone stale.<br><br>"slorr... me in a foul mood today.. can't sleep.. u leh??"<br><br>MOTHER'S (direct translation to chinese), what slorr slorr... now<br>when I read it twice in a row, I m beginning to feel disgusted in that<br>nick Tye gave me. Tye said that: "who knows.. it might attract some innocent<br>gals in talking to u... haha.."<br><br>"I m not feeling very good too.... so lets sad together."<br>Finally squeezed a sentence out, but I can already feel droplets of<br>sweat forming on my forehead. Actually I m not in a bad mood, I<br>just wanna follow up her topic that's all. And if she ask for the reason<br>for my feeling down, I can say:" since u r feeling down, how can I ever<br>be happy?..." I know it sounds mushy, but Tye said: "MUSHYNESS IS THE<br>FUNDAMENTAL TO ALL COURTSHIP". And gals are a very weird species,<br>they trust their ears far more than their eyes. So instead of doing<br>10 things to impress her, why not just say a sentence to move her.<br><br>"ok... but u haven't greet me leh..."<br><br>DAMNIT!.. how can I forget simple manners to gals. To think they<br>call me 'MR COURTEOUS' in school. If this thing ever leaks out in school, I<br>would lost all my female fans.<br><br>"nice to meet u... miss long-hair.."<br>I've been wishing that she's keeping long hair. Tye said that:<br>"FlyNDance... hmm.. she would either be long-haired or a desperado,<br>'COs when gals dance, only 2 parts of them may fly: hair and skirt. So<br>if she doesn't has long hair, that means her skirt Flys when she dances,<br>AH-HA!!.. this has a certain sexual hint in it...haha.."<br><br>"eh?... how u know I got long hair?.."<br><br>BINGO!!.. heaven is on my side this time. It goes to prove that she<br>is not a DESPERADO. yesh!!..<br><br>"not only that.. I also know u seldom wear skirt.."<br><br>I increased the stake, if I m correct this time, peace on earth<br>forever.<br><br>"err... I guess u r rite lor.. but how u know one?.."<br><br>HAHAHAHAHA.... I m good ahh...<br><br>"just guess..."<br><br>"ok lor... hey slorr... tell u wat.. me tired liaoz... u coming<br>online tomorrow morning??..."<br><br>Â”ya... y??.."<br><br>Please please please say the u coming too, if not I m going to kill<br>myself for letting u go tonight.<br><br>"I'll see ya tomorrow at 10 am then...good night..."<br><br>"er.. should be today at 10 am.. ok.. good night too"<br><br>I just blurted out a last sentence....<br>Offline. Suddenly I was so impressed by my performance just now.<br>But is the season of spring really arriving for me??... I wish.<br><br>"slorr... what a coincidence ahh..."<br><br>yeh... I m not late.<br><br>"ya lor... so qiao.."<br><br>gals are weird, I thought we already had an arrangement, y do I<br>have to pretend that it's not. they must have watched too many movies, and<br>like to think that guys they met due to the thing called 'fate' is the<br>best thing that can happen to their love life.<br><br>"slorr.... u talking nonsense lah..."<br><br>NONSENSE???.. ok, let me tell u what nonsense.<br>Summer's beach, the guy must be good at running, with broad<br>shoulders, dark complexion with a tint of redness, sparkling eyes and loud<br>laughter. Then he will call out loud the name of the gal, running<br>towards her, carry her and spin 3 rounds anticlockwisely.<br><br>"slorr.... u siao liaoz ahh??"<br><br>I siao?.. ok.. Let's change a location then. Deep in the mountains,<br>the guy must have long hair, gotta have the look of an artist, carries<br>a sketching stand, a few pieces of drawings, and u can see birds stop<br>over at his side, admiring his work. and there will be a gal whose the<br>model.... most probably naked.<br><br>Â”slorr.. but these all very romantic mah..."<br><br>ROMANTIC??.. hello miss... romance only survive in novels and<br>movies.<br>In real life, the guy on the beach may step onto broken glass or the<br>gal may be too heavy which tore his arm muscles. Birds may just clear<br>their waste on top of the guy in the mountains, or he might get a<br>thrashing from the gal because he comments on the excess fats around the<br>waist and hips.<br><br>"slorr... u hate romance??.."<br><br>I hate romance?... nope, I m just using my knowledge of statistic<br>to get a deduction, that guys must be TALL to be romantic, not<br>HANDSOME!!!..<br>some love novels even portrayed the guy as normal looking, but<br>no-one Dares to challenge the height of him!..  I object.... because I m<br>not tall.<br><br>"slorr.... objection overruled..."<br><br>I think I m really outstandingly bo liao, talking to her about<br>these until noon.<br><br>"slorr... are u hungry?..."<br><br>"ya... u leh??...."<br><br>"yesh... guess its time for lunch...slorr.."<br><br>"then do u think we should....??"<br><br>"slorr... I m just asking... I dun intend to have lunch with u..."<br><br>ok, good.. I m not romantic... neither are u.<br><br>I had lunch with Tye, we talk about the conversation with FlyNDance<br>this morning. "U moron... told her u r not romantic... u siao ah?.." "u<br>have disgrace me man... how can u make such a big mistake?....I...I..."<br>Tye grabbed a chicken wing with chopstick, and I can see the trembling<br>of the hand and the wing. "there are 3 'don'ts' in chasing a gal...<br>one...dun forget to be romantic,.. two ... dun be too honest...<br>3...dun be too stingy on the sugar in our speech... noticed number 1, u<br>stupid??" what rubbish is that??.... "In mandarin we say 'nan ren<br>bu huai, nu ren bu ai', u should know this..." this I know, but it has<br>been a controversial topic over centuries. "women aren't really that...<br>cheap.. so y would they only falls for 'bad guys' like me??...<br>that's because 'bad guys' are usually romantic... those 'nice guys' are<br>usually...  dumdums...so she would rather choose a romantic 'bad<br>guy' rather than any of those dumdums... in maths we call this<br>2C1...understand?...dumdum.."<br><br>oh, Tye is talking about maths!!.. now I understand. No wonder I<br>have always been left on the shelf. "in another words... gals wouldn't<br>mind if u r not tall...   if u r not handsome... they can bear with ur<br>inconsiderate acts...can forget ur stupidity...but they can never<br>forgive if u r not romantic..." come on, this is so exaggerating.<br>"hey... most women have a 'knot' for romance.. just like most men<br>have a 'knot' for virginity... to women they just can't understand how<br>precious the thin layer of membrane is to men, same thing, men can't imagine<br>how important women treats romance. this is bullshit! how come I've<br>never heard of that. "the key word is 'knot'...if u can untie it...<br>fine..<br>but how many had actually succeeded in that... practically none..." ok,<br>fine. now I've done it... so what should I do to remedy the<br>situation?<br><br>"face it... u r hopeless already... I promise u I'll have a drink<br>with u when u and her are over..."<br><br>U SONOFABITCH.<br><br>Mid-night. I m trying to concentrate on my physics notes....<br>F=ma,v=u+at...it's really a wonder that nature can be explained by<br>just a few formulas and  equations, and this we call science. then y is<br>astrology and palmistry being labeled as superstitious? science<br>should only be one of the ways to explain truth, wat can't be explained by<br>science, it doesn't necessary mean that's its unreal.... Close to<br>1am.<br><br>since I can't get anything into my head, I shall try my luck on net<br>then, maybe she is there...<br><br>"slorr...u here finally... good night to u...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">.."<br><br>'FINALLY'? strange word to use it here. Wat is she doing here at<br>this hour? must be feeling down again.<br><br>"yes... it is fate that brought me to u at this moment..."<br>I m trying very hard to convince her that I m a bit romantic.<br><br>"slorr... nothing to do with fate...I waited 4 u 4 one hour<br>liaoz..."<br><br>"sure or not?.. for wat?.."<br><br>"talk to u mah...or else I can't sleep..."<br><br>"u sick izzit?... go see doctor lah..."<br><br>"<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">...."<br><br>"slorr....let's continue our topic.. wat do u think of<br>relationships began from  internet?..."<br><br>oh my god... how should I answer her now? "its.. its<br>very...romantic..."<br>indeed I m not a good liar, even my words are shaking now.<br><br>"slorr... u bluffing... u not romantic one mah..."<br><br>GAME OVER. I m finished!.. no choice but to drink with Tye.<br><br>"slorr.... u lagging?... or just daoing me?..."<br><br>"no... I m wondering y is the sky so chio tonight?.."<br><br>"nonono... dun try to shift the topic...  slorr..."<br><br>sigh... I give up... I asked for it myself. Actually I think<br>relationships started from cyberspace is considered as ROMANTIC,<br>'Cos romance gives pple an impression of unreal, and cyberspace is<br>virtual.<br><br>"slorr....that's interesting.."<br><br>2 surfers keep a safe distance from each other and usually 3 types<br>of pple are produced in this way.<br><br>The 1st type....<br><br>The 1st type being those who present themselves on net with their<br>'secondary personality'. Usually all of us consists of multiple<br>personalities, and in Everyday life, wat we present to the world is<br>the 'primary personality', with the secondary one being suppressed, or<br>maybe we dun even realised this other Trait of us deep inside. so<br>internet is the place where this side of us is revealed, both intentionally or<br>without conscious knowledge.<br><br>"izzit true?... wat about 2nd type?.."<br><br>the 2nd type are those who will transform themselves into the kind<br>of man/woman he/she would want to be. theres bound to be 1 or 2<br>characteristics that u particularly admire, too bad, sometimes<br>these characteristics are just couldn't be found in u. cyberspace is the<br>perfect location for this transformation to occur.<br><br>"slorr.... u blowing cow izzit?.. type 3 leh?..."<br><br>I m not blowing cow, I read it from an article of TIMES mag!! type<br>3 will be those who transform themselves into characters which are<br>impossible for them to become in real life. for example, if u r a<br>gal, you may act as a man on net. you may even become BATMAN or SUPERMAN<br>if u want.<br><br>"hm.. thats pretty amazing..."<br><br>the 1st type is the 'faithful' type, 'cos its his own personality<br>that is being presented on net. the 2nd type is the 'foolish' type, 'cos<br>he knows only how to admire others, always forgets his own strong pts.<br>the 3rd type is the 'pathetic' type, 'cos he is wishing 4 some<br>impossible.<br><br>"slorr.... den u belong to wat type?... me leh?.."<br><br>i dun wish to believe u r type 3, 'cos i m not. I crossed the<br>possibility of type 1 'cos its too common, because i think u r<br>special.<br>being able to attract u, i think i m at least a bit specila.  so we<br>belong to type 2.<br><br>"type2.... den who u wish to become?..slorr.."<br><br>i certainly would like to become a person like Tye, humorous,<br>romantic and eloquent, 'cos these are wat i m lacking of.<br><br>"slorr.... wat about me?.."<br><br>U?.. i dun know. U want to FLY and DANCE, probably that means u<br>wish to fully enjoy ur youth while u can. but if this is something u<br>wish yet u can't achieve, den theres 2 possibilities: 1, u r ageing, 2, u r<br>leaving the world.<br><br>i think i said something wrong,  'cos she didn't sent me anymore<br>msg after this. i began to blame myself for being  so perverted, y talk<br>about these things?.. I should have discussed with her whether ZOE<br>or FANN, who should be the queen of caldecott hill. damn that TIMES<br>mag, poison my mind.  maybe she's lagging. so i waited... and waited.<br>although its just a few minutes, but it felt like several hours. i<br>want to apologize, but do not know how to start. until she sent me this<br>msg:<br><br>"slorr... lets meet..." without hesitation, i used the hand that I<br>had used it over 18 years to wipe my ass, typed 'O-K'.<br><br>PART 2<br><br>I m supposed to meet FlyNDance tonight , 8pm, at the entrance of<br>Mcdonalds, the one beside YMCA. that's the best time and place to<br>meet a gal u have never met b4, according to Tye, 'COs they would have<br>taken their dinner by that time which means we can simply go inside the<br>Mc and  have some fries and coke. she will be wearing a whole set of coffee<br>theme attire and I will be wearing my usual blues, this is our way<br>of identification.she told me she is not those 'cute gals' I may<br>think she is, I said nevermind, I m not Brad-pitt either. then she told<br>me she has long ago given up on this hope already.<br><br>"slorr... u r early..."<br><br>while I was idling, a gal tapped my shoulders from my back. althoh<br>I was oridi mentally prepared for anything that's gonna appear in front<br>of me, I was still astonished by this gal who stood in front of me now. if<br>not for the coffeee theme and that 'slorr', I would think she is only<br>asking for directions. 'COs she is one of those chio buz that can only be<br>found on orchard road, usually while I m crossing the road. maybe I<br>suffered from a serious concussion due to the heavy blow, my mind was<br>extraordinarily calm. "had ur dinner rite?.. I think we shall go<br>inside the Mc 1st..."<br><br>"u r pretty smart huh?... a good way to save money indeed..."<br><br>AIYA!~!... she knows me soooo well, I can only give her an innocent<br>smile back. since she's so pretty, I ordered 2 LARGE cokes, and<br>even ordered TWO packets of fries.<br><br>"this time u treat, next time i'll let u treat..."<br><br>I m not falling for that, miss... but I m glad she mentioned 'next<br>time'.<br><br>"slorr... r u disappointed when u saw me just now?.."<br><br>DISSAPPOINTED?... r u drunk?.. "y do u think I will be disappointed<br>then?.."<br><br>"'cos i told u i m not cute mah, so u must be quite dissappointed<br>when u saw me.." she is making 0 sense, but i know she is just trying to<br>hint that she's actually cute.<br><br>"then y did u have to lie that u r not cute?"<br><br>"slorr... i said i m not cute... i didn't say i m not pretty.."<br><br>#$%$##%^*&amp;%$@!!!<br><br>"but u r also quite....decent looking what.. its not like what u<br>described to me too.."<br><br>'DECENT'? a very vague word. to many gals, decent=boring. one good<br>thing is that she didn't lie to me about the fact that she is keeping<br>long hair. she also has a fair complexion which reminds me of HL milk I<br>take almost everyday. it is now only that i found out she is from ACJC,<br>but had spent her 1st 3 mths in AJ. sitting in front of each other, we<br>talk about many things. from her obsession with coffee to my hobby of<br>watching movies. in btw, she had completely shoke off my<br>misconception of 'if she is pretty, she is brainless'. she appears to be an<br>attractive gal, both physically and character wise, talking, smiling to me,<br>occasionally being a little sarcastic and nasty. its like a dream.<br>we left the Mc at around 10 pm. since its still early, i decided to<br>send<br>her home and fortunately, its just Ang Mo Kio, two  MRT stops from<br>mine.<br>i would have a second thought if she's staying at Pasir Ris.<br><br>"slorr... congratulations.... u r officially permitted to date me<br>from now on..." she said this b4 the lift door closed.<br><br>back at home, i realized that i hadn't asked for her real name,<br>maybe its the influence of that stoopid Tye. Tye told me:" never ask a<br>pretty gal her name the 1st time u meet her, 'cos there are oredi too many<br>wolves out there dying to know, so she will be more interested in<br>you if u act bochap..." then y didn't she ask for mine? dun tell me theres<br>a female version of Tye telling her not to?<br><br>it's again 1am. time to meet her in ajcrr.<br><br>"hi!... slorr.. u tired?..."<br><br>of 'cos i m tired after all the surprises she presented me, i would<br>go straight for my bed if not for her.  but y is she here also?...<br>isn't she tired too?..<br><br>"long time no see.. how r u?.."<br><br>"slorr u siao ah?... 2 hours only leh.. miss me?..."<br><br>"A)yes.. B)of'cos.. C)abuden...D)dying to see u...E)all of<br>above....<br>answer is E..."<br><br>"<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">..."<br><br>seems like she is really tired, even the smiling face are yawning<br>to me rite now.<br><br>"u wanna go for a movie tomorrow?.."<br><br>maybe i should ask her now, while she is half asleep, hoping that<br>she will blur-blurly click 'OK'.<br><br>"should be no problem... what show?<br><br>... HOOOOORAY!!... i m cheering for her fatique.<br><br>"we decide what show tomorrow... anyway whats important is watch<br>with who... not the show.." Tye's fav line, i m just borrowing it.<br>"<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">..."<br><br>"u should go sleep now lah..."<br><br>"wait one little while... u haven't tell me u tired or not?.."<br><br>"ok lah... a bit.... u leh?.."<br><br>"i m exhausted.... but have to say good night to u 1st... slorr..if<br>not i can't sleep..<br><br>"me too...."<br><br>i can't believe i m doing this SILLY business rite now....<br>"ok i tell u what.... i count 1,2,3... then we log off together..."<br><br>"ok.... good night slorr..."<br><br>"same to u.."<br><br>"1...."<br><br>"2..."<br><br>"3.."<br><br>i never talk whenever i m inside a cinema, and now is the best time<br>for my mouth to rest, so I spent the following 3 hours to admire this<br>much-talked-about movie of the century, Titanic. i m not a romantic<br>person, so its perfectly understandable if i can't really<br>appreciate this motion picture fully, except for all those stunning special<br>effects. but something stroke me when Jack said to Rose b4 he sank<br>into<br>the deep.....<br><br>"Rose, listen to me...listen....winning that ticket was the best<br>thing<br>that had happened to me...it brought me to u....and i m thankful,<br>Rose.... i m thankful...."<br><br>suddenly i felt much fortunate than Jack, 'cos I dun have to risk<br>my life to board Titanic, all I have to do is to switch on my PC every<br>night. But he's one lucky guy too, 'cos he knows how to draw, and<br>just look at how slowly he was drawing Rose, that made me blame myself<br>for the lack of this talent. But to her, this movie wasn't just about<br>drawings or special effects. i noticed that packet of tissue paper<br>she was holding in her hand. and just when Rose said:" i promise...<br>i will never let go, Jack... i'll never let go.."she opened up her<br>sling<br>bag and here comes the reserve handkerchief.<br><br>Damn that celine Dion, y on earth did she had to sing that "MY<br>HEART<br>WILL GO ON" at the end of the show, for all the female species<br>inside the theatre, its like "MY TEARS WILL ALSO GO ON". "Ok... movie<br>ended...<br>lets go...." i stood up, speak to her gently, worried that every<br>single word i breath out might just crush Onto her, and  kill her. she<br>continued to sit on the position, looked at me with her beautiful<br>eyes that just came back from a swim.<br><br>after a while, she said... "slorr.... movie ended..... but life<br>goes on.. m I rite?..."<br><br>i nodded my head... but i just wished somebody might give me some<br>clue of what she was saying.<br><br>finally we managed to leave Orchard cineplex, since its still<br>early, we decided to take a walk down the  street. along the way, she seems<br>unusually quiet. so I guess Tye was rite about the 'TITANIC FLU',<br>he said that gals often got so mentally distressed after watching this<br>show, and its the best time to launch an emotional attack on her,<br>thats<br>y Tye had watch Titanic for over 5 times roughly. her eyes were<br>focussed on the path or the crowds but i know her mind was still<br>left on Titanic,  sinking with her, waiting for somebody to pull her up. i<br>just<br>kept my mouth shut 'cos I know i m not a good swimmer. we walked to<br>Plaza Singapura. suddenly she stopped in front of a Christian Dior<br>counter.<br><br>"slorr.. have u read a novel called 'fragrance'?..."<br><br>"err..nope.... y do u ask?..."<br><br>"look at this 'DOLCE VITA' from Christian Dior... its what the guy<br>bought for her girlfriend in the story on her birthday.... and he<br>told her 'DOLCE VITA' is French, meaning 'SWEET TIMES'..." she pointed<br>to a bottle of perfume at the counter, but i was more interested at the<br>price tag around the neck of the bottle.<br><br>"oh... izzit?..."<br><br>"slorr... then do u consider today as 'sweet times'...?"<br><br>"at first i do... but some pts are deducted since u started<br>crying..."<br>"that means it can only be considered a little bit sweet, i'll buy<br>the small bottle then..."<br><br>i insisted to pay for the perfume as her bdae  present from me<br>since i know her birthday is coming soon, this kinda saves me a lot of<br>trouble of finding a present for her. luckily its just perfume, i would<br>have to pawn my underwear if that guy in the story gives her girlfriend<br>diamond or gold bar.<br><br>"r u hungry?.... wanna sit down and have something?..."<br><br>"i dun have appetite... what about u?.."<br><br>"you eat, i eat...." her eyes are red again...... i m such a fool.<br><br>finally got away from the noisy crowd at the mrt station, walking<br>on one of the streets of AMK ave6. contrastingly, its so quiet now<br>that I even can hear the rhythm of her heartbeat.<br><br>"slorr... do u know what's the correct way of  applying<br>perfume?...."<br><br>i shoke my head. in fact, i had never used a perfume or cologne b4,<br>medicated oil maybe.<br><br>"1st u apply some behind ur ears... then ur neck and wrists...<br>after that spray some onto the air, then walk through it..."<br><br>"sure or not?... in that case this little bottle wont even be able<br>to last u for 3 days...." "slorr.. shall we try?..."<br>"'we'?... u go ahead... i m a MAN..."<br><br>she opened up that DOLCE VITA... behind her ears, neck then the<br>wrist she applied some... and she really did spray some onto he air!!...<br>WABIANGZ!!.. expensive leh!... finally she stretched out her<br>hands...<br>facing up... like enjoying the raindrops falling on her face...<br>"hahaha.... slorr... this is so fun!.... now its ur turn...."<br><br>she went through the same procedures with me and i can feel the<br>coldness of he fingers.  maybe its the perfume... i guess.<br><br>"slorr... get ready... i m going to spray!!..."<br><br>i imitated her.. face up... and walked through my 1st perfume rain.<br>"slorr lets have another round!!..."<br><br>WHAT!!... serious?.. my money  isn't easy to come by leh!!.... b4 i<br>can collect the broken pieces of my heart, she had walked through her<br>second round. she was even more excited this time, hoping around, like her<br>nick.... a flying and dancing butterfly. late night of AMK, the<br>streets smells unusually nicer rite now. until we finished the whole of<br>that<br>DOLCE VITA.<br><br>"DOLCE VITA is exhausted... i guess this sweet time shall end now<br>too.... slorr.. i'll go up now.... tonight 1am. i wont be online,<br>and u r not to do so too..."<br><br>"huh?....but why?...."<br><br>"go online at 12pm tomorrow.. u will know....remember... only<br>12pm..."<br>she turned and walked into the lift... at the same time... i saw an<br>obvious pink patch behind her neck... which is visible only now<br>be'cos she tied her hair. i looked up towards her window on the 4th floor<br>from below, but it never light up. i switched off the light in my<br>room...<br><br>engulfed  in the absolute darkness... 'cos i wished to have the<br>same kind of feeling as her right now... i realised in complete<br>darkness...<br>the easiest mood one gets... is loneliness..  she must be lonely<br>rite now... half asleep.. i almost can see a beautiful butterfly..<br>turning to ashes amidst the sea of flame...  and that patch behind her neck..<br>from pink it became red... then burgundy.. slowly.. it swallowed me....<br>was it the cause of that can of beer just now?... suddenly i felt<br>cold...<br>and shaky.. and that coolness seemed to have come straight from my<br>heart... the rate of my heartbeat was an exponential function of<br>time as it got closer to 1am... USE A DIFFERENT NICK!!... checked .. she<br>isn't<br>there.... my heart was beating fast... but the temp remained below<br>healthy level........<br><br>PART 3<br><br>finally its 12 pm, excited as i was, logged on the net, yet there<br>was still no sign of FlyNDance. But theres a mail from her......<br><br>Dear slorr,<br><br>At first i thought it will be easier for me to settle down in the<br>darkness... recollecting memories we have shared... but all i felt<br>was loneliness...... can u feel it too?... I still can't change the<br>habit of logging on at 1am... so i used a different nick to sneak into<br>AJCRR...<br>u dun blame me right?...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">... u weren't there... should i feel glad<br>for ur obedience?.... U said both of us belonged to TYPE 2... the foolish<br>type... maybe u r right!... 'cos I really do admire those who dares<br>to fight for their desires... I stroke my hair gently when u said that<br>I m leaving the world... and a few strands of hair fell..... No!...<br><br>doctor told me its not a terminal disease... and doctor aren't supposed to<br>lie!!?... I still can live like a normal person... BUT CAN I?..<br>FlyNDance... is it really something i wont be able to do?... After<br>the 1st meeting with u at Mc... I started to realise that u r not only<br>a virtual being living in the cyberspace... in reality u r strong,<br>gentle and sensitive.... i can feel the defense Wall of my heart is slowly<br>breaking apart.... i m defeated... I tied my hair today.. 'cos my<br>fren told me that i look more attractive this way... I want u to<br>remember my face as it is today... 'cos after today... everything may<br>change....<br>But why didn't u ask for my real name?..thats why i never asked for<br>urs...<br>I m a gal  mah..<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">... do u  realised how i wish to have  something<br>more than a nick to take along with me?... Slorr... thank u for the<br>DOLCE VITA... finally got a taste of what sweet times are like... but i m<br>really sorry..... i just couldn't bear to say goodbyz..... since it<br>started from a mail.... it should end with a mail too.... Its been<br>3 months and 2 days since the very 1st mail... not a very long time<br>but it isn't short either.... our story began from me... and I will end<br>it..<br>Maybe its what u said... 'internet is fast and convenient, but it<br>isn't perfect'.... I can send u my thoughts right away... but not my<br>tears...<br>Its about 5.30am now.... time to go.... by the time u  receive this<br>mail... i would be trying to settle down somewhere else.... i dun<br>know....<br><br>Good Bye.<br><br>With lotsa love,<br>FlyNDance<br><br>After reading her mail, i felt as if i had just experienced a<br>roller-coaster ride which Almost derailed. she had shown me the<br>other side of her, soft and sensitive. For a couple of mths, i was trying<br>to hypnotise myself, to suppress my feelings whenever I started to<br>think<br>about her again. Perpetually i was telling  myself, she is just one<br>virtual character that flys and dance in the net, but never in the<br>real world.<br><br>I became a fugitive, escaping from my PC, escaping from the<br>internet and anything that has to do with coffee . Hide  myself behind the piles<br>of lecture notes, behind the crowd of pple, trying to get rid of this<br>thought of missing something in life.<br><br>But i failed. I found out that its not that i dun miss her, its<br>just that i had forgotten the passion that always comes  along when u r<br>having something hanging on ur mind all the time. its like i cannot<br>not breath, its just that I had forgotten the fact that i have been<br>breathing in and out for the past 19 years. i can hold my breath<br>for a while, but not forever.  i have to find her.<br><br>"err... i m looking for ... er.. FlyNDance...."<br><br>"HUH??..."<br><br>'huh'.... this is the exact word i was expecting from her. she<br>seems to be FlyNDance's elder sister, 20++, looked quite a beauty too even<br>without any makeup. But of 'cos, still can't be compared with<br>her...<br><br>I explained to her my purpose for knocking on the door and told her<br>that i m no stalker whom she might think i m. surprisingly when i told her<br>my disgusting nick, slorr, she appeared to be rather  excited and<br>quickly she scribbled something on a small piece of paper and handed it to<br>me.....<br><br>"u should go and see her.."<br><br>SGH, Room 3-425<br><br>This is the 1st time i've ever stepped into the Singapore General<br>Hospital. its a dust-free space, everything looked soo clean, tidy<br>and arranged. But i dun like the feeling it gave me... I entered room<br>3-425,<br>she was there, in a deep sleep... i stood by her, watching... her<br>hair was still as long as before, laying across the soft, White<br>pillow...  her face looked roundish now, I know it's the side-effect of the<br>medicine...<br><br>and the pinkish-red patch that was on her neck had spread to her<br>face...appearing in a shape of a butterfly.. nevertheless.. she was still<br>the most beautiful butterfly i've ever seen...<br><br>Her eyelashes twitched slightly.. she must be dreaming... what's<br>that  in her   dream??... Mcdonald's fries and coke?.. sinking Titanic?.. or<br>the rain at AMK ave 6?.. The room was getting darker as the clock<br>approaches 6pm.. i wanted to switch on the light... 'cos I hate to see her<br>lying lonely under the shadow of a patient's room.... But i m worried<br>that her dreams might be disturbed by the sudden light rays... while i was<br>in a dilemma.. her eyes opened slowly... Her eyes were wide on me.. then<br>she turned away suddenly.. i can only see her back at this moment...<br>she lost weight... after a long time.. she turned to face me again..<br>rubbed her eyes... and smiled....<br><br>"slorr.. u r here!..."<br><br>"yes... nice weather today.. isn't it?.."<br><br>"ya lor.. sky also very chio today?.. right?...heehee.."<br><br>'SKY VERY CHIO'<br><br>... i can still remember this was the conversation we had in one of<br>our<br>AJCRR meetings... But she didn't realized that it's raining<br>today... "slorr.... why r u standing there.. sit down.."<br><br>thanks for reminding me.. i just found out that my legs were numbed<br>due to the  several hours of standing...<br><br>"slorr... u lost weight..."<br><br>ME?.. i thought i should be the one who's telling this to<br>her!!??....<br><br>"slorr.. u hungry?... had ur lunch?.."<br><br>"food here isn't so good.. thats why patients like me always slim<br>down a bit.."<br><br>"apart from that.. its quite ok.. but sometimes i feel really bored<br>without a PC here to talk to u.."<br><br>"slorr.. how's ur mid-year?.. sure did very well right?.."<br><br>WAIT A MINUTE!.. u r the one who's lying on bed right now!!.. not<br>me!....<br><br>Yet.. i had nothing to ask her actually.. 'cos I was there to see<br>her..<br>not to find out  the answers to those questions.. maybe now its the<br>time for me to utter some  touching lines like whats in the case of a<br>movie..<br>But i m not a Romantic person...  moreover... movies are fiction..<br>life isn't.. I just wished that she could leave this place which almost<br>made me sick as soon as possible... back to AMK ave6, back to ACJC, back<br>to where she belonged.... and i promised she wont be alone anymore..<br>'cos I will always be there... After a while... her mum was here to see<br>her.. around the age of 50, slightly overweight.. other than the cheerful<br>smile... she didn't really remind me of FlyNDance...<br><br>"err... i think i've gotta go now... bye bye auntie.."<br><br>"You....You..." she sat up straight in a sudden.. like experienced<br>a tremendous shock...<br><br>"i'll be here again tomorrow.. and the day after  tomorrow... until<br>u leave this place..."<br><br>before i went back home, i went to Plaza Singapura again to buy<br>that Christian Dior Dolce Vita...and  i've got the biggest bottle this<br>time, that she can even swim in it. i try not to close my eyes that<br>night, 'cos I want to go to her as soon as the 1st sun ray shoots into my<br>room. i hired a cab, didn't want to waste too much time on bus.<br><br>"slorr.. u r here.. i've been waiting for u for a long time..."<br><br>"had a good night's rest?..."<br><br>"oh... i didn't allow myself to fall into a deep sleep... 'cos i<br>know u wont wake me up when ur  here..."<br><br>"then u should take a rest now..."<br><br>"err... since u r here  already... i dun think I can..."<br><br>I gave her the Dolce Vita, and we'd agreed that  we would dance in<br>the rain in front of SGH main entrance the day she's discharged. i dare<br>not look straight at her... 'cos theres a butterfly on her face.. it<br>was only last night b4 I leave SGH that i found out she's suffering<br>from an illness called ERYSIPELAS.. what  the unprofessional call the<br>BUTTERFLY DISEASE... but i what i like is the coffee butterfly that is able<br>to<br>dance around freely.... not that pinkish-red butterfly that<br>settled on her pale complexion... moreover.. whats a butterfly if it can't<br>fly....<br><br>"slorr.. why r u looking at me.. and not talking?..."<br><br>i dun know... 'cos i noticed that she's getting weaker<br>physically...<br><br>I had a bad feeling about this...<br><br>"slorr... i m thirsty... can u get me a drink?.."<br><br>I m not leaving her at this moment. i can still remember a movie<br>about this guy who went all the way to get red bean soup for his<br>girlfriend who's on sickbed... and to find her lying silently on the white<br>bedsheet when he came back... never to wake up again...<br><br>"r u trying to get rid of me... like whats in that movie?.."<br><br>"slorr... movie is movie... life is life..."<br><br>MOVIE?.. LIFE?....<br><br>"but i thot u just had a drink?... anyway.. so what can i get for<br>u?..."<br><br>"Ultimate Ice Blended!!...."<br><br>This is a hospital leh!!... did she think I can find Coffeee Bean<br>everywhere on this island?...like Mcdonalds... whatsmore... coffeee<br>wasn't suitable for her at that time...<br><br>"err.... coffee isn't good for health.. order something else...<br>ok?.."<br>"so u know coffee isn't good for the body too... then u should cut<br>down on ur intake oso... ok?.."<br><br>i saw her smile appearing... and theres a shine  in her eyes... i<br>realised that she's just trying to tell me not to  drink too much<br>coffee in the future... My heart seemed to have suffered from a heavy<br>blow...<br>This is not good... a taste of pH&lt;7 has started to fill my<br>nose.....If this is not going to stop.. tears might be the next thing that<br>appears in front of her... i recalled the chapter on reservoir and dam in<br>physics textbook.. quickly apply the knowledge on me...  even if<br>its just a few  droplets...<br><br>"ok... i promise... i'll try my best.."<br><br>"and try to sleep earlier in the future..."<br><br>"and dun skip breakfast... its important to u..."<br><br>"and dun be too obsessed with Blue.. it makes u look..troubled...."<br><br>"and....."<br><br>this didn't sound good... its like giving the final instructions b4<br>she...  I can't bear to let her continue...<br><br>"okok... i'll go get u a drink right away.."<br><br>"slorr... is the machine far away?... if it is.. then its ok.. i<br>dun want it anymore..."<br><br>from my mental calculation....men would take 67 steps while women<br>would take 85 steps to reach the vending machine right at that corner..<br>plus the time taken to  purchase... average would take a total of<br>1.8-2.1 minutes... not very far...<br><br>"quite near.."<br><br>"slorr.... come back quick... i dun want to be alone for too<br>long....<br>i hate that feeling.."<br><br>i didn't answer her.... i just increased my pace....<br><br>X      X      X      X      X      X      X<br><br>"eh... its late already... go to sleep.."<br><br>my mum was nagging at me again.<br><br>"okok.... 10 more minutes..."<br><br>Until today, FlyNDance had left for more than 2 mths. i still<br>logged on at 1am everynight, but onto channel DOLCE-VITA which was created by<br>myself, with slorr and FlyNDance being the only 2 nicks inside, for<br>10 minutes. Althoh she wont be able to fly and dance in real life<br>anymore, but i still wish that she could continue to do so in the virtual<br>world.<br><br>Even Tye has given up on me... "she's gone.... y r u still doing<br>this?.. for what?!!..."<br><br>Yet, even if thats the case, i can't allow her soul to<br>be left at the corner of loneliness. 'cos she said.... she hate the<br>feeling of being alone... I still remember there was a heavy<br>downpour<br>on that day.... When i reached SGH... they told me... A coffeee<br>butterfly flew away from her room at around 1am last night.... after that...<br>i can't remember... i just knew that i stood at the bus-stop for<br>a whole  day... and i was all wet because of the rain.. even my<br>face..<br>I've been  crying hard not to think of her over theses 2 mths..<br>I've been hoping that her face wont appear in my mind every moment that<br>i breath, but it's like hoping that....  the sky isn't blue; the<br>grass isn't green; the stars do not twinkle at night... Basically, i was<br>hoping for something impossible to happen... I can't believe that i<br>m of Type 2, even in real  life.. Did i cry?.. NO WAY!.. i said it b4, i<br>m  not a romantic person, and this may be due to the deficiency in the<br>hormones that constitutes emotions... whenever i had the feeling of<br>pH&lt;7, i'll browse through those FWDS:jokes... attention will then<br>beshifted by those dim-wit, low-class jokes...<br><br>so now everything is back to the way it was b4 I met her 9 mths<br>ago... Tye is still flirting around, and i m still the old decent=dull me.<br>But  i've stopped taking coffeee and beer.<br><br>"xing ah... is this for u?...."<br><br>My mum handed me a letter she picked up in  the mail box this<br>morning.<br><br>i was surprised when i saw 'To:slorr...' written on the envelope.<br>That's for me i guess. i opened it up, there was a piece of writing<br>inside,<br>and another coffee  envelope.<br><br>Slorr,<br><br>I m FlyNDance's sister, i think this is how u r addressing her. I m<br>sorry that i do not know ur  real name, althoh we'd met b4. When i<br>was packing her stuffs a few Days ago, I  found this letter with your<br>name and address already written on it. So i posted it to you, because I<br>believe this is what my sister intended to do.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>Xiao wen<br><br>The letter was sent 3 days ago, and there was another<br>'To:slorr...' followed by my home address written on the coffee<br>envelope. But this handwriting was a lot nicer and the words seemed<br>to be moving swithtly...like in a joyful dance. I have no time to<br>figure out how she has gotten my home address... did i give her in one of my<br>mails?.. I tried to control my trembling hands, slowly, I opened up<br>the envelope. I found a photo, and a half of a movie ticket inside...<br>Apart from these, there was a blue letter... with the familiar DOLCE VITA<br>smell on it. The photo Showed her, standing on a piece of<br>grassland...<br>wearing the same coffee theme attire on our 1st meeting at<br>Mcdonalds.<br>Something was written at the back of it....<br><br>Dear slorr,<br>Coffee represents Pisces.. thats me.<br>Blue represents Sagittarius.. thats you.<br>A blue letter inside a coffeee envelope....<br><br>know what i mean?... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>seeing me... do u feel like drinking coffee<br>now?..<br>stop drooling!... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br>FlyNDance<br><br>I smiled.... bitterly.. and the contents of the blue letter is<br>simple:<br>If i have one more day to live,<br>i want to be your girlfriend.<br>Do i have one more day? No.<br>Too bad. I can't be your girlfriend...<br>not in this life.<br>If i have wings, i want to fly down from the<br>paradise just to see you.<br>Do i have wings? No.<br>Sadly. I can never see you again.<br>If all the water are drawn out of the bath-tub,<br>but it still can't put off the flame of love btw us.<br>Can all the water in a bath-tub be drawn off?<br>Can.<br>So, yes. I LOVE YOU.<br><br>FlyNDance<br><br>My chest was torn apart... tears broke through the dam I<br>constructed a long time go in a jiffy... As proud, as emotionless as i was, i<br>can't pull back the salty wet thats on the whole of my face anymore....She<br>has changed my 'little theory'... and  gotten<br>Back what I'd owed her... tears for 2 months....<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>Titanic has won 11 awards in the Oscar.. including best picture.<br>Yet, Rose wasn't the best actress under that category. So if its sad in<br>a movie, it may not be so fortunate too in real life. and.. in<br>reality...<br>hould Jack hold on to Rose.. and<br><br>'Never let go?'.....<br><br>Maybe he shouldn't be worried about this... 'cos that beautiful<br>coffee butterfly will continue to fly and dance in his heart.. forever...<br><br>~THE END~<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>&gt; It's a cold February night. People are bustling through the<br>&gt; streets, either pulling up their coat collars or wrapping<br>&gt; scarves around their necks, trying to stay warm.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; It's so cold today.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I'm standing at my window, looking at the people moving like<br>&gt; little dots. Standing in a heated room, I'm beginning to pity<br>&gt; those people. Why don't they go home? Do they plan on<br>&gt; wandering until morning?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Almost time to go home! My boyfriend must be going crazy."<br>&gt; One of the nurses breathe a sign of relief. "Still needs to<br>&gt; work overtime on Valentine's Day. It's so unfair!"<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "You are fortunate." Another nurse says. "Some people don't<br>&gt; have anyone waiting for them."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "You mean Dr. Shu?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Like Sherlock Holmes, my ears perk up when I hear my name.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Do you remember how she lost control on this day last year?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Of course I do." A nurse shudders. "I've never seen Dr. Shu<br>&gt; like that. Crying and yelling, like she was crazy."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; They are talking about how I was last year. They are correct.<br>&gt; I was out of control, like they said.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "You can't blame Dr. Shu. If my boyfriend died in front of my<br>&gt; eyes, I would probably go crazy as well."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Keep it down. She hasn't left work yet. She might hear you."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The two nurses are too late. I heard the entire conversation<br>&gt; through the canvas wall.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Dr. Shu, what are you doing standing here?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Just as I was deciding whether or not to reveal myself,<br>&gt; another nurse exposed me. I awkwardly step out. The 2 nurses<br>&gt; who discussed me start to blush. Their faces became redder<br>&gt; than the bow on Valentine's Day chocolates.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "I'm waiting to go home." I pretend that I didn't hear<br>&gt; anything.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Dr. Shu, you must have gotten too involved in your work. It's<br>&gt; already past time to go home. See you tomorrow. Happy<br>&gt; Valentine's Day!" She waves goodbye.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Happy Valentine's Day." I wave back and watch the 2 nurses<br>&gt; hurry away.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; That's fine. I was ready to go home anyway. Even though no<br>&gt; lover is waiting for me, at least there's a lazy cat waiting<br>&gt; for me to feed.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -------<br>&gt; After I come home, the first thing I do is feed the cat. I<br>&gt; forgot when first had the cat. Probably since last year's<br>&gt; Valentine's Day. At that time, I was like an abandoned cat,<br>&gt; with eyes filled with despair. Cats don't cry, I do. That's<br>&gt; the only difference.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Better drink all the milk or I'll skin you." I threatened the<br>&gt; cat. Her name is Christine, my least favorite English name. I<br>&gt; don't know why I named the cat Christine.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Christine meowed once to let me know she heard me, but her<br>&gt; eyes are complaining about my severity. Her eyes remind me of<br>&gt; someone I used to know, standing in front of me with eyes of<br>&gt; rebelliance.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -------<br>&gt; An year ago today, I had lunch with my boyfriend and took the<br>&gt; opportunity to complain to him.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Today is Valentine's Day. Why didn't you give me any<br>&gt; flowers?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt; He raised his eyebrow. "Why should I give you flowers? You are<br>&gt; not my anyone."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Then... you should at least give me a card!" I pouted my<br>&gt; lips, hurt by his tone.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "I know, I know. After lunch, I'll send you an e-card."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; E-card. That sounds so impersonal, but that's the way he is.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "You have to e-mail it to me. I'll be waiting." I excitedly<br>&gt; smiled and planned to sneak home after lunch to check e-mail.<br>&gt; Even though<br>&gt; he wouldn't use any romantic words, I still looked forward to<br>&gt; the card.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "I can't stand you women. Why do you make such a big deal out<br>&gt; of Valentine's Day??" He grumbled while eating his food. His<br>&gt; comment induced me to fight with him again.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "You are not romantic at all!! Don't you watch any Japanese<br>&gt; drama?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Japanese drama? I only watch Discovery Channel."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Your life is so boring." I made a face at him. "One recent<br>&gt; drama was really good. You should have watched it."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "What's that drama called?" He didn't believe in the love<br>&gt; portrayed in TV and movies. He always thought they were lies.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "It's called 'Story of A Century'." I gladly answered.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "What kind of trashy plot did it have?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "What do you mean trash?? Show some respect!" I was so angry.<br>&gt; "That drama was very touching, and the theme song was<br>&gt; beautiful as well. It's called 'Only Love', performed by Nana<br>&gt; Mouskouri." I wonder if he knew who Nana was.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Nana, I know her. A Greek singer with really expensive<br>&gt; albums."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Her voice is worth it." Even though I secretly agreed with<br>&gt; him, I couldn't bring myself to admit it.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Whatever." He glanced at his watch. "I'll give you 5 minutes<br>&gt; to tell me the plot. After that, I'm leaving."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I tried hard to explain 6 hours worth of story in just 5<br>&gt; minutes. The drama portrayed the love stories of 3 generations<br>&gt; of women spanning 100 years, from 1901 to 2000. Each<br>&gt; generation was portrayed by the same actress. The story was<br>&gt; tear-jerking.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "What's so touching about it?" He asked, after listening to<br>&gt; the story.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Don't you think each generation's story is wonderful? If I<br>&gt; have such great screenwriting ability, I wouldn't be a doctor<br>&gt; anymore. I would become a screenwriter."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "If you become a screenwriter, I bet no one would watch the<br>&gt; show. The TV station can go out of business." He quickly<br>&gt; interjected.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "I'm going back to work. Hurry and send me the card!" I was so<br>&gt; mad that I went home immediately, not even finishing my<br>&gt; coffee.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; As soon as I walked in my door, I turned on my computer and<br>&gt; got online. Staring at the empty inbox, I began to reminisce<br>&gt; about how we met. Maybe no one will believe me, but my<br>&gt; boyfriend and I were actually neighbors. Our homes were only 1<br>&gt; wall away. Ever since we were kids, we liked to fight with<br>&gt; each other all day long. I still remember when I moved to the<br>&gt; country that year. Used to the city life, I couldn't get used<br>&gt; to the simple life in the country. After school, I would just<br>&gt; go home and do nothing. Whenever that happend, he would always<br>&gt; come over to tease me.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Why are you staring off into space??" He loved to pull on my<br>&gt; hair. "You're so ugly when you're doing nothing. But you're<br>&gt; also not<br>&gt; pretty when you smile."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In other words, I'm really ugly.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "You're the one who's ugly!" I pull back my hair. "If you<br>&gt; think I'm so ugly, why do you visit me??"<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Can't help it. My home is right next to your home." He<br>&gt; argued.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Then I'll move!" The next day, I drew a line in the ground<br>&gt; using some white chalk. A line that I forbid him to cross.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; That year, we were both in the 5th grade. We couldn't stand<br>&gt; each other and hoped the other would move away. But 5 years<br>&gt; passed, and neither of us moved. Not only that, we got into<br>&gt; the same high school and into the same class.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "You're that infamous couple." All the students and teachers<br>&gt; in the school would say whenever they saw us. "We're not!" I<br>&gt; always tried to explain. "We're only neighbors." At that time,<br>&gt; I hated my parents for making us live next to him.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "My standard is not that low." He would say. "Who wants her to<br>&gt; be a girlfriend?? It's not like I don't have eyes."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Yes, I know your eyes are on top of your head." I really<br>&gt; disliked him. "Better than having eyes on the bottom of my<br>&gt; head like you."<br>&gt; He implied that I couldn't judge guys. At that time, I had a<br>&gt; crush on a senior.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I didn't think that his sarcasm had a hidden meaning. After a<br>&gt; while, I found out that the senior student had lots of<br>&gt; girlfriends. When I cried about it, he silently passed me a<br>&gt; handkerchief and awkwardly held me in his arms. "I told you he<br>&gt; wasn't any good." He roughly comforted me.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I cried in his arms the whole night, and began to see him in a<br>&gt; different way. Things began to change between us. We still<br>&gt; fought all the time, but he started to look at me differently.<br>&gt; And I blushed and my heart beat faster when he was near. We<br>&gt; both knew: we fell in love with each other. Even with this<br>&gt; knowledge, neither of us said anything. Even though we would<br>&gt; not be able to resist and kissed each other constantly. Even<br>&gt; though we cared about each other's every moves. Both of us<br>&gt; refused to admit our love.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Time flew by quickly, and it was time to face separation. I<br>&gt; chose to study medicine, and he chose physics. Yet we still<br>&gt; couldn't separate from each other. Our parents worried that we<br>&gt; didn't know anyone in Taipei, so they forced us to live in the<br>&gt; same apartment building. Once again, we became neighbors. We<br>&gt; still fought, but sometimes we fought into the bedroom.<br>&gt; Alright, we became lovers, but we still wouldn't say we loved<br>&gt; each other. We didn't even spend Valentine's Day together<br>&gt; until he saw me share dinner with a man one Valentine's Day.<br>&gt; That night, he waited for me in front of my door and said that<br>&gt; he would take me out to dinner on Valentine's Day from then<br>&gt; on. I have to say that he was very arrogant. But I nodded and<br>&gt; accepted his request. Since then, we spent every Valentine's<br>&gt; Day together.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; After graduation, I became an intern. He started a small<br>&gt; computer company with some friends and became a programmer. We<br>&gt; were busy with our own lives and had no time for a<br>&gt; relationship. Three years later, I became a doctor, and his<br>&gt; business began to boom. We separately moved to bigger<br>&gt; apartments and stopped being neighbors. On the surface, we<br>&gt; left each other. In reality, we were still together. We spent<br>&gt; every Valentine's Day together but each year became more<br>&gt; dreary than the next because he never told me he loved me even<br>&gt; with all my hints.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Facing the empty inbox, I suddenly grew very angry. He<br>&gt; wouldn't say it and wouldn't send me a card. What did he mean?<br>&gt; Who did he think I was? I called his cell phone.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Hello." He picked up the phone.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "I didn't receive the card." I immediately showed my<br>&gt; displeasure.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "You didn't receive it?" He seemed really busy. "But I sent<br>&gt; it."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; He was really busy but I didn't care. "I didn't receive it.<br>&gt; Send it again."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Okay, I'll send you 100 times. Is that good enough??" He said<br>&gt; with impatience. His tone further infuriated me. Is that how<br>&gt; lovers speak to each other?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Don't bother sending it to me. And you don't have to pick me<br>&gt; up tonight. I'll eat dinner by myself."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Don't be childish, ok? I'm really busy."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "I AM childish!" I hung up the phone and tears rolled down my<br>&gt; cheeks.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Childish?? Why didn't he consider the situation? We've gone<br>&gt; out for so many years and spent countless Valentine's Day<br>&gt; together. I never received any flowers nor cards from him.<br>&gt; Now, I just want a little e-card. Is that too much to ask<br>&gt; for??<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I unplugged the phone from the wall and turned off my cell<br>&gt; phone. I didn't want to hear his explanations. After I<br>&gt; returned to the hospital, I instructed the receptionist not to<br>&gt; forward me any phone calls. I wanted to concentrate on work.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Because there were so many emergencies today, I was sweating 1<br>&gt; hour later and forgot about our argument.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Dr. Shu, please take a look at that patient."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; As I was collecting my equipment, the shrill sound of an<br>&gt; ambulance sounded outside the ER. When I stepped out the door,<br>&gt; the emergency medics hurriedly wheeled in a gurney.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "What happened to him?" I asked the 1st medic. Everyone  else<br>&gt; were trying to help put the patient on the gurney. He was<br>&gt; covered<br>&gt; with blood.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Car accident." The medic replied. "Very serious. He may die."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I nodded and ran to the operating room with them. When I<br>&gt; arrived, the nurses told me that the man had already stopped<br>&gt; breathing and also his heartbeat also stopped<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Prepare for shock." I calmly instructed the nurses. Saving<br>&gt; people is our duty. We can't lose our calm.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; But when I saw who laid on the operating table, I lost my<br>&gt; calm. That person was my boyfriend!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "No..." I stood in shock. "NO!!!" I grabbed the paddles and<br>&gt; continuously shocked his body. His body bounced up and down<br>&gt; from the shocks. The scared nurses went to find another<br>&gt; doctor, to tell him that I was crazy.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I didn't know if I was crazy or not. I just wanted to save my<br>&gt; lover. Even though we fought all the time. Even though he<br>&gt; never showed me his love. I still wanted to save him. He still<br>&gt; owed me a card. He couldn't die!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I threw away the paddles and began to press on his heart. I<br>&gt; pressed with all my strength, hoping it would revive him, but<br>&gt; he didn't wake up. He didn't even say "It hurts". He just laid<br>&gt; there with his eyes closed, punishing me with his silence.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Dr. Jian angrily pushed me away. By that time, I couldn't see<br>&gt; clearly anymore. I cried. I wailed. I bowled until no sounds<br>&gt; could come out of my mouth.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "It's too late, Dr. Shu. He's already dead. I'm sorry." Dr.<br>&gt; Jian patted me on the shoulder. They knew each other and ate<br>&gt; together once. I introduced them.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "He can't die." I shook my head. "He can't die!!" I struggled<br>&gt; to run to him.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Dr. Shu, control yourself!" Dr. Jian slapped me. "I<br>&gt; understand what you're going through, but you're a doctor."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Yes, I'm a doctor, but I'm also a regular person. How can Dr.<br>&gt; Jian understand how I feel? I've loved him for so many years<br>&gt; that it's<br>&gt; become a habit. How can I just throw away a habit? Besides, he<br>&gt; still owed me a card.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "I want him to live! I want him to live!" I ran to him again<br>&gt; and tried to knock the life back into his body.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Take her away!" That day, I lost my control and my<br>&gt; professionalism. And that day happened to be Valentine's Day.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Afterwards, I asked his co-workers why he left work early that<br>&gt; day. They told me that after I hung up the phone, he tried to<br>&gt; call me several times but couldn't reach me. Worried, he drove<br>&gt; to the hospital to find me and got hit by a large truck on the<br>&gt; way.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; When I heard this, I froze. My tantrum killed him. Just<br>&gt; because of an unmailed card, he died. After that, I lost my<br>&gt; privilege to be childish. Like an abandoned cat, I couldn't<br>&gt; even cry anymore. After his death, I couldn't cry anymore,<br>&gt; regardless of how touching the plot or how tear-jerking the<br>&gt; dialogue. They didn't affect me anymore.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Now, I'm only left with a cat and a seldomly used computer.<br>&gt; Stepping over the cat, I turned on the computer. Even though I<br>&gt; know no one will send me a mail, I still hoped that someone<br>&gt; will remember me on this day.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Meow, meow. I looked at Christine to see what's wrong. She<br>&gt; finished her milk. I went into the kitchen to get her more<br>&gt; milk then came back to look at the computer screen.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I have.... 100 emails! Who would be bored enough to send me<br>&gt; 100 junk mail?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I was just about to delete them all when I received another<br>&gt; mail, and this one said: "Because of system error, we could<br>&gt; not send these until today. We apologize for the delay." The<br>&gt; sender was my ISP.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I looked at the 1st mail. It showed the send date is last<br>&gt; year's Valentine's Day. My heart began to beat fast. Could he<br>&gt; have sent these?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; With a trembling hand, I opened the mail. The first thing that<br>&gt; popped up was a gorgeous red rose set against green leaves.<br>&gt; Then a beautiful melody began to play.... "Only Love". I<br>&gt; couldn't believe it. The rose was so beautiful and the music<br>&gt; was so dreamy. I almost thought I was in a fantasy. Most<br>&gt; touching of all were the words underneath the rose, because<br>&gt; the words read like a beautiful poem.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Hwei."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; That's my name.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Knowing you so many years, I've never sent you any flowers.<br>&gt; Today I send you a rose."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I received it and it's so beautiful.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "You know we are always fighting. We can never really open our<br>&gt; hearts and tell each other how we feel."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Yes, but it's all your fault for being so distant.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "I know I always make you mad by the things I say."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Good that you're admitting it.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "But today I want to say to you: I'm sorry, and I love you."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I waited so many years for those words.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "And I want to tell you a good news. I finally saved enough<br>&gt; money."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; You already have enough money. Why did you need so much?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "So Hwei, let's get married!! I was afraid to propose to you,<br>&gt; because I didn't trust in my ability to give you the good life<br>&gt; you deserve.<br>&gt; But now I've saved enough money so we don't have to wait<br>&gt; anymore."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Who wanted you to wait? I'm already yours.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Today, I use this card to propose to you. Will you marry me,<br>&gt; Hwei? Will you?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt; That's the content of the whole card. Like a fool, I kept<br>&gt; reading his words and talking to him. It's like I can hear his<br>&gt; voice and see him again. As if it's back to 1 year ago with us<br>&gt; constantly fighting.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The song played over and over. Repeating Nana's heartbreaking<br>&gt; voice.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Only love can make a memory.<br>&gt; Only love can make a moment last.<br>&gt; You were there and all the world was young<br>&gt; and all it's songs unsung.<br>&gt; and I remember you then when love was all,<br>&gt; all you were living for,<br>&gt; and how you gave that love to me...."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The lyrics of this song fits our love so closely. When he was<br>&gt; alive, my world was so young. Every day, I could find a<br>&gt; something different to fight with him about. But after he<br>&gt; left, my life is only left with memories and coldness that<br>&gt; will never go away.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Will you marry me?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt; When I read these words, my tears unconsciously came, wetting<br>&gt; the keyboard.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Will I? If he's in front of me, I will definitely kick him and<br>&gt; call him a big fool. If I wasn't willing, I wouldn't have<br>&gt; waited until today.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; So I moved the cursor over the "Reply" box, and typed the<br>&gt; response that I've already prepared for so many years - "I<br>&gt; will."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I will - be by his side for the rest of my life. I will -<br>&gt; fight with him forever. That is how I answered him, but the<br>&gt; only response I got was the repeating song "Only Love."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Nevertheless, I opened every single letter, accepted every<br>&gt; singled rose, and typed the same response: "I will."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I replied 100 times, and "Only Love" played 100 times. In this<br>&gt; cold Valentine's night, the line that's been broken for 1 year<br>&gt; finally got reconnected.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I answered you. What about you?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br><br>=====<br>Happiness is a choice<br></div>
