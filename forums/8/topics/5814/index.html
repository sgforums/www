            <div class='col-md body'>As I read one of the posts by Raychele (correct?) in which she wrote it's hard to find guys to do all those stuff.  Hmm! Interesting!  Is it true?  I thought in these days of age it's common that a couple who live together would share the chores.  My impression is that it is no longer the responsibility of the female alone who has to cook, etc.<br><br>I am still living at home, but I still help to clean, washing dishes, vacuum, sweeping, etc. etc, except for the cooking part and ironing.<br><br>I will be moving out on my own in the next two months.  My gf said she expects me to do more than now - get into cooking and ironing.  Obviously, I did not say no, but neither did I say yes.  I told her that I can do everything except for the cooking and ironing part.  I can never have the patience to iron my dress shirts and pants for some reasons.  I am extremely impatience.  Everything for me has to be quick quick quick and get it out of the way asap.  She said she does not care, and that I must learn to do it or else she is not going to marry me (ya right! her usual threat).  Let's see!  In three months time, I will see if I can get away with the ironing and the cooking.  But definitely, I am ready to be accountable for cleaning, etc. , not cooking and ironing though.<br><br>Do any males and females here are lucky enough that they do not have to do all the chores or they are unlucky enough that they have to do all those chores?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I used to do that too when studying overseas, but after coming back, I dun do them anymore. Basically, I am too busy with work, perhaps it's an excuse.. but I do enjoy cooking. I hated ironing though..  :p<br><br>I guess when guys are abroad, they got no choice but to do all these themselves. In the army, I dun think most guys would even need to cook or iron, coz they can bring them back to wash and cook.. well, unless you are a cook.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A few friends and I just talked about this stuff two weeks ago. We found that it is very interesting. If u say that it is hard to find guys who do housework, I would say that it is kinda more difficult to find girls who are willing to do those stuffs.<br><br>Personally, I am lucky enough that I don't need to do most housework except washing dishes occasionally. Oh no, I may say I am lazy one instead, sometimes, really feel sorry to my mama for not sharing housework with her.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>But I don't think I am a particular lazy one. Among my friends group, most girls don't do all housework. Some may share a little bit, but at most just washing dishes and cleaning. Cooking?? NO NO NO.<br><br>on the other hand, we found that many guys share some housework at home. they may can't cook too, but seems they are more willing to share all the housework than girls. I lived in campus hostel last year, we seldom cooked for ourselves except just putting the fast noodle into the microwave oven. But when we cooked a "big meal" with many friends occasionally, the guys usually did more in the cooking. We felt very surprised, but they said that they often cooked at home. You see, how interesting! It is quite different form the tradition, guys usually don't need to do any housework at home, but nowadays, many guys changed liao.<br><br>I am not trying to show off that we donÂ¡Â¦t need to do housework. But it is true that more and more girls are not willing to do housework, especially for cooking. My future husband must be required to SHARE all the housework. It will be appreciated if he does more than me lah. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I still think that woman should learn to cook and to ENJOY doing housechores...Why??Maybe I am still traditional...in thinking...It is a good way to show ur appreciation and a sense of satisfaction when ppl likes and gives u a good appraisal for cooking.Of cos, no one is born to know how to cook well but I believe practice makes perfect...Try to derive the joy of cooking..dun get discouraged if the first time fails...<br><br>Of cos, sharing of housechores and cooking is ideal but it should be put on an equal basis not exploiting the guy's love for u...and laziness cannot be the reason of avoiding housework when it is ur turn to do..Sharing housework for couples have to be an act of real sharing and love ...not mandatory...If u love someone deeply..U would not want to see him or her to tired doing housework..therefore this is how sharing comes about...<br><br>I mean the satisfactio of seeing ur house spick and span ....cooking the food which ur family love..U can give a pat on your shoulder and say.."This is what a Millenium woman should be...Virtious and yet intellectual"<br>hope all of u trying to understand what I am driving at..<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 27 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... I can't help but ponder about DaKaR comments, I mean is Rinoa, really real? Well, if you are, I am sure glad to know that my dream gal still exsist. *LOL* But on the topic, I do not believe that the housechores should be done by any of the sexes alone, simply because it is Housework, and not malework or femalework, being part of the family mean to be respondsible for the house too. Not only monetarily but also in terms or spirituality and physical support. I too like my room clean and tidy, it is always refreshing to go back to a house like that, but if I am not going to keep it clean and just rely on my partner for it, then I guess it would not be fair would it?<br><br>Hmmm... about the women of the millenium thingy, Intelligent and virtuous? Hmmm... so far I have met a few but they are not employing anyone at the moment*LOL* Women who do housework nowadays are quite rare, Well you can't blame them for it, they too, goes to work, and like us man, hopes to come back to a nice clean home. But I have a friend whose husband is a really great guy(Who is so much better than me of course, me? I am just a slacker,*laffs*) He irons his clothers, mops the floor, cook dinner for her, and all that is on top of the fact that he is an Engineer in profession. He really loves her, and sometimes I think she is just so unfair to him. *smiles* But frankly speaking I owuld not mind doing it for the person I love too, but of course I do expect her to do part of the house work too, that is because knowing myself, I am sure to bring up such things at the spur of the moment in a squabble. *laffs*<br><br>What do you guys and gals think, is it worth it?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>callan;<br>I am glad to hear that u guys don't take housework as women's duty for granted. If guys still expect their future wives do most housework and manage the home very well as the traditional housewives, most likely, they will get disappointed unless they want to have a full time housewife at home. But how many girls want to be a full time housewife nowadays? errr, but i never said that women shouldn't do housework and shift these responsibilities to men even if women also need to work. So sharing is the best scenario. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Rinoa:<br>I agreed with u that women SHOULD learn to cook and enjoy cooking even I still can't make up my mind to learn cooking NOW. Being the kind of girls donÂ¡Â¦t cook and donÂ¡Â¦t enjoy cooking is one of my weaknesses. I honestly quite admire u still keep this good traditional thought in this way even though u did not say that u often cook and often enjoy cooking <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I will try my best to learn and ENJOY cooking later on, hehe,  I will put it into practice someday. Maybe, someday when I leave my family and work outside, it will be time for me to learn cooking and take care of myself :p<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I cook, I clean, wash laundry, dishes, take out rubbish...etc...<br><br>Yes there are now more guys than ever doing things that women used to do...and the sad thing is that many women are now taking it all for granted and now men are expected to bring home the bacon and take over the wifes duties also...<br><br>My point is that these things aren't just womens duties, but a shared responsibility and both parties must learn to do them and share in it...In Singapore, Men are still required and expected to give up a large sum of their money to their wives even when the wife is making money on her own...and now, a lot of these same women dun even know how to cook or clean....<br><br>the sad thing is that the tables have turned...and instead of learning from mistakes of the past gender wars, a lot of modern women now conveniently forget and do the exact same things tot he guys...and take their money also....<br><br>I totally disagree with what is happening...I for one love to cook and cleanning is fun sometimes and even when I was living at home with my family it was the childrens duties to clean, wash, and cook...although the cooking was done mostly by our mother.<br><br>It was a shared activity and most times we never complained...but we all knew how to do it...many girls I've met and known in spore dun even know what flour and corn oil is...or even how to work a vacuuum cleaner or mop properly...and I agree with the aboe staement somewhere that more guys now are willing to do housework and cooking than girls...<br><br>i for one feel that Singaproean women are now too p[ampered and have very few responmsibilities...even when they make their own money, they can keep it while the men's wage must be the one that supports the whole family....Something wrong with that..Really wrong...<br><br>I will never marry a woman who doesn't care enuff to take on these responsibilities...if I'm willing to do them, then she should be also...there is no such thing as you do it all I go out use all your money and save my own money....<br><br>to all the women who understand that men shouldn't be taken for granted, i salute u and hope to marry u one day...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>luf,<br><br>whether you or other guys fall for the image rinoa constructed is beside the point. my point of contention is that you do not give men, in general, credit when you say they consume this image in a simulacrum-like manner. the construction of this image is founded on specific cultural and sociological premises and i have to oppose your assumption when you mistake these specificities for generalities. the weaving of an imagine is a construction that appeals to the politics of background and you have effectively washed an entire spectrum of men with one culturally and sociologically specific brush.<br><br>cheers</div>
