Too much of a coincidence wat.<br></div></blockquote>Hello Kitty:<br>It's not a coincidence. VCD started getting popular, and since Japan is usually at the cutting edge of technology, they started burning their drama serials into VCD to sell to suckers in HK, Taiwan, Malaysia, and SINGAPORE!<br><br>And since their actor and actress are all damn chio or yantao, we also dun waste time and start drooling saliva... while in the midst of watching the serials, we follow them and "la...la...la..." and "what can i do..."<br><br>If HK drama serials start hotting up (well, i mean not among aunties only), I bet you can hear a lot of Canto pop songs in KTV also... but then, HK drama are too damn long, so chances are not very high.<br><br>I hope after my intense explanation, you will be able to understand why it's not coincidental that pple go crazy over Jap songs even when most dun understand Jap. Not that I'm trying to be lor sor...Anyway, it doesn't help that Jap stuff and clothes are that hip. But for those Singaporeans who just follow Jap fashion blindly, I think they are a sad case who doesn't have dress sense and try to copy the Japs.<br><br>Well, in Celine Dion sings Jap now... can't be coincidental, rite?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I can't believe it. Hello Kitty has once again done it. She has sparked off an intellectual discussion. Bravo Hello Kitty.<br><br>With regards to what she mentioned, yes, I believe there is a trend among Singaporeans to like anything Japanese, be it Hello Kittys, Tarrepandas, or Overtime and Long Vacation, or the yandaogias, you all name them, I can't remember the names quite well. Well, the fact is the Japanese are the closest group of people from whom Singaporeans can identify with. Someone Singaporeans can simulate. (It would be interesting to note that the trend in Japan is to simulate the Americans, something Singaporeans don't like.) This is the pursuit of an idol, someone whom each individual can scalp him or herself to be, and well, Japanese being the nearest culture they can identify with, doesnt hurt much rite?? And with the influx of the Japanese influence in the Singapore market, who can blame Singaporeans??? It is just like English people like to model themselves like the blacks, look at Ali Gee.
