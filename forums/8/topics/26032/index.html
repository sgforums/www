But not by cleanser alone.<br><br>Here goes.<br><br>Most of us know that pimples are caused by trapped sebum causing blocked pores and then infection sets in.<br><br>So things to avoid when choosing cleansers, toners, moisturisers and exfoliants.<br><br>1) Avoid products with anything that are oil based. Eg, lanolin, beewax, mineral oil (they now diguise under other names), parrafin..etc Why? They block pores. You may ask me why then the products contain them. Its a long story....<br><br>2) Avoid any irritants in products that can irritate your skin molecular structure and causes allergy thereby causes infections and if not, parched skin which are weak and again have less immunity to infections. Usual culprits are harsh alcohol (some types are ok), fragrances(this is bad) as fragrance has nothing to do but just smells good and giving an asthetic effect which most skins will be allergic to. Yet may cause inflammations.<br><br>3) Avoid anti biotics in both topical or oral forms as it may work for a while but will make bacteria immune in a matter of time.<br><br>4) Never never squeeze. Lifetime scars, infection, spreading of germs are the results.<br><br>5) Stay away from pollutions. Pollutants are small particles in the air eg ashes from joss sticks, insense paper, roadside dust. These will be attracted to oil on you face and will clog your pores resulting in pimples and backheads.<br><br>Daily Regimen:-<br><br>1) Choose a cleanser devoid of the above. Do not clean too often as  it will rob your skin from nature's best defence which is your skin's natural secretion.<br><br>2) Tone with  a PH balanced toner 5.5.  Watch out here. Many toner got harsh alcohol.<br><br>3) Moisturise (even for oily skin but must be careful which depending on your skin type) . Hint. If oily skin, heard of "skin enhancer?"<br>There are both for dry or oily skin type.<br><br>4) Always have sunscreen. Must use those w/o oil base on the face!!!!  SPF15 protection should be enough unless prolonged exposure such as swimming or playing golf or soccer, then at least SPF 35 and above to be used generously. Today's glowing tan is your future's sun damage. Even a 10 minute exposure to sun w/o protection can do permanent damage.<br><br>Treatment:-<br><br>1) Use clay masque at least twice a week. They suck out impurities which blocked the pores and where pimples will be  formed. Some people will have outbreaks at the begining. Don't be worried unless it is severe because it is a good sign. That meant your skin is clearing up the rubbish inside. After awhile, your skin will glow.<br><br>2) Exfoliate. Dead skin cells breed bacteria. Choose a very very fine scrub so as to not irritate your skin. Again, in the beginning if your skin is not used to it, there may be out breaks too. No pain no gain.<br><br>3) Vitamin C serum. It strengthens your skin structure and combats free radicals. Very powderful antioxidant.<br><br>3) Diet. Leafy green veggies. Not only protects your skin, it is good health too. Avoid red meat , alcohol, ciggarettes and stress as these produce free radicals that cause weakening of your body's molecular structure.<br><br>By 30, your cells are starting to degenerate and the above will not only help your skin but also your general health which then will also promote radiant glowing skin.<br><br>Avoid creams that drys up pimples cos pimples may be dried up, skin is damaged thru burning effect and future problems are pigmentation and wrinkles.<br><br>Ethically, I cannot recommend products and brands. Use your own judgement on the guidelines provided above.<br><br>FI arr.... can or not har? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How Acne Forms<br><br>Male hormones found in both males and females rise during adolescence (puberty) and stimulate and enlarge the oil (sebaceous) glands of the skin. These glands are found in areas where acne is common (the face, upper back, and chest). Rarely, acne can be due to a hormonal imbalance.<br><br>The oil glands are connected to a hair-containing canal called a follicle. The sebaceous glands make an oily substance called sebum which reaches the skin surface by emptying through the skin surface opening of the follicle. The hair follicle opening is sometimes called the pore. The oil (sebum) causes the cells from the follicular lining to shed more rapidly and stick together, forming a plug at the hair follicle opening. Bacteria grow in the mixture of oil and cells in the follicle. These bacteria make chemicals that stimulate inflammation and cause the wall of the follicle to break. The sebum, bacteria, and shed skin cells spill into the skin causing redness, swelling, and pus - a pimple. Cham liow lah <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cleansing<br><br>The black in a blackhead is dried oil and shed skin cells in the openings of the hair follicles. For the normal care of your skin, wash your face with soap and warm water twice a day. Acne is not caused by dirt. Washing too often or too vigorously may actually make your acne worse. Regular shampooing is also recommended. If your hair is oily, you may want to wash it more often.<br><br>Men with acne who shave should try both an electric and a safety razor to see which is more comfortable. If you use a safety razor, soften your beard thoroughly with soap and warm water before applying shaving cream. To avoid nicking pimples, shave as lightly as possible. Shave only when necessary and always use a sharp blade.<br><br>Diet<br>Acne is not caused by the foods you eat. Dermatologists have differing opinions on the importance of your diet in the management of acne. One thing is certain; a strict diet by itself will not clear your skin. On the other hand, if certain foods seem to make your acne worse, then try to avoid them. But be careful about jumping to conclusions, acne may get better or worse on its own. It is always important to eat a well balanced diet. So try standing on a basket ball and balancing yourself there while eating ba kut teh....hehehe <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Sunlight<br>A tan can mask your acne, but the benefits are temporary. Since sunlight ages the skin and can cause skin cancer, you should not sunburn, "bake in the sun," or use sunlamps. Choose a sunscreen that is oil-free, such as a gel or light lotion.<br><br>Cosmetics<br><br>If you wear a liquid foundation or use a moisturizer, look for ones that are oil-free and not just water-based. Choose products that are "non-comedogenic" (should not cause whiteheads or blackheads) or "non-acnegenic" (should not cause acne). Remove your cosmetics every night.<br><br>A flesh-tinted acne lotion containing benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid or sulfur can safely hide blemishes. Loose powder mixed with oil-free product is also good for cover-up.<br><br>Shield your face when applying hairsprays and gels. Best if got spiderman mask <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Treatment<br>Control of acne is an ongoing process. All acne treatments work by preventing new acne. Existing blemishes must heal on their own. Improvement takes time. If your acne has not improved after 6 to 8 weeks, you may need a change in your treatment.<br><br>The treatment your will vary according to your type of acne. Occasionally, an acne-like rash can be due to another cause - such as from makeup, lotions, or from an oral medication. Many non-prescription acne lotions and creams help milder cases of acne. However, many will also make your skin dry if used too often. If you use these products, follow instructions carefully.<br><br>There are also antibiotics that are applied to the skin. These are used in less severe cases of acne. When large red bumps (cysts) are present, the dermatologist may inject cortisone directly into the bumps to help them go away.<br><br>Don't pick, scratch, pop or squeeze your pimples yourself. When the pimples are squeezed, more redness, swelling, inflammation and scarring may result.<br><br>Antibiotics taken by mouth such as tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline or erythromycin are often prescribed for moderate or severe cases, especially when there is a lot of acne on the back or chest. Antibiotics reduce the bacteria in the follicle and may also decrease the skin redness directly. When taking oral antibiotics, some women may develop a vaginal yeast infection.<br><br>Women who are taking birth control pills may notice a significant improvement in their acne, and these pills are sometimes used specifically for the treatment of acne. It is also important to know that oral antibiotics may decrease the effectiveness of birth control pills. This is uncommon but possible, especially if you notice break-through bleeding.<br><br>In cases of severe acne, other drugs may be used. These may include female hormones or medications that decrease the effects of male hormones. Another oral medication, isotretinoin is sometimes used for severe acne that has not responded to other treatments. Patients using isotretinoin must thoroughly understand the side effects of this drug. Frequent follow-up visits are necessary to monitor side effects. Prevention of pregnancy is a must, since the drug causes severe birth defects if taken during pregnancy. Viagra can? Dunno leh.<br><br>Treatment of Acne Scarring<br><br>Should scarring be already present prior to treatment or be a residual of treatment, dermatologist can treat these scars by a variety of methods. Combination skin resurfacing with laser, dermabrasion, chemical peeling or electrosurgery, can flatten depressed scars. Soft tissue elevation with collagen, filling products or fat can elevate scars. Scar revision by your dermatologic surgeon with a microexcision and punch grafting can correct pitted scars, and combinations of these dermatologic surgical treatments can make noticeable differences on the appearance of the scars. I understand that there are certain clinics doing laser treatment for about $300. One famous one is at Choa Chu Kang cemetry..oops...clinic. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  Dr Gurmit Singh<br><br>Proper care is necessary<br><br>Remember hoh,  you must continue proper skin care until the tendency to have acne has passed. There is no instant or permanent cure for acne, but it is controllable, and proper treatment may prevent scarring.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  DuH<br><br><img src="http://www.aad.org/pamphlets/images/extreme.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Regular exercise boosts health and fitness levels while keeping you in shape. You know this, but as an incentive to get you started, exercise can bring a healthy glow. Here's how:<br><br>Gives you radiant skin: Exercise improves blood circulation and increases oxygen in the skin. Oxygen in your skin boosts collagen which builds and increases skin regeneration. You can be guaranteed a healthier and more radiant skin.<br><br>Exercise promotes better sleep: A good night's sleep is a must when it comes to improved skin texture and tone. Regular exercise will help get quality sleep. Exercise has an alerting effect on most people and it raises body temperature. Your body will have a corresponding fall in temperature a few hours following this perk which makes sleep easier and deeper. Having ample sleep time is a definite must for any beauty regiment.<br><br>How To Get Started<br>The best way is right away. You don't need to join a gym, buy new gear or even equipment. A lot of the time thinking about how to get started means you never do. Think immediate and think baby steps first. You can go for the frills later.<br><br>The easiest and most effective workout, and everyone can do it, is to walk. Build in as much walking in a day as you can. Don't set yourself up for failure by having grand exercise schemes. The important thing is to keep active and off the couch. We share some simple exercise do's top get you going and some pointers to sticking with it.<br><br>Take a walk: Instead of spending your time having a cup of coffee or slouching in front of the television set, make a little sacrifice, get out of your chair and go for a walk after meals. Brisk walking increases your heart rate and you will become fitter in no time.<br><br>Stick to a routine you enjoy: Start an exercise regiment that you would enjoy. It will be easier to stick to it if you enjoy doing it. If you hate going under the sun, then you are likely to enjoy working out in the gym or doing yoga. If you're a lover of nature, then a game of golf may be the thing for you.<br><br>Jazz up your workout: If boredom sets in after a while, introduce some variety into your routine. Instead of just walking sign up for aerobic classes, you may want to try a dance class if you're tired of working out in a gym. Try mountain biking instead of the usual bicycle ride in the park. Switch from swimming to walking around your neighbourhood. In fact variety means you will work different muscles and that's a good thing for all round body tone. When bored, never quit, find something different. After a while you can switch back to what your original exercise routine.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hair Myths<br><br>By your Grandmother who anyhow talked<br><br>Myth: 100 strokes a day leaves hair healthy and shiny<br>Truth: If you use a poor quality brush or comb you could in fact be doing hair damage by scraping the hair shaft! 100 strokes was touted when conditioner wasn't invented and, brushing hair brought the scalp's natural oils from the roots to the ends to give a 'conditioning effect'. Today with mild shampoos that allow for daily cleansing and conditioners for every imaginable hair texture and condition there's hardly any need to brush hair to give it shine. Brushing or combing is primarily to detangle and style hair.<br>If you prefer more shine, shine a torchlght lor <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Myth: Don't brush your hair if it's thinning.<br><br>Truth:Thinning hair can tolerate brushing as well as thick hair. Brushing doesn't cause hair to fall out. Hair that falls out is at the end of its growth cycle and will fall out on its own, whether it's brushed or not.<br><br>Myth: If you pull out grey hair, more will appear.<br>Truth:You should be lucky that if you pull out one hair more will grow, white or otherwise! Each hair strand has a predetermined life cycle (the number of time it will fall out and regrow) and if you yank hair from the follicle you are in fact shortening its life span. Not to say  si peh painful!!<br><br>Myth: Short hair grows faster, or hair will grow faster and thicker if it's frequently cut.<br>Truth: Long or short hair grows an average of 1cm a month. Hair is in fact dead protein, so whatever you do to the ends, does not affect the follicle that's responsible for hair growth. Cutting off the ends doesn't send any signals to follicle. Cutting hair cannot encourage growth nor can thinning hair be made thicker by shaving it all off. Short hair may 'seem' to grow faster because 1cm of growth is more visible on very short hair than it is on long hair.<br><br>Myth:Hair must be shampooed twice to be thoroughly clean or clean hair must squeak.<br>Truth: If you shampoo hair daily, there's no necessity to shampoo twice, unless of course you use loads of hairspray or gel. How squeaky is enough squeak? In going for the squeak you could over shampoo and dry hair out.<br>Got people shampoo hair twice a day meh?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Myth: Vegetable dyes are natural and gentle on hair.<br>Truth:If a vegetable dye claims it gives more than 30 percent coverage of grey hair, or lightens hair, chances are there are chemicals in it. Egyptian henna is the only all-natural colour but it colours hair a flat, uniform orangy-red shade - it maybe natural colour, but gives unnatural looking colour!<br><br>Myth: The more you colour hair, the more grey hair you'll have.<br>Truth: We say long live colour, if it can give you more hair. The truth is that with coloured hair you forget the amount of grey you had before hair was coloured. And with frequent touch ups you don't really notice more hair has turned grey. Once you leave off colouring for a spell, you're shocked to see the amount of grey hair, you now have! Gray hair is also color wat. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Myth: Dandruff is caused because your scalp is dry.<br>Truth: Actually the reverse is often true. Seborrhea, the most common type of dandruff usually signals an oily scalp, and overactive oil glands is the cause. Teenagers and those with oily skin tend to be the most prone to dandruff. Treat with an anti dandruff shampoo and avoid styling products that are very oily.  Use the oil to make chicken rice instead. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br><img src="http://www.evildeadclowns.com/cards/xmasgraphics/santaclown.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by yuppiez:</div><div class="quote_body">i mean for asian skin..what product u think is the best?</div></blockquote>Asian skin, Western skin, Alien skin or simply thick skin does not depend very much on products as products are usually made for general use. Of course there are some differences but not of much concern unless skin type is so different like Indians donch need too much sunscreen because they have natural melanin pigments protecting them from UV/UVA rays where a fairer caucasion will have to splash loads of it, reason being obvious. Even in the country of manufacture, say USA, there are humid, cold climates as opposed to hot desert like condition in Las Vegas or Nevada. In contrast, Singapore is hot and humid therefore you need lighter moisturiser where heavier ones will be uncomfortable and may even cause outbreaks. Although there are targetted products, manufacturing costs are usually prohibitant than producing a general one. For example, see a GP or a specialist doctor.<br><br>So to choose products, use the guidelines in my earlier postings. Most impotent...er...important,  your skin type must be determined. Many people just stop at oily or dry type which is not  usually the case. That is because your skin type will change given climatic changes, stress level, enviromental factors such as humidity or pollution and even sufficient rest or sleep.<br><br>For example, do you work outdoors or indoors? Outdoors need less moisturiser whereas indoors need heavier ones because of dry aircon air.  Also outdoor work require more sunscreen which SPF 15 may not be enough. Example of outdoor works are  outdoor sales people, site engineers, drivers..etc. Remember, for most people, even 10 minutes in the sun can start to damage your skin. NS boys to take note.<br><br>What about lip protection? Do you want moist, plum sensual lips or dried, wrinkled and shriveled ones? Lips have very little natural protection thus are subjected to merciless UV/UVA rays and have no pores to absorb any goodies. So extra care must be taken there. Just look at your grandma's lips and you will know why.<br><br>Therefore, you must know your skin type. I have in my possession some questionaires to determine your type.  Once your skin type is ascertain, then we can talk about products.<br><br>One word of caution. Products that you can normally buy off the neighbourhood shelves are for general use and are made affordable therefore efficacy may not be that potent. If you intend to use those, use this simple guideline.<br><br>1) If no noticeable improvement within a month or two, change.<br><br>2) If itchiness, redness or dryness occurs. Stop immediately. You are allergic to it. May lead to permanent damage.<br><br>3) Too oily for you or too fragrant, avoid.<br><br>The philosophy of today's skincare industry is  preventive care. If you wait until wrinkles, liver spots or scarring occurs, much less can be done and specialist products and care may be very prohibitive for most people.<br><br><img src="http://www.nuskin.com/sg/images/products/tips1.jpg"> <img src="http://www.thai.net/nkfav/iconp7.jpg"><br></div>
