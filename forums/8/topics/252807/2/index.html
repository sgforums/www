Christian children go to Sunday schools and that is like English "tuition" or "extra classes".<br>2. Christianity was brought to Singapore by the British and so, mostly conducted in English and Singapore schools happen to be English schools - giving them an advantage (proficiency in the language). (I think most Christian students are poor in Chinese or average in Chinese, sort of proving that it is not super-natural.<br>3. Christian parents are educated (due to reasons above) and because the children have educated Children, their children benefited. If you look at children from non Christian homes but with highly educated parents, the children will do well or better than average. (again - nothing super-natural)<br>4. Christians are quite logical people but their "logic" is skewed, so that you will not find many cutting edge scientists or philosophers among Christians. To be able to do cutting edge science and philosophy, your logic must not be "skewed". You have to be absolutely crystal clear in your thinking.<br><br>Christians believe based on skewed logic but it is still based on some sort of logic, whereas many non-Christian religious beliefs are not based on "logic". They are pure beliefs.<br><br>Therefore, among believers, Christians have an advantage but among purely, highly "logical" people, Christians have a disadvantage because they are "tied" into their system of beliefs and are therefore restricted or if you want to use an offensive word, "delusional" in many areas.</span></div></blockquote>1. Sunday school is taught in Mandarin in some places.<br><br>2. Reasonable.<br><br>There are billingual mission schools. Maris Stella High and Catholic High were run by Marist Brothers from China. St Nicholas' Girls' school also has superb billlingualism.<br><br>But you're right, most Christians can't speak Mandarin for nuts.<br><br>3. Reasonable.<br><br>4. St Thomas Aquinas was a great philosopher. Then we have; Galileo, Pascal, Leonardo da Vinci, Michaelangelo, St Albert the Great ; who are all great scientists and thinkers.<br><br>How then is Christian logic skewed simply because there is a belief system?
