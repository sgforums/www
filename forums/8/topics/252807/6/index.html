            <div class='col-md body'>Hey I have a question for christians, erm.. just something out of curiousity, and not to start any flame war.<br><br>The Bible is amended over time right? Who are those who write the new amendments? The Pope? That means if that someone got a "revelation from God" , he/she will add it to the book?<br><br>According to what I know, 2 Timothy 3:16 states that Â“All scripture is inspired by GodÂ….Â” and 2 Peter 1:20-21, Peter reminds the reader to Â“know this first of all, that no prophecy of scripture is a matter of oneÂ’s own interpretation, Â… but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.Â” Is that supposed to be interpreted that God itself is the author of this book?<br><br>How true and accurate can men be in their interpretation of their revelation from God? Joan of Ark, some historians are still thinking if the revelation was true at all.<br><br>I've read many articles that says the revelation often comes in dreams, is that true? If that is true, how do we know if that is actually a revelation from God and not some normal dream?</div>
