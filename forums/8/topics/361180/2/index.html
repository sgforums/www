              <p>Vir,</p>
              <p>Singapore uses the MIRACLE filters. All impurities will be filtered out.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, we tend to fail our chemistry classes at school.. So yeah... we believe the recycled water is clean.</p>
              <p>Although I've posted before that the only way to get impurities free water is through distillation. But I got shoot down by many for being unpatriotic.</p>
              <p>So yeah..... best just let the people believe what they wanna believe ya ?</p>

              <p>You can always try to sell your pristine water touting all the good stuff.. But as long as it's more expensive than the tap waters which are good for washing clothes and dishes.. there's really only the bottled potable water market for you.</p>
              <p>We don't need human hormones free water for our plants or to wash the streets if it's gonna cost more.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you can set up a BULK NZ water container with a tap attached in Orchard road and sell it as potable water.. instead of bottles, you use cups. Defeats the purpose ain't it ?</p>
              <p>So unless you can figure out ways to make and transport  your water cheaper than our tap water.. your pristine bulk water.. has no market in Singapore.</p>
