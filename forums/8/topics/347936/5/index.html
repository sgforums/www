              <p>yeah, that Movement and Dance thing sounds something like ELDDs, drama club kind of thing. used to join those too, and the teacher heck-care.</p>
              <p>you should find a CCA whereby the teacher is heck-care and slack type, then don't show up. compared to NCC, yes, NCC may be stricter in attendance due to it's regimental nature.</p>
              <p>also, not sure why u got into NCC in first place, but if you really get into NCC and get high rank, then you'll suffer during NS, because people with NCC as CCA in sec school tend to up in combat units, meaning you have to stay in 5.5 days per week, book out sat morning and book in sun night. sux rite?</p>
              <p>and don't worry lah, a lot of schools always have fierce teachers who threaten all kinds of this and that, but they won't carry it out.</p>
              <p>besides, if anything, if they punish you, then just blow up the matter and tell them they've no right to force you into CCAs you've no interest in.</p>

              <p>even if you die die don't go CCA, the teacher at most pissed off mah, no big deal.</p>
              <p>if they want to play hard-ball, then get your parents to meet them head on, and tell the teachers that you can't enter the CCA you want, because they are full already.</p>
              <p>and also, tell them that the CCA you want to join is full because the teacher in-charge only selects and accepts those kids who have won competition before. btw, that's how CCAs in every school is like and it's a very crappy unfair system. the teachers, after hearing that, will malu malu.</p>
              <p>and that M&amp;D is something like those ELDDS, CLDDS and MLDDS last time in the 90s.</p>
              <p>ELDDS = English Literature Drama and Dance Society</p>
              <p>MLDDS = Malay Literature Drama and Dance Society</p>
              <p>CLDDS = Chinese Literature Drama and Dance Society</p>
              <p>basically, what you do is to act out on stage during events, and i find it to be very satisfying and fun, trust me. Lots of chicks too, and the guys in such clubs usually are ah-gua types, so if you're a man, then you should have no problem getting the girls there. of course, girls in such clubs usually nerdy and goody types, but will have many pretty ones too. :-D</p>
              <p>you should really cherish the chance to be in M&amp;D.</p>
              <p>more pros than cons compared to NCC. besides, NCC a lot of ah-bengs and those macho-manly types who love to act alpha-male, which i really cannot tahan.</p>

              <p>eh bluedark: what do you like to do in your free time? play computer games? soccer? you like to play guitar? or go outdoors and climb trees?</p>
              <p>from your hobby, you can see what you like and from there see which CCA suits you best.</p>
              <p>no such thing as CCA full one, only short of intakes. why would a CCA not want to have more recruits/intake? eg. dragon year babies, a huge influx of sec1 come in, they will have to cope no matter what. they know will have some quit, some change CCAs one. if a CCA short of recruits for a long time, then they have to close that CCA fyi. and if you NCC not getting alot of awards, forget it, waste of time, in a dif school with same CCA and time, you can be getting gold and awards for the school, unit and most impt yourself.</p>
