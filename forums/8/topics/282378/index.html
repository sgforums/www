            <div class='col-md body'>hmm.. when the media reports on the shooting of the monks came in, i was a little skeptical. No doubt shots were fired and people died. However, anyone can easily shave their heads and don a robe. Are the dead monks really monks? or are they imposters who simply want to inflame the situation and illicit more hatred from the populace since monks are highly respected in the country.<br><br>My advice is..we shouldnt so easily trust the news media reports i.e. jz trust what our eyes see. Its also important to be critical and cynical. It kinda irks me to see how readily and naive the tertiary students in SG or general public join in the bandwagon to protest against the violence against the monks. Until. there are evidence to suggest the dead monks are really monks and not some imposters, i believe this event could be instigated by some sinister force in the country with a purpose to bring down the military junta.<br><br>Hmm, sure i agree that the Military junta shd be removed; but if the means is through deception i.e. posing as monks and deliberately get themselves shot to raise public anger and sympathy?? then.. are you sure when the junta is gone, the incoming government will then be clean with impeccable integrity and honor? NO!..</div>

NO!</blockquote>even if it's really really really thru deception, it's at least better than nothing.<br>at least burmese got action and they wanna save themselves.<br>what's wrong with fighting for your freedom?<br><br>this myanmar episode has made me learnt a lot of new things about politics and politicians: they're all words and no-action.<br><br>across the world, all the politicians, even our divine flawless SG government, can ever do....is to come up with super-fanciful words of condemnation, such as "we will not tolerate such a REPULSIVE regime", "abhorrent act", "we strongly urge..."<br><br>i always wonder why politicians don't change careers and be literature teachers instead since their use of words are better than our english teachers.<br><br>the people of myanmar are waiting for foreign help to save them.<br>judging from the looks of things, it's impossible for them to topple the government or rebel since they don't even have access to ammo to begin with.<br><br>their government is an absolute one.<br>in the case on indonesia / phillippines / eastern europe governments, their troops don't shoot at their own people even when the latter rebels, but in myanmar, they don't ****ing care who you're.<br>that's why the governments above can be toppled by their own people but not in the case of myanmar.<br><br>japanese, korean, whatever, the very moment they think u wanna rebel, you die.</div>
