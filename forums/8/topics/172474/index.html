            <div class='col-md body'>Red roses were her favourites, her name was also Rose. And every year, her husband sent them, tied with pretty bows. The year he passed away, the roses were delivered to her door. The card said, "Be My Valentine," like all the years before.<br><br>Each year he sent her roses, the notes would always say, "I love you even more this year than last year on this day." "My love for you will always grow with each passing year." The year he passed away, she knew it was the last time that the roses would appear on her front door.<br><br>She thought he ordered the roses in advance before this day. Her loving husband did not know that he would die. He always liked to do things early, way before the time. In this way, if he was too busy, everything would still work out fine.<br><br>She trimmed the stems, and placed them in a very special vase. Then she sat the vase beside the photograph of his smiling face. She would sit for hours, in her husband's favourite chair while staring at his photograph and the roses sitting there.<br><br>A year went by and it was difficult to live without her mate. With loneliness and solitude that has become her fate. Then, at that same very hour, as on Valentines before, the doorbell rang and there were red roses sitting by her door.<br><br>She brought the roses in and then just looked at them in shock. Then, she went to get the telephone and called the florist that had delivered the roses. The owner answered and she asked him if he would explain why someone would do this to her, causing her so much pain?<br><br>"I know your husband passed away more than a year ago," the owner said. "I knew you'd call and you would want to know," he continued. "The flowers you received today, were paid for in advance. Your husband always planned ahead, he left nothing to chance."<br><br>"The re is a standing order that I have on file down here. And he has paid, well in advance, so you'll get them every year. There is also another thing that I think you should know. He wrote a special little card which he did several years ago."<br><br>"Then should ever I find out that he is no longer around, that's the card that should be sent to you the following year." She thanked him and hung up the phone, her tears now flowing hard. Her fingers shaking, as she slowly reached to get the card.<br><br>Inside the card, she saw that he had written her a note. As she stared in total silence, this was what he wrote...<br><br>"Hello my love, I know it's been a year since I've been gone. I hope it hasn't been too hard for you to overcome. I know it must be lonely and the pain is very real. For if it was the other way, I know how I would feel. The love we shared made everything so beautiful in life. I loved you more than words can say. You were the perfect wife and the perfect companion."<br><br>" You were my friend and lover. You fulfilled my every need. I know it's only been a year, but please try not to grieve. I want you to be happy, even when you shed your tears. That is why these red roses will be sent to you for years."<br><br>"When you get these roses, think of all the happiness that we had together and how both of us were blessed to have each other. I have always loved you and I know I always will. But, my love, you must go on, you have some living still."<br><br>"Plea se, try to find happiness while living out your days. I know it's not easy, but I hope you find some ways. I know you will. You have always been there to cheer me up. The roses will come every year and they will only stop when your door's not answered, when the florist stops to deliver and knock on the door."<br><br>"He will come five times that day, in case you should be out. But after his last visit, he will know without a doubt, to take the roses to the place, where I've instructed him and place the roses where we are, together once again."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
