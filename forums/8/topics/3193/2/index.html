            <div class='col-md body'>3 years NS? Who in the hell said that? Our dear Senior Minister? Our Primer? Or our boss? - The Defence Minister? For goodness sake, all these 3 years stuff are just a whole lotta bullsh**. Unless they've out in print in ST, it will always be a rumour. These 3 years NS started way back in about '95 and it has nearly been 4 years since the news started.<br><br>Anyway, I do think it would be a good idea if gals were to serve NS too. Maybe not as combat specs but probably Support and Logistics Units. This would let em understand the sufferings all us guys went through during these 2 years!<br><br>Gals would always whine and complain that their steads didn't have time to accompany them, let them serve NS and see what happens! 3/4 of them will be dead by the time the first week of BMT is over...

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm...well liny, i gtta say this...night trainings arnt usually spent out of camp in jungles, training on defensive nor offensive maneouvres...like if u go thru ns u will realise that night trainings could just be extra physical trainings, and extra tekaning, and in some stay-in units, its "own time, own target" after 5, or dinner, which means its such a dumb thing for SAF to make pple stay to do nothing that cant be done in the day, plus pay for their food and lodging...if we spend more on transport due to journeys btw camp and home, we would inject more money back into the economy!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>8 to 5 doesnt mean 8 to 5 ALL the way...maybe have some overnite field camp trainings at regular intervals, so we have effective fighting at night too...u mean to say you train to fight at night almost evrynite in combat maneouvers? Also, maybe they could make it 8 to 5 after a year or so if some dont agree with this...cos some units DO practice this...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1stly, I am one who already served my 2 1/2 yrs NS in an active combat unit. I agree tt 3 yrs is a pretty long time for NS. This is especially so bcoz its very usual for infantry units to spend/waste their last 1/2 yr away doing nothing much after ATEC2 ( a sort of assesment excercise). However, I did not get to enjoy this lobo period like many of my counterparts bcoz our unit's ATEC2 ( Excercise starlite in Taiwan was just b4 our ORD time)<br>However, I should say tt serving NS, though takes a huge amt of our time away is not totally wasted. It really builds up ur strength mentally and physically. From my own experience, training excercises brought me further than I ever thought I could ever go b4 NS and my ability to endure had no doubt risen to another level. So, for those guys who r bout to enter NS...... take it positively. Well, u will meet some really Xialan Instructors and PTIs during BMT......just do ur part and dun blif too much in them.<br>hmmm......there r units who pratice 8-5 after a yr? I would like to know wh units they r. Can u enligten on this pls JCBOY? I wonder how this is possible bcoz my unit used to hv a lot of night trianing bcoz our combat units usually practices Dawn and Dusk attacks. Tt is  even after being active for a yr. Anyway, for an active combat unit, U might like to go hm everyday in the beginning...... but after some time......u will realise some ppl dun even wanna go for nights off. Its quite tiring travelling to and fro the camp if ur hse is not exactly near.<br>In some mths, u will find urself constantly in the field. While in some, u find urself doing nothing much in camp......perhpas these r the mths where 8-5 should be granted but definitely not for prolong periods bcoz sometimes at nite, commanders might need the men to do some preparations for training and the days might already hv been used for something else. Those who hv served their NS in an active combat unit should know tt when we were busy...... we were really very busy and when there r no excercises...... its damn lobo......no choice tts how the army works coz all the units hv to share the limited training space and facilities.<br>Perhaps its easy for me to say......but u will really find time passing very fast. One moment u r in NS and the next, u r clearing leaves waiting for ORD...... I'm sure Ns will definitely bring back some good memories for those who already ORD.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Another frd in HQ 4 SAB tells me the same thing...8 to 5, and sometimes just laze arnd...during working hrs...Provost units...i was there for a while and was told that after abt one yr they get to stay out even!! 5 SIR, they have auto nights off evrynite once they become operationally active...these are all that i know of at present...but probably others exist...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Train physically one cannot do on one's one free time if one is stay-out izzit...or even during 8 to 5?? mentally?

            <div class='col-md body'>lol~ no i do not love NS but I still had to go thru it (If i love NS i would hv signed on like u said)~ my point is...... theres no point complaining~ If one wants to keng.....its really not too difficult...... this is at least so for me and i'm sure many share this view. JCBOY, as u hv mentioned ......8-5 applies to the HQ units...... SIR units gets only nitesoff bcoz 8-5 is really not feasible. Wat good r nitesoff when u r only off for a few hrs? Sometimes u really get sick of nitesoffs and i'm sure most units hv lots of nitesoffs after operational for a yr.<br><br>Though as a platoon sergeant, I get to stay out as late as i want most of the time, as long as i get back to camp b4 the next day starts......I rather not go hm bcoz there r so many things to take care off during peak periods. Even most of the men got quite sick of nitesoffs after some time.<br><br>Actually I would like to know wat unit u r from, wats ur vocation and hows the system like in ur unit since u got so much to complain about.<br><br>About the physical part...... I think most of us must face it......without NS ......how many would actually bother to go train overselves up as much as we do during NS? How many can in their life run a 1/2 marathon and smile after tt? During our 1st reservist IPPT, so many ppl were struggling to pass. For those who were in Infantry, (Including Guards and Comandos)they will understand what i meant by 'go further than u would expect urself to' How many of us would actually go climb all the damn hills and mountains if not for NS? How many would walk from the nite to the morning to conquer an objective just to find ourselves setting out for another and another and another at a few hrs interval? U go on and on and doesnt fall out so as not to be a burden to ur platoon mates. This is the physical endurance i am tokin about.<br><br>BMT is really nothing much compared to the unit......just tt u r lead by a bunch of instructors who r mostly the worst of their lot in SISPEC and OCS with many 'show-offs' among them (sorry to offend anybody by saying this, of coz its not alwayz the case) Wat type of mental endurance do u gain in BMT? Its just to get u accustomed to regimental lifestyle and develope some discipline. U r only responsible for very few things. Furthermore, as a new recruit, the benefit of doubt is mostly given to u when something goes wrong and u dun get much pressure.<br><br>To think positively...... these r really the 2 most valuable things u gain in NS and of coz the pals who go thru thick and thin with u. The ppl who really waste their NS away r those in 8-5 vocations and yet do nothing in their free time. I would suggest they go take up some courses during their free time<br><br>I can understand ur reaction JCBOY......this is very common in most ppl serving NS. Its not like I never grumble b4 but wats the point? Until u can set aside all ur pride and keng for a downgrade...... theres really no point being envious of those in 8-5 vocations. If u really wanna keng, keng all the way......keep goin for specialist appointments. Sooner or later u will be downgraded but the ultimate question is......can u set aside all ur pride??? Well, dunno bout u but i cant.<br><br>All the best in ur NS life though~  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>looks like Fallacy and i r on the same frequency.. JC boy, maybe i can enlighten u a bit on that fallacious part on the 8-5 for HQ 4 SAB guys as I am from Armour. ( Once Armour, Always Armour)HQ 4 SAB is the SSOHQ for two Armour units)hence the guys in HQ 4 SAB get 8-5 vocations by default. But do u know that the guys down at HQ 4 SAB do not knock off at 5? *grin*<br><br>Though it is true that nite trgs r not conducted every nite.. Staying in will sort of discourage pple from cheonging until unearthly hours when they book out after 5. when pple dun get sufficient sleep, u think they can put in their best and get realistic trgs? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Provost units by their nature of vocations do not call the need for staying in much. One more point, when the button is reali pressed, and when the SAF needs to send in additional forces other than the units on standby, it will be easier to alert another 'stay in' operational unit. as u can see apparently, time is usually taken up in drawing ammo... who will b there to draw the ammo when there is no one in the unit? smooth drawing of ammo can be done when there is not much manpower in camp?( drawing of ammo is a super tedious job especially when u r dealing wif the big calibre ammo).<br><br>i would oso like to get to know which unit u were from previously and take this opportunity to pre-empt my friends who r going for their NS real soon. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Cheerios.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Whoa...lotsa responses...ok 1st of all i wnna say i do NOT yet have a unit(yeah crazy that i'm complaining so much aint it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">)...<br><br>and almost evrything i've said does not come from my own mouth but is agreed upon by others...basically i DID enter NS with very very negative attitude especially since something very very very very bad happened to a friend of mine...suffice to say, there's no turning back for him...<br><br>However, during BMT i just learnt how to grin and bear it...yeah i agree that once u go for infantry type-units you do a lot more, i respect those who went thru it cos my vocation now is a service kind, though its stay in and i am combat fit, gtta do SOC and ippt, still its physically less strenuous than yr units...ya i had a positive attitude in me inoculated by my officers at that time, that is why i know that army IS essential, and that we HAVE to serve...my problem lies in allowing us some kind of stay-out...i really dont mind chionging arnd the place, knowing that at the end of my training phase, there's the feeling of warmth i get when heading home to my family...PLUS, i get to do other things like yeah...self-study and courses...frankly i can rem much abt my studies in JC anymore...i just wanted to state my opinions and listen to what other shave to say abt it all...like i said, no offense meant to anyone, i respect those roughing it out...<br><br>Thing is, army normally keeps one too busy to think abt such things...my frds and i had changed a lot in NS, and only because they got service vocations after BMT that they reverted back to 'emselves...a 3SG frd of mine only reverted back to his old fun-loving self after gradutating from SISPEC for some weeks...i DIDNT at all enjoy the company of his "new army self"...<br><br>Once more i state that while i support SAF, i really feel that maybe they could change it a little more, after all they're changing it alot alrdy...whats wrong with giving us a little freedom to look forward to at the end of the day?? and yeah while you guys are at it, gimme yr opinions why more highly educated pple have to serve more...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Regarding y more highly-educated ppl serve longer. The very basic thing is bcoz they r the ones to be given commander positions and lead the less-educated and therefore needs to go thru more training.(Eg.Sispec/OCS) Surely u dun like to be led by less-educated ppl do u (Unless they r very experienced of coz)? Though  not all more highly-educated ppl r given commanding positions but the ARMY has to be fair rite?

            <div class='col-md body'>wah...i really hate to try to get the last say in, but "fishbone stuck in throat, dont say will choke.." so what if u're a "commander" as defined by you as in sispec and ocs grads...as a CPL u alrdy serve extra and you're a man, going by yr theory of letting commanders serve longer, CPLs shouldnt extend service...plus i dont really see why commanders have to extend service in the 1st place..arnt we all NSFs??<br><br>Going by rank to extend ord..doesnt this mean officers should have even later ORD dates than Specs?...pls enlighten me...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>references : SAF and 30 years of National Service( Mickey Chiang), and my personal experience.<br><br>it is ubiquitous that NSFs nowadays complain that the present SAF officers are nothing but wayang.. do allow me to elaborate on  this and at the same time regaining confidence of the NSFs to b. The blacksheep officers often work for rewards during their cadets' days in the hope of achieving the SOH ( Sword of Honour) and SOM ( Sword of Merit).<br><br>well, i've seen it all. one of my friend who managed to clinch the SOM was badly evaluated during the overseas ATEC in 1998. him and his Tank crew was declared casualty when he had not even identified the enemies... ( simplest drill for any Tank Commanders) also got wind that he's a plague among his platoon now. to compound this whole thing, he's a Regular.*sigh* he would often siam all the mistakes that he had committed, letting his PS to b the scapegoat.. sad to say, he's not ready to serve for the sake of a greater good : his comrades, his men and his country.<br><br>as to the query posted by JCboy, the additional 1/2 year of service is applicable to CPL and above, rite? y is this so? this is becoz soldiers who have attained the rank of CPL are of at least Tertiary education , they are the brain pillar of the SAF. fighting skills is often not sufficient for modern warfare, it must b complemented by meticulous planning, often done by the Commanders.<br><br>even NSFs of Tertiary education who did not make it to the Commanders cohort, after their battalion goes on "lau", they take up appointments of auxillary instructors in trg schools as they are deemed to b more capable in picking up new things.<br><br>officers do not ORD later than their NSFs counterparts. but, they will be called up more often during their 13 yrs reservists trg cycle i.e. more trgs than other ranks.<br><br>to extend the NSFs liability by another 1/2 years(if it is reali true), come to think of it, it will b a great expenditure incurred by the gov. u can do a simple calculation here.. this additional expenditure could have been put to other uses which may yield higher monetary returns. if the gov were to  extend the service by 1/2 years, they have a rationale for doing so, and this will have to b debated thru the paliarment with a new bill being passed..<br><br>umm.. hope this clears the air. *grin*<br><br>------------------<br>who else but me......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1st i would like to say again tt I was from an active combat unit so watever i say applies to especially to the situations of a combat unit.<br><br>commanders (section commanders, platoon sergeants, PCs) needs to serve longer bcoz they hv to be trained 1st to lead b4 goin to the units. They r the ppl who trained the men  when they enter the units together. Without being trained 1st, how r they goin to do tt? Learn together with the men? Whos gonna train  everybody now? the regulars? and do u think the men will look up to their superiors as commanders when they r equally ignorant as the men?<br><br>As i said ....the ARMY has to be fair as in corporals also needs to serve 2 1/2 yrs. For if this is not the case, what would the sergeants and PCs think? the extra pay they get covers the extra 1/2 yr they serve? Definitely not. I think maybe we can start a topic: What do NSF PCs and Sergeants think bout letting their corporal counterparts serve 2 yrs of NS? Or maybe u can ask ur frens for their opinions. And i think finger has pointed out tt corporals r sumtimes given instructor roles when the units r in lull( For eg. when the rests of the men ORD b4 them) or even help out in the HQs. PCs already serve longer during their reservist and i think this more than justifies the quite significant extra sum of pay they get during NS.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hahahah...just wanted to say something abt "lull" today, but seems others have said what i've wanted to say, namely fingers and Fallacy...<br><br>Fallacy, i must say that yr argument on the commanders having to train to be of use in the platoons they go to sounds real solid initially...but after further dissection, i think there's a (no pun intended really!) fallacy? in yr statement...<br><br>its like my Qn was why commanders should have to serve extra 1/2 yr cos its unfair to them...while you answered they have to undergo training in order to be of use and respect to the men, which is VERY TRUE...<br><br>you do not seem to add into the equation that "commanders" while training how to lead are in fact STILL serving NS, and on a even tougher scale than when they're in unit...<br><br>plus, sispec training is abt 1/2 yr for advanced section leader course...BUT ocs is abt 9 mths...so going by yr apparent training doesnt really count toward nsf liability, officers should serve 3 mths more, but this aint the case...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>i aint trying to attack you personally here, its just my way of discussing a topic and i'm interested in what you have to say to this...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm...got wat u said...my maths really ain't tt good but lets see.....if commanders were to serve 2 yrs NS......by the end of their training (SISPEC/OCS) they will be left with 1 1/4yrs and 1 yrs liability respectively while the men still hv 1 3/4yr left. They would not hv enuff time to finish one tour in a unit with the men. Perhaps u might say tt the next batch of commanders can alwayz take over...but try to calculate...going at this rate...after some time...wouldnt there be a shortage of commanders?<br><br>PCs yes very true do train few mths more than<br>Sergeants but as u can see the difference it makes is really not tt great,if the ARMY were to increase the NS liability of PCs and who would wanna go for OCS? Me wonders......  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
