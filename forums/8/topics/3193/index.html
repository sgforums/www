Memories of my BMT will never be forgotten man...<br>Oh, some tips for those seeking to downgrade, try to get a specialist letter, must be a strong one, else u may juz end up getting a temporary PES status, which, IMHO, is only good for NS, but in the long term, what about your reservist ???<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NS is fun??<br>forgive me when i say this...u must be CRAZY!!<br><br>NS, while serving yr country, is a REAL waste of time in the sense that there are so much more other things one can do, and instead leave the damn infantry grdwork for the regulars!! doncha agree fellow NSFs!??!??<br><br>Dont get me wrong, i understand the need for our country to depend on its own citizens to protect itself, yeah but as an a-lvl grad, i feel it is REALLY UNFAIR!! alrdy to make us serve extra 1/2 yr just becos we are more educated...frankly, its not as if we dint have to study hard to reach our educational standards, and u say the state subsidises our education, why dont i say DONT subsidise for me, i pay full sum and sevre less 1/2 yr HUH?? DURH....well, then what abt pple who study abroad all their lives till NS, and enlist as a foreign Uni-Grad...still must serve extra AH???<br><br>I aint anti govt, but it would really be more fair if we all serve abt the same amt, even if they feel we should really serve extra...make it lesser like 3 months max...believe me its enough of a torture as even if it will only be 3 months...like that, some of us who enlist later can ORD b4 our uni term...like "Chief" whom since he april i think wil have this problem...<br><br>OK they claim that we should all learn to defend our country in one way or another, i agree fully, but WHY!!, WHY!! must they make us stay-in?? lemme say this: even if they gimme reasonably tough training i WONT mind as much if i can get home by the end of the day; that is 8 to 5 training...maybe they want us to appreciate our family more, but i say 3 mths of BMT alrdy made me realise that...i suppose same for all the rest of you guys...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Eh JC Boy, since ur an A level grad(or gonna be like me....I HOPE), and since u think 3 yrs would waste urtime, why don't u make it worth yourtime by trying to get into OCS?<br><br>then at least you'll come out an officer, and 3 years would  seem kinda worth it. Actually 2.5 coz they haven't confirmed anything yet.<br><br>I know that'swhat I'm gonna do.<br><br>------------------<br><br>-------------------------<br>If ya got a STD and your dick drops off what the fuck ya gonna do?

            <div class='col-md body'>to have a 8-5 trgs? that sounds weird.. how about the night trgs? if we were to forgo night trgs, does that means that when night falls during war, we'll tell the enemies to stop fighting since SAF is not trained to fight at night???<br><br>i agree wif what Zippo says, since NS is mandatory, y not optimize ur time for ns and strive to b one of the best and contribute more to the ctry?<br><br>wat jasonnex said is reali true, once u have fitted into the groove, u cannot live wifout it. juz take NS as a learning experience. believe it or not u'll b surprised at how gals r impressed by guys who have went thru NS becoz these guys have become more independent and mature. *hope no one has started to throw tomatoes and eggs*<br><br>if u guys were to complain that NS is super lobo and do nothing but sleep.. well, it all depends on ur unit's S3. a good S3 will have the trg programs well planned, and not come up wif trg programs for Zzzzz... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>to guys going for NS real soon, juz remember that SAF stands for Serve and Forget....<br><br>Cheerio.</div>
