              <p><br>teenagers like me like only america, jap and british fashions and pop songs, or even hk, taiwan and korea, so to speak, but to be like them is a total different issue. And Dun take teenagers as a point of arguement here, cos we our mind are not settle and change all the times, we tend to idolise things and people that are famous, but i believe as adults like you, your thinking will be different, you will be more patriotic to your own identity. You yourself must hv been thru teenager life before ya, so at the point of time, what was in your mind?? i guess you also idolise movie star and singer and all those fashionable stuffs of your time.</p>

              <p>I know what you mean, but dont be so quick to dismiss what it means "to be like them". Its often part of the subconscious. Teengers want to speak like them, dress like them, style their hair like them, watch their shows, listen to their music. And it inevitably creeps into the psyche. And this phenomenon only exists with first world/ dominant cultures (eg. Jap/US). Therefore China will start to exhibit such qualities in time.

              <p>Teenagers idolising new trendy stuffs, beauti and fashion is normal, but it does not said that we want to be in their shoes such as their culturea, their way of lifes. If Nike got new lady's shoes, i go for it, but that does not mean I am americanised. If a popular young US or taiwan singer come here to perform, i will try to get the ticket, but does not mean I like USA or Taiwan and take on their culture.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But i believe that as we grow up, our hormone change, as adult I have no doubt you have your own style, character and decision to make. No more living in naive state like we teenagers do, where everything is good and fine and carefree.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And if china is to one day become an icon for teenagers to follow, it still belong to the entertaining icon but never the culture. As young singaporeans, we know that there is no better place than a place we call it home. I can listen to Justin Timberlake, my idol, WangLeeHong, my idol and secret admirer, I can wear Nike, polo Ralp, E spirit, Mango, CK fashions. But i still identify myself as Singapore even if I am driving a Cherry Car that is made in China.</p>

              <p>I'm glad to hear your explanation of your viewpoint. But you seem to distance music, fashion, and lifestyle preferences from culture. I'd say that this distinction isnt really qualified.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"it still belong to the entertaining icon but never the culture"</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You seem to be suggesting that we like their culture, but we dont take it on ? That assumes that we have our own unique culture, which defines us, and we occasionally subscribe to foreign influences.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The problem with that is, what then is our culture. We dont take on their culture, then what is our culture ? When you are not wearing the Nike shoes, the westerns/jap/taiwanese style clothes, listening to foreign music, what are the alternatives ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you have indigeneous singaporean clothing to wear ? a sarong perhaps ? traditional music ? I wouldnt think so. In that case, almost all the culture we have, and live with, is foreign !</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like i said, its mostly subconscious. Just like propaganda. You wont know that you're brainwashed. Eg. You think that the Straits Times is reliable, accurate, so much better than all those crazy malaysian/whatever newspapers. But do you know how state controlled our press is ? That everything you see and hear is decided by the government ?</p>

              <p>From the Economic point of view, due to the low cost of hiring these foreign workers (not just China), it will make Singapore goods more competitive in the global market. If everything is done by locals by Singapore high wage policies, chances are high we are going to lose out.</p>
              <p><br>So from the Economic point of view, its a good thing to have foreigners, afterall isn't the target to have 25% foreigners?</p>
              <p>Just from a typical Singaporean POV... some of them are nice people, not all. Those I met in the food sector (ie they prepare the food) are nice people, but I can't really say for the service sectors. (not that kind of sectors,<em> lah</em>!)</p>

              <p><br>From economic point of view, your stand that they make SG goods more competitive is debatable. Although it is without doubt that they lower the cost of production, thereby lowering the prices of goods, resulting in export competitiveness, but the quality of goods <em>might</em> go down.  </p>

              <p>I'm glad to hear your explanation of your viewpoint. But you seem to distance music, fashion, and lifestyle preferences from culture. I'd say that this distinction isnt really qualified.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"but it does not said that we want to be in their shoes such as their culturea, their way of lifes"</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"but does not mean I like USA or Taiwan and take on their culture."</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"it still belong to the entertaining icon but never the culture"</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You seem to be suggesting that we like their culture, but we dont take it on ? That assumes that we have our own unique culture, which defines us, and we occasionally subscribe to foreign influences.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The problem with that is, what then is our culture. We dont take on their culture, then what is our culture ? When you are not wearing the Nike shoes, the westerns/jap/taiwanese style clothes, listening to foreign music, what are the alternatives ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you have indigeneous singaporean clothing to wear ? a sarong perhaps ? traditional music ? I wouldnt think so. In that case, almost all the culture we have, and live with, is foreign !</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like i said, its mostly subconscious. Just like propaganda. You wont know that you're brainwashed. Eg. You think that the Straits Times is reliable, accurate, so much better than all those crazy malaysian/whatever newspapers. But do you know how state controlled our press is ? That everything you see and hear is decided by the government ?</p>

              <p>Most of our textbooks and studies are base on foreign authord and writers, so as our goods and products here, but that does not mean we absorb their culture and forgo our nationalities. Do you think the govt wish us to get culturally influence/brainwash by foreigners? To be like them with a freedom of speech and all those riots and free to protest?? I dun think so. If they allow that, they are doom, that is why they instill a total control from young, PAP kindergarden to govt school and to army for guys.

As a natural resourceless country,we must adopted an open economy inorder to bring in wealths and jobs, therefore the explode of informations and cultures sprout like no one business, it is skeptical that some youths may go to the extreme of following trendy stuff like piercing and tatooing, but no one is yet to take a gun and shoot freely as USA do.</p>

              <p>Tho i am not eligible to vote, but i understand that the relevant party get the higher vote wins and be the govt, it like an endorsement from the peoples of the country that allow them to be the govt.

The freedom to protest, the freedom of speech, is the inherent right of every human being. If a government that allows that is doomed, its an incompetant government. The PAP wants you to think that freedoms lead to degeneration, and it looks like they succeeded. Can you imagine what else you hold as TRUTH, is actually conjured by your beloved government ?</span></p>

You think that is 'seeing the world' ? Want to give it a try ? You find the pro-Al Qaeda website, find the pro-islamic extremism websites.
