              <p>Let me recall an incident.</p>
              <p>In my uni, one of my lab technologist is a Malay lady. She mentioned that while she was having lunch with another Singaporean Chinese professor at engineering canteen, a large bunch of PRCs students were chatting loudly at the next table.</p>
              <p>They were laughing at how stupid Singapore government is. Give them scholarships and money to let them spend. Even China government wont be so nice to its own citizens. Also, they derogated Singaporeans in condescending tone. While they were disparaging about Singapore government and Singaporeans alike, they have no qualm about whether if there are any Singaporeans around. They just happily continued with their Singapore bashing.</p>
              <p>This is just one of the many incidents one may encounter local universities where we have significant portions of foreign students.</p>

              <p>Exactly. You don't see poor village's children getting proper education. Yet Singapore is being so "generous" to "import" its China talent. Come on, does talent only has to come from China ?!</p>

              <p>Let me recall an incident.</p>
              <p>In my uni, one of my lab technologist is a Malay lady. She mentioned that while she was having lunch with another Singaporean Chinese professor at engineering canteen, a large bunch of PRCs students were chatting loudly at the next table.</p>
              <p>They were laughing at how stupid Singapore government is. Give them scholarships and money to let them spend. Even China government wont be so nice to its own citizens. Also, they derogated Singaporeans in condescending tone. While they were disparaging about Singapore government and Singaporeans alike, they have no qualm about whether if there are any Singaporeans around. They just happily continued with their Singapore bashing.</p>
              <p>This is just one of the many incidents one may encounter local universities where we have significant portions of foreign students.</p>

              <p>Good, somebody could have recorded it and send to PAP.    Now we can have a good laugh at PAP, ha ha ha.</p>

              <p>They are not very smart actually. It is easy to thrash most of them, and I have done it many times.</p>
              <p>In addition, in most companies offering local scholarships, it already makes business sense to sponsor a singaporean in local studies for 4 years and bond him for 4 years. It would make even more business sense to our business minded government to bond these scholars for 6 years for a 4 years of studies and 3 plane tickets (1 to come over to study, 1 to go back after study, and 1 back here to start work). This is excluding those that start here from secondary schools though...</p>
              <p>Further business sense would be the government is actually spending directly into the economy. Most these funds to the students are almost directly spent back into the Singapore economy.</p>
              <p>And again, because many of these students are about 1 year older than average Singaporean girls (1 year younger than sg guys) when they just start uni, by the time they are free to go back to their country, they are already at least 30 years old.</p>
              <p>And again in the business sense, any contributions they made during their 6 years, in terms of research or patents, are all within Singapore. Good for the reputation of the economy as a whole.</p>
              <p>Overall, it makes business sense for the government to get these people here. However, in the social arena, the outlook definitely does not seem as rosy.</p>

              <p>I have to agree that they are extremely hardworking and competitive. I know of many PRC scholars who are now studying extremely hard in NUS (now is study week), while I'm still typing here in the forum -.-"</p>
