              <p>and no, I'm only insulting you. Not any one else.</p>

              <p>IF singapore is at war with Malaysia, do you think these prc will protect Singapore? Most of the PRC friends who i have known of could say that they could go back to China after their educational bond has ended. Where is this loyalty ? On the other hand, i couldn't blame them. China is really a nice place to live in now, lower standard of living, and it's big country, full of economical opportunities. Their roots are still there. Most of them are nationalist at heart. With the increasing resentment among singaporean, i just don't think the PRC could appreciate Singaporean more after coming across this thread.</p>
              <p>To be fair, some PRC are really nice people and they are one of the most hardworking and intelligent people i know of. They are also quite pitful as they are staying far away from their family.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, I do think that most of the third or fourth generation singaporean are quite complacent and love to enjoy, in relative comparision with the PRC. They are are hardworking, resourceful and knowledgable. We are more of a westernised generation where individualism rule. In addition we are quite politically apathetical.</p>
              <p>If singaporean has to be competitive, we leverage on some of government's policies but do not totally relay on them too.</p>

              <p>What the singapore government has done is fostering a competitive environment. It is either we continue to lament and suffer or seek to evolve, individually and socially as a whole. I agreed with your points.</p>

              <p>Japan:105</p>

              <p>Singapore:100</p>
              <p>UK:100</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In several cases, actual GDP did not correspond with that predicted by IQ. In these cases, the authors argued that differences in GDP were caused by differences in natural resources and whether the nation used a "planned" or "market" economy.</p>
              <p>One example of this was Qatar, whose IQ was estimated by Lynn and Vanhanen to be about 78, yet had a disproportionately high per capita GDP of roughly USD $17,000. The authors explain Qatar's disproportionately high GDP by its high petroleum resources. Similarly, the authors think that large resources of diamonds explain the economic growth of the African nation Botswana, the fastest in the world for several decades.</p>
              <p>The authors argued that the People's Republic of China's per capita GDP of roughly USD $4,500 could be explained by its use of a communist economic system for much of its recent history. The authors also predicted that communist nations who they believe have comparatively higher IQs, including the PRC, Vietnam, and North Korea, can be expected to gain GDP by moving from centrally-planned to market economic systems, while predicting continued poverty for African nations. Recent trends in the economy of the People's Republic of China and Vietnam seem to confirm this prediction, as China's GDP has grown rapidly since introducing market reforms. South Korea has a higher average IQ and a market economy. However, South Korea still has a lower GDP/Capita than many Western nations (but relatively high overal). Still, South Korea went from amongst the poorest nations in the world to advanced economy by recording among fastest growth rate in the world. Despite a supposedly higher average IQ and a market economy since the Meiji Restoration in 1867, Japan still has a lower GDP/Capita than many Western nations. Also, Sub-Saharan Africa is now having faster growth than Latin America and the Middle East, which seems to contradict the predictions.</p>
              <p>The two most striking exceptions, however, may be Ireland and the United States. Ireland, whose average I.Q. is listed at 93, has the fourth highest per capita GDP (PPP adjusted) of any country in the world (after tiny Luxembourg, Norway and the United States).[7][8] The United States, with an average I.Q. of 98, has the third-highest per capita GDP (PPP adjusted), and is by far the most populous of the richest 10 countries. Both of these countries have I.Q. averages considerably below those of countries such as South Korea, Taiwan, and Germany, but have per capita GDPs about 1.5 times higher.</p>
              <p>Kim Ung-Yong (born March 7, 1963) was a Korean child prodigy. He was able to read and write in Japanese, Korean, German, and English by his fourth birthday. At the age of four, on November 2, 1967, he solved complicated differential and integral calculus problems on Japanese television, demonstrated his proficiency in German, English, Japanese, and Korean, and composed poetry. Kim was listed in the Guiness Book of World Records under "Highest IQ"; the book estimated the boy's score at "over 200."</p>
              <p>Kim was a guest student of physics at Hanyang University from the age of three until he was six.[1]. At the age of seven he was invited to the United States by NASA.[1]. He finished his university studies, eventually getting a Ph.D. in physics at Colorado State University [1] before he was 15. In 1974, during his university studies, he began his research work at NASA[1] and continued this work until his return to Korea in 1978.</p>
              <p>When he returned to Korea, he decided to switch from physics to civil engineering and eventually received a doctorate in that field. Kim was offered the chance to study at the most prestigious universities in Korea, but instead chose to attend a provincial university.</p>
              <p>As of 2007 he also serves as adjunct faculty at Chungbuk National University.</p>

              <p>Seriously, though I do dislike this "foreign talent" from China &amp; India policy, we really cannot totally blame the government. The government is doing this not only for their economic interests, but it is to a certain extent, our own benefits as well. Without a pool of talent, like it or not, we will be less attractive to the big companies that provide us with jobs.</p>
              <p>What i'm really against is the infiltration of foreigners into our education system. These young people repeatedly take advantage of our system by using is as a "stepping stone to the bigger universities". If we are facing a shortage of university places, why are so many foreigners allowed into our universities?</p>
              <p>TO an extent, it is partly our fault too. Many Singaporeans simply refuse to reproduce even with the baby bonus schemes and all, thus, the replacement rate is not adequate to replace our population. If we really want the PRCs out of OUR SINGAPORE, we really have to increase our birth rates. But of course, the mechanics isn't right anymore. It would simply be too expensive to raise too many children in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Anyway, does anyone here realise that our population has grown quite rapidly? I feel that the country is gettin more crowded over the past year, so i checked on the total population. We've grown to 4.6 Million people in such a short period (with the import of foreigners to our shores). As much as I like to see diversity, it is disturbing that proportion of true Singaporeans are getting smaller and smaller.</p>
