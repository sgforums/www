                                      Maybe the British should get all them back to China, so we dont

I don't, I see myself as Singaporean first, being chinese, is just my ethnicity ... maybe it's an alien concept to you, you sound like you just got here from a homogenous society where they ALL speak in chinese ...are you implying that your loyalty to your "race" supersedes the loyalty you should pledge to your country ? .. well of course, if you come from say China, that loyalty is one and the same for both ? .... well hey, I got news for you again ...</p>

              <p>Thoughout my arguments, I did not neglect the importance of english, as. However I failed to see your understanding abt the current situation which is the fact that Singapore is lacking manpower in all its sectors. That's why we see many new PRCs here, admittedly,some are good, some are not. Language is just one of the problems caused by the immigration. Certainly you cant expect those PRCs can speak english as fluent as you, it takes generations to build up its linguistic ablity, and you could be the best proof. So, I do not agree with you that it is chinese chauvinist high horse.</p>
              <p>I quote you also...</p>
              <p>"Singapore is a multi-cultural society .... and you must learn to
                                      look beyond the color of the skin as well ... just because someone

                                      mandarin ... and some Singaporeans are NOT even chinese ...."</p>
              <p>According to this, we are looking for those ppl who can speak not only in english but all the dialects,malay and tamil, because there are still number of Singaporeans who cannot fully understand english, especially the older generation. I think you've forgotten them.</p>
              <p>The truth is that migrants are here, and still many of them are coming. They need to adapt the change in the environment, and you do.</p>

              <p>all prcs who come to spore should take a singlish proficiency test, like how to use the local lexicon (hokkien superlatives, random malay words etc) and poor grammar. somemore they should take a speech test to see if they can speak in a monotonous, choppy, unintelligible (to those outside spore) without sounding prc-ish</p>

              <p>then what abt you? Arent you gonna start re-examing your own

              beautiful singlish, so you should be back to where you come from"
              arent you gonna say that?</p>
              <p>Thoughout my arguments, I did not neglect the importance of
              english, as. However I failed to see your understanding abt the
              current situation which is the fact that Singapore is lacking
              manpower in all its sectors. That's why we see many new PRCs here,
              admittedly,some are good, some are not. Language is just one of the
              problems caused by the immigration. Certainly you cant expect those
              PRCs can speak english as fluent as you, it takes generations to
              build up its linguistic ablity, and you could be the best proof.
              So, I do not agree with you that it is chinese chauvinist high
              horse.</p>
              <p>I quote you also...</p>
              <p>"Singapore is a multi-cultural society .... and you must learn
              to look beyond the color of the skin as well ... just because
              someone looks "yellow" to you, doesn't mean he or she automatically
              understands Mandarin ... some of us are babas ... some of us speak
              dialects at home ... speaking better malay or hokkien than we do
              mandarin ... and some Singaporeans are NOT even chinese ...."</p>
              <p>According to this, we are looking for those ppl who can speak
              not only in english but all the dialects,malay and tamil, because
              there are still number of Singaporeans who cannot fully understand
              english, especially the older generation. I think you've forgotten
              them.</p>
              <p>The truth is that migrants are here, and still many of them are
              coming. They need to adapt the change in the environment, and you
              do.</p>

              <p> By right all of us should be using Malay to communicate with each other, because it the national language. You are right that the English is the common language among all the races, and it the the official language together with MANDARIN,MALAY AND TAMIL.</p>
              <p>I understand that you have encountered the PRCs who could not speak in proper english, or could not speak at all. But I also understand that the shops are not solely running by the PRCs, there are Singaporean sales assistants who are able to communicate with you in english. Maybe you can re-visit the shop after a few months later, you will realise its either the person's english is getting better, if not the person is  no longer there. I suppose either scenario can make you feel better.</p>
              <p>But, if you went to this coffee, and old chicken rice stall auntie who can only speaks in dialect and mandarin, assume that you cant speak either of the language, or you are a indian if you want to. I am just curious what would you like to say. Isnt it sounds familiar?</p>
              <p>Please do consistently check out the environment around you, and you will realise that your previous assumption of the penetration of english in singapore is not so sound.</p>
              <p>English is the way to achieve social cohesion, but for sure it is not the sole factor. Lever of understanding, toleration, and trust among the ppl are more important. GET IT?!</p>
              <p>btw, if you can call my viewpoint as chinese chauvinism, so i think you are the english chauvinist. Because I FAILED to see your understanding abt the meaning of the TRUE multi-racial and cultural society. Maybe you should shift to england, because I think you purely cant tolerate those who are not born english speakers, like yourself.</p>

              <p><br>Aren't our govt today are pro china too?? it's not a case of pro china or not, but they are blooming, u cannot stop them, you cannot beat them, so you join them. Ask yourself, if today, u shut your door to china and refuse to do business with them, do you think our economy will be so vibrant if we tight ourselves toward the US of A only, which is having a bear situation?  Now given an option, we must ride the wave with china so as to gain from it success. But of course they do have a different culture, living style, habits and mindset. But if you are able to understand them, listen to them, understand their way of living, doing business and working. They mean no harm.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And in term of super power, they can be the next economy powerhouse but not in arms. Because now their new lots of young leaders understand that investing in economy is better than wasting time and money in arms with negative return. As Deng xiao peng once said, if we got foreign investors here in China from Europe and America, do you think they are going to attack us with their asset at stake??</p>
