              <p>Wrong lor....not everyone is like that.</p>
              <p>I also got friends who are just out to take advantage of me, of course there will be many people like that in our lives. This is something that everybody will eventually need to learn how to deal with this kind of common friends. Once you have found your way to overcome those bad friends and bad relatives, you will realised that actually all those bad friends are relatives aren't really important to your life at all. And you might laugh about it later after you have overcome this unpleasant feeling that's still surfaced in you whenever you had to deal with those bad friends and relatives.</p>
              <p>But I also got good and close friends and even best friend in my life. It just takes time to discover them, but once you've found them...they will be with you till the end of time.</p>
              <p>Good friends and potential partner are probably most difficult to come by, cos they're mixed among all the bad ones.</p>
              <p>Maybe this kind of things really need to depend on fate and destiny.</p>
              <p>But don't feel disappointed with yourself and life itself just because of a few disappointing people in your life. If you compared those few bad ones with the rest of the world, your life isn't all that bad afterall you know? At least you still got the rest of the world who are still interested to be your friends. :)</p>
              <p>I also never give up my search for good friends, so I always be true and kind to everyone I've met. If they disappoint, betray, take advantage of you, upset you, then so be it and strike them off your list. I usually don't give second chance cos I know I can forgive them, but I can never forget them...and it's better not to meet them again. :)</p>
              <p>I believe you will find good friends and future partner eventually if you are optimisstic. Who knows, your next new friend might end up being your best friend or even your wife! :)</p>
              <p>Press on and never say die hor..............................</p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">After going thru
                  so much with people, I’ve learnt that the worst investment is
                  efforts, time and money “invested” in maintaining human
                  relationships. I’ve read and seen for myself how fragile human
                  relations are and once broken, it is like a broken vase. Even if
                  fixed back, there’ll still be cracks and scars, never as good like
                  before.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma; color: #000000;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whenever I joined
                  a new company, I’ve been “pulled” by different colleagues to join
                  their group/gang. The victim of backstab, will be mouthed until
                  him/her to no value and only negative things. They told me all the
                  bad things about this person and that person and to be careful of
                  them. But when I actually interacted with that “evil person”, I
                  find that he/she is not as bad as the colleagues bad-mouthed. Maybe
                  a few character flaws, but who doesn’t have character
                  flaws?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma; color: #000000;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">Read before about
                  when a person is in a bad plight like bankrupt, all his “so-called
                  blossom” friends left him, all relatives avoid him like plague.
                  Then what’s the point of making friends and having relatives? Then
                  I rather have no friends, no relatives. Which is true as whenever
                  I’m in trouble, I am my own benefactor. No one has really helped
                  me.</span></span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">To those who
                  begged to differ, saying that friends and relatives are important,
                  are you really so sure that your so called friends will help you
                  when in SERIOUS need? Not say buying lunch for you, doing small
                  things, but making BIG BIG sacrifices!</span></span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">So far, since
                  secondary school, I never have any REAL friends. Just hi-bye
                  friends and my life is still fine. I really felt for those who
                  spent money, time and efforts to help friends but when they
                  themselves need their friends’ help, all the “friends” just run
                  away and leave all the misfortune for himself to
                  handle.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma; color: #000000;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is so sad but
                  true of society. I don’t intend to make new friends and don’t
                  expect anyone to help me when I’m in trouble. I don’t really need
                  friends/relatives!!!!</span></span></p>
