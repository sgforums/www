              <p>I'm surpised my login still works. I've not been here since.... 2006?<br>I see FireIce is still here.</p>
              <p><br>Anyway, on to the important matter. In 3 months' time, I will be applying for naturalisation, to become a Japanese citizen. I figured I'm give some pointers. A little quarrel with the heartlander sister reminded me that some of you probably are still trying to get out.</p>
              <p>First things first, I've been in Japan since 16th August 2006. Initially as a student, then as a working member of society.</p>
              <p>There are 2 options to staying permanently in Japan. Naturalisation or Permanent Residency.</p>
              <p>There are 5 conditions for naturalisation:<br>- minimum 5 years constant residency.<br>- don't be a minor (15 full years and above)<br>- don't be poor (No need to be rich. Just have a stable job. Average wage for us peasantfolk is 2million yen starters)<br>- don't be a criminal in either countres<br>- not have taken part in anti-government activities.</p>
              <p>This isn't really a condition as much as it is a necessity. Japanese language ability. You want to live here and contribute here, not be a burden.</p>
              <p>You will be required to renounce your Sg and any other citizenship you may hold. No dual citizenship here. No worries, your renouncement will be annulled if your application fails. At least, that's what most countries do. The UK even allows you to recede your renoucement once you've been granted JPN citizenship effectively giving you dual citizenship, albeit illegally.</p>
              <p>There are several paperwork you will need:<br>- birth certificates of you and your entire immediate family (all legal and biological parents &amp; siblings, spouse.)<br>- marriage/divorce/re-marriage/death certificates of your parents. (you too, if married)<br>- full copy of passport.<br>- all property records in both countries. (addresses you lived in.)<br>- driving records (violations included)  in both countries.<br>- FULL education, employment, tax and pension (cpf) history  in both countries.</p>
              <p>Your parents may not be willing to give you their papers. If no amount of persuading works, give up, hire a lawyer, declare yourself estranged from them. Then it won't be neeed.</p>
              <p>Don't worry. Changing your nationality doesn't mean you are no longer their child (even if estranged). They will understand one day. Probably a decade later, on their deathbed, when you bring your Japanese family to visit them.</p>
              <p><strong>You have the right to live your own life.</strong></p>
              <p>Once all paperwork has been submitted, the whole process should take about half a year excluding the paperwork hunt, so get that done BEFORE you apply. Makes life easier. You'll be effectively stateless during this period so do not plan any overseas business trips or holidays. You will be stuck in the airports as like Tom Hanks in the Terminal movie. Just not with as romantic a setting.</p>
              <p>That's it. The process is also free (your paperwork excluded.)</p>
              <p>For PR, you need 10 years residency and it costs 8000 yen. It's just easier to get naturalised. Who would've thought, a country with a reputation of xenophobia would be that easy to get into. Anyway they're not xenophobic. Well most aren't.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok, I believe that's the gist of it.</p>
              <p>A little extra tips.</p>
              <p>The Japanese academic/financial/political year starts in spring. That means April 1st.</p>
              <p>University enrolment usually begins in August~March. Go to the embassy if you want to know more. Many people used to ask me if so and so university is 'recognised'. My answer, a degree is  a degree is a degree.</p>
              <p>You can convert your Sg license into Jpn license. They cost roughly the same and have the same courses but I only took 2 months to get my license. You can't use a Jpn license in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Japanese companies usually do not accept international applicants (unless they specifically ask for it.) You need to be here. You need to speak the language. Many people come on a 90-day tourist visa and start job searching then. Many also become English Language Teachers. The going rate is 2~3000 yen per hour. There is an abundance of ELTs in the market. Don't get your hopes up.</p>
              <p>There is a minimum wage here. Any part-time job you do is usually well above it.</p>
              <p>That's about it.<br>I won't be back so if you want to know anything, find me, Sen Heng, on facebook or something.</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>

I do have some contacts companies that base in Tokyo and Osaka. But overall as i need to know from you, are such job easy to get?</div>

              <p>Side note(not to scare any potential citizens) :</p>
              <p>My countrymen/women suffer from a certain condition called gaijin phobia (sometimes mistook and may well be considered rascism towards foreigners). Almost everyone has it to a certain degree.</p>
              <p>Helps if you talk, sound and act(most important and most difficult to achieve) like a Japanese. </p>
              <p>You may have lived in Japan for a long time and yet not be Japanese enough to be Japanese. (begets the question:what does it mean to be Japanese??)</p>

              <p>The only thing I like about Japan are their pretty AV models and porn industry. Other than that, I don't fancy Japan. Work there is stress. Their paper houses are even smaller then our HDB flats. Radiation problem. Threat from North Korea. High cost and expensive property (unaffordable). Earthquake and tsunami.</p>
