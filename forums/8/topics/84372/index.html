A martial-arts old master will make the poor orphan his disciple...but instead of learning martial arts, the poor orphan gets bullied by his seniors and ordered to cook or chop woods.<br>9. The hero will find ways to learn martial-arts by peeping at his senior's martial-arts training.<br><br>10. The hero is a weakling at the beginning but will learn an ultimate fighting skill in a mysterious place which allows him to become a skillful fighter.<br><br>11. The hero gets to show off his skills to fight a villain during a world-pugilist gathering, and with his fighting skills, he astonish the pugilistic world.<br><br>12. When a man is wounded and dying, he always manage to catch his breath and speak a few sentences to reveal the killer before dropping his head and declare dead.<br><br>13. When an old man is dying after being attacked by villains, while lying down he will ask the hero (kneeling beside him) to take care of his beautiful daughter (who will be crying).<br><br>14. No matter how powerful the hero is, he will never realize his good-buddy is actually a girl in cross-dressing .....at one time the hero will accidentally touch his good buddy's br<span style="font-style: italic;">e</span>ast and wondering why they are soft.............until one day during a fight, his good buddy's hair band is cut loose and her beautiful long hair fly loose in the wind.........then the hero realize she is actually a feminine girl.<br><br>15. When fighting with the enemy, instead of hitting each other, the villain and the hero will choose to hit each other's palm and stone there for sometime before pushing each other away.....and one of them will spill blood out of his mouth.<br><br>16. When saying goodbye to other skilled fighters, they will cover their right fist with their left palm and jumping out of camera screen (assuming you know they actually fly off into the sky).<br><br>17. The waiter of the inn (xiao-er) will always carry a kettle and a cloth on his shoulders, and always have a head-wear with many strings on top. Same goes for the accountant at the counter (zhang-gui) who will be an old man with beard and head-wear with strings.<br><br>18. When inside an inn, the waiter will ask the hero what food does he want, and the hero will say " Just any small dishes will do (shui bian lai dian xiao cai) ." And the waiter will always know what to do and go away without any more questions.<br><br>19. The waiter will always smile with utmost respect at the sight of gold and silvers even though the money does not go to them.<br><br>20. The inn is such an up-to-date information-centre that when having lunch at the inn, you can always overhear gossips of the latest news on what's happening in the pugilistic-world.  And usually the gossips come from a few goons at the next table.<br><br>21. There can never be peace at the inn so long as the hero is there  -  the bad guys at the next table will complain at the slow delivery of dishes and turn the table, threatening to kill the waiter...and it's time for the hero to show off his righteousness and most importantly, show off his skills.<br><br>22. The hero and the villain will fight at the inn with chop-sticks and bowls at first sitting down. And when the fighting gets hot, both will fly out of the window and start a big fight on the street. The by-standers on the streets will always crowd around and point fingers at the fighting with a bored and expressionless face.<br><br>23. When asking to rent a room at the inn, often the accountant at the counter will reply that the rooms are fully booked, but there is still a small vacant room in a far corner. More often the hero will have to share the room with his cross-dressed buddy and the cross-dressed buddy will start to feel awkward.<br><br>24. The traders on the streets will always be selling the same things - cloths, candies, mask, puppets, buns.<br><br>25. And the people there seem to like bun so much that they carry it most of the time.<br><br>26. Girls are not afraid of peeping toms even though the walls and doors are partially made of paper.<br><br>27. Assasins seem to have some kind of agency for employments -<br>they always wear the same standard uniform , black cloth all over revealing only the eyes.<br><br>28. The assassins seemed to have graduated from the same<br>academy - when trying to assassinate someone inside the room, the assassin always use saliva and make a hole on the paper wall,<br>then he will blow the sleep gas with a pipe sticking through the hole. They also prefer stealing things from rooftops by opening a brick to reveal a hole and lowering a string to hook up things up.<br><br>29. People seem to be afraid of the rooftop so much that assassins always choose to escape by flying over roof-tops, and the hero will give up the chase<br></div>

Skilled people are able to fly over roof tops, up trees and across distances without any sweat. But when travelling to towns and villages, they still have to walk or ride horses.<br><br>4.

Healing internal wounds in the body is as easy as sitting down cross-legged, palms on the knees and smoke coming out from the head.<br><br>7. They can keep alot of stuff in their sleeves and waistband and never drop them.

            <div class='col-md body'>Let me comment....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by 798:</div><div class="quote_body"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Just to add on:<br><br>8. A martial-arts old master will make the poor orphan his disciple...but instead of learning martial arts, the poor orphan gets bullied by his seniors and ordered to cook or chop woods.<br>9. The hero will find ways to learn martial-arts by peeping at his senior's martial-arts training.<br><br>10. The hero is a weakling at the beginning but will learn an ultimate fighting skill in a mysterious place which allows him to become a skillful fighter.<br><br>11. The hero gets to show off his skills to fight a villain during a world-pugilist gathering, and with his fighting skills, he astonish the pugilistic world.<br><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If not, how to be hero?</span>  </span><br><br>12. When a man is wounded and dying, he always manage to catch his breath and speak a few sentences to reveal the killer before dropping his head and declare dead.<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: brown;">This doesn't happen in Jing Yong's novels.  Jing Yong likes to make the person die before he could speak so that everyone would misunderstood that the Hero of the story was the murderer.  </span></span><br><br>13. When an old man is dying after being attacked by villains, while lying down he will ask the hero (kneeling beside him) to take care of his beautiful daughter (who will be crying).<br><br>14. No matter how powerful the hero is, he will never realize his good-buddy is actually a girl in cross-dressing .....at one time the hero will accidentally touch his good buddy's br<span style="font-style: italic;">e</span>ast and wondering why they are soft.............until one day during a fight, his good buddy's hair band is cut loose and her beautiful long hair fly loose in the wind.........then the hero realize she is actually a feminine girl.<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: blue;">This one quite true...hahaha.  Somemore in the ancient days, everyone has long hair -- both male and female.  How they identify the female by looking at the long beautiful hair  ???  </span></span><br><br>15. When fighting with the enemy, instead of hitting each other, the villain and the hero will choose to hit each other's palm and stone there for sometime before pushing each other away.....and one of them will spill blood out of his mouth.<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: blue;">This is so true   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </span></span><br><br>16. When saying goodbye to other skilled fighters, they will cover their right fist with their left palm and jumping out of camera screen (assuming you know they actually fly off into the sky).<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: green;">yah lor. It seems that they all don't like (or dunno how to) to walk.</span></span><br><br>17. The waiter of the inn (xiao-er) will always carry a kettle and a cloth on his shoulders, and always have a head-wear with many strings on top. Same goes for the accountant at the counter (zhang-gui) who will be an old man with beard and head-wear with strings.<br><br>18. When inside an inn, the waiter will ask the hero what food does he want, and the hero will say " Just any small dishes will do (shui bian lai dian xiao cai) ." And the waiter will always know what to do and go away without any more questions.<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: blue;">Yah.  I have been wondering how the hell the waiter knows what to do.  Somehow I am just curious whether I could do the same when I go order food at the coffee shop zhi char stall</span></span><br><br>19. The waiter will always smile with utmost respect at the sight of gold and silvers even though the money does not go to them.<br><br>20. The inn is such an up-to-date information-centre that when having lunch at the inn, you can always overhear gossips of the latest news on what's happening in the pugilistic-world.  And usually the gossips come from a few goons at the next table.<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: green;">hahahhaa  This is better than reading newspapers.</span></span><br><br>21. There can never be peace at the inn so long as the hero is there  -  the bad guys at the next table will complain at the slow delivery of dishes and turn the table, threatening to kill the waiter...and it's time for the hero to show off his righteousness and most importantly, show off his skills.<br><br>22. The hero and the villain will fight at the inn with chop-sticks and bowls at first sitting down. And when the fighting gets hot, both will fly out of the window and start a big fight on the street. The by-standers on the streets will always crowd around and point fingers at the fighting with a bored and expressionless face.<br><br>23. When asking to rent a room at the inn, often the accountant at the counter will reply that the rooms are fully booked, but there is still a small vacant room in a far corner. More often the hero will have to share the room with his cross-dressed buddy and the cross-dressed buddy will start to feel awkward.<br><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This is so true</span></span><br><br>24. The traders on the streets will always be selling the same things - cloths, candies, mask, puppets, buns.<br><span style="color: green;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But then, in those days, what else could they sell?  They can't possibly sell gameboy and playstation, right?</span></span><br><br>25. And the people there seem to like bun so much that they carry it most of the time.<br><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">that's their version of hamburger or sandwiches.  just that the bun has no ingredient inside.</span></span><br><br>26. Girls are not afraid of peeping toms even though the walls and doors are partially made of paper.<br><span style="color: green;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Yah lor.  so easy to peep one.  Just lick the finger and then poke the window paper with the same finger.  So fragile one.</span></span><br><br>27. Assasins seem to have some kind of agency for employments -<br>they always wear the same standard uniform , black cloth all over revealing only the eyes.<br><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Have to wear like that what.  Can't expect them to wear white or some luminous colour, right</span></span><br><br>28. The assassins seemed to have graduated from the same<br>academy - when trying to assassinate someone inside the room, the assassin always use saliva and make a hole on the paper wall,<br>then he will blow the sleep gas with a pipe sticking through the hole. They also prefer stealing things from rooftops by opening a brick to reveal a hole and lowering a string to hook up things up.<br><br>29. People seem to be afraid of the rooftop so much that assassins always choose to escape by flying over roof-tops, and the hero will give up the chase<br><span style="color: green;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The roof looks so uneven.  How come they never lose their balance and fall off one?</span></span><br></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
