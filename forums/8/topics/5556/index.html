            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys and girls who frequent this site.  If until now you still do not know what is the main reason that this site is set up for, lemme feed you something that you all should know.  The supposedly called Chief or whatever cool nick he calls himself is actually Jason Ling, a student from ACJC.  He and his girlfriend Eunice Chew from RJC are all nymphos.  He would send his girlfriend to take photographs of girls from RJC so that he can satisfy his sexual hunger and of course the sexual hunger of many others.  Of course in the end, the badass principal of RJC came to know about it and it got his girlfriend into quite some shit, and of course his previous website was taken down and it was followed by many reports on the Newpaper and Straits Times etc, that made him feel good about himself momentarily.  And now he's back with a vengeance, a new domain for his no good website that caters to desperate people and other nymphomaniacs.  And here you have, all his perverted supporters giving him the attention he needs and wants.  Thank you all for the support and long live Jason.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yo People out there.....basically....im shocked. Its sad, don't you feel, that 18 yr old students from ACJC, can be as perverted as this to set this page up. Its probably due to loneliness, or perhaps the owner of this page feels his girlfren is....inadequate and insufficient to quench his insatiable sexual appetite?<br>I feel disturbed. *sigh*<br>obviously, we can attribute this pervertish and voyeurish behaviour, to the tetesterone charged nature of the web owner.....<br>sad. most guys who come here are probably similar natured fellas. cant find pretty girlfren outside, must come in here and look at pics.Tut tut.<br>Furthermore, whine about ah bengs getting the girls, and they not having girlfrens b4, etc etc.<br><br>Pathetic.<br><br>Grow up you people.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To reply to Aaron Soh:<br><br>This information is not justified and anyway, what is your relationship with this supposed Jason Ling that you are trying to malign and libel him ?<br>Also, how is it that you seem to know so much about his activities as well as his girlfriend's ?<br><br>I seriously doubt the information posted by you and I think you are simply a disgruntled individual who is trying to gain some attention.<br><br>Reply to Damien Chew:<br><br>You shouldn't take everything you read at face value, especially on the Internet. So far nothing has been proven about anything and it is not wise to make assumptions as yet.<br><br>You seem to be another against this website, for whatever reasons of your own. Obviously, you seem to indicate that it is a sad thing for some guys not being able to find gf outside and so having to resort to viewing Net girls.<br><br>The truth is some guys may not possess the charm &amp; abilities to get a gf, though there might be nothing wrong with them; thus you should try to be more sympathetic (unless you are one of those who gets girls as easily one takes a breath of air). Furthermore, this site is intended to allow people to relax and unwind and I believe has no misleading content on it to justify your accusations. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Hope you can see the light soon my friend.<br>Good luck to both of you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MusicWhiz!!!<br>You have my full support in your statements!<br>I do think that what Aaron is trying to do here is to stir up some anti-jason sentiments and maybe get him into trouble wif his sch by listing it openly here?<br><br>I personally feel that this site is harmless fun and the newspaper articles have proven that what Jason and his guys are doing is not really so wrong after all. Who doesn't want to see pictures of gorgeous people?<br>Well,ok, maybe it's just a matter of not letting things go out of hand(no panty shots, no plunging necklines blablabla), but seriously, I dun see much to complain about at this site which is pretty well done indeed!<br><br>Suggestions for the webmasters: well, perhaps if you concentrate more on the contributor's column instead of the candid ones, all those pple who complain about the voyeuristic nature of this site won't have much left to say,but then again, that would be spoiling some of the fun, won't it?<br>Also, what's all this fuss about some of the contributed pics being stolen from porn sites? I don't see any that cause alarm. Perhaps you guys can say that the contributed pics have nothing to do with you watsoever and whoever wants to complain can email the contributors instead?<br>Best of luck!</div>

Whatever his reasons for starting up the site, it has become something totally different from what u seem to think that this site exists for.  It's about the appreciation of beauty.  Even WITH plunginf necklines and upskirt shots, this site is still more tame than the fashion magazine.  I tell u straight off that I wack off to those magazines than I do to this site.  Maybe u don't read many magazines, but if u take a look at the new issue of HER WORLD, somewhere near the last few pages, there's a picture of this really pretty girl in her singlet and stripped spagetti panties.  YAOW!!!!!  I can name a few more mags more "rude" than this site.<br><br>What business is it of anyones what the HornMaster and his GF's sexual urges, appetites or orientation is.  They can be swingers for all I care.  Doesn't matter really does it? We won't go telling u that ur a dirty bastard for doing whatever it is u do in your spare time.  U can be a chronic masturbater for all we care.  It really isn't our business is it?<br><br>What u read here doesn't necessarily mean that the real person is like this.  This is cyberspace.  It exists for anonimity.  It exists for the tranfer and exchange of information.  Information can come in many forms.  But the base is that it's an exchange of ideas, of feelings, and emotions, but in a controlled and open environment behind prying eyes. (paradox there....<br><br>What is expressed here is what, I would like to believe, people wouldn't say in real life. Or becasue they want to share ideas and pain with others who are in the know.  Obviously, If u aren't on the same wavelength and don't understand the whole rationale behind the net and this kind of exchange, u would make fleeting, and insulting statements like u made above.  It's insensitive...period.  And do  u really think that everyone here is single and desperate?...maybe some are, but that doesn't mean that they are rejects or whatever it is u classify people here as.  There are a few guys here who are attached...and to pretty girlfriends also...so ur staements hold no water.<br><br>We are here to discuss things that matter.  If u want to talk about the finer points of how to read whatever bible it is ur reading, u shouldn't be here.  Wrong wavelength guys.  There are a few girls around here too, so what does that make them.  I doubt that they are desperate.<br><br>I don't know u, but if ur the kind that can get girls just by flashing the thickness of your leather cowhide JPG insignia-ed wallet, or just plain good looking, u should have a little respect for other people.  Even if u are just the average joe, have a little respect for how others feel.<br><br>Like I said, maybe u aren't so bad in real life, I don't know, butif u wanna contribute, then contribute...refrain from trivialising people's emotions and intentions...<br><br>Anyway, hope u guys can try to surf and enjoy ur self around this site.

            <div class='col-md body'>Re: to Aaron Soh &amp; Damien Chew,<br><br>Frankly speaking, i'm not quite sure that both of u exist! Considering the fact that both of ur profile seemed mighty dubious...<br>(let's juz hope that it's not the creator that is playing this game to check out the loyalty value amongst us, the ardent supporters)<br><br>Anyway, from what i observed... Mr Aaron Soh has drawn quite alot of fire to himself... i seriously doubt that we'll see much of him in the near future... By exposing the creator... &amp; by defaming him on THE net itself, one could only imagine the hatred &amp; the enemity between the two of them... maybe the so-called Jason stole his girlfriend (or his secret admirer)... &amp; this Jason is but a totally innocent party... who had no links with this website whatsoever... you've sinned gravely young man if that's the case... the answer is but only yours... Anyway i see it... it's considered a non-profitable &amp; self damaging action... (or maybe u r an extremist, by George!)<br><br>As for Mr Damien Chew... sorry, i've a problem communicating with kids *smile* ... but maybe Kraft (the cheese) would help u...</div>
