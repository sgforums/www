              <p>I have an important assignment but my teacher will only grade it if my Medical Certificate covers the dateline of submission. However, the MC I got only covers one day but I was really sick and rested for two days. (Second day was the date of submission). Parents letters are not allowed. </p>
              <p>Is it safe for me to alter the dates on the MC? Will the teacher call the clinic to verify? </p>

              <p>Police have arrested a 
                  22-year-old female student who is involved in several cases of Forgery 
                  of Medical Certificates.  </p>
              <p>It is believe the suspect had sold forged Medical 
                  Certificates to other students, who in turn submitted them to their 
                  respective schools to skip classes. The students had contacted the 
                  suspect through social media and subsequently arranged to meet up with 
                  the suspect to purchase the forged Medical Certificates (MCs), which had
                   the letterheads of legitimate clinics fraudulently printed on them. The
                   forged MCs were detected when the teacher of the school in the east 
                  became suspicious and verified the students’ medical records with the 
                  respective clinics, which then exposed the ruse. A police report was 
                  then lodged.</p>
              <p>Through protracted investigations and extensive 
                  follow-up, officers from Ang Mo Kio Police Division managed to establish
                   the identity of the suspect who sold the MCs to the students. On 22 May
                   2013 at about 10.30 pm , the suspect was arrested in the vicinity of 
                  Ang Mo Kio Avenue 9. A stack of forged MCs was also found at the 
                  suspect’s house and seized as case exhibit. Preliminary investigations 
                  revealed that the suspect had sold the forged MCs to at least 30 
                  students between March 2013 and May 2013.</p>
              <p><strong>Investigations against the suspect as well as the
                   students involved are on-going. The offence of Forgery for the Purpose 
                  of Cheating under Section 468 of the Penal Code Chapter 224, carries a 
                  maximum jail term of up to 10 years’ imprisonment, and shall also be 
                  liable to fine.</strong></p>
              <p>Commander of Ang Mo Kio Police Division, Deputy 
                  Assistant Commissioner of Police (DAC) Keok Tong San, commended his 
                  officers for their good investigation which resulted in the arrest of 
                  the suspect and protected the integrity of the affected clinics. <strong>He also
                   cautioned that forging Medical Certificates in order to skip school or 
                  work is tantamount to a criminal offence and the Police will not 
                  hesitate to take such persons to task.</strong></p>

              <p>Sian.. I know that feel.. At least your sch accept MC. Some schools like YJC got this sickening college policy, even with MC also they don't accept. As a result, I got 0/25 for my test. It's not even a major exam, but these tests determine if you promote or not &gt;.&lt; </p>
              <p>Which school are you from? I think they should accept if you give an MC attached with the parents letter? Parents letter should state that you were still not feeling well but already went to see a doctor on the (insert date) and on medication. It would be pointless to see a doctor again to get medicine. Something along those lines... </p>

              <p>Just revisit your doctor again and request he/she extend your MC (although not sure this doctor of your if need you to pay for his consultation fee again), If you still seriously sick for longer day, you can also request an doctor's letter from him.</p>
              <p>If it is not an test/examination but just an assignment, you can always request your close one like your friends, sibling or even parent to pass on your behalf. So what is the issue?</p>

              <p>And I'm aware that MC forgery is a crime but I'm experience many peers who got away with it. For instance, they altered their MC in order to skip CCA which is really hard to get caught because the CCA teachers don't give a damn even if you skip intentionally.
