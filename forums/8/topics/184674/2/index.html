In Canada, when you commit to stay in a hostel/dorm you have to for the whole term.  Only after the term ends you can switch to live somewhere else.  If I'm allowed to switch any time I want, I will stay in the hostel first.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi mito,<br><br>Me thinks.....it's not so recommendable to stay off campus....in fact many people here want to stay on-campus but couldn't.<br><br>There are many benefits if you stay on-campus.......<br><br>if you want to eat......many canteens are around....getting meals is convinient. Laundry, is available. Air conditioning.....is available at some newer places (u can try to request), if ur room has no air-con, there is a big ceiling fan. Other facilites include lounges (TV), kitchens, bathrooms, etc the usual stuff.......<br><br>There is also a big advantage.....if you have morning classes, u can wake up later.........imagine if you stay off-campus, u waste so much time just for commuting every day......to and fro.....but if u stay on-campus, the commuting time is almost non-existant.<br><br>Another point already mentioned previously.....NUS and NTU are far apart....if u want to stay together with ur friend....the middle point will make both of u suffer......<br><br>Off-campus pricing is also more expensive.<br><br>Lastly....Im sure you will consider, that by staying on-campus.....u can make more friends this way.....I think in fact you will end up enjoying it much more than staying off-campus.....u can make friends with the locals and the numerous other exchange students.....<br><br>Me highly recommend to stay on-campus.<br><br>PS : Dont worry about constantly seeing other people studying....if you need a change of environment, simply go out of the campus.....</div>

If you join more, you get more points. If you have lotsa points, you have higher priority over the ones with fewer points, when it comes to accomodation.<br><br>All on-campus residences have rules forbidding visitors to stay overnight. However occasionally this rule can be bent officially. For instance if you have a visiting sibling, and it's very late in the night. You can simply notify and ask your Resident Fellow for permission.<br><br>There are also people who have friends staying overnight without any permission. As long as nobody knows, or report you, and usually nobody will, this is fine also, but dont do it too often.<br><br>The cheap $300 room for rent off-campus, is likely very basic, with basic furniture only, and located at a not-so-strategic place. Utility bills, air-con, may or may not be inclusive. Meals usually are not available (cook or go out yourself). Also if it's only a room, you need to check whether you will be sharing the flat with the owners, and/ or with other tenants at other rooms. Internet, may or may not be available (my guess is most likely not available).<br><br>I again would want to close with an endorsement and recommendation to stay on-campus. Most exchange students do, and Im sure you will find it more comfortable and enjoyable.<br><br>For further information, please dont hesitate to contact me at toll free 1-800-Help-888.</div>

But everyone said hostels and halls are suppose to be the cheapest but it's $440/month.  So is there something wrong with these rooms because it's cheaper??</div></blockquote>Friends for visits are ok, but no overnighters allowed.
