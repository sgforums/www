            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone, I just registered today on this forum.  I'll be coming to Singapore next year as an exchange student to NUS.  Another student will be going to NTU also.  It will be our very last term before we graduate, so of course we want to know where to have fun...also where to live.  Since my friend will be coming to NTU and I, NUS, where should we look for a flat? BTW what is HDB flat??</div>

You get to patronise pubs, sushi, movie screenings, supper bars, 24hr coffee and prata shops in NUS, all within walking distance from hotel.<br><br>If you like to get a flat, you should ask someone in Singapore to help you find one before reaching singapore, else you will not have a place to settle when you arrive.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  </div></blockquote>Do the hostels have air conditioning or not? I'm not very used to tropical weather and that's also a reason why I didn't want the school to arrange my room because I read they don't have air conditioning.<br><br>No, this is not typical of Canadians, a lot of them actually like heat, but not me.</div>

Dont worry about school hostels being a stressful place to stay, students who stay in hall tend to play alot too.<br><br>if u want to stay with ur friend whose going ntu, the two of u probably has to find a central location somewhere in the middle of ntu and nus. and flat rentals generally more expensive than school hostel even if the two of u split the costs. and whichever one of u whose going to ntu, it's really quite troublesome to travel to ntu to study everyday. best advice is stay in hostel, the local students will be more than pleased to show u around.</div>

I believe it's the faculty of business, since I'm enrolled in the mba program.  I do want to stay in dorms to meet people and have fun and the option is still open.  NTU doesn't start until mid March and NUS starts early January so I have to arrive before my friend anyways.<br><br></div>
