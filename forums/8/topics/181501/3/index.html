            <div class='col-md body'>This thread is getting interesting!<br>Okie, lets bring it a step further, and list down briefly our experiences of the countries we visited. I shall start first.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Malaysia - Our closest neighbouring country. Very accessible for us singaporeans. I have been to various parts like KL, Langkawi,  Penang, Malacca and JB of cos.<br><strong>Likes</strong> The food, favourable currency exchange rate  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> , cheaper petrol, people are generally friendly and helpful.<br><strong>Dislikes</strong> Not as safe as SG, modified protons are a nuisance, Milo produced there not as nice.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Indonesia - Another common destination. Very accessible with high speed ferries to coastal areas and budget flights to and fro daily. i have been to Jakarta and of cos, their beautiful islands.<br><strong>Likes</strong> Local food and dry food products like keropok, extremely favourable currency exchange rate, beautiful islands.<br><strong>Dislikes</strong> Safety might be an issue in some parts, Jakarta city's air is very polluted.<br><br>Thailand - Yet another choice destination among singaporeans. I have been to bangkok (shoppers' paradise), Phuket, Pattaya, Hat Yai.<br><strong>Likes</strong> Local food, Favourable currency exchange rate, excellent massages at reasonable rates, people are generally friendly. Very beautiful islands, many nice golf courses.<br><strong>Dislikes</strong> The sleaze in some tourist areas like patpong, not as safe as SG, traffic congestion in Bangkok city, tom yum soup makes me 'lao sai' sometimes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>China - The upcoming economic and military power. A poular destination cos its inexpensive and gives u the most bang for ur buck. i have been to Beijing and Xiamen.<br><strong>Likes</strong> Rich history and culture, haven for high quality fake goods.<br><strong>Dislikes</strong> Shopkeepers quite crafty. Once, i was at a fruit stall choosing pears. The shopkeeper held the plastic bag and placed the chosen pears inside it. Later, when i was taking out my money, she exchanged the bag with another one when i was distracted. Only when i got back at the hotel then i found lousy quality pears in it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Australia - A very popular PERMANENT destination for many singaporeans.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Also popular with students doing further studies overseas cos its cheaper than europe or usa. I been to perth, cairns, brisbane, gold coast.<br><strong>Likes</strong>: Strawberries, kiwis and nougats are cheaper there. Nice weather all yr round. Would love to try hot-air balloon next time.<br><strong>Dislikes</strong> Crappy tourist advertisements eg, 'where the hell are u!?'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>New Zealand - The country with more sheeps than people!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Slightly more expensive destination than Australia, but still popular. Went there when i was 5 yrs old. can't remember much.<br><strong>Likes</strong> Very beautiful scenery. experienced snow for the 1st time at mt cook.<br><strong>Dislikes</strong> Sheeps, cos they scared me sh!tless when i went to a sheep farm  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hong Kong - A cosmopolitan city just like singapore. Stayed there for 3 nights. Went to places like ladies market, the peak, and also saw the super duper big buddha statue(dunno wats the place called  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> ). I also took photograph with 2 hk policemen in green uniform on the streets  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><strong>Likes</strong> Dim sum, city with most good-looking asian guys(in my opinion)<br><strong>Dislikes</strong> Housing estates are very run-down, bad city planning. Hotel rooms are tiny too. Disadvantage if u can't speak cantonese<br><br>South Korea - Causing a frenzy throughout asia with their drama serials and movies now. Went there 3 yrs ago. I visited the popular tourist destinations like lotteworld, an asian version of disneyland and others.<br><strong>Likes</strong> -Girls i saw on the street very pretty  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> , Girls i saw on the street very pretty  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> ,Girls i saw on the street very pretty  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> ,Girls i saw on the street very pretty  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">.

Causing controversies around the world, but still, that shouldn't stop us from going there.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> I went disneyland at 4 yrs old. Was totally clueless about mickey mouse and donald duck.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><strong>Likes</strong> The original disneyland, large food portions<br><strong>Dislikes</strong> Can't think of any.

A country with rich culture and history. Many impressive old cathedrals. The cathedral had marble pillars and paintings on the ceiling. Really overwhelming. i didn't even know where to look.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  i visited the leaning tower of pisa, where many ppl would stand at a spot, hands outreached, with the tower in the background to take a pic to give the illusion dat u were supporting the leaning tower.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><strong>Likes</strong> The sound of italian language<br><strong>Dislikes</strong> never succeeded in learning italian  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>France - The country that invented french fries??..haha...just kidding. the locals said that if u didn't make a trip to the eiffel tower, u nv went to france. Seeing the eiffel tower in real life was cool. U can either walk up the tower( take about less than 2 hrs) or take a lift up(gotta pay money, cost freaking expensive).
