            <div class='col-md body'>My experience with Nikon service.<br><br>Bought my camera on 2 weeks ago. found the SD card slot too tight (have to use substantial force to pull out the Fragile SD card). Went to Nikon centre (within 7 days) and repeatedly explain to the customer service gal and technician.<br><br>They insisted that there was nothing wrong with the camera (using a thin 64MB card) on my camera and refuse to acknowledge that there was a problem.<br><br>Was told that they will change a new cam for me.<br>Come back only when they call.<br><br>Finally ...they call, says that they only fix the card slot.<br>Well then, so I went down to Nikon Centre, guess what happens:<br><br>1. My same D80 was brought out. Check the camera, noticed the Connector Cover was "crumpled" and unable to close (I have not even touch there yet). The gal tried and got worried. She went in and came out says "we change for u liao".  Wah lao, They used force to handle our camera?<br><br>2. The SD card slot is the same, still hindered the card from getting out properly.<br><br>3. Technician came out and say aloud (with all the customers around): Its all the same with D80. (hmmm..). He took out a new box with another new D80 and challenged me to try myself (while he stand there and look...hmm I am customer leh). I raised my voice (to let other customers to take notice) and tried it and wah la!! it is smooth and proper. I have to demonstrate in front of him and other customers to prove to him. I pass both cameras to him and asked him to try it out himself. He tried and immediately his face colour drained and darkened. Without a word, he quickly marched back into his backroom, without any explaination. The rest of the customers were shaking their head at atttitude of the technician. My camera was with them for a week, he did not noticed/felt it/tried it? The other customer service woman start closing her cabinet with loud noise/bang and showed unpleased expression.<br><br>4. The customer service gal came out later and told me that his manager is going to change a new set. I ask the customer service gal is the slot is really faulty. She nodded her head and quickly rework on her paperwork.<br><br>5. The technician came out thereafter to collect the box that he left on the counter. He totally ignored me and walked right back in.<br><br>6. The customer service re-do the receipt and ask me to sign. Luckily I check again. The expiry/warranty of my camera was shortchanged from Dec 07 to Jul 07 (6 months). When I highlighted it, the lady just use pen to amend the receipt. I asked her isn't she need to update her system accordingly, she then changed it in her system. She insisted that she cannot give me the original receipt that I signed, with the amended correct date. OMG!<br><br>7. I asked for the CUSTOMER SERVICE feedback email/form, she insisted that Nikon do not have any feedback email for customers. She only gave me her dept manager email, which is the same people who tried to "con" their way through, without making any effort to work on the SD card slot and problem.<br><br>The journey down to Nikon centre took time, taxi fare and effort.<br><br>Nikon, expensive equipment, yet so unprofessional service.<br>Tried calling them and left a few messages, never reply.<br><br>What if my fragile 2GB SD card gets chipped after tugging it out from the slot..!<br>all precious photos of 1 month travel will be gone...<br></div>
