            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys, I would just like to share my 2 cents worth of experience.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>For weight training, there are two variations. You either train for <strong>strength</strong>, which is the maximum force your muscles can exert, or you train for <strong>endurance</strong>, which is the ability of your muscles to endure constant stress.<br><br>Here's a quick list of the equipment you should use at the gym to tone and bulk up.<br><br>Upper back - Lats pulldown, pull-ups<br>Shoulders (Deltoids) - Shoulder press, shoulder lifts using dumb bells<br>Triceps - Triceps extension<br>Biceps - Bicep curls<br>Chest - Chest press, bench press<br>Abdominals (Obliques) - Crunches, sit-ups<br><br>As for the legs, I train them by running long distances and through interval training.<br><br>Always go for free weights over machines unless they aren't available, E.G. Too many people using, area's too crowded, etc. Machines restrict your range of movement to a particular one, and do not reflect the kind of day to day activities that your muscles will use.<br><br>If you're signing up for a gym, the number one issue that you should look out for is convenience. Simple reason being that if you find it a hassle to go down to the gym on a regular basis, you will sooner or later lose the discipline to work out. Usually, your neighbourhood gym is good enough.<br><br>As for diet, I can't give much help cause I don't really watch what I eat. However, I do stay away from foods high in the prime evils, E.G. Salt, sugar, saturated fat, etc. Of course, it doesn't hurt indulging yourself once in a while.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>All things said, the two most important things to remember are consistency and discipline. You will need to be consistent to see results, E.G. Run/Jog 3 times a week, and be disciplined enough to push procrastination away, E.G. "I will go for my regular run instead of lazing my arse in front of the television."<br><br>Initially, you might feel discouraged, but persevere on! Before you know it, you'll notice the small bodily changes. Many small changes over time equates to a big change.<br><br>Just for the record, I started running on a serious basis 16 months ago. There were numerous ups and downs, but I'm happy with my performance, considering that I run nearly 5 miles for my weekly training and a mile or two below that. I consider myself kinda slow in building up the momentum, but that's just my opinion.<br><br>Hope this helps.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
