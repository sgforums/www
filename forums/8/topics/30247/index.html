"May the best man win" is definitely part of your moral dictionary? In other words, in the case with my ex, if you were me you'd bid them good luck and congratulate the "bastard" for seemingly being able to provide better for her. and you wouldn't think twice about going after a gal that u are sure would make u extremely happee and vice versa even if she was attached/married.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it's pretty hard to clearly define oneself between the two given descriptions.<br><br>one can be either type, depending on the status of the current relationship, yet can be rightfully justified.<br><br>in an ideal situation, i see myself as the first type and prefer to stick to my decision.<br><br>there are simply endless of "greener pasture" out there if you keep comparing.<br><br>no matter what, i always thought one should make a clean decision when they bumped in to an emotional crossroad.<br><br>being draggy and indecisive is simply unacceptable.</div>

Think about this... even if you were to go with her 5 years? 8 years? 10 years? If this were to happen, it would happen - not being together only meant one thing: she is just NOT the one. Its all part of love nature cycle of growing up and strange as it may sound, its a good thing. (You don't want to wait until you married her to discover her true self isn't it? Or the discovery that her love for you wasn't as deep as you thought it was?) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You may have lost her, but don't lose that lesson you learn from the relation or worst - lose yourself. Its not matter of 'its not worth it' like a million would tell you, rather your ex and that guy wouldn't even feel a thing that you are undergoing. So whats the point? To tell you the truth, many people fluctuate between the two extreme you pointed: to remain in the relation and if in their own definition they have to give it up, they moved on. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Unless she is married to you (although it may only seemed so on the surface), people wouldn't give up wooing even though she/he may be attached. All is fair in love and war - no such thing as immoral and if your other half prefers him/her, you should give them your blessing because the highest form of love is when they are happy with their choices. Whats makes you think that remaining with you, she will be happier? Unless she has a history of being a bitch, then blame on your ownself if you decide to put feelings into this relation. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>'If you can't make her, respect it'<br><br>Love Eco-cycle is a constant movement between people to people -exchange life and relation lessons they ought to learn this lifetime.

If the mindsets and foundation is good - no *MATTER* what kind of pro hunter/huntress, they will fail.
