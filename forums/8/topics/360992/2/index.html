              <p>well, apparently, in terms of graciousness, 've never met a bad ang-moh all my life.</p>
              <p>refering to my watson job experience again last time at Holland V where there's a lot of ang-mohs (some tourists but most are expats).......there was never a bad one despite me encountering hundreds of them in that period.</p>
              <p>say, if a product is sold out, they will smile warmly, thank me and walked away.</p>
              <p>locals and PRC's reaction? the average ones just walk off, the bad ones keep harrasing me and the extreme ones (a few) wanted to see my supervisor. KNN.</p>
              <p>and there was this ang-moh guy who wanted to buy a microwave oven at watson (promotion last time). He wanted to take out the thing to see and i agreed.</p>
              <p>and he was the one who seem to be guiding me instead of the other way round! lol</p>
              <p>Him: now, let's take a look at this......what do we have here?</p>
              <p>And he slowly unpack everything himself and seeing that i was so busy (1 - 2 PM peak period at watson), he packed everything neatly back under my nose. awesome.</p>
              <p>best example is this ang-moh girl at the bank. both she and me were going towards the door and we were at the same footing, and since i'm a guy, it would be shameful to squeeze her out of the way and fight for the door, so i quickly open the door for her.</p>
              <p>the reaction? a warm "thank you" + smile.</p>
              <p>i can say 99 / 100 SG girls won't give you this reaction......they will think you're some freak trying to pick them up. NO KIDDING!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
              <p>oh, btw, saw this SG office guy in tie and briefcase dashing for the MRT seat after the previous person got up, even though there were some girls around him. well done!!!</p>
              <p>i'm not saying all ang-mohs are angels, but asians generally have much to learn from them in terms of graciousness. of course, they should learn filial piety and confucian, moral values from asians. that's an area they're weak in, since Western society doesn't seem to talk about filial piety, righteousness and all these stuff.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>To Minigun:</strong></p>
              <p>the word "god" means nothing to me, so i can just it anywhere i like to express my meaning. to me, the word "god" means someone who is of a higher standing compared to the average man on the street.</p>

              rarely, it takes time and decades of conditioning to make people like
              that.<br></div>
              <div class="quote_body"><strong><br></strong>
              <p><strong>it's because they're real men, big-hearted and gracious.</strong></p>
              <p>Go to Clarke Quay at night and you won't find the gracious "angmohs", maybe at galleries, but even then not likely.</p>
              <div class="quote_body"><br></div>
              <p><strong>Singapore should welcome real men like these so that our
                      population can be more gracious; those gracious and kindness
                      campaigns are useless.</strong></p>
              <p>Campaigns
              are insulting to Singaporeans. Being gentle and nice and kind should be
              something innate and human, and it seems the "angmohs" are like that
              simply because we have a longer culture/history of fighting each other,
              stealing, pillaging and conquest in europe, genocide and wars hence we
              see the need to be all "nice to each other today," so that we don;t
              fight. That's my constructivist answer to explain it, it is not a
              naturally innate thing, but it is moulded through time and history.</p>

                      big-hearted.</strong></p>
              <p>I
              dont know about all those qualities, it really could be the opposite.
              But sg girls need to grow larger and thats it... i am not disputing
              personalities, it sucks that you would say that. Sg girls don't sleep
              around as much and there are less instances of slag calling in Sin in
              schools than in brit schools, which is a good thing.</p>
              <div class="quote_body"><br></div>
              <p><strong>this is why ang-mohs are given better / priority service
                      everywhere (on the plane, at restaurants etc), because generally,
                      their race have set a good reputation for themselves and in our
                      hearts and minds.</strong></p>
              <p>They are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only </span>given priority service by the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">oriental </span>customer
              service providers in my experience, which sucks, because your point
              shows that you "singaporeans" discriminate in service. The australian
              and british flight attendants do not discriminate, they treat everyone
              like crap ha! (Except 1st class).</p>
              <p>I remember in 89 one time
              when i was flying SIA, we were with some Hong Kong partners (Chinese
              guys), and at the end of my flight, my children were given toys, but
              not my Chinese partner's children, and so we got so furious "its as if
              my children get toys because they are white, and do only white children
              like toys and comfort?" NO, i am a foreigner and i hate how asian
              people have that favouritism. Especially, when i walk into a bank with
              an Indian man, it really sucks.</p>
              <p>You want to talk about
              hearts and minds. You are an example of a Singaporean with a 3rd world
              mentality, you need to change that.</p>

              <p>well, apparently, in terms of graciousness, 've never met a bad
              ang-moh all my life.</p>
              <p>refering to my watson job experience again last time at Holland
              V where there's a lot of ang-mohs (some tourists but most are
              expats).......there was never a bad one despite me encountering
              hundreds of them in that period.</p>
              <p>say, if a product is sold out, they will smile warmly, thank me
              and walked away.</p>
              <p>locals and PRC's reaction? the average ones just walk off, the
              bad ones keep harrasing me and the extreme ones (a few) wanted to
              see my supervisor. KNN.</p>
              <p>and there was this ang-moh guy who wanted to buy a microwave
              oven at watson (promotion last time). He wanted to take out the
              thing to see and i agreed.</p>
              <p>and he was the one who seem to be guiding me instead of the
              other way round! lol</p>
              <p>Him: now, let's take a look at this......what do we have
              here?</p>
              <p>And he slowly unpack everything himself and seeing that i was so
              busy (1 - 2 PM peak period at watson), he packed everything neatly
              back under my nose. awesome.</p>
              <p>best example is this ang-moh girl at the bank. both she and me
              were going towards the door and we were at the same footing, and
              since i'm a guy, it would be shameful to squeeze her out of the way
              and fight for the door, so i quickly open the door for her.</p>
              <p>the reaction? a warm "thank you" + smile.</p>
              <p>i can say 99 / 100 SG girls won't give you this
              reaction......they will think you're some freak trying to pick them
              up. NO KIDDING!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
              <p>oh, btw, saw this SG office guy in tie and briefcase dashing for
              the MRT seat after the previous person got up, even though there
              were some girls around him. well done!!!</p>
              <p>i'm not saying all ang-mohs are angels, but asians generally
              have much to learn from them in terms of graciousness. of course,
              they should learn filial piety and confucian, moral values from
              asians. that's an area they're weak in, since Western society
              doesn't seem to talk about filial piety, righteousness and all
              these stuff.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>To Minigun:</strong></p>
              <p>the word "god" means nothing to me, so i can just it anywhere i
              like to express my meaning. to me, the word "god" means someone who
              is of a higher standing compared to the average man on the
              street.</p>
