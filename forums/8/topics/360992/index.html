              <p>went to this 7 eleven outlet today to buy something, and me and this ang-moh couple (presumable tourists) were slightly in front of me. both were in their late 50s - 60s.</p>
              <p>the wife went in, and i waited for the husband to go in to, but this kind old soul instead open the door for me big-big and gestured me to go in first.</p>
              <p>when i saw that, i was so touched i want to cry because you don't see SGreans doing this (if they did, God will call the devil "daddy"). i smiled and told him thank you.</p>
              <p>(btw, everything in that Marina square 7-11 costs double the price of elsewhere.....can u beat that???!!!)</p>
              <p>i learnt a big lesson today, and can now understand why so many SG girls like them.</p>
              <p>it's because they're real men, big-hearted and gracious.</p>
              <p>not like tiny SG guys who fight with women to see who can get into MRTs first.</p>
              <p>KNN.</p>
              <p>and i'm a SG guy btw, though i don't push others to enter MRTs or buses.</p>
              <p>Singapore should welcome real men like these so that our population can be more gracious; those gracious and kindness campaigns are useless.</p>
              <p>and not reall SG guys too........SG girls must learn from ang-moh girls too......more elegant, more gracious, more big-hearted.</p>
              <p>when i compare local girls to foreign ones, they have lots to learn in terms of character.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>last time when i was a staff at Watson, the easiest customers to deal with were all ang-mohs; hardest to deal with are PRCs (as expected).</p>
              <p>i always avoid PRC customers and favored the ang-moh ones.</p>
              <p>this is why ang-mohs are given better / priority service everywhere (on the plane, at restaurants etc), because generally, their race have set a good reputation for themselves and in our hearts and minds.</p>

              <p>ive seen demanding and unreasonable angmohs before... make our local shop keeper angry with their stuck up attitudes...</p>
              <p>we sgporeans can also be gracious and kind when we are touring in foreign countries with holiday mood.. probably not so in singapore island where its a rat race down here.</p>

              <p>i learnt a big lesson today, and can now understand why so many
              SG girls like them.</p>
              <p>it's because they're real men, big-hearted and gracious.</p>
              <p>not like tiny SG guys who fight with women to see who can get

              <p>KNN.</p>
              <p>and i'm a SG guy btw, though i don't push others to enter MRTs
              or buses.</p>
              <p>Singapore should welcome real men like these so that our
              population can be more gracious; those gracious and kindness
              campaigns are useless.</p>
              <p>and not reall SG guys too........SG girls must learn from
              ang-moh girls too......more elegant, more gracious, more
              big-hearted.</p>
              <p>when i compare local girls to foreign ones, they have lots to
              learn in terms of character.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>last time when i was a staff at Watson, the easiest customers to
              deal with were all ang-mohs; hardest to deal with are PRCs (as
              expected).</p>
              <p>i always avoid PRC customers and favored the ang-moh ones.</p>
              <p>this is why ang-mohs are given better / priority service
              everywhere (on the plane, at restaurants etc), because generally,
              their race have set a good reputation for themselves and in our
              hearts and minds.</p>

              <p>You might wish to consider making a trip to Europe (preferably Central and Eastern Europe) and patronise the touts at renowned tourist attractions to boost your self-esteem a tad. I am sure it will do your confidence wonders to be worshipped by a seemingly superior race as they seek to charge you exorbitant sums for their products.</p>
              <p>Then again, all that graciousness is worth paying for if it inflates your self-esteem a little, isn't it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
