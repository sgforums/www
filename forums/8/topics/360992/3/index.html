              <p>Sin city is too young for that, and its people dont have a culture of empathy and politeness they are simply just not into it yet. Some might say people here are less human. Give it time</p>
              <p>Just yesterday i was on the bus, and there was this whole load of Singaporeans crowding in the front of the bus when the rear end was free. A few commuters and myself could not even get in, and a few Singaporeans on board were smiling at our predicament.</p>
              <p>So i yelled out telling them to move inward, telling them (you people) not to wait for a "kindness on the Bus" campaign to come before they modify their attitudes.</p>
              <p>Well as expected they didn't do anything, but they did let me move to the rear. So that's about all you can expect from the locals.. Next time i might be more forceful, but frankly it'll do little good if the cultural mentality is set like that, i am no disciplinarian, i just watch with amused sociological interest.</p>

              <p>went to this 7 eleven outlet today to buy something, and me and this ang-moh couple (presumable tourists) were slightly in front of me. both were in their late 50s - 60s.</p>
              <p>the wife went in, and i waited for the husband to go in to, but this kind old soul instead open the door for me big-big and gestured me to go in first.</p>
              <p>when i saw that, i was so touched i want to cry because you don't see SGreans doing this (if they did, God will call the devil "daddy"). i smiled and told him thank you.</p>
              <p>(btw, everything in that Marina square 7-11 costs double the price of elsewhere.....can u beat that???!!!)</p>
              <p>i learnt a big lesson today, and can now understand why so many SG girls like them.</p>
              <p>it's because they're real men, big-hearted and gracious.</p>
              <p>not like tiny SG guys who fight with women to see who can get into MRTs first.</p>
              <p>KNN.</p>
              <p>and i'm a SG guy btw, though i don't push others to enter MRTs or buses.</p>
              <p>Singapore should welcome real men like these so that our population can be more gracious; those gracious and kindness campaigns are useless.</p>
              <p>and not reall SG guys too........<strong>SG girls must learn from ang-moh girls too......more elegant, more gracious, more big-hearted.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>when i compare local girls to foreign ones, they have lots to learn in terms of character.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>last time when i was a staff at Watson, the easiest customers to deal with were all ang-mohs; hardest to deal with are PRCs (as expected).</p>
              <p>i always avoid PRC customers and favored the ang-moh ones.</p>
              <p>this is why ang-mohs are given better / priority service everywhere (on the plane, at restaurants etc), because generally, their race have set a good reputation for themselves and in our hearts and minds.</p>

              <p><br>Why do you think the percentage of Ang Mo guys coming for Asian girl? Cos Asian girls are more loyal n faithful to their partner. Large percentage of Ang mo gals can have more than 15men as friend partners, flings that I believe seldom Asian gals will do....</p>
              <p>I personally like Ang Mo for their kind gesture to gals, but when u see how they drank and a fuss at Boat Quay, then u will step 5 steps back <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> </p>
