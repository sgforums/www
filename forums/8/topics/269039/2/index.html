If the gal is paying for him willingly and knowing he is a jerk. Whose fault is it?<br><br>2) The gals can chose not to sleep with him but they did so whose fault is it?<br>He did not use a knife or a gun to force them into bed rite?<br><br>3) The girls are treat like dirt and they still stick to him, so whose fault is it?<br><br>The big moral of the story is if you meet this type of jerk and you still want to stick to him without thinking about the future, whose fault is it?<br><br>You can only let others know about him, but they are the ones who willingly go to him and sleep with him. As long is not force even the law cannot not do anything about it.</div>

Bearie000, if it is someone you know or someone who had fallen victim to such jerk then you must provide some credibilities to what you had claimed. This is macham like spreading some urban legend. What you had described seems like most or some of the guys in S'pore. There are SO MANY IT professional here and in S'pore. There are SOME MANY guys who likes to bed women after women. Otherwise, this is just another bla bla bla.<br><br>Just like kiss29's posts and we all know who and how kiss29 looks like. He's just a harmless normal desperado. Nothing wrong with that, most men are desperado at some point in their life.<br><br>You will need to provide name, pictures or even contact numbers of this so called "Jerk" so we will know he's not fabricated. Don't plant fear and distrust in the minds of people.<br><br>At least provide a name.
