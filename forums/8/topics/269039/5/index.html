            <div class='col-md body'>Aye, seconded.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by oldkid:</div><div class="quote_body">Defamation? No one here even know if you are really a girl, less to say to track you down and sue your ass off. If I were you and had put a topic called "Exposing a JERK." My first post will be his pic, name, contact, address and all the relavent details to make sure he gets it slam in the face. Of course try doing all these not using your own computer but at some LAN shop or CyberCafe.<br><br>I'm too sceptical? Oh come on. If you've got the materials, you will have no qualm in exposing that bastard. I'm not a victim? Oh come on, I had met more materialistic bitches and heartbreakers than my fingers could count and keep track.<br><br>If that person has the intention to cheat he wouldn't leave any evidence? Oh come on, he cheated you of ur feelings. Can you show evidence of ur feelings? One cannot show prove of intangible stuff like feelings. If he cheated you of body and money, its also very easy to get away. This is because you willingly gave it to him out of love. If a person has the intention to cheat my dear, he wouldn't fear you accusing him.<br><br>The jerk can get away time after time because people REFUSE to expose these bastards out of fear and many many reasons. He is of no difference to a serial rapist. He must be exposed so there will be no future victims. But yet all we heard till now in page 4 is your lament of how sad you are. Do you know you can help the next victim by exposing him? Make the difference. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> </div></blockquote></div>
