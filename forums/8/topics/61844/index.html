            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">by Mamak Cock</span><br><br>In a bid to demonstrate its support for the Malay-Muslim community in Singapore, the Gahmen has for the first time ever, decided to set up stalls in the Geylang Serai Festive Bazaar.<br><br><img src="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/images/stories/foodfight.jpg"><br><br>Ministry of Community Support spokesman Mr. Angkat bin Bola explained, "Last time, our interaction with the Bazaar was limited to MPs conducting walkabouts in white uniform with hidden cameras and mircrophones. But in view of all the simmering ethnic tension, we decided to take a more active part."<br><br>A tour by Talkingcock revealed the following stalls run by the Gahmen:<br><br><strong>"Roti Jaya"</strong><br>Law Minister Professor Jayakumar was busy in his stall making roti jaya Â– which looked exactly like roti jala though he strongly denied that it was. He claimed the original, legally-registered name of the dish was Â“roti jayaÂ”, and that the Malaysians have been cooking up all sorts of nonsense suggesting it should be named something else. He said that his Ministry was considering submitting the roti jala/roti jaya dispute to the International Court of Justice, which the Malaysian government immediately pronounced Â“distastefulÂ”.<br><br><strong>"DPM Prata"</strong><br>Meanwhile, DPM Lee Hsien LoongÂ’s stall was gathering a massive crowd. The heir apparent was demonstrating his personal recipe for making very thin and very crispy roti prata. The secret, said DPM Lee, was in the way you slap the dough. Assisting DPM Lee with the curry was Straits TimesÂ’ political editor Chua Lee Hoong. Said DPM Lee, Â“Her skill at curry flavour is well-known.Â” Helping keep the pots warm was PM Goh Chok Tong.<br><br><strong>"Halal Bak Kua"</strong><br>Meanwhile, Deputy Minister for Muslim-Non Muslim Relations, Mr. Jacob Abraham, was selling halal bak kua, made from beef and not pork. He explained that it is essential for the Malay-Muslim community to merge their way of life with other ethnicities and seek uniformity, and he said the best way was through food. He proudly demonstrated how his halal bak kua was moderately prepared, with moderate spice and moderate flavour, in order to avoid any extreme taste.<br><br>Some opposition politicians had also decided to set up stalls at the Bazaar. Dr. Chee Soon Juan was seen selling his specially-brewed glucose drinks under a banner asking visitors to Â“Dare to TasteÂ”, while Mr. J B Jeyaretnam had set up his own sarabat stall.<br><br>Apparently, Mr. JeyaretnamÂ’s specialty is teh halia, the spicy ginger milk tea so beloved of Singaporeans. According to a stall helper, Â“Teh Halia is the secret to his ability to make all these spicy comments that make certain politicians get all steamed up.Â”<br><br>Business was slow at Dr. Chee and Mr. JeyaretnamÂ’s stalls, as access was blocked by a steady parade of tourists dressed in white baju kurongs and songkoks.</div>
