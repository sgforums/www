            <div class='col-md body'>Let me tell you how CHC works...<br><br>Children's church:<br>- for kids under 12.<br>- free tuition provided (but peeps just scrawl over the whole paper drawing pics of gundam)<br>- preaching of one hour<br>- no peer pressure of becoming a christian<br>- Donation (dont donate also nvm one)<br>- sing 2 songs<br>- home sweet home<br><br>Youth service:<br>- for peeps between 13 and 21<br>- preaching of 2 hours<br>- dance and sing<br>- donation (minimum $1, or else all eyes on you)<br>- very heavy peer pressure to force you be a christian (if not, they will insult you and your family and religion)<br>- cell group meeting (feedback on service)... They force you to say ONLY GOOD THINGS about CHC<br>- go dinner with friends and talk about CHC<br>- go home<br><br>Adult service:<br>- for adults above 21.<br>- Offer a portion of your pay to CHC<br>- Volunteer in services<br>- Encourage people to come CHC<br><br>JAMS church:<br>- for intellectually disabled.<br>- They try all sorts of games to teach you the bible but mostly to no avail<br>- no donation<br><br>TO MAKE IT CLEAR: I AM NOT A CHRISTIAN. How I know all these is because I had been to CHC from 1998-2000, 2004-2005.<br>Reasons:<br>- Tuition in kids service (I was then around P3 - P5)<br>- Do social service (Help those mentally retarded because my sis is one... thats why i was asked by the CHC peeps to teach there... but ended 'cause I had to cope with O Levels + some freak peeps wanted me to attend youth service also.
