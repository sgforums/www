This is a in your face statement. But true.<br><br>3) No offering = no blessings?<br>Explain. I cannot agree with this unorthdox statement.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Cheers<br></div></blockquote>no offerings = no blessings? no. read again pls. no offering doesn't means no blessings if one tithes. tithing opens up the windows of heaven.<br><br>maybe my presentation wasn't clear. my point is not abt talking who give more or who give less. regardless of who u r as a person (rich or poor), the amount u give (more or less according to wad u have) will determine how much u love God.<br><br>And God sees the heart of the giver. the more the better if his heart is willing and if his heart is for God.</div>
