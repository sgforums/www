            <div class='col-md body'>anyone who had been to their service before should know that their preachings were very shallow. They were literally talking how God love us, blah blah blah, never leaving far from this love thing. Other churches will tell more things, like why he did this why he did that, what does this mean, what does that means. Not CHC. They literally only talk abt LOVE.<br>however, the gals there are really very pretty. Why harh? Are pretty gals really bimbos? I went to their service on xmas and the number of pretty gals really overwhelme me. Now, I really seriously considering joining their church, get an gal, then move to another church.
