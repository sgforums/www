Not here at least. Because those who are credible, mature and smart enough to do so would know better than to try to start a flame war against a church in a public forum.<br><br>I agree with you as well that the Sun Ho factor has played a large part in things being blown out of proportion. Kind of the problem it is with public figures. It's really sad to see how a single member can become bigger than the church itself to the point that people don't see a difference between the church and the celeberity.<br><br>But ultimately, the church needs only be responsible to its congregration and not to the public.
