What we are saying is that CHC always tell the MEMBERS TO GIVE GENEROUSLY. In the end, the pastor gets HIGH PAY (Rev Kong took $8000/mth before he give up). The rest won't be much lesser then that. When i was in CHC, i'm ALWAYS POOR. Now, i know where my $$ goes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
