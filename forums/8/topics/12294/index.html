            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, the important thing is that you do not make it obvious to the boyfriend that you are chasing her. You can get to know her, but I think you must definitely show respect to her boyfriend and you cannot act as if you don't recognise his presence at all.<br><br>I don't think its wrong to chase a girl who is attached although I normally don't advise it. =P It's relatively tiring and only very rarely do you get her.  Also, it's quite delicate the situatoin when you're with a girl who has a boyfriend. There are certain boundaries which you cannot go into if you are showing disrespect to the GIRL as well.<br><br>So my advice, unless you REALLY REALLY like the girl, or you REALLY REALLY think you have a high chance... go for it! If not, forget it!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think making friend with her first is the most reasonable step. Once you know her you might think different and don't feel so special of her. wujung wujung you not attrated by her anymore and will leave her alone with her boyfriend.<br><br>the worse thing that could happen is when you both began to know each other better she starts to like you while you begin to dislike her.</div>
