            <div class='col-md body'>Well the liquid is actually the same liquid that comes with your sperm. Just that the transparent liquid doesn't have sperm.  It is normal. When u stop masturbating for a long time or very seldom after a agreesive habit. Its just discharge that's all. It is normally. It comes out normally when u r excited and yet didn't orgasm.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there is also the same thread in BAR... I think it would be more appropriate in BAR but anyway, here is the answer... its normal.<br><br>the transparent liquid as described forms the bulk of semen and its secreted by the prostate.  It serves several purposes.  In every case including yours, upon sexual arosal, the body automatically secretes this liquid to neutralise the urethra (the long tube inside your dick) and make it a frenly environment for the semen since sperm itself must be in a slightly alkali(??) environment to survive.  The urethra which you use to pee with is before this not exactly a suitable environment for the sperm to travel through.  This same liquid also forms the bulk of semen and its there to sustain the sperm cells since it contains an abundance of nourishing bits.  Next its there also as a medium to help transmit and transport the sperm when ejacutation.<br><br>It is wrong to think that "pre-cum" as some in BAR had called does not contain sperm cells... thats not true... there is a small amount of sperm cells in it and if you try pernatrating without protection thinking that its safe... ha you might be in for a huge and painful surprise 9 months later!!<br><br>And no... this liquid is not there as lubrication for sex... thats not the purpose and there is never enough of it anyway.<br><br>Some people secrete more while others less but there is always some present since without it the sperm cells will not survive.<br><br>So this is the long and short of it and its normal but if you are unsure, please discuss this with your GP ... but in the mean time read up a proper bio book and not some crappy mag for info!</div>
