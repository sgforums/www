Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine in the very heart of your house, your children like olive plants all around your table.</span><br>~  Psalm 128:2-3<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Even though he was single, at age thirty-two Bill decided it was time to buy a house. He found a modestly priced four-bedroom home and began to visualize how he could use the rooms. A few months later, however, he found himself engaged to marry a woman who had three young daughters. Two years after their marriage, Bill and his wife, Dee, had a baby. The gym and TV room he had envisioned in his new home never materialized!<br><br>It took Bill and Dee four jobs to pay for the life they had chosen and although their schedules were relentless, Bill couldnÂ’t help but conclude, Â“AinÂ’t life grand?Â” Eventually, his stepdaughters began to leave home and Bill once again made plans for the spare rooms in the house. But his elderly parents needed help and Bill and Dee invited them to move in. Even in getting up at night to help his ailing father, Bill still was of the opinion, Â“AinÂ’t life grand?Â”<br><br>After more than twenty-five years, Bill still doesnÂ’t have his Â“dream house.Â” What he has had, however, is two decades of a real home.<br><br>------------------<br><br><strong>Quiet Time</strong><br><br>Daily You pour Your blessings on us, Lord<br>yet we turn to the ash-heap of yesterday<br>pawing through the ruins searching for You.<br><br>Help us to remember that you don't live in yesterday<br>any more than WE do!<br>Teach us to receive all YOUR now blessings<br>even when they're cleverly disguised as unsolvable problems.<br><br>~ Susan Lenzkes<br><br></div>
