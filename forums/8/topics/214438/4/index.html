            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I think that the problem with the looks of SIA girls is not the main issue. Basically, u must be aware that the Kerbaya uniform they wear being the reason some look big size or a little plump. The SIA uniform, the plus side is that it seems to make the girls look more endowned. But, the narrow waist cutting, makes the tummy veri obvious.....I mean, unless u have a 'teko' figure, some how, the kerbaya will exaggerate your waist line.<br><br>In the past, I thought SIA service not veri good, but after siting on a PRC carrier, I immediately have second thought.<br><br>When I went to Yunan for tour 2 yrs ago, I sat on one of their airline(I'm not mentioning the name). When I aboard the plane, I approach the I was assigned on my ticket, to my surprise, there was this guy in pilot uniform already seated there. I try to speak to him about his occupancy of my allocated seat....... Guess wad, he choose to treat me as invisible and continue to read his magazine. I thought he did not hear me and I guestured to him again. He looked up briefly and choose to ignore me again, by carrying on with his magazine. I was quite unhappy and signal for the stewardess to assist me. It was then, that I realise that he was a transiting pilot and only after a lengthly debate between the stewardess and the pilot, then he choose to give in, giving me a "Du Lan" look.<br><br>During the flight, the cabin is stuffy due to the weak air-con and the headphones they provide is spoilt at one side.<br>During meal time, another episode happened...........<br>I used mandarin to request for red wine from the stewardess and she doesn't seem to understand me. I repeated in mandarin again for another few times, seeing she did not understand me, I changed to English. This time she got 2 of her colleagues to assit her. Guess wad, after a long while, they seem to understand wad i was requesting for........ but instead of red wine, they gave me a can of orange juice!!<br><br>On the return trip, we flew off in the night thus we are given only snacks. Believe it a not, the snacks are only 2 small packets of plain crackers and this long 'tube' like thing. The tube is secured with 2 fastened rings at the sides that can't be opened without a cutter. My siblings and I have a wonderful time guessing wad is in it and deciphering how to open it. To make matters worst, they don't come with any instructions, thus I can imagine the nightmare the non Chinese passengers will experience on their flight. I ask the stewardess how to open it and to my surprise, she not only don't noe how to open, she doesn't even noe wad is in it!! In the end, after many trial and error I managed to open it and it is hotdog inside........<br><br>Thus I can conclude at least SIA is not that bad after all..........</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the issue here is not comparing SIA with other airlines...<br><br>but rather that SIA's standard is dropping. Seriously, their "Cabin discipline", work attitude seems to be in decline in recent years.<br><br>Now on long haul flights, you frequently hear them at the back of the cabin joking, talking loudly when most of the passengers are trying to sleep.<br><br>I really can't blame them. Their training now and in-flight service is so "text-booked" that everthing they do is according to what the book <span style="font-style: italic;">requires</span> them to do rather than doing their job with passion.<br><br>To them, it's more like, "so long i do what the book requires me to do, i think i have given good service to my passengers".<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by equlus84:</div><div class="quote_body">I think that the problem with the looks of SIA girls is not the main issue. Basically, u must be aware that the Kerbaya uniform they wear being the reason some look big size or a little plump. The SIA uniform, the plus side is that it seems to make the girls look more endowned. But, the narrow waist cutting, makes the tummy veri obvious.....I mean, unless u have a 'teko' figure, some how, the kerbaya will exaggerate your waist line.<br><br>In the past, I thought SIA service not veri good, but after siting on a PRC carrier, I immediately have second thought.<br><br>When I went to Yunan for tour 2 yrs ago, I sat on one of their airline(I'm not mentioning the name). When I aboard the plane, I approach the I was assigned on my ticket, to my surprise, there was this guy in pilot uniform already seated there. I try to speak to him about his occupancy of my allocated seat....... Guess wad, he choose to treat me as invisible and continue to read his magazine. I thought he did not hear me and I guestured to him again. He looked up briefly and choose to ignore me again, by carrying on with his magazine. I was quite unhappy and signal for the stewardess to assist me. It was then, that I realise that he was a transiting pilot and only after a lengthly debate between the stewardess and the pilot, then he choose to give in, giving me a "Du Lan" look.<br><br>During the flight, the cabin is stuffy due to the weak air-con and the headphones they provide is spoilt at one side.<br>During meal time, another episode happened...........<br>I used mandarin to request for red wine from the stewardess and she doesn't seem to understand me. I repeated in mandarin again for another few times, seeing she did not understand me, I changed to English. This time she got 2 of her colleagues to assit her.

My siblings and I have a wonderful time guessing wad is in it and deciphering how to open it. To make matters worst, they don't come with any instructions, thus I can imagine the nightmare the non Chinese passengers will experience on their flight. I ask the stewardess how to open it and to my surprise, she not only don't noe how to open, she doesn't even noe wad is in it!! In the end, after many trial and error I managed to open it and it is hotdog inside........<br><br>Thus I can conclude at least SIA is not that bad after all.......... </div></blockquote>[/i]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That one is a small domestic liner, of course abit different with a big international liner like SIA.<br><br>But you are lucky, the pilot didnt harm you.<br><br>I was once seating happily, then a man changed seat and sit beside me. I was very tense because he look like a Pakistani.<br><br>Haiii...so tense the whole journey.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Knn, see pakistani, u scared?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>equlus, that pilot is damn lau lan. How many stripes on his shoulder? 3 stripes - Capt. 2 stripes - First Officer. It would be a pain to fly with this kind of asshole in the co.ckpit.<br><br>ponders - cabin crew talking behind is normal what. A lot of airlines do that. But yeh, a lot of service is textbook based. As long as they are polite and eager to help, it's ok. In SIA training centre, SIA trainees are told to smile at those with shirt and tie (assume they are from mgt)....saw none of it when i was there 2 weeks ago.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

And how much is the SIA ticket worth? Its like you paid for a second-hand car and asked the seller why it didn't look brand new <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Also, pls pls pls, how many awards SIA won and how many did that PRC airline win? How can you compare SIA with lousier airlines. No wonder standard drop, ppl look backwards instead of looking forward.</div>
