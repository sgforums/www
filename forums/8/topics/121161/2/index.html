You can make a lot of friends that way. Also, join freshman orientation camp, normal orientation to make more friends... I didnt join any eca because i find it too hectic but now i regret.. luckily my faculty is a close knitted familly: Year 1 - year 4 all same class..<br><br>3) Why is (2) important ? Because MOST faculties DO NOT practise the class system.. Most students wont meet the same people in the class more than 2 times...<br><br>4) Don't do last minute mugging for exams, you can still get away doing that in JC but most likely you will die if do that in NUS..<br><br>5) Mid-term tests are VERY important. They hold low % but they WILL decide your overall grade since most likely everyone will score the same in exam.<br><br>6) There are a lot of chio bus and yandaos on campus... Just don't forget that you are here to study <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>7) Register for hostel only if you are the following:<br><br>a) I am a foreigner la! So Bo Pian!<br><br>b) I am in the ARTs, i have SOOO Much time i dont know what to spend on.. maybe the hostel activities?<br><br>c) I have mastered the secret of time management! I can play very hard(Hostel activities) and work very hard too.<br><br>d) I am a scholar... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Some one said that difficulty wise: Engine&gt;Science&gt;Arts.. that is true to a certain extent only....<br><br>Most importantly,[b] help others </strong>if you can and <strong>enjoy your life</strong> in NUS!!!<br><br>The above applies to NUS and to a certain extent NTU..
