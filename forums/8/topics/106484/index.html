            <div class='col-md body'>OTTAWA : Canada's Supreme Court gave the government the go-ahead to change the definition of marriage, a famous victory for gay and lesbian groups battling for equal rights.<br><br>The ruling, on a draft law, cleared the final obstacle for Canada to follow the Netherlands and Belgium in authorizing same-sex marriage. Spain is moving in a similar direction.<br><br>Members of parliament are expected to back the law when the government introduces it to the House of Commons early next year.<br><br>The court also ruled that religious officials could not be compelled to marry same-sex couples, if the practice ran counter to their beliefs.<br><br>It declined to address the question of whether a change to the laws regarding same-sex marriage was required by the Constitution, a move that could complicate the task of shepherding the draft law through parliament.<br><br>Prime Minister Paul Martin said he had wrestled with the issue, but did not believe Canada could have "two classes of citizens."<br><br>"I think we are a very mature nation, I think we can undertake that kind of debate," he said.<br><br>Alex Munter, of lobby group Canadians for Equal Marriage, said the move reflected "Canadian values and Canadians' commitment to fairness."<br><br>Thursday's ruling was a blow to advocates of traditional marriage, who wanted the government to permit civil unions between couples of the same sex, but not sanction full-scale marriages.<br><br>"My position will be to preserve the traditional definition of marriage in the law," said opposition Conservative leader Stephen Harper.<br><br>"The government bill is going to be about obviously redefining," he said.<br><br>The government had taken the unusual step of asking for a Supreme Court ruling on draft legislation last year.<br><br>Government plans would see the definition of marriage changed to the "lawful union of two persons," rather than the "lawful union of one man and one woman."<br><br>While the government was waiting for a judgement before changing federal law on same-sex marriage, courts in six Canadian provinces and one territory had already ruled that same-sex marriage was legal.<br><br>The court was posed four questions by the government:<br><br>- Is parliament allowed to change same-sex marriage laws?<br><br>- Is the proposal constitutional?<br><br>- Does freedom of religion allow priests to refuse to marry gay couples?<br><br>- Is a change to the traditional definition of marriage as between a man and woman required by the Constitution.<br><br>The court responded "Yes" to each of the first three questions, which were posed last year by the previous government of premier Jean Chretien.<br><br>But it exercised its prerogative not to issue a ruling on the fourth question, which was added by the current government led by Martin in January.<br><br>The final inquiry was motivated by a desire to standardise law between any provinces which ruled that marriage was a state between a man and a woman.<br><br>"We will not permit the Balkanisation of marriage across the country," Martin said.<br><br>- AFP<br><br></div>
