            <div class='col-md body'>Its not easy to bring out the abs lines because by nature, fats start to gather there first.  Well, its not impossible, but there's no single way either.  Three main things need to be done:<br><br>(1) Watch the diet.  Doesn't usually mean eat less.  Just means don't eat too much fattening things, or high-energy stuff.  But don't sacrifice your nutrition either.  Once upon a time, I had to force myself to eat Yong Tau Foo soup (less fat) a few times a week, with lots of tauhu for proteins.<br><br>(2) Do abs exercises like leg raises (for lower part), sit-ups (for upper part) and other strength exercises.  This is to build up the abs muscles so that they can be more "clear".  It doesn't really bring out the lines in between the muscles - for that, you need to burn off the fats under the skin (see no. 3 below).<br><br>(3) Cardio.  This is the single most important thing.  If you do enough cardio, you won't even have to do any of the above 2.  Lots of people don't believe it, but constant long-distance moderate-speed running is the best way to bring out the abs.  Running 2.5-5.0 km 5 times a week would be nice, if you can.  You should be panting moderately, or else it means that you're not running fast or hard enough.  Cardio is actually the exercise which burns fats....and thus bring out the lines.  Although it seems that running involves mainly the legs, it is cardio and works the whole body (heart, lungs, etc.) and burns fats on the whole body.<br><br>For non-believers in running, here's proof:  We've all seen sportsmen, boxers, strong wrestlers, bodybuilders, etc etc who have bodies which are not so defined with lines.  But have you ever seen a long-distance runner who is fat or undefined?  Nay...there is no such thing.  And remember, long distance runners they don't even do sit-ups!  (Truth is, I heard that marathon runners do carbo-loading before each run or else in a single marathon, they can lose 2-3 kg in body weight!!....simply due to the high amount of calories they burn during running).<br><br>Er...lastly, I don't know about your fitness condition, But please better start slowly first....<br><br>Its a long hard road, but lots have done it before....so can you and me!  Good Luck!  And please be a bit patient too...may take weeks see the first results (depending on your starting condition).<br><br>Honestly, when I first heard about what I had to do to get a defined tummy, I said "Aiyoooooo.....forget it lah, after all when I wear my shirt who can see anyway?" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
