Likewise, everything we call "the future" is nothing but present memories inverted, or rearranged, to form a prediction or expectation. The appearance of "time" is little more than a trick of memory, as the Avatamsaka Sutra (Flower Ornament Scripture) says. You can easily discern this for yourself: simply figure out what it is you consider "the past" and "the future." You will discover that it is nothing but thoughts--nothing but memories, nothing but expectations, nothing but mental commentary. It's "all in your head," so to speak. There's really no such thing as time. There is really only Now--an eternally present Present with no beginning and no ending. Everything is completely new, distinct, and original every instant, with no real "change" or "motion" at all. The mystic-philosopher Heraclitus, explaining this point, said, "A man cannot step in the same river twice."</blockquote><a href="http://www.buddhistinformation.com/buddhism_and_the_illusion_of_time.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhistinformation.com/buddhism_and_the_illusion_of_time.htm</a></div>

What we should understand is that, according to the doctrine of Buddhism, firewood stays at the position of firewood.... There are former and later stages, but these stages are clearly cut."<br><br>Every moment is complete and transient, yet unmoving. Changing, changing, yet complete, unmoved. Drop the observer, just the walking, the typing...<br><br>But there is no sense of walking while walking, no moving in movement... everything is complete as it is, just This.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: red;">.[b]..Theres no mind for motion to exist apart from, and no motion for mind to exist apart from. Motion is the mindÂ’s function, and its function is its motion. Even so, the mind neither moves nor functions, the essence of its functioning is emptiness and emptiness is essentially motionless. Motion is the same as the mind. And the mind is essentially motionless. Hence the Sutras tell us to move without moving, to travel without traveling, to see without seeing, to laugh without laughing, to hear without hearing, to know without knowing, to be happy, without being happy, to walk without walking, to stand without standing...</span></span></strong><br><br><a href="http://www.abuddhistlibrary.com/Buddhism/C%20-%20Zen/Ancestors/The%20Zen%20Teachings%20of%20Bodhidharma/The%20Zen%20Teachings%20of%20Bodhidharma/THE%20ZEN%20TEACHINGS%20OF%20BODHIDHARMA.htm" rel="nofollow">THE ZEN TEACHINGS OF BODHIDHARMA</a>[/b]</blockquote>i sort of understood the one in bold red....<br><br>kinda meaningful <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
