            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by gigabyte14:</div><div class="quote_body">er, you can simplify anot?</div></blockquote>Words, no matter whether they are vocalized and made into sounds or<br>remain unspoken as thoughts, can cast an almost hypnotic spell upon you.<br>You easily lose yourself in them, become hypnotized into implicitly<br>believing that when you have attached a word to something, you know what<br>it is. The fact is: You donÂ’t know what it is. You have only covered up the<br>mystery with a label. Everything, a bird, a tree, even a simple stone, and<br>certainly a human being, is ultimately unknowable. This is because it has<br>unfathomable depth. All we can perceive, experience, think about, is the<br>surface layer of reality, less than the tip of an iceberg.<br><br>Underneath the surface appearance, everything is not only connected<br>with everything else, but also with the Source of all life out of which it<br>came. Even a stone, and more easily a flower or a bird, could show you the<br>way back to God, to the Source, to yourself. When you look at it or hold it<br>and let it be without imposing a word or mental label on it, a sense of awe, of<br>wonder, arises within you. Its essence silently communicates itself to you<br>and reflects your own essence back to you. This is what great artists sense<br>and succeed in conveying in their art. Van Gogh didnÂ’t say: Â“ThatÂ’s just an<br>old chair.Â” He looked, and looked, and looked. He sensed the Beingness of<br>the chair. Then he sat in front of the canvas and took up the brush. The chair<br>itself would have sold for the equivalent of a few dollars. The painting of that<br>same chair today would fetch in excess of $25 million.<br><br>When you donÂ’t cover up the world with words and labels, a sense of<br>the miraculous returns to your life that was lost a long time ago when<br>humanity, instead of using thought, became possessed by thought. A depth<br>returns to your life. Things regain their newness, their freshness. And the<br>greatest miracle is the experiencing of your essential self as prior to any<br>words, thoughts, mental labels, and images. For this to happen, you need to<br>disentangle your sense of I, of Beingness, from all the things it has become<br>mixed up with, that is to say, identified with. That disentanglement is what<br>this book is about.<br><br>The quicker you are in attaching verbal or mental labels to things, people, or situations, the more shallow and lifeless your reality becomes, and the more deadened you become to reality, the miracle of life that continuously unfolds within and around you. In this way, cleverness may be gained, but wisdom is lost, and so are joy, love, creativity, and aliveness.<br><br>They are concealed in the still gap between the perception and the<br>interpretation. Of course we have to use words and thoughts. They have their<br>own beauty Â– but do we need to become imprisoned in them?<br>Words reduce reality to something the human mind can grasp, which<br>isnÂ’t very much. Language consists of five basic sounds produced by the<br>vocal cords. They are the vowels a, e, i, o, u. The other sounds are<br>consonants produced by air pressure: s, f, g, and so forth. Do you believe<br>some combination of such basic sounds could ever explain who you are, or<br>the ultimate purpose of the universe, or even what a tree or stone is in its<br>depth?<br><br>~ Eckhart Tolle, A New Earth</div>

I suggest you improve your eloquence because you seem to be lacking communication skills. Either that or get some help, your train of thought seems to be going around in circles and makes no sense whatsoever. It's something like:<br><br>How do you know your existence of this planet is the reality? Because that's what the human mind presents you.<br><br>The presentation of the human mind is reality yet it is not.<br>The human mind presents reality unrealistically and therefore it is not reality.<br><br>Makes no sense does it?

There is no one here. This is not a figure of speech. I mean there is truly no one here, no person, no individual speaking to you. You look at me and think there is a person here talking to you, trying to tell you something. I assure you, there is not. Look at me. If there were not Consciousness streaming through this body, what would be here? What would this body be if Consciousness were not here? A corpse, of course! Dead matter. There is nothing else here. There is only the appearance of a body, and Consciousness which animates it. You, along with the rest of the world, have assumed that there is a discreet individual person here: that the Consciousness which is the animating force here is an individual consciousness, unique to this body and separate from the consciousness in other bodies.<br><br>This is based on appearances: there appear to be separate bodies, so the assumption is that there are separate consciousness-es. The belief in this assumption blinds you to seeing What Is, and is also the cause of your experience of this life as disquieting, confusing, unhappy, and generally full of fear and suffering. But it is not the case. There is in no way an individual sitting here talking to you. This body is nothing, an appearance in the dream. All there is is Consciousness, and it is Consciousness which is streaming through this appearance.<br><br>There is nothing here that exists in and of itself. What we call the human being is not an independent being, not an originating mechanism, not a transmitter. It is a relay station, a pass-through mechanism for Consciousness, the One Consciousness, All That Is. That is what I am, talking to you. And it is the same One Consciousness listening to this, looking back at me out of those eyes you call your own. What I am when I say 'I Am' is exactly the same as what you are when you say 'I Am.'....</div>

Is not life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feed them. Are  much more valuable than they? Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?Â”<br><br>Matthew 6:25-27</div>
