So unlike you, I won't contradict myself. And again you're saying that a Heavenly Father isn't reality so you are <strong>AGAIN</strong> judging what's real and what's not and you are <strong>AGAIN</strong> contradicting yourself.<br><br>And secondly, I'm not here to prove to you that I'm so smart because I know I'm not so smart. Unlike you who thinks you know all and whenever someone doesn't agree with you you call that person a delusional idiot. So please come to terms with the fact that you don't know more than everyone else and that you could be wrong and others right.</div>

Going from a sensible argument to personal attacks. Well you just proved my point that when someone doesn't agree with you you say they're stupid, delusional and talking nonsense.
