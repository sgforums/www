There is no one here. This is not a figure of speech. I mean there is truly no one here, no person, no individual speaking to you. You look at me and think there is a person here talking to you, trying to tell you something. I assure you, there is not. Look at me. If there were not Consciousness streaming through this body, what would be here? What would this body be if Consciousness were not here? A corpse, of course! Dead matter. There is nothing else here. There is only the appearance of a body, and Consciousness which animates it. You, along with the rest of the world, have assumed that there is a discreet individual person here: that the Consciousness which is the animating force here is an individual consciousness, unique to this body and separate from the consciousness in other bodies.<br><br>This is based on appearances: there appear to be separate bodies, so the assumption is that there are separate consciousness-es. The belief in this assumption blinds you to seeing What Is, and is also the cause of your experience of this life as disquieting, confusing, unhappy, and generally full of fear and suffering. But it is not the case. There is in no way an individual sitting here talking to you. This body is nothing, an appearance in the dream. All there is is Consciousness, and it is Consciousness which is streaming through this appearance.<br><br>There is nothing here that exists in and of itself. What we call the human being is not an independent being, not an originating mechanism, not a transmitter. It is a relay station, a pass-through mechanism for Consciousness, the One Consciousness, All That Is. That is what I am, talking to you. And it is the same One Consciousness listening to this, looking back at me out of those eyes you call your own. What I am when I say 'I Am' is exactly the same as what you are when you say 'I Am.'....</div></blockquote>Yes there is nobody there all there is is my computer monitor. Yes there are separate consciousnesses because you have your consciousness I have mine and so forth. And yes there would only be a corpse if you weren't conscious, that's why living things have a consciousness and therefore the saying I think, therefore I am. And if there is only one consciousness like you said then why am I not conscious of this? Hmmm? If there is only one consciousness then I would be able to know what every other person in the entire world and every creature is thinking. And no your consciousness is not mine because we're thinking completely different things right now and you are conscious of different things that I am. What you're relaying is just ideas through words.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Read this. This is very well written.<br><br>There are many things that I can doubt, but I cannot doubt my own consciousness in this moment. My consciousness and even if I tried to doubt it, it would be my consciousness doubting. I can imagine that my senses are being presented with a fake reality Â– say, a completely virtual reality or digital reality, which looks real but is merely a series of extremely realist images. But even then, I cannot doubt the consciousness that is doing the watchingÂ…<br><br>The very undeniability of my present awareness, the undeniability of my consciousness, immediately delivers to me a certainty of existence in this moment, a certainty of Being in the now-ness of this moment. I cannot doubt consciousness and Being in this moment, for it is the ground of all knowing, all seeing, all existingÂ…<br><br>Who am I? Ask that question over and over again, deeply. Who am I? What is it in me that is conscious of everything?<br><br>If you think that you know Spirit, or if you think you donÂ’t, Spirit is actually that which is thinking both of those thoughts. So you can doubt the objects of consciousness, but you can never believably doubt the doubter, never really doubt the Witness of the entire display. Therefore, rest in the Witness, whether it is thinking that it knows God or not, and that witnessing, that undeniable immediacy of now-consciousness, is itself God, Spirit, Buddha-mind. The certainty lies in the pure self-felt Consciousness to which objects appear, not in the objects themselves. You will never, never, never see God, because God is the Seer, not any finite, mortal, bounded object that can be seenÂ…<br><br>This pure I AM state is not hard to achieve but impossible to escape, because it is ever present and can never really be doubted. You can never run from Spirit, because Spirit is the Runner. To put it very bluntly, Spirit is not hard to find but impossible to avoid: it is that which is looking at this page right now. CanÂ’t you feel That One? Why on earth do you keep looking for God when God is actually the Looker?<br><br>Simply ask, Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?<br><br>I am aware of my feelings, so I am not my feelings Â– Who am I? I am aware of my thoughts, so I am not my thoughts Â– Who am I? Clouds float by in the sky, thoughts float by in the mind, feelings float by in the body Â– and I am none of those because I can Witness them all.<br><br>Moreover, I can doubt that clouds exist, I can doubt that feelings exist, I can doubt that objects of thought exist Â– but I cannot doubt that the Witness exists in this moment, because the Witness would still be there to witness the doubt.<br><br>I am not objects in nature, not feelings in the body, not thoughts in the mind, for I can Witness them all. I am that Witness Â– a vast, spacious, empty, clear, pure, transparent Openness that impartially notices all that arises, as a mirror spontaneously reflects all its objectsÂ…<br><br>You can already feel some of this Great Liberation in that, as you rest in the ease of witnessing this moment, you already feel that you are free from the suffocating constriction of mere objects, mere feelings, mere thoughts Â– they all come and go, but you are that vast, free, empty, open Witness of them all, untouched by their torments and tortures.<br><br>This is actually the profound discovery ofÂ… the pure divine Self, the formless Witness, causal nothingness, the vast Emptiness in which the entire world arises, stays a bit, and passes. And you are That. You are not the body, not the ego, not nature, not thoughts, not this, not that Â– you are a vast Emptiness, Freedom, Release, and Liberation.<br><br>With this discoveryÂ… you are halfway home. You have disidentified from any and all finite objects; you rest as infinite Consciousness. You are free, open, empty, clear, radiant, released, liberated, exalted, drenched in a blissful emptiness that exists prior to space, prior to time, prior to tears and terror, prior to pain and mortality and suffering and death. You have found the great Unborn, the vast Abyss, the unqualifiable Ground of all that is, and all that was, and all that ever shall be.<br><br>But why is that only halfway home? Because as you rest in the infinite ease of consciousness, spontaneously aware of all that is arising, there will soon enough come the great catastrophe of Freedom and Fullness: the Witness itself will disappear entirely, and instead of witnessing the sky, you are the sky; instead of touching the earth, you are the earth; instead of hearing the thunder, you are the thunder. You and the entire Kosmos because One Taste Â– you can drink the Pacific Ocean in a single gulp, hold Mt. Everest in the palm of your hand; supernovas swirl in your heart and the solar system replaces your headÂ…<br><br>You are One Taste, the empty mirror that is one with any and all objects that arise in its embrace, a mindlessly vast translucent expanse: infinite, eternal, radiant beyond release. And youÂ… areÂ… ThatÂ…<br><br>So the primary Cartesian dualism Â– which is simply the dualism betweenÂ… in here and out there, subject and object, the empty Witness and all things witnessed Â– is finally undone and overcome in nondual One Taste. Once you actually and fully contact the Witness, then Â– and only then Â– can it be transcended into radical Nonduality, and halfway home becomes fully home, here in the ever-present wonder of what isÂ…<br><br>And so how do you know that you have finally and really overcome the Cartesian dualism? Very simple: if you really overcome the Cartesian dualism, then you no longer feel that you are on this side of your face looking at the world out there. There is only the world, and you are all of that; you actually feel that you are one with everything that is arising moment to moment. You are not merely on this side of your face looking out there. Â“In hereÂ” and Â“out thereÂ” have become One Taste with a shuddering obviousness and certainty so profound it feels like a five-ton rock just dropped on your head. It is, shall we say, a feeling hard to miss.<br><br>At that point, which is actually your ever-present condition, there is no exclusive identity with this particular organism, no constriction of consciousness to the head, a constriction that makes it seem that Â“youÂ” are in the head looking at the rest of the world out there; there is no binding of attention to the personal bodymind: instead, consciousness is one with all that is arising Â– a vast, open, transparent, radiant, infinitely Free and infinitely Full expanse that embraces the entire Kosmos, so that every single subject and every single object are erotically united in the Great Embrace of One Taste. You disappear from merely being behind your eyes, and you become the All, you directly and actually feel that your basic identity is everything that is arising moment to moment (just as previously you felt that your identity was with this finite, partial, separate, mortal coil of flesh you call a body). Inside and outside have become One Taste. I tell you, it can happen just like that!<br><br>(Source: Boomeritis, Sidebar E: Â“The Genius Descartes Gets a Postmodern Drubbing: Integral Historiography in a Postmodern AgeÂ”.

Of course I'm always here! The word 'here' implies the exact location I am now. It is impossible not to be 'here' unless it is someone else's 'here' and then it'll be your 'there'. How did a discussion about consciousness turn into a debate on location? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div></blockquote>Don't get you. So someone else is 'there', but you're still here, right?<br><br>BTW, It is not about a matter of location. Here is not 'here' as opposed to 'there'.<br><br>What AndrewPKYap is saying is that to YOU, there is no 'there' or 'location'. There is only Being Here, your present awareness... 'location' is in the objective world. But You, Subject, Seer, is only the undeniability of your present awareness, nothing to do with objects and locations.<br><br>Who You Are is NOT any object that moves here and there... You are the unmoving awareness/Seer. (though, at the higher level of non-dual realisation/no-self, even the Seer is dissolved into the Seen, where all manifestation are realised to be self-luminous, self-shimmering, self-knowing, i.e Manifestation is the Source.. i.e there is no hearer, the hearing hears, no seer, the seeing sees, everything is there by itself, self-luminous)<br><br>BTW, you can't conceptualise what it means by being here... anything you conceptualise just misses the mark.<br><br>'Here' doesn't have a fixed shape and form, objects or location... it is empty. If you conceptualise 'here' as having this or that, the next moment passes and it's gone. You can only feel it and go with the flow.<br><br>Past mind is ungraspable, present mind is ungraspble, future mind is ungraspable. ~ Diamond Sutra</div>

Pls read my reply.<br><br>What you said is getting there... But actually, even to say there is a soul misses the mark... because we imagine there is a formless entity called self.. that is not the case. Formless does not mean a ghostly entity residing in the body somewhere that has no form. Your awareness cannot be reduced to an objective reality, whether form or formless. Means you cannot see 'consciousness' as an object -- because the moment you see it as whatever, a soul, what you are seeing is an object, not the Seer! Any image we form about that, is not it, is merely an object.<br><br>Now you know why, Consciousness is not individual or collective, or whatever. You cannot see 'self' or 'consciousness' as an object! It is only because you see 'consciousness' as an object, you see yourself as an individual apart from billions of others. But consciousness is not an object, it is the Seer, pure objectless emptiness consciousness.<br><br>But even that is not ultimate yet! This is only the description of the causal, the Witness. Only when one realises Non-Dual, No-Self, that is true enlightenment.

It is a form of 'touch'. Such peak experiences, transpersonal realisations, also being studied in 'transpersonal psychology'.<br><br>However, the emptiness nature of Consciousness must also be known (a higher level of realisation)... after which Consciousness is then realised to be non-dual (no subject-object separation), non-local, filling all spaces (the intuitive insight that all there is is consciousness, but there is no 'seat' of consciousness).
