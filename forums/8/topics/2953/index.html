            <div class='col-md body'>Guys..I think that besides how to propose, the impt thing to think of is also when to propose...i think that you have to be quite sure she also want to get married at that point in time...dun suddenly scare her away with that big question &amp; dun always put the marriage word in your mouth...guys are not the only ones who can get scared away with the big M, girls can too....especially when they are still confused and not quite sure if this is the guy that they really want to settle down wif in future....<br><br>Okie, back to the point...as a girl...I dun think i want the traditional way of proposing, esp. using the "Lets go apply for HDB flat" phrase...it's soooooo unromantic and it makes it seem as though the HDB flat is more impt than the girl...<br><br>I also think that i wouldnt be that surprised if my bf propose to me using the suntec billboard....it's quite overused by TCS..heheheh.....sorry Oakley, no offence intended...but seriously, I would prefer that my bf use that money to buy me something more practical!!! hehehehehehe.....<br><br>Fire's method is quite good...cheap, simple, but yet surprising and personal. It's something that both parties can relate to, something like a their very own secret....<br><br>as to what i want...havent really thought of it yet...coz no intention of wanting to get married soooo early...anyway, it's not for me to think....It'll be something my bf will have to do when the time comes! sometimes it's good being a gal...heheheh...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heh, just heard a good idea from my bf! If you're really sure that your gf will marry you, then no need waste so much time... just drag... you will end up she proposing to you.  Then you can boast about it to your kids.<br><br>Otherwise, you can try the Love Letter "Fujii Itsuki"'s method! Especially suitable for shy pple. Fujii Itsuki brought his gf Watanabe Hiroko to a mountain. It was very cold, and Fujii didn't dare to pop the question. In the end, Hiroko couldn't bear it and propose to Fujii  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah...proposing...I remembered doing that many, many, years ago. Well, not too long ago, probably 5+ I think (just celebrated the 5th Anniversary).<br><br>What did I do? I gathered a group of our mutual friends at this Japanese restaurant in Sogo (she loves Japanese food...or anything Japanese for that matter!). Then I went to buy 12 red roses (she loves red roses).<br><br>I stood before her, and announced, "Darling, in the presence of these friends of mine, and before God, I ask of you - would you marry me?"<br><br>My friends clapped like crazy, attracting the attention of the patrons, but I did not mind - she accepted the flowers and said yes!<br><br>Heh...we got married in December that year, five years ago.</div>
