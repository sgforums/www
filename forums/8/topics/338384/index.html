              <p>Review at the top.... Classic</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Picked this up for use in one of my kid's 'diversity' projects in
              school (Great Success!), and stuck the leftovers in the cabinet next to
              the baking soda.
              <br> <br>Ran out of toothpaste, and remembered how you're supposed to be
              able to use baking soda to clean your teeth, so of course, I
              accidentally used this instead, and Wow! all I can say is, my teeth
              have never been cleaner! They sparkle, they tingle, and for some
              reason, they STAY clean now, no matter what. Highly recommended!
              <br> <br>However, when I ran out of that fire-ant killer powder stuff, I figured I would try some for that too.
              <br> <br>Big mistake!
              <br> <br>Boy, it sure did not kill those ants!
              <br> <br>Fortunately, those suckers get slower as they get bigger, so I have
              been able to use a shovel to take care of most of them, one at a time
              though, the sneaky devils.
              <br> <br>And the darn trash man refuses to take them away..
              <br> <br>I would have given this product 5 stars for the teeth and the
              project on embracing diversity, but I deducted one star because of the
              giant mutant ants.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: verdana; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">First of all, I need to mention that if you're looking for facial ointment, THIS IS NOT IT. <br>I found that out the hard way. <br>Second of all, this stuff is totally inferior, but not totally useless. Upon finding out that it wasn't acne lotion (and made a HORRIBLE cake icing,) I did some research. My discoveries were interesting, so I decided to try some "Family Fun" projects with Uranium Ore. <br><br>A bit of advice: You know how there's the urban legend about the death ray using Uranium? Well, guess what--it's crap. I tried it on my sister, and she ran away screaming in agony. NOT DEAD. (By the way, my sister also ran away screaming in agony when I pointed a toilet-paper tube at her and made that funny laser noise from Star Wars.) <br><br>However, Uranium does have its uses. First of all, it's the heaviest natural element in existence (Gravity gun? Has potential), which means that it has a whopping 92 protons. Second of all, it's only 2 protons away from Plutonium. <br><br>Ah, plutonium. <br><br>Plutonium is not available on Amazon, which means the closest you can get is Uranium. Now, Plutonium: <br>Makes an excellent death ray <br>DOES clear up zits (by melting your face) <br>Tastes EXCELLENT on cake <br>AND is highly radioactive, which means if you hang around it long enough, you get superpowers (but, usually, you get cancer instead). <br><br>And, an added bonus is that, when adding those extra particles to fuse the Uranium into Plutonium, the fusion causes an explosion force the size of an atomic bomb, which, if harnessed properly, provides excellent energy. You can power your house for a years with the energy, and not have to use ANY fossil fuels. It is a wonderful method of (literally) green energy. <br><br>Unfortunately, I recently learned that, to initiate fusion, you need a mass the size of the sun. <br><br>Um. <br><br>But, I'm working on invention for that. I'm going to use the uranium ore to make a gravity gun, and then I'll use the gravity gun on the uranium ore... <br>...which is in the gravity gun. <br><br>Um. <br><br><br>So, Uranium ore can be very useful, and I would recommend it, but by more than one. After all, shipping is expensive, especially when the UPS driver keeps abandoning his truck to jump around in spandex and stop every petty theif he sees. <br><br>Bottom line: Useful, but not necessary. It has potential, but it's not that great on it's own.</span></p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>I had recently purchased a used car from my friend Dr. Emmitt Brown,
              and was told I needed to purchase nuclear material to enjoy the full
              benefits of the car. I saw this item on Amazon and thought I was in
              luck. Unfortunately, the use of uranium in my Delorean had some
              unforseen consequences. As I entered a California freeway, I knew I had
              to speed up to 90 MPH, or I would be run off the road. As I approached
              this speed, many weird things started to happen, and long story short,
              I was somehow transported to the year 1996. Knowing the past sports
              outcomes of the last decade, I went to Las Vegas and correctly
              predicted the winner of every World Series, Super Bowl, NBA Finals.
              Now, I am a billionaire and married to my childhood sweetheart, after I
              killed her husband. Thank you uranium ore, for making my dreams come
              true.</p>
              </blockquote><blockquote>
              <p>This product is one of the best gag products I've ever purchased. I've
              already tricked 5 of my friends into getting cancer by either drinking
              it (spiked their drink), eating it (sprinkled it in their Rice-a-Roni),
              breathing its fumes (poured ore dust in his asthma inhaler), smearing
              it on their body (mixed it in with his soap in the soap dispenser), and
              using it for a rectal enema (self-explanatory). Each time, I was
              rolling on the ground laughing, it was so funny. I know those guys are
              probably gonna get me back for my crazy stunts, but I'm always gonna be
              one step ahead as long as I have tons of radioactive material at my
              disposal.</p>
              </blockquote><blockquote>
              <p>This is the best strawberry jam I've ever tasted. It works well with toast AND English muffins.</p>
              </blockquote><blockquote>
              <p>I purchased this product in order to eat it and use the radioactive
              powers gained to rob a local bank, bringing me into conflict with my
              nemesis, the thunder god Thor. By the time it kicked in, it was 4:50
              and by the time I got over to the bank in the Decatur Street traffic
              the furgin bank was closed. I tried to melt my way in but no go and my
              stomach was starting to hurt. I turned to the heavens and screamed out,
              "ThoooOOOORRRR!!!" And I thought the clouds parted but I guess not. So
              I got in my car and drove over to, well, it was going to be Denny's but
              I quickly realized that the emergency room was a better bet. The doctor
              there didn't know how to summon Thor and honestly, I was not really up
              to fighting him by that time. My midsection was purple as a eggplant
              and I had about a thousand IV tubes in me. Anyway long story short, I
              died, and I found that none of the religions really got it right. No
              light or tunnel, no old guy with a gray beard, no reincarnation. It was
              like one of those long anterooms at a movie theatre when you superhave
              to take a leak. I looked around all over for Asgard and it took like,
              six months to get there and, long story short, Thor wasn't even there.
              You may want to try the [...] douche syringe instead.</p>
