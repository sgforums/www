Yes his karma will be less when compared to people working at the slaughter house, but in the practise of 8 Fold Path, whereby 1 of them is Right Livelihood, butchery and selling meat does not constitute under this catergory:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Buddha mentions four specific activities that harm other beings and that one should avoid for this reason: 1. dealing in weapons, 2. dealing in living beings (including raising animals for slaughter as well as slave trade and prostitution), 3. working in meat production and butchery, and 4. selling intoxicants and poisons, such as alcohol and drugs. Furthermore any other occupation that would violate the principles of right speech and right action should be avoided.

When Princess Wencheng married Tibetan King Songtsen Gampo, the most expensive betrothal gift was a Buddha statue built according to the image of the 12 year old Jowo Sakyamuni. It was brought to Tibet all the way from Chang'an. The Buddha's diadem, cape, decorative strap and robe were splendidly adorned with various pearls, agates, turquoises, corals and hundreds of various Dzi, including three Nine-eyed Dzi beads, Triple-eyed Dzi beads, Double-eyed Dzi beads, Tiger-tooth &amp; Longevity Dzi beads and others. This Buddha statue is currently placed in Lhasa, Jokhang Monastery. Hence, we can see that Dzi beads have been used as offerings to Buddha; not only are they sacred, but they are also rare and precious.</div>
