            <div class='col-md body'>1. (This is a declaration of) immunity by Allah and His<br>Apostle towards those of the idolaters with whom you made an<br>agreement.<br><br>2. So go about in the land for four months and know that you<br>cannot weaken Allah and that Allah will bring disgrace to the<br>unbelievers.<br><br>3. And an announcement from Allah and His Apostle to the<br>people on the day of the greater pilgrimage that Allah and His<br>Apostle are free from liability to the idolaters; therefore if you<br>repent, it will be better for you, and if you turn back, then know<br>that you will not weaken Allah; and announce painful punishment<br>to those who disbelieve.<br><br>4. Except those of the idolaters with whom you made an<br>agreement, then they have not failed you in anything and have<br>not backed up any one against you, so fulfill their agreement to<br>the end of their term; surely Allah loves those who are careful (of<br>their duty).<br><br>5. So when the sacred months have passed away, then slay the<br>idolaters wherever you find them, and take them captives and<br>besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush, then if<br>they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, leave their<br>way free to them; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.<br><br>6. And if one of the idolaters seek protection from you, grant<br>him protection till he hears the word of Allah, then make him<br>attain his place of safety; this is because they are a people who do<br>not know.<br><br>7. How can there be an agreement for the idolaters with Allah<br>and with His Apostle; except those with whom you made an<br>agreement at the Sacred Mosque? So as long as they are true to<br>you, be true to them; surely Allah loves those who are careful (of<br>their duty).<br><br>8. How (can it be)! while if they prevail against you, they<br>would not pay regard in your case to ties of relationship, nor<br>those of covenant; they please you with their mouths while their<br>hearts do not consent; and most of them are transgressors.<br><br>9. They have taken a small price for the communications of<br>Allah, so they turn away from His way; surely evil is it that they<br>do.<br><br>10. They do not pay regard to ties of relationship nor those of<br>covenant in the case of a believer; and these are they who go<br>beyond the limits.<br><br>11. But if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate,<br>they are your brethren in faith; and We make the communications<br>clear for a people who know.<br><br>12. And if they break their oaths after their agreement and<br>(openly) revile your religion, then fight the leaders of unbelief--<br>surely their oaths are nothing-- so that they may desist.<br><br>13. What! will you not fight a people who broke their oaths<br>and aimed at the expulsion of the Apostle, and they attacked<br>you first; do you fear them? But Allah is most deserving that you<br>should fear Him, if you are believers.<br><br>14. Fight them, Allah will punish them by your hands and<br>bring them to disgrace, and assist you against them and heal the<br>hearts of a believing people.<br><br>15. And remove the rage of their hearts; and Allah turns<br>(mercifully) to whom He pleases, and Allah is Knowing, Wise.<br><br>16. What! do you think that you will be left alone while Allah<br>has not yet known those of you who have struggled hard and<br>have not taken any one as an adherent besides Allah and His<br>Apostle and the believers; and Allah is aware of what you do.<br><br>17. The idolaters have no right to visit the mosques of Allah<br>while bearing witness to unbelief against themselves, these it is<br>whose doings are null, and in the fire shall they abide.<br><br>18. Only he shall visit the mosques of Allah who believes in<br>Allah and the latter day, and keeps up prayer and pays the poor-rate<br>and fears none but Allah; so (as for) these, it may be that<br>they are of the followers of the right course.<br><br>19. What! do you make (one who undertakes) the giving of<br>drink to the pilgrims and the guarding of the Sacred Mosque like<br>him who believes in Allah and the latter day and strives hard in<br>Allah's way? They are not equal with Allah; and Allah does not<br>guide the unjust people.<br><br>20. Those who believed and fled (their homes), and strove<br>hard in Allah's way with their property and their souls, are much<br>higher in rank with Allah; and those are they who are the<br>achievers (of their objects).<br><br>21. Their Lord gives them good news of mercy from Himself<br>and (His) good pleasure and gardens, wherein lasting blessings<br>shall be theirs;<br><br>22. Abiding therein for ever; surely Allah has a Mighty reward<br>with Him.<br><br>23. O you who believe! do not take your fathers and your<br>brothers for guardians if they love unbelief more than belief; and<br>whoever of you takes them for a guardian, these it is that are the<br>unjust.<br><br>24. Say: If your fathers and your sons and your brethren and<br>your mates and your kinsfolk and property which you have<br>acquired, and the slackness of trade which you fear and dwellings<br>which you like, are dearer to you than Allah and His Apostle<br>and striving in His way, then wait till Allah brings about His<br>command: and Allah does not guide the transgressing people.<br><br>25. Certainly Allah helped you in many battlefields and on<br>the day of Hunain, when your great numbers made you vain, but<br>they availed you nothing and the earth became strait to you<br>notwithstanding its spaciousness, then you turned back retreating.<br><br>26.<br>Then Allah sent down His tranquillity upon His Apostle<br>and upon the believers, and sent down hosts which you did not<br>see, and chastised those who disbelieved, and that is the reward<br>of the unbelievers.<br><br>27. Then will Allah after this turn (mercifully) to whom He<br>pleases, and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.<br><br>28. O you who believe! the idolaters are nothing but unclean,<br>so they shall not approach the Sacred Mosque after this year;<br>and if you fear poverty then Allah will enrich you out of His<br>grace if He please; surely Allah is Knowing Wise.<br><br>29. Fight those who do not believe in Allah, nor in the latter<br>day, nor do they prohibit what Allah and His Apostle have<br>prohibited, nor follow the religion of truth, out of those who<br>have been given the Book, until they pay the tax in acknowledgment<br>of superiority and they are in a state of subjection.<br><br>30. And the Jews say: Uzair is the son of Allah; and the<br>Christians say: The Messiah is the son of Allah; these are the<br>words of their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who<br>disbelieved before; may Allah destroy them; how they are turned<br>away!<br><br>31. They have taken their doctors of law and their monks for<br><br>lords besides Allah, and (also) the Messiah son of Marium and<br>they were enjoined that they should serve one God only, there is<br>no god but He; far from His glory be what they set up (with<br>Him).<br><br>32. They desire to put out the light of Allah with their mouths,<br>and Allah will not consent save to perfect His light, though the<br>unbelievers are averse.<br><br>33. He it is Who sent His Apostle with guidance and the<br>religion of truth, that He might cause it to prevail over all<br>religions, though the polytheists may be averse.<br><br>34. O you who believe! most surely many of the doctors of<br>law and the monks eat away the property of men falsely, and<br>turn (them) from Allah's way; and (as for) those who hoard up<br>gold and silver and do not spend it in Allah's way, announce to<br>them a painful chastisement,<br><br>35. On the day when it shall be heated in the fire of hell, then<br>their foreheads and their sides and their backs shall be branded<br>with it; this is what you hoarded up for yourselves, therefore<br>taste what you hoarded.<br><br>36. Surely the number of months with Allah is twelve months<br>in Allah's ordinance since the day when He created the heavens<br>and the earth, of these four being sacred; that is the right<br>reckoning; therefore be not unjust to yourselves regarding them,<br>and fight the polytheists all together as they fight you all together;<br>and know that Allah is with those who guard (against evil).<br><br>37. Postponing (of the sacred month) is only an addition in<br>unbelief, wherewith those who disbelieve are led astray, violating<br>it one year and keeping it sacred another, that they may agree in<br>the number (of months) that Allah has made sacred, and thus<br>violate what Allah has made sacred; the evil of their doings is<br>made fairseeming to them; and Allah does not guide the unbelieving<br>people.<br><br>38. O you who believe! What (excuse) have you that when it is<br>said to you: Go forth in Allah's way, you should incline heavily<br>to earth; are you contented with this world's life instead of the<br>hereafter? But the provision of this world's life compared with<br>the hereafter is but little.<br><br>39. If you do not go forth, He will chastise you with a painful<br>chastisement and bring in your place a people other than you,<br>and you will do Him no harm; and Allah has power over all<br>things.<br><br>40. If you will not aid him, Allah certainly aided him when<br>those who disbelieved expelled him, he being the second of the<br>two, when they were both in the cave, when he said to his<br>companion: Grieve not, surely Allah is with us. So Allah sent<br>down His tranquillity upon him and strengthened him with hosts<br>which you did not see, and made lowest the word of those who<br>disbelieved; and the word of Allah, that is the highest; and Allah<br>is Mighty, Wise.<br><br>41. Go forth light and heavy, and strive hard in Allah's way<br>with your property and your persons; this is better for you, if<br>you know.<br><br>42. Had it been a near advantage and a short journey, they<br>would certainly have followed you, but the tedious journey was<br>too long for them; and they swear by Allah: If we had been able,<br>we would certainly have gone forth with you; they cause their<br>own souls to perish, and Allah knows that they are most surely<br><br>43. Allah pardon you! Why did you give them leave until<br>those who spoke the truth had become manifest to you and you<br>had known the liars?<br><br>44. They do not ask leave of you who believe in Allah and the<br>latter day (to stay away) from striving hard with their property<br>and their persons, and Allah knows those who guard (against<br>evil).<br><br>45. They only ask leave of you who do not believe in Allah<br>and the latter day and their hearts are in doubt, so in their doubt<br>do they waver.<br><br>46. And if they had intended to go forth, they would certainly<br>have provided equipment for it, but Allah did not like their<br>going forth, so He withheld them, and it was said (to them):<br>Hold back with those who hold back.<br><br>47. Had they gone forth with you, they would not have added<br>to you aught save corruption, and they would certainly have<br>hurried about among you seeking (to sow) dissension among<br>you, and among you there are those who hearken for their sake;<br>and Allah knows the unjust.<br><br>48. Certainly they sought (to sow) dissension before, and they<br>meditated plots against you until the truth came, and Allah's<br>commandment prevailed although they were averse (from it).<br><br>49. And among them there is he who says: Allow me and do<br>not try me. Surely into trial have they already tumbled down,<br>and most surely hell encompasses the unbelievers.<br><br>50. If good befalls you, it grieves them, and if hardship afflicts<br>you, they say: Indeed we had taken care of our affair before; and<br>they turn back and are glad.<br><br>51. Say: Nothing will afflict us save what Allah has ordained<br>for us; He is our.Patron; and on Allah let the believers rely.<br><br>52. Say: Do you await for us but one of two most excellent<br>things? And we await for you that Allah will afflict you with<br>punishment from Himself or by our hands. So wait; we too will<br>wait with you.<br><br>53. Say: Spend willingly or unwillingly, it shall not be accepted<br>from you; surely you are a transgressing people.<br><br>54. And nothing hinders their spendings being accepted from<br>them, except that they disbelieve in Allah and in His Apostle and<br>they do not come to prayer but while they are sluggish, and they<br>do not spend but while they are unwilling.<br><br>55. Let not then their property and their children excite your<br>admiration; Allah only wishes to chastise them with these in this<br>world's life and (that) their souls may depart while they are<br>unbelievers.<br><br>56. And they swear by Allah that they are most surely of you,<br>and they are not of you, but they are a people who are afraid (of<br>you).<br><br>57. If they could find a refuge or cave or a place to enter into,<br>they would certainly have turned thereto, running away in all<br>haste.<br><br>58. And of them there are those who blame you with respect<br>to the alms; so if they are given from it they are pleased, and if<br>they are not given from it, lo! they are full of rage.<br><br>59. And if they were content with what Allah and His Apostle<br>gave them, and had said: Allah is sufficient for us; Allah will<br>soon give us (more) out of His grace and His Apostle too; surely<br>to Allah do we make our petition.<br><br>60. Alms are only for the poor and the needy, and the officials<br>(appointed) over them, and those whose hearts are made to<br>incline (to truth) and the (ransoming of) captives and those in<br>debts and in the way of Allah and the wayfarer; an ordinance<br>from Allah; and Allah is knowing, Wise.<br><br>61. And there are some of them who molest the Prophet and<br>say: He is one who believes every thing that he hears; say: A<br>hearer of good for you (who) believes in Allah and believes the<br>faithful and a mercy for those of you who believe; and (as for)<br>those who molest the Apostle of Allah, they shall have a painful<br>punishment.<br><br>62. They swear to you by Allah that they might please you<br>and, Allah, as well as His Apostle, has a greater right that they<br>should please Him, if they are believers.<br><br>63. Do they not know that whoever acts in opposition to<br>Allah and His Apostle, he shall surely have the fire of hell to<br>abide in it? That is the grievous abasement.<br><br>64. The hypocrites fear lest a chapter should be sent down to<br>them telling them plainly of what is in their hearts. Say: Go on<br>mocking, surely Allah will bring forth what you fear.<br><br>65. And if you should question them, they would certainly<br>say: We were only idly discoursing and sporting. Say: Was it at<br>Allah and His communications and His Apostle that you mocked?<br><br>66. Do not make excuses; you have denied indeed after you<br>had believed; if We pardon a party of you, We will chastise<br>(another) party because they are guilty.<br><br>67. The hypocritical men and the hypocritical women are all<br>alike; they enjoin evil and forbid good and withhold their hands;<br>they have forsaken Allah, so He has forsaken them; surely the<br>hypocrites are the transgressors.<br><br>68. Allah has promised the hypocritical men and the hypocritical<br>women and the unbelievers the fire of hell to abide<br>therein; it is enough for them; and Allah has cursed them and<br>they shall have lasting punishment.<br><br>69. Like those before you; they were stronger than you in<br>power and more abundant in wealth and children, so they enjoyed<br>their portion; thus have you enjoyed your portion as those<br>before you enjoyed their portion; and you entered into vain<br>discourses like the vain discourses in which entered those before<br>you. These are they whose works are null in this world and the<br>hereafter, and these are they who are the losers.<br><br>70. Has not the news of those before them come to them; of<br>the people of Nuh and Ad and Samood, and the people of<br>Ibrahim and the dwellers of Madyan and the overthrown cities;<br>their apostles came to them with clear arguments; so it was not<br>Allah Who should do them injustice, but they were unjust to<br>themselves.<br><br>71. And (as for) the believing men and the believing women,<br>they are guardians of each other; they enjoin good and forbid<br>evil and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, and obey Allah<br>and His Apostle; (as for) these, Allah will show mercy to them;<br>surely Allah is Mighty, Wise.<br><br>72. Allah has promised to the believing men and the believing<br>women gardens, beneath which rivers flow, to abide in them,<br>and goodly dwellings in gardens of perpetual abode; and best of<br>all is Allah's goodly pleasure; that is the grand achievement.<br><br>73. O Prophet! strive hard against the unbelievers and the<br>hypocrites and be unyielding to them; and their abode is hell,<br>and evil is the destination.<br><br>74. They swear by Allah that they did not speak, and certainly<br>they did speak, the word of unbelief, and disbelieved after their<br>Islam, and they had determined upon what they have not been<br>able to effect, and they did not find fault except because Allah<br>and His Apostle enriched them out of His grace; therefore if they<br>repent, it will be good for them; and if they turn back, Allah will<br>chastise them with a painful chastisement in this world and the<br>hereafter, and they shall not have in the land any guardian or a<br>helper.<br><br>75. And there are those of them who made a covenant with<br>Allah: If He give us out of His grace, we will certainly give alms<br>and we will certainly be of the good.<br><br>76. But when He gave them out of His grace, they became<br>niggardly of it and they turned back and they withdrew.<br><br>77. So He made hypocrisy to follow as a consequence into<br>their hearts till the day when they shall meet Him because they<br>failed to perform towards Allah what they had promised with<br>Him and because they told lies.<br><br>78. Do they not know that Allah knows their hidden thoughts<br>and their secret counsels, and that Allah is the great Knower of<br>the unseen things?<br><br>79. They who taunt those of the faithful who give their alms<br>freely, and those who give to the extent of their earnings and<br>scoff at them; Allah will pay them back their scoffing, and they<br>shall have a painful chastisement.<br><br>80. Ask forgiveness for them or do not ask forgiveness for<br>them; even if you ask forgiveness for them seventy times, Allah<br>will not forgive them; this is because they disbelieve in Allah and<br>His Apostle, and Allah does not guide the transgressing people.<br><br>81. Those who were left behind were glad on account of their<br>sitting behind Allah's Apostle and they were averse from striving<br>m Allah's way with their property and their persons, and said:<br>Do not go forth in the heat. Say: The fire of hell is much severe<br>in heat. Would that they understood (it).<br><br>82. Therefore they shall laugh little and weep much as a<br>recompense for what they earned.<br><br>83. Therefore if Allah brings you back to a party of them<br>and then they ask your permission to go forth, say: By no means<br>shall you ever go forth with me and by no means shall you fight<br>an enemy with me; surely you chose to sit the first time, therefore<br>sit (now) with those who remain behind.<br><br>84. And never offer prayer for any one of them who dies and<br>do not stand by his grave; surely they disbelieve in Allah and His<br>Apostle and they shall die in transgression.<br><br>85 And let not their property and their children excite your<br>admlration; Allah only wishes to chastise them with these in this<br>world and (that) their souls may depart while they are<br>unbelievers<br><br>86. And whenever a chapter is revealed, saying: Believe in<br>Allah and strive hard along with His Apostle, those having<br>ampleness of means ask permission of you and say: Leave us<br>(behind), that we may be with those who sit.<br><br>87. They preferred to be with those who remained behind,<br>and a seal is set on their hearts so they do not understand.<br><br>88. But the Apostle and those who believe with him strive<br>hard with their property and their persons; and these it is who<br>shall have the good things and these it is who shall be<br>successful.<br><br>89. Allah has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers<br>flow, to abide in them; that is the great achievement.<br>And the defaulters from among the dwellers of the desert<br>came that permission may be given to them and they sat (at<br>home) who lied to Allah and His Apostle; a painful chastisement<br>shall afflict those of them who disbelieved.<br><br>91. It shall be no crime in the weak, nor in the sick, nor in<br>those who do not find what they should spend (to stay behind),<br>so long as they are sincere to Allah and His Apostle; there is no<br>way (to blame) against the doers of good; and Allah is Forgiving,<br>Merciful;<br><br>92. Nor in those who when they came to you that you might<br>carry them, you said: I cannot find that on which to carry you;<br>they went back while their eyes overflowed with tears on account<br>of grief for not finding that which they should spend.<br><br>93. The way (to blame) is only against those who ask permission<br>of you though they are rich; they have chosen to be with<br>those who remained behind, and Allah has set a seal upon their<br>hearts so they do not know.<br><br>94. They will excuse themselves to you when you go back to<br>them. Say: Urge no excuse, by no means will we believe you;<br>indeed Allah has informed us of matters relating to you; and<br>now Allah and His Apostle will see your doings, then you shall<br>be brought back to the Knower of the unseen and the seen, then<br>He will inform you of what you did.<br><br>95. They will swear to you by Allah when you return to them<br>so that you may turn aside from them; so do turn aside from<br>them; surely they are unclean and their abode is hell; a recompense<br>for what they earned.<br><br>96. They will swear to you that you may be pleased with<br>them; but if you are pleased with them, yet surely Allah is not<br>pleased with the transgressing people.<br><br>97. The dwellers of the desert are very hard in unbelief and<br>hypocrisy, and more disposed not to know the limits of what<br>Allah has revealed to His Apostle; and Allah is Knowing, Wise.<br><br>98. And of the dwellers of the desert are those who take what<br>they spend to be a fine, and they wait (the befalling of) calamities<br>to you; on them (will be) the evil calamity; and Allah is Hearing,<br>Knowing.<br><br>99. And of the dwellers of the desert are those who believe in<br>Allah and the latter day and take what they spend to be (means<br>of) the nearness of Allah and the Apostle's prayers; surely it shall<br>be means of nearness for them; Allah will make them enter into<br>His mercy; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.<br><br>100. And (as for) the foremost, the first of the Muhajirs and<br>the Ansars, and those who followed them in goodness, Allah is<br>well pleased with them and they are well pleased with Him, and<br>He has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flOw, to<br>abide in them for ever; that is the mighty achievement.<br><br>101. And from among those who are round about you of the<br>dwellers of the desert there are hypocrites, and from among the<br>people of Medina (also); they are stubborn in hypocrisy; you do<br>not know them; We know them; We will chastise them twice<br>then shall they be turned back to a grievous chastisement<br><br>102. And others have confessed their faults, they have mingled<br>a good deed and an evil one; may be Allah will turn to them<br>(mercifully); surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.<br><br>103. Take alms out of their property, you would cleanse them<br>and purify them thereby, and pray for them; surely your prayer<br>is a relief to them; and Allah is Hearing, Knowing.<br><br>104. Do they not know that Allah accepts repentance from<br>His servants and takes the alms, and that Allah is the Oft-returning<br>(to mercy), the Merciful?<br><br>105. And say: Work; so Allah will see your work and (so will)<br>His Apostle and the believers; and you shall be brought back to<br>the Knower of the unseen and the seen, then He will inform you<br>of what you did.<br><br>106. And others are made to await Allah's command, whether<br>He chastise them or whether He turn to them (mercifully), and<br>Allah is Knowing, Wise.<br><br>107 And those who built a masjid to cause harm and for<br>unbelief and to cause disunion among the believers and an<br>ambush to him who made war against Allah and His Apostle<br>before; and they will certainly swear: We did not desire aught<br>but good; and Allah bears witness that they are most surely<br>liars.<br><br>108. Never stand in it; certainly a masjid founded on piety<br>from the very first day is more deserving that you should stand<br>in it; in it are men who love that they should be purified; and<br>Allah loves those who purify themselves.<br><br>109. Is he, therefore, better who lays his foundation on fear of<br>Allah and (His) good pleasure, or he who lays his foundation on<br>the edge of a cracking hollowed bank, so it broke down with him<br>into the fire of hell; and Allah does not guide the unjust<br>people.<br><br>110. The building which they have built will ever continue to<br>be a source of disquiet in their hearts, except that their hearts get<br>cut into pieces; and Allah is Knowing, Wise.<br><br>111. Surely Allah has bought of the believers their persons<br>and their property for this, that they shall have the garden; they<br>fight in Allah's way, so they slay and are slain; a promise which<br>is binding on Him in the Taurat and the Injeel and the Quran;<br>and who is more faithful to his covenant than Allah? Rejoice<br>therefore in the pledge which you have made; and that is the<br>mighty achievement.<br><br>112. They who turn (to Allah), who serve (Him), who praise<br>(Him), who fast, who bow down, who prostrate themselves, who<br>enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil, and who keep the<br>limits of Allah; and give good news to the believers.<br><br>113. It is not (fit) for the Prophet and those who believe that<br>they should ask forgiveness for the polytheists, even though they<br>should be near relatives, after it has become clear to them that<br>they are inmates of the flaming fire.<br><br>114. And Ibrahim asking forgiveness for his sire was only<br>owing to a promise which he had made to him; but when it<br>became clear to him that he was an enemy of Allah, he declared<br>himself to be clear of him; most surely Ibrahim was very tender-hearted<br>forbearing.<br><br>115. It is not (attributable to) Allah that He should lead a<br>people astray after He has guided them; He even makes clear to<br>them what they should guard against; surely Allah knows all<br>things.<br><br>116. Surely Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the<br>earth; He brings to life and causes to die; and there is not for you<br>besides Allah any Guardian or Helper.<br><br>117. Certainly Allah has turned (mercifully) to the Prophet<br>and those who fled (their homes) and the helpers who followed<br>him in the hour of straitness after the hearts of a part of them<br>were about to deviate, then He turned to them (mercifully);<br>surely to them He is Compassionate, Merciful.<br><br>118. And to the three who were left behind, until the earth<br>became strait to them notwithstanding its spaciousness and their<br>souls were also straitened to them; and they knew it for certain<br>that there was no refuge from Allah but in Him; then He turned<br>to them (mercifully) that they might turn (to Him); surely Allah<br>is the Oft-returning (to mercy), the Merciful.<br><br>119. O you who believe! be careful of (your duty to) Allah<br>and be with the true ones.<br><br>120. It did not beseem the people of Medina and those round<br>about them of the dwellers of the desert to remain behind the<br>Apostle of Allah, nor should they desire (anything) for themselves<br>in preference to him; this is because there afflicts them not<br>thirst or fatigue or hunger in Allah's way, nor do they tread a<br>path which enrages the unbelievers, nor do they attain from the<br>enemy what they attain, but a good work is written down to<br>them on account of it; surely Allah does not waste the reward of<br>the doers of good;<br><br>121. Nor do they spend anything that may be spent, small or<br>great, nor do they traverse a valley, but it is written down to their<br>credit, that Allah may reward them with the best of what they<br>have done.<br><br>122. And it does not beseem the believers that they should go<br>forth all together; why should not then a company from every<br>party from among them go forth that they may apply themselves<br>to obtain understanding in religion, and that they may warn<br>their people when they come back to them that they may be<br>cautious?<br><br>123. O you who believe! fight those of the unbelievers who are<br>near to you and let them find in you hardness; and know that<br>Allah is with those who guard (against evil).<br><br>124. And whenever a chapter is revealed, there are some of<br>them who say: Which of you has it strengthened in faith? Then<br>as for those who believe, it strengthens them in faith and they<br>rejoice.<br><br>125. And as for those in whose hearts is a disease, it adds<br>uncleanness to their uncleanness and they die while they are<br>unbelievers.<br><br>126. Do they not see that they are tried once or twice in every<br>year, yet they do not turn (to Allah) nor do they mind.<br><br>127. And whenever a chapter is revealed, they cast glances at<br>one another: Does any one see you? Then they turn away: Allah<br>has turned away their hearts because they are a people who do<br>not understand.<br><br>128. Certainly an Apostle has come to you from among yourselves;<br>grievous to him is your falling into distress, excessively<br>solicitous respecting you; to the believers (he is)<br>compassionate,<br><br>129. But if they turn back, say: Allah is sufficient for me,<br>there is no god but He; on Him do I rely, and He is the Lord of<br>mighty power.<br><br>�<br><br>Chapter 9, Koran<br><br>[This message has been edited by KTE (edited 10 February 2002).]</div>
