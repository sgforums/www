            <div class='col-md body'>Well, that's what makes a movie.... over dramatised and exaggrated and not logical.<br><br>E.g scenario 1<br>Our hero encounters a gun fight. MIRACULOUSLY all the bad guys happen to have a -100% hit rate and every bullets graze pass him without him having to dodge. And our dear hero also JUST happen to have 'auto homing satellite guided' weaponery which will 1shot any baddie he happens point his gun to.<br><br>You wun expect the hero run into this situation then get a couple of shots, end up lying in hospital for 1-2months before continuation of story, right? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>E.g scenario 2<br>Some party members die. The heroes/heroines take 1-2minutes to take note of his deathwishes before continuing the story, time seems to freeze at that moment.<br><br>You wun expect the hero to say "ZOMG, he died. Zombies are near let's move on quick?", audiences will say the hero doesn't care about his party <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>E.g scenario 3<br>When there's a haunted house, people will go explore in movies cuz they are 'curious' and certain they can survive it.<br><br>Well, if everyone who sees a haunted house then say "WTF, I'm not going in there", there won't be any movie or story in the first place right? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
