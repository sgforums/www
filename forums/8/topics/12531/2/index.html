            <div class='col-md body'>I think you all got it wrong. Handsome is not a crisis at all, it's just worthless.<br><br>All you need is to be financially sound and be a walking ATM to the ger and most likely you will secure her heart. Come on, be honest. Which educated girl in singapore will stay forever with a handsome guy with no career and money. e.g. A damn handsome Ah beng/bummer or factory workers??<br><br>During teen period, maybe they will hang around those handsome chap but i can bet with you it would not be long b4 they break off and the girl will settle down for a not so handsome guy whose wallet are fat enuff to support her. That explain why most pretty girl who want status go with guys are who are not so handsome but financially stable.<br>This is maybe because handsome guy play too much, have too many girlfriends etc and hence can never be considered stable compared to the others in the eye of these educated pretty girl.<br><br>Maybe you might like to ask how about those rare cases of handsome guy with bright future?  Needless to ask, they are rare and most girls do not get a chance to know them when they are single cos they are snatched up immediately by the other girls. And normally these girls who are singaporean are those not so pretty one. You want to know why? Cos all those pretty singaporean girl are too proud and snobbish to even be friendly to the guy at all. Furthermore, there is also the competition from foreign girls who are not snobbish and damn friendly to these bright handsome chap. With so much competition plus the snobbish altitude of the pretty singaporean girls, what end up would be their late marriage when they finally give up, being desperate and hence settle down with those not so handsome rich guy.<br><br>These are my personal opinion. No need to flame if you think otherwise.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>One more question. What about those both ugly and zhobo/poor "Bu wu zhen ye" guy?. Well, mostly i would say MOSTLY they will contribute to the small percentage of single men in singapore unless they can find some girl who are do not mind them. And mostly i can bet, these girl will not be those classic pretty singaporean girl who are flooding along the orchard road. This is because even those not pretty girl will also look down on these poor guys and rather remain single contributing more to the problem of singlehood pple in singapore than to anyhow settle down with them.<br><br>The morale of the story is it's ok to be ugly but rich. Cos in the end, there will always be a girl for you. And being handsome is just worthless unless you intend to be a gigolo or a guy who live off woman (most probably old rich woman).<br><br>And by the way, i got a few real life example of a friend's guy friend who is damn handsome but still single until now when he is closing to 40 years old. However, he is soon getting married. Why? Becos he finally found a fat Malaysian girl who does not mind his status to settle down in singapore when all the singaporean "Lao Chu Nu" (Old Virgin) are not even showing interest in him cos he is working as a delivery man all his life. Needless to say, all the young singaporean girl don't even know his existence. Wat a joke for being handsome. You can jump into the singapore river and no sg girl even notice you. And depend on your luck whether a foreigner girl walk by to save you or not.<br><br>Again these are my personal opinions.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 25 October 2001).]</div>

How about the rest of the girls?<br><br>I agree every guy would rather be handsome than to be ugly but what i want to state here is handsome is not a crisis nor is it a plus plus point. It's just worthless if you are toking about attraction to singaporean girl compared to other criteria. The idea here is that you got to be rich in order to make the difference. Even if you are ugly, you still can fair better than those poor handsome guy who thought they got extra ordinary gift being handsome. There's nothing to boast about to anyone if you are damn handsome. It's your wallet that shine to Sg Girl. Be practical. You want pretty gf, start working hard instead of being vain and boasting your handsomeness here. I would rather keep quiet even if i am damn handsome and there also no need to comfort yourself blabbering excuses if you are non-handsome people. There is nothing personal to be involved but facts.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 26 October 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Want to hear another story?<br><br>Well, that happened in real life to my friend's girl friend whom i met. she is quite a pretty slim lady in her early 20+ working as an admin executive in an MNC company and her guy whom she ROMed with is a Manager in the financial sector earning big buck owning big car for a few month. And guess you should somehow guess how this manager look like. He is a damn fat ugly asshole who like to flirt around with his sexy bitchy secretary. Then guess what happen next? He wanted to a divorce with her because he find her being too sensitive to his flirtatious lifestyle.<br><br>And as usual, this girl can not take it and commited suicides unsuccessful for a few time. The first time i met her with a gang of friends was when she just got discharged from hospital and she fainted again in the girl toilet. Kind of sad to see her pathetic state crazing over such a fat rich asshole. Even in hospital she threaten to cut her wrist again if her husband in name does not come and see her. Of course, the fatso did came but gave her another hit for a clean break-off. All this while, one of my friend's handsome guy friend who actually like this girl alot was helping out her like it's his own business. And he being a 'A' level holder is working as a supervisor in a small factory. So they went along well as friend during the girl's sad and moody time.<br><br>And guess what he was rejected some time ago and the girl went steady again with another not so handsome degree holder working in an insurance company. And want to know what happened to the fatso manager? he ROMed with his sexy bitchy secretary. And so we have our handsome little poor guy being single and available. Any girl interested?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That explain why most pretty girl are seen with rich and ugly pple. Cos the rich guy can change partner until he got the prettiest and sexy babe in town in his bed. Once he is satisfied, maybe he will not change.<br><br>As for your choice, i have no comment. But i had stated both have the same level of faithfulness. If the non-so handsome guy can flirt around, so can the poor handsome guy. And with such equal condition, you choose to live in hardship. Let's hope you made the right choice then. Not all rich guy are as bad as you think cos it depend on character. And not all poor guy are as faithful as you think, same principle apply.<br><br>My comparison is purely between A) Look B) Money, which one appeal to you girls more.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 26 October 2001).]</div>

I am surprised that your ideal ans contradict with what you had previously said. But nevertheless, I respect your answer. So how about the rest of the girls?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I heard from this from somewhere...quite interesting. This person said, 'Nowadays alot of ugly guys also not trustworthy...since guys will eventually run off, we might as well get a handsome one...at least which is better? A handsome bf ran off or an ugly bf ran off? Obivously get the handsome one lah! Ugly one also run off, gals...very lose face leh...shows that you can't even charm an ugly guy!'....haha...anyway, this is just meant to be a joke lah. Looks dun actually constitute to faithfulness...if he is the faithful kind, he will be regardless of how he looks. If he is the playboy...now, ugly guys also know how to sweet talk and cheat gals mah...who also can be playboy...how will we gals know whether a certain guy is playboy or not just by judging their looks? Well...my bf also quite cute mah...but he is still so nice to me after more than 2 yrs...he dun even give a damn about other gals. Other gals like him, he also dun look at them, even keep calling me in front of her to let her know she has no chance.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I guess...if you found the right one, he is the right one...no need care he handsome or not...even if he is a playboy, you're the right one, he might change from playboy to faithful boy leh?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>So if you're a cute guy, you need to work even harder if you wanna find true love, you need to let the other person have confidence in you, let them understand though you cute, you not playboy. Sincerity, patience plus lots of effort is very important to win her over. Gals basically need lots of security, they dun accept handsome boys cos they dun give them any sense of security...but once they have that sense of security, that should do the job...and obivously, not forgetting, they must have that chemistry with you lah...if they really dun love you, have no feeling for you, then too bad. But if they also fond of you, just that you handsome they dun accept you, then you need to give them lots of security feeling...stop flirting or talking alot to other gals! That will help alot!<br><br>[This message has been edited by Twiggie (edited 26 October 2001).]</div>

Think that might not be an appropriate move. If got all the extra $$ to go for facial surgery, why not send yourself go better to make yourself more beautiful and him remain the same, then he will not go flirt around right?</div>
