            <div class='col-md body'>From TNP Electric NewPaper dated 04 Feb 2006<br>The NewPaper<br><br>Her role costs Jack a bomb<br>February 04, 2006<br><br>IT'S the first time that Fann Wong is starring in a Jack Neo movie, but she has already made him cry.<br><br>--SHIN MIN DAILY NEWS<br>The 46-year-old director pretended to burst into tears when we asked him about the cost of casting an A-lister like Fann in his new film.<br><br>'In all my years of making movies, I've never paid an actor so much money before! She's been to Hollywood, okay?'<br><br>Just Follow Law is a pun on the Singlish phrase 'just follow lor', and is a satire about red tape in the civil service.<br><br>Set in a fictitious government agency, it stars Fann Wong as an idealistic vice-president and Gurmit Singh as a blue-collar technician who swop souls after a car accident.<br><br>The movie is slated for release in May.<br><br>Jack wanted a change and decided not to use his usual bunch of J Team artistes like Mark Lee, Henry Thia and Patricia Mok.<br><br>But the decision cost him a lot - a six-figure sum to be exact, for Fann's name in the credits.<br><br>This is even more than what Jack is getting for being in the director's chair.<br><br>Still pretending to cry, he continued: 'I broached the subject of this movie two years ago, and actually tailored the role for her. But I didn't realise how much it would cost me! I want to be a mei nu (Chinese for beauty) too, in my next life!'<br><br>But Jack has a big challenge in store for Fann.<br><br>Her sweet princess image will be thrown out of the window for this movie, as she has to spew vulgarities and play the uncouth lout.<br><br>Jack believes she can do it, as she's a 'very professional actress'.<br><br>Fann is just relieved that she doesn't have to speak Hokkien.<br><br>Just Follow Law will be mostly in English, a move away from Jack's previous movies that were in Mandarin heavily laced with dialect.<br><br>Fann, a Hakka, said: 'I was so worried before I got the script. Now I'm relieved, because my Hokkien is really lousy.'<br><br>Fann dogged by ill luck<br>But her fortune may be looking up, starting with new film Just Follow Law<br>By Wendy Teo<br>February 04, 2006<br><br>THE year of the Dog almost didn't get off to a woofing good start for Fann Wong.<br><br>--SHIN MIN DAILY NEWS<br>The MediaCorp actress was as sick as a dog during the first two days of the festive season. It was from a persistent virus that had been plaguing her for a week.<br><br>And on the day before Chinese New Year's Eve, she crashed her beloved two-year-old Porsche Cayenne SUV into a pillar at her condo's carpark.<br><br>When she spoke to reporters at the prayer ceremony for her latest movie Just Follow Law, which will be directed by Jack Neo, Fann's voice was still raspy.<br><br>The 35-year-old said that she was already feeling terrible when we last spoke to her the week before, just before the premiere of the animated movie Zodiac.<br><br>'I had a high fever, suffered from body aches and my throat was badly swollen. Halfway through the premiere, I messaged my manager and told her I'd better go to the hospital.'<br><br>She was not hospitalised, but was sent home with a three-day medical certificate.<br><br>However, just two days later, Fann was back at work rehearsing for MediaCorp's annual Chinese New Year special.<br><br>That added to her bad throat, and Fann had to spend her new year recuperating at home.<br><br>In her hurry to get to work, she also accidentally backed her car into a pillar at home.<br><br>Fortunately, the pillar took most of the damage while Fann's car suffered a dent on the bumper.<br><br>She blamed medication for causing her lapse in judgement.<br><br>'I'm a very careful driver. But I just had my medication before I went out of my house, so maybe that's why. So now I firmly believe no-one should drive under medication.'<br><br>Even though it's not the first time that she has scratched her car, Fann still insists it's not her driving skills that are at fault.<br><br>And she pooh-poohed the idea that her SUV might be too big for her.<br><br>In cheeky defiance, she said: 'I like the size of my car because I go to China for filming often, and it is big enough for all my suitcases. And I think I'm a good driver. My car is not too big, it's always the carparks that are too small!'<br><br>Anyway, Fann is now hoping that her spate of bad luck will 'purge' her of other misfortunes for the rest of the year.<br><br>She said: 'Some people believe minor illnesses bring good fortune, so maybe this will bring me luck!'<br><br></div>

She's been to Hollywood, okay?'<br><br>Just Follow Law is a pun on the Singlish phrase 'just follow lor', and is a satire about red tape in the civil service.<br><br>Set in a fictitious government agency, it stars Fann Wong as an idealistic vice-president and Gurmit Singh as a blue-collar technician who swop souls after a car accident.<br><br>The movie is slated for release in May.<br><br>Jack wanted a change and decided not to use his usual bunch of J Team artistes like Mark Lee, Henry Thia and Patricia Mok.<br><br>But the decision cost him a lot - a six-figure sum to be exact, for Fann's name in the credits.<br><br>This is even more than what Jack is getting for being in the director's chair.<br><br>Still pretending to cry, he continued: 'I broached the subject of this movie two years ago, and actually tailored the role for her. But I didn't realise how much it would cost me! I want to be a mei nu (Chinese for beauty) too, in my next life!'<br><br>But Jack has a big challenge in store for Fann.<br><br>Her sweet princess image will be thrown out of the window for this movie, as she has to spew vulgarities and play the uncouth lout.<br><br>Jack believes she can do it, as she's a 'very professional actress'.<br><br>Fann is just relieved that she doesn't have to speak Hokkien.<br><br>Just Follow Law will be mostly in English, a move away from Jack's previous movies that were in Mandarin heavily laced with dialect.<br><br>Fann, a Hakka, said: 'I was so worried before I got the script. Now I'm relieved, because my Hokkien is really lousy.'<br><br>Fann dogged by ill luck<br>But her fortune may be looking up, starting with new film Just Follow Law<br>By Wendy Teo<br>February 04, 2006<br><br>THE year of the Dog almost didn't get off to a woofing good start for Fann Wong.<br><br>--SHIN MIN DAILY NEWS<br><strong>The MediaCorp actress was as sick as a dog during the first two days of the festive season. It was from a persistent virus that had been plaguing her for a week.<br><br>And on the day before Chinese New Year's Eve, she crashed her beloved two-year-old Porsche Cayenne SUV into a pillar at her condo's carpark.</strong><br><br>When she spoke to reporters at the prayer ceremony for her latest movie Just Follow Law, which will be directed by Jack Neo, Fann's voice was still raspy.<br><br>The 35-year-old said that she was already feeling terrible when we last spoke to her the week before, just before the premiere of the animated movie Zodiac.<br><br>'I had a high fever, suffered from body aches and my throat was badly swollen. Halfway through the premiere, I messaged my manager and told her I'd better go to the hospital.'<br><br>She was not hospitalised, but was sent home with a three-day medical certificate.<br><br>However, just two days later, Fann was back at work rehearsing for MediaCorp's annual Chinese New Year special.<br><br>That added to her bad throat, and Fann had to spend her new year recuperating at home.<br><br>In her hurry to get to work, she also accidentally backed her car into a pillar at home.<br><br>Fortunately, the pillar took most of the damage while Fann's car suffered a dent on the bumper.<br><br>She blamed medication for causing her lapse in judgement.<br><br>'I'm a very careful driver. But I just had my medication before I went out of my house, so maybe that's why. So now I firmly believe no-one should drive under medication.'<br><br>Even though it's not the first time that she has scratched her car, Fann still insists it's not her driving skills that are at fault.<br><br>And she pooh-poohed the idea that her SUV might be too big for her.<br><br>In cheeky defiance, she said: 'I like the size of my car because I go to China for filming often, and it is big enough for all my suitcases. And I think I'm a good driver. My car is not too big, it's always the carparks that are too small!'<br><br>Anyway, Fann is now hoping that her spate of bad luck will 'purge' her of other misfortunes for the rest of the year.<br><br>She said: 'Some people believe minor illnesses bring good fortune, so maybe this will bring me luck!'<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>U say ZT fans blind..
