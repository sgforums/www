THis gal is my classmate and for dunno y recently we kinda click along so well that we become best friends.<br><br>Peacock, my fren likes this gal.<br><br>Her name is Charcoal.<br><br>Charcoal and i were v close, like erm best frens. We talk alots, suan each other also... Basically jus having fun.<br><br>Recently things got so well that we will chat frm midnight 2 to 6 in the morning.<br><br>We were happy as frens but recently something change..  I suspect she likes me. Cause yesterday, we were talking like usual and then i start to mention abt my life in N A, how stress it is and stuff. THen we talk abt our dreams and told her i wanted to go poly. THen she told me she don have this intention of going poly.<br><br>THen i told her that i want everything to b perfect, like studies, games and watever..<br><br>She became sad out of the sudden.. then she keeps wanting to log off and telling me "bye, i'm off.. haiz" I was like shock as i dunno wat i done to make her feel sad!<br><br>Jus a moment ago, another thing happened. THis time she asked me for help in a assisgnment. When i agreed to help her, she told me "Ai ni wor, thankx" Then she keep saying "Ai ni" and stuff..<br><br>Not only these things, most of the time when i didn't reply her msg or i am offline.. She will sms me and say "hey why so fast offline? Stupid boy why never reply my msg" and stuff like that.<br><br>ANd jus now, she went to slp and left a sms saying that she wanted to tell me things, but dun want liao.<br><br>Ok right now, if she really likes me i really dunno how to answer her as:<br><br>I only treat her as a fren, no special feelings.<br><br>I don wish to reject her as it will hurt her feelings, i don wish to accept her also.<br><br>It will b awkard if she really confess to me..<br><br>Like i mentioned b4, my fren peacock likes her! i don wanna hurt my fren feelings also. And i will never fight with frens for a gal..<br><br>I jus wanna know, how am i gonna ans her if she really confess to me<br></span></div></blockquote>Come on, how can this in anyway be deep shit? No disregard to the girl's feelings though, but there are worse situations to be stuck in.<br><br>Just be honest with her if she ever asks you and say you have no feelings for her. But tell her that you will always be a friend for her.<br><br>How she takes it is totally not in your hands. You could just make it less painful for her.<br><br>I don't feel there's any need to blame yourself if you haven't been giving her wrong signals.</div>
