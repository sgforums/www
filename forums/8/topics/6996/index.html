            <div class='col-md body'>Any soccer fans here watched the game...me got up early to watch despite having to work..but i'm just too disappointed with Chelsea performance...I think they lose not to Luis Figo, but to Vialli!!!! He got all the tatics wrong...Which team on earth can soak up the pressure in Nou Camp???? what make he think he can do that...If u wanted to, he should use 5-3-2 , not 4-4-2!!!!<br>Moreover, when 2 nil down, he should change players, use Petrescu instead of Lamourde...take down Descamp for Poyet...When Barcelona bring on Dani, take out Zola and put in Thome to beef up the defence....If he did that, i think Dani will not score the third goal and Chelsea will be through...<br>Anyway, i believe this the most exciting match i seen so far this season, got lots of goals, a miss penalty for Rivaldo, one red card, stupid vs smart tatics, and the superb display by Luis Figo...maybe Chelsea should ask their players to give Figo at least two crunching tackles on his ankle, then he will not fly too much...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tuesday April 18, 2000, 11:29 PM London Time<br>Rivaldo wins in a night of hit and miss<br>By Nigel Clarke and Sean Smith<br><br>Barcelona 5-1 Chelsea (6-4 on agg, aet)<br>Chelsea looked to have survived a penalty let-off in their Champions League quarter-final second leg, but as the tie moved into extra time, the World Footballer of the Year had other ideas.<br>Rivaldo, seemingly conspicuous by his absent influence at Stamford Bridge a fortnight ago, let the West London side off late in the second half with an incredulous miss from the spot after he had been felled by Frank Leboeuf.<br><br>But as the tie slipped into extra-time Chelsea were made to pay for an overly respectful defensive performance when Luis Figo ran through on the right of the penalty area only to be scythed down by Celestine Babayaro, who received his marching orders for a professional foul.<br><br>There was little complaint from a Chelsea defence that had relied on the wit and agility of their Dutch keeper Ed de Goey for much of normal time.<br><br>Rivaldo stepped up immediately in the intensest of atmospheres and proved that it is not only skill that determines the truly great, but an iron will and total belief, to place his penalty exactly where he meant the first to go - in de Goey's bottom right-hand corner.<br><br>It was the seminal point of a pulsating match that had swung dramatically both ways.<br><br>Chelsea had looked a beaten side when they were two down at half-time but manager Gianluca Vialli came up with the right answers in the moment of greatest need and was rewarded for never flinching from having the courage of his own convictions.<br><br>Vialli had watched on almost helplessly as Chelsea's dreams of glory seemed set to be obliterated in the Nou Camp by the passions of Catalonia.<br><br>In just 45 minutes, all the wonderful work that produced a 3-1 win at Stamford Bridge had been undone with a Rivaldo free-kick which deflected off Frank Leboeuf and the coolest of finishes by Luis Figo.<br><br>It looked for all the world that Figo's reply in the first leg would be the pivotal moment in the tie. Vialli could have panicked. Instead, he made just one change for the second half, sending on Bernard Lamborde for Albert Ferrer.<br><br>But whatever he said was inspirational. Chelsea sensed Barca wavering and, on the hour, they cracked. Ruud Hesp's shocking clearance straight to Tore Andre Flo gave the Norwegian the chance to claim his eighth goal of the Champions League campaign.<br><br>With seven minutes left on the clock Dani snatched the goal that level things up again and, with Rivaldo missing from the spot, the match went to extra time.<br><br>Chelsea needed only to look at the team Louis Van Gaal had ranged against them to know this was to be the ultimate test of their character and nerve.<br><br>There was never any doubt that the mantra was 'Attack, attack, attack'. With Dutch winger Boudewijn Zenden brought in on the left and Rivaldo tucking into midfield, Van Gaal's team was effectively playing with six bombing forward.<br><br>Vialli knew the men he needed to be strong. Marcel Desailly and Frank Leboeuf had to stand up to the challenge, Dennis Wise and Didier Deschamps needed to cover every blade of this famous turf.<br><br>Barca had scored 22 goals in their six previous home Champions League games. It seemed to mean the first half would be absolutely vital in determining the pattern of the most important match in Chelsea's history.<br><br>And, if Chelsea needing any further reminding, they were confronted as they walked out by a mosaic of coloured placards spelling out Barca's forecast - a 2-0 victory.<br><br>It was a sensational sight. The question was whether it would herald a sensational night.<br><br>From the outset, Barca dominated possession, with Chelsea hurrying and scurrying merely to close down the options.<br><br>Zenden, hugging the left touch-line, induced a foul from Albert Ferrer - back on home territory - within 40 seconds. The caution meant he could not afford another mistake.<br><br>Leboeuf was also embarrassed by Rivaldo out on the right and, as Barca passed and probed to find Chelsea's weak spot, the danger signals were all on red.<br><br>Chelsea were playing a narrow four in midfield, Jody Morris trying to push on Pep Guardiola with Roberto Di Matteo on the left, and, even though they could not put Barca under any defensive pressure, Desailly and Leboeuf seemed to be coping well enough.<br><br>The only real threat early on came when Zenden released the overlapping Phillip Cocu for a superb near-post cross which Patrick Kluivert could not quite reach under pressure from Leboeuf.<br><br>For all that Barcelona had the ball, Ed De Goey did not have a save to make until he was beaten for the first time after 24 minutes.<br><br>It was Rivaldo who gave the Nou Camp what it wanted. Deschamps' foul on him 30 yards out spelled trouble and, although it was not Rivaldo's greatest contact with that magical left foot, it still produced a goal.<br><br>A fraction lower and Leboeuf, at one end of the wall, would have blocked it. Instead, the flick off his shoulder sent the ball arcing beyond a stranded De Goey.<br><br>Rivaldo's reaction was to urge the crowd to even greater intensity, to promote the irresistible rhythm that has seen Barca recover from similar European deficits four times previously.<br><br>Chelsea had to react as well, to avoid being swamped. Led by Morris, slowly beginning to link play, they began to make some inroads, even if the ball was not being held up at the front.<br><br>They might have stolen an equaliser when Ferrer closed down Frank De Boer's short back pass 10 minutes before the interval. The defender blocked keeper Ruud Hesp's hurried clearance but the rebound sailed wide.<br><br>Van Gaal's side remained in the ascendancy, Gabri's low ball from the right sailing across De Goey's six-yard box, before Chelsea squandered a golden chance.<br><br>Gianfranco Zola was lucky to be awarded a corner but, when he delivered to the back post, Flo rose all alone.<br><br>If he had hit the target, Hesp was helpless. Instead, the striker powered his effort too high and Chelsea's reaction suggested they feared it might prove the most important moment of the tie.<br><br>The point was underlined five minutes later when Barca grabbed their second with the last kick of the half.<br><br>Figo played in to Kluivert, who took two touches before firing right-footed from 20 yards. The shot hit the post and pinged back to Figo's feet, and the Portuguese striker kept his head to pick his spot in the opposite corner.<br><br>The goal brought the scores level on aggregate but the Spaniards were in front by virtue of their away goal.<br><br>Chelsea walked off dispirited at the interval. Desailly seemed to be struggling to lift his legs; Vialli had to find the way to lift their heads.<br><br>Somehow Vialli found it and Flo's strike put the London club back in front, but there was more drama to come.<br><br>Dani, on for Zenden, twice came close with headers only to make it third time lucky. But when Rivaldo somehow side-footed wide from 12 yards Chelsea were alive again.<br><br>It was to be a brief return, as Rivaldo put his miss behind him. Patrick Kluivert's header late on in the first-half reconfirmed the Catalans' status as one of the favourites for this year's title.<br><br>It took a shrewd person to bet on them after their Stamford Bridge humiliation. It would take a braver person to bet against them now.<br><br>Copyright Â©1999 ESPN Internet Ventures. Click here for Terms of Use and Privacy Policy applicable to this site.

            <div class='col-md body'>Tuesday April 18, 2000, 10:59 PM London Time<br>Chelsea torture as Rivaldo gets his revenge<br>By Nigel Clarke<br>Dani, the striker who floored Chelsea in the Cup-winners' Cup last season, struck again to take Barcelona into the Champions League semi finals.<br><br>Tore Andre Flo had thrown Chelsea a 60th minute lifeline after Barcelona had gone 2-0 up to lead on away goals.<br><br>But just when it seemed that Gianluca Vialli's side had booked their semi-final place, Dani, who scored a crucial away goal for Real Mallorca in the Cup-winners Cup semi-final last year, put Barcelona 3-1 ahead in the 83rd minute to set up the thrilling climax.<br><br>Then after the Catalans had finally eased 4-1 ahead Dani crossed from the right for Patrick Kluivert to rise above Bernarde Lambourde and head the crucial fifth goal. From that moment of torture there was no way back for Chelsea.<br><br>Barcelona had come within an ace of sealing the tie in normal time but Rivaldo, FIFA's Player of the Year, made a mess of a penalty awarded for a foul by Frank Leboeuf.<br><br>However nine minutes into extra time Celestine Babayaro gave away another penalty and was sent off for that foul on Luis Figo. This time Rivaldo made it 4-1.<br><br>Chelsea went into the match with a 3-1 advantage but that was reduced after 24 minutes when a free-kick by Rivaldo was deflected into the net off the shoulder of Leboeuf with goalkeeper Ed De Goey wrong-footed.<br><br>It was a cruel way to concede a goal - and things got even worse for Chelsea when Barcelona struck again with the last action of the first half.<br><br>Home fans had been losing patience with Barcelona, who had gone into the match after four successive defeats - the last three by 3-1 margins - but they were back in top form and centre forward Patrick Kluivert picked his way past two tackles and hit a right-foot shot from the edge of the penalty area.<br><br>De Goey was completely beaten but saw the ball cannon off his right-hand post and back into play.<br><br>However, before Chelsea could clear the ball, the unmarked Luis Figo unmarked had time to settle himself and drive a right-footed shot into the net.<br><br>Barcelona's manager Louis Van Gaal had always promised that his side could score the necessary goals in the return leg. It began to look as if he was right - and highlighted the importance of their goal at Stamford Bridge two weeks ago.<br><br>Chelsea knew they had to score to remain in the competition. But, in fact, it was Barcelona who came closest to killing the tie with a third goal but this time De Goey was able to smother Rivaldo's shot after the Chelsea defence had been split by a lovely move.<br><br>However, somehow Chelsea found fresh reserves of commitment to exert their own pressure. Hesp, always uncertain when the ball was in the air, looked far from secure and he was stranded when Didier Deschamps miskicked from only six when he might have scored.<br><br>Chelsea's pressure was rewarded, however, and they had thank Hesp for getting back into the game. In attempting to clear the goalkeeper kicked the ball straight at Flo, who gathered himself sufficiently to drive left footed into the unguarded net.<br><br>Then Dani scored with a glancing header after winning a dubious free kick. The match was never going to end tamely, however, and Chelsea's hopes were kept alive when Rivaldo missed from the penalty spot.<br><br>Copyright Â©1999 ESPN Internet Ventures.

            <div class='col-md body'>Rivaldo completes Barcelona's resurrection<br><br>By Reuters, 2000-04-18<br><br>Dennis Wise leaves the field after his side had been crushed by Barcelona<br><br>BARCELONA, April 18 (Reuters) - Barcelona showed that reports of their demise have been greatly exaggerated as extra-time goals from Rivaldo and Patrick Kluivert swept them to a classic 5-1 victory over Chelsea for a 6-4 aggregate success and a place in the Champions League semifinals against Valencia.<br><br>Louis van Gaal's side, who lost the first leg 3-1 and then went on to record three successive 3-0 defeats in domestic matches, roared their way back to life to reveal the sort of character befiting their earlier status as European Cup favourites.<br><br>Goals from Rivaldo, a deflected free kick after 24 minutes, and Luis Figo, after a brilliant piece of work from the Portuguese after 45 minutes, got the home side back in the tie and brought the aggregate score to 3-3 with Barcelona having the advantage of an away goal.<br><br>Chelsea then went 4-3 up on aggregate when Tore Andre Flo, the scourge of Barca at Stamford Bridge, latched on to a poor clearance from Ruud Hesp to smash in on the hour-mark.<br><br>What followed, in the remaining hour of the match, was absolutely riveting as a 98,000 crowd at the Nou Camp willed their side to victory.<br><br>Chelsea held on to their advantage until seven minutes from the end of normal time, but lost it when Dani nodded down and in to level up the match 3-1 on the night and 4-4 on aggregate.<br><br>There was then an astonishing incident two minutes later when Franck Leboeuf brought down Kluivert and the referee awarded a penalty. However play continued and Kluivert, regained his balance to slip the ball into the net, thinking he had scored.<br><br>Swedish referee Anders Frisk though had blown for the infringement and awarded a penalty, which Rivaldo then fired wide of Ed De Goey's right-hand post -- effectively sending the match into extra time.<br><br>After 97 minutes Celestine Babarayo handed Rivaldo a second chance fron the spot although he was sent off for hauling down Figo.<br><br>Rivaldo, holding his nerve as befits the World and European Player of the Year, shot to the right of De Goey again, but this time the ball hit the back of the net.<br><br>That made it 4-1 and 5-4 on aggregate and there was to be no way back for Chelsea after that.<br><br>Kluivert completed the scoring after 105 minutes, nodding in a Dani cross, and Barca had clinched one of the more remarkable comebacks in their 101-uear history, certainly good enough to rank with wins over Gothenburg in 1986 and Dynamo Kiev in 1993.<br><br>Dani, whose introduction for Boudewijn Zenden in the second half swung the game Barca's way, paid tribute to the supporters.<br><br>"The fans were 10 out of 10," said the striker. "They pushed us throughout the game and that was fundamental."<br><br>Chelsea coach Gianluca Vialli had promised to attack Barca rather than sit on their lead but that proved to be an idle boast as Barcelona dominated from the start and the official match stats showed Barcelona had 72 per cent of possession in the first half to Chelsea's 28 per cent.<br><br>Chelsea came back with more determination in the second half, but in the end had no defence against a rampant Barcelona side, who had five other great scoring chances including one header that hit the bar.<br><br>Valencia will host the first semifinal on May 2 with the return at the Nou Camp on May 10 -- guaranteeing that at least one Spanish club will be in the European Cup final in Paris on May 24.<br><br>There could yet be an all-Spanish final if Real Madrid knock out champions Manchester United in their quarter-final on Wednesday and then go on to eliminate Porto or Bayern Munich in their semifinal.<br><br>Copyright Reuters Limited.
