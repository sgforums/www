What saddens me is the actions of his widow after his death. Is all Sg women like this?<br><br>"John Tan died in Feb 2005 of renal failure, aged 48. He was an engineering graduate from NUS and began his career with JEL (later known as JTC) working his way up to chief engineer. He married a fellow graduate from NUS and they had 2 sons. John spent his entire life slogging for a better life for his family. John was retrenched a few years back and after being unable to find another job, became a taxi driver.<br><br>He worked long hours as a cabby and it took a toll on his health 2 years later. He was diagnosed with kidney problems and required dialysis. John did not have to work so hard as he was financially well-to do but he still continued to slog for the well being of his "family". After being on dialysis, John always felt tired so one of his sons suggested donating a kidney to him. The whole family then went for medical testing to find out whose kidneys is compatible with John's. That was a decision John regretted. He discovered that the blood types of both his sons does not match him. Further DNA testing confirmed his fears.<br><br>Imagine finding out after all these years that your wife had been cheating on you and the 2 boys you brought up were not your sons. (the older boy is an NUS graduate while the younger is in 3rd year at NTU)<br>John became so depressed that he did not carry on with his dailysis nor take his medication. One month later, he passed away.<br><br>John had cash savings of about 280k, his insurance payout was 350k, had 600k in his cpf, hdb mansonaitte vld 550k (fully paid upon his death). All this $$$ went to his widow (except for 300k in cpf which went to the sons). That bitch is now living in John's house with the man who fathered the sons, enjoying life with John's hard earned money."<br><br>Poor John, GOD is fair, there will be retribution for the guilty ones....RIP<br></div></blockquote>based upon this stiory in which u claimed is true, i guess it should reflect badly on married cases wherby husbands start to think whether their sons or daughters is truly their own kins... anyway, my stand is before gettin' married, one should go for a DNA test whether the child that ur spouse is carrying is indeed yours... however, my choice would be that if they are happy where they are now... they should leave it as it is...</div>
