I saw people with blood pouring from them, people on the ground.Ã¢Â€Â�<br><br>There was no claim of responsibility, but officials immediately blamed ETA.

            <div class='col-md body'>Top Worldwide<br><br>Madrid Terrorist Train Bombings Kill at Least 60 (Update4)<br><br>March 11 (Bloomberg) -- At least 60 people were killed in three rush-hour train bombings in Spain's worst-ever terrorist attack. Political leaders blamed Basque group ETA for the Madrid explosions which came three days before general elections.<br><br>The death toll could rise to as many as 125, Efe newswire reported, citing information provided to Spain's National Court. The Red Cross said about 200 people were injured.<br><br>``This is an attack against democracy and liberty,'' said Economy Minister Rodrigo Rato.<br><br>Police had warned of violence ahead of Sunday's general elections pitting the incumbent Popular Party, which has ruled Spain for eight years, against the opposition Socialists. Two weeks ago, police arrested suspected ETA members in a truck laden with explosives headed for Madrid.<br><br>Three bombs exploded today between 7:30 a.m. and 8 a.m. near the Madrid train stations of El Pozo, Santa Eugenia, and Atocha, which is Madrid's main hub serving southern cities, a National Police spokeswoman said. A fourth explosion around the same time came on railroad tracks.<br><br>At least 29 people were killed in one blast, 19 in another and 15 in the third, Spain's TVE said, citing the Interior Ministry.<br><br>``I was working in the garden when it happened and the explosion lifted me off the floor,'' said Eloy Cabezas, 29, a janitor at the Atocha station, in an interview. ``Even the glass dome of the station moved. In the panic, we all ran out.''<br><br>Other Bomb Found<br><br>News reporters who gathered at the Atocha station were evacuated before Spanish police carried out a controlled explosion of a suspicious package found nearby, Spanish television TVE said.<br><br>Television showed images of dozens of victims with heads or arms bandaged, limping and clinging on to rescue workers. The camera showed one train car ripped in half.<br><br>The destroyed train cars were on the line connecting Guadalajara, northeast of Madrid, to the capital city.<br><br>``I hope that these criminals are caught by the police as soon as possible,'' said Zapatero.<br><br>Spanish stocks fell, paced by resort-hotel operator Sol Melia SA. The benchmark IBEX 35 index dropped 140.4 points, or 1.7 percent, in Madrid trading at 10:09 a.m., headed for its largest daily decline in 15 weeks.<br><br>ETA, which has killed about 830 people in its campaign for Basque independence, planned to bomb electricity towers to disrupt the wedding of Spanish Prince Felipe to Letizia Ortiz, a former television news presenter, La Vanguardia reported last week, citing unidentified court officials.<br><br>Spain's main political parties have vowed for years to crush ETA.<br><br>In December Spanish anti-terrorism police arrested people trying to bomb trains on Christmas Eve.<br><br>ETA's worst attack in terms of lives was the 1987 bombing of a shopping center in Barcelona that killed 21 people.<br></div>
