              <p>Actually, your friend is not wrong.</p>
              <p>The mother SHOULD stay at home to take care of the children when the kids are still young , until they go to full day school. Then the mother SHOULD go out and work to supplement household income.</p>
              <p>Young children fare better when taken care by their own parent.</p>
              <p>Do you have a young child ? Or are your children already teenagers ?</p>
              <p>For a cabby to earn $3000 means he must work double shifts. That means he will hardly get to spend much time with his family.</p>
              <p>What's the point of having a family when you don't get to enjoy em ?</p>
              <p>Unless the mother earns much more than the cost of external help to take care of the children. It makes no sense to pay someone else with her income.</p>
              <p>Say she earns $1,500 and take home pay is $1,200  child care costs $1000 , the savings only $200. She might as well just forgo the $200 net income and stay at home to take care of the kids.</p>
              <p>Unless the family is so poor that $200 per month is a big deal.. then they need to decide if it is worth the sacrifice.</p>

              <p>they will eventually become friends ma. Normally the girl will go out with the guys. now guys that are married thier wives or gf is better to make friends. a more close knit relationship. So thier kids can play together n wives n gf together while the men are busy doing guys stuffs.</p>
              <p>Wel , u are going to give a shi|t when they all go out , attend dinners and sh|t. Thats what i've seen so far. The gf especiially the wives are always reasonably good with each other. Because if ur gf or wife being the less experienced one in marriage n kids , its natural to seek help from who else but those closer to your husband. His good friends. She can seek help from HER friends. but trust me , ur friends are not gonna give a sh|t about u next time either as they go thier lives u do yours.</p>

              <p>they will eventually become friends ma. Normally the girl will
              go out with the guys. now guys that are married thier wives or gf
              is better to make friends. a more close knit relationship. So thier
              kids can play together n wives n gf together while the men are busy
              doing guys stuffs.</p>
              <p>Wel , u are going to give a shi|t when they all go out , attend
              dinners and sh|t. Thats what i've seen so far. The gf especiially
              the wives are always reasonably good with each other. Because if ur
              gf or wife being the less experienced one in marriage n kids , its
              natural to seek help from who else but those closer to your
              husband. His good friends. She can seek help from HER friends. but
              trust me , ur friends are not gonna give a sh|t about u next time
              either as they go thier lives u do yours.</p>

              <p>You speak as if there is only 1 kind of people in this earth n generalise that her close friends can just WHAM come to a dinner. Maybe u should ask what kind of dinner it is. Not all dinners u can just ask anybody to join right ? Are u like.. thinking that there is perhaps not just 1 kind of dinner ? Sure she has close friends , i go dinner with her close friends. why not. It will just be another social circle which is hers. Maybe u dont know that if i am the one earning the money. Business associates n close friends together , my dinner with them will be more frquent ? Let me make it more simple and extreme for you since u always like to pick the extremes of a statement. Outside.. its my world. at home its her world.</p>
              <p>Oh n about giving a sh|t about my own baby.. so..where did i say i wont give a sh|t about my baby when the baby is born ? Are u another that alway assume or.. maybe have problems understanding my statement hence coming out with ur own opinion . I know for sure , when my baby is born. i WILL be sleeping on the couch.. because i am gonna need my fuking sleep to go work next day.</p>

              <p>seriously.. its all on surface all one big family. yes.. at least that is keeping us from bullshitting each other n fuking ourselves in the @ss. Well, have u thought maybe if the wives are all close,  they have more control on thier husbands ? More info n intel... promotes healthy competition  for us as men.</p>
