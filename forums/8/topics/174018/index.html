            <div class='col-md body'>Pongal is a traditional Indian Harvest Festival also known as Sankaranthi. It is a community festival to celebrate a plentiful harvest.<br>Pongal is a festival when god is praised with a simple faith and sincerity. Old vices are all washed out and all that is good is welcomed in this New Year. This festival concerns all living things. Pongal celebrates the rice harvest, so they use the new rice they have just picked. After they offer it to the gods, everyone shares the treats. They also offer the gods clay statues of horses to thank them for sending rain for the growing rice.<br><br></div>
