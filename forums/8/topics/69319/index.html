            <div class='col-md body'>laurence, the theory about savants is that they focus very narrowly upon one mental function, say, memory.  They may be able to recall the scores of every FA cup match all the way back to 1950, or something of the sort.  There does not seem to be anything they can do that no ordinary person cannot do to a lesser extent - instead, they take an ordinary human function and perform it to an amazing level.</div>
