            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Littleman,<br>As to your question maybe I can answer cause I have reached that level. Well Racism to me means descrimination &amp; prejudices against other races or skin tones.<br>As a matter of fact I have been married to someone who is of different race, different language group. Till now there has been no differnce in opinions. I do respect her religion and vice versa. This this sound like Racism.<br>You might not want to get committed to some ger who is of different race, maybe cause u feel uncomfortable with the peson. or Lack of self confidence.<br><br>What do u think?
