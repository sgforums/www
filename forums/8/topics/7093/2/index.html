Let's see, i know durian and laksa through my senses (taste and smell) but i am also influenced by <span style="font-style: italic;">media</span> to differentiate between the white and the blacks ... for example, recently i watched a musical in Manchester. It is called Fame. In that musical, all actors/actresses are white except one. And that only black actor acted as someone who :<br><br>a. cannot read and write<br>b. too proud of himself and refuse to learn<br>c. only person in that musical who fail to pass his exams and he is detained at the end of the show<br><br>this musical already sent a strong message to me. And it shaped the way i differentiate the white from the blacks, just like how i differentiate between durian and laksa. One is by mental senses, one is by physical senses.<br><br>there is this sub-concious biasedness i have against the black though not strong. I can actually go all the way out to deny that but i choose to recognise it.</div>
