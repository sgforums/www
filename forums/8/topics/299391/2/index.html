If you are widely travelled as you had said so and had dated so many women of many different countries as you had said so, you wouldn't be complainting here.<br><br>What you have spoken doesn't match the profile of a well travelled person who "knows the ways of the world".<br><br>In summary, stop faking, go out and have a real date with a real woman.
