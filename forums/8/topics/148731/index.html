            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">SCORPIO MAN</span></strong><br><br>A man with foggy clouds over him. He is sensitive &amp; easily hurt &amp; always feels lonely. He does not trust anyone but himself. Sounds so negative, but he has an amazing charisma. He's a compassionate man. He absorbs other people sentimental feelings &amp; pain. He is a good psychiatrist &amp; he could understand complex &amp; confused feelings. He has a hidden power that he could use to make things happen &amp; do things well. He does not like people who never try to do things themselves before asking other people for favors. He is the type of guy who's able to achieve his goal in life. Once he sets his mind for something, he will put all his energy &amp; efforts in it , whether or not it is a small matter or a big project. One of the most successful man in all the Zodiac. He is a very patient man &amp; can wait for years to reach his goal. He hates weak determinations. He cannot retreat or rest for long, for he thinks life has more questions &amp; more answers to be searched. If he is in love, u will get plenty of love from him, sometimes maybe too much than u have asked for. He is serious about love &amp; relationship &amp; will not waste time with someone he does not love no matter how pretty she is. He hardly makes mistake. He could tell if u have any bad thoughts, &amp; will not hesitate to tell u so. If u do not like straightforward sincere man, then pack your bag now. If u are an over-sensitive person, try not to ask for his comments. He will tell u the truth, even when u might not be able to take it. Example: if u ask him if u are fat (&amp; u are fat), he will say "yes, as big as a balloon". He makes such comments because he cares for u, so do something about your weight &amp; do not get upset with him. If he says "u look pretty today", u can be proud because he will not say such thing just to please u if he does not really mean it. There will be both kind of people, those who like him &amp; those who hate him. If u are in love with this guy, be strong &amp; believes in your decision, do not be vulnerable. He remembers all his anger &amp; will wait for his pay-back time. He is very serious about your promise, do not promise something u could not keep. He loves his friends &amp; will do anything for his close friends. He likes u to take care of him, but not in front of his friends. He is a complex man &amp; u will never understand what he means if u do not really know him. He is happy to know he is a complex figure. When he is thinking or when he needs privacy, u should give him some space. He memorizes everything well. U may say something that u already forgotten, but he will remember every word. He wants to be respected &amp; admired &amp; at the same time. He does not like people to have power over him. When he falls in love, he really falls deep. A man in this Zodiac, once in love, he will be sweeter than sugar. He does not like plain &amp; simple woman. A complex woman's mind is his venture. Always be interesting &amp; able to talk to him about everything in any subjects. He does not like a woman who sits around waiting for his call.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">SCORPIO WOMAN</span></strong><br><br>A simple woman who always show what kind of mood she is in. U can tell right away if she upsets, or if she is flirting with u. She displays herself with her act much more than trying to say it for it's in her character. A Scorpio woman has her own mysterious personality. She is confident &amp; deep down inside she is quite proud of herself. She hates to think she is borne a woman &amp; so limiting her with a certain social acceptable rules. She is a real woman &amp; despite her innocent &amp; childish looks, she has a spirit of free soul. Many men will make mistakes if they think she is a good follower, they are wrong. She thinks being a plain simple housewife is boring. She likes to have power &amp; control over other people, but this will be only her secret, so u will only see a cute woman. Everything she does will look good, &amp; she has all the woman's trick u can think of. She can manipulate men without them knowing it. If u think she's going to do everything u say because she loves u, then u will be disappointed. She could be a little tomboyish &amp; she can read your mind by just looking into your eyes. U may say sweet words which could sweep any woman, but not with the Scorpio woman. She will use her X-ray eyes to read your thought of what u just said or what u are going to say. She always smiles &amp; she can really hides her feeling. She will constantly show u that she loves freedom. If she has freedom, she will not leave u, but will even love u more. If she wants something, she will go all means to get it. She has her own sixth sense &amp; u can feel that energy feed-back when u'r around her. She likes a man who can earn her respect, &amp; she will also respect &amp; feel proud of that man. A man with power over her should not threaten or challenge her confidence. She likes to have a good looking, strong &amp; healthy man especially if she starts to compare u with her friends' boyfriends. It is a plus if he holds a degree or a good career. She is a hot lady. She likes heavy music. She either loves or hates, there are no "fond of", or "like" for her. Love has no "maybe", or "perhaps". If she is real mad, she will trash &amp; throw things. Her windstorm can sweep all her dishes &amp; u could get accidentally hit on your head for this matter. Be calm, it is just your grandmother favorite china for she has good quality as much as her bad temper. Sometimes she shows her weakness, but it won't be long. She will put herself together &amp; back to be that hot chili again. If she loves u, she will not care what other people may say. Her relationship will be more important than what is right or wrong. Because of this reason, u may know some Scorpio woman becoming a second wife - mistress. She is spolit, but she allows her loved one to over-power her. Dating this woman, u should not keep old love letters in your pocket or in your house. It could be a love letter 2 years ago, but nevermind she will argue about this since this is a big deal for a suspicious woman. Remember she has a temper of the shrew. If u play a cold war with her, she will treat u likewise &amp; double it. If u stood her up once, she will stood u up 2-3 times. She is quite fair in justice, so she can accept your apologies as much as she can pretend to accept things for now &amp; wait for a pay-back revenge in the future. If u are nice to her, she will double that to u as well. A real fair woman. She likes to earn &amp; spend money. She likes to have fame &amp; reputations, &amp; never let herself broke &amp; have no name at the same time. She is too proud &amp; will not accept the status of being "Poor". She loves to have face, so if u are a manager with small salary, she will be proud much more than u earning more money being a truck driver. She hates to think &amp; she can't stand being a "Nobody". If u like her, play a little hard to get. This will excite her a bit. When u'r out on a date, set your schedule, but do not let her knows that u have planned this for weeks. Always go to pick her up on time or better to go 5-10 minutes early.<br><br></div>
