            <div class='col-md body'>ah well ..<br><br>true , many try to put on weight.<br><br>but why is it that losing weight is more popular. why is it that people go on dietz and what have you ?<br><br>everyday i read the newspaper. everyday there are at least 10 ads on slimming , airy promises of the ultimate body .<br><br>and i see maybe once a fortnight a little tiny ad offering weight gain help.<br><br>stereotyping you see.<br><br>why is it that angmoh's get away with flab ?<br>you guys still ogle at them.

            <div class='col-md body'>Mooey...In Europe, thicker women are preferred over thin one(except in Modellinng and fashion)...Most men there find fat ort big women very sexy and it's a sign of health that the women are like this...In THailand and laos, big women are preffered  traditionally(don't know about now though but it should still be the same as they haven't changed their belief systems much)...as it shows that they are healthy and can have children....<br><br>Unfortunately asian women suffer from idealistic beauty that is thrown upon them...Asian are supposed to be small size...they are supposed to be slim and small frame, they are supposed to have lean legs and lean faces...u get my point right?  and our guys also believe it too...is it western media?  No, I don't think so...maybe a bit, but we can't just blame it on that...big women are basically just in the wrong era this century...Why, back in the 50's and earlier, big women were preferred...<br><br>Are Singaproean men only interested in smaller sized women(lean skinny)?  Maybe, but so is everyone else...even women themselves want to be skinny...it's a trend and as with all trends will slowly give way to the big women trend again...<br><br>I klnow this sounds stupid, but in central europe, they had the big womens beauty pageant...only women of a certain weightage could enter...and they were all fat as hell9sorry to say with such excitement)...and the turn out for that event was spectacular...men from all over were trying to go to the event...I know some joker out tehre is going to say that it is only to see the joke...but they went there and when interviewed, they said that they all preferred big women cause they were much sexier than small women....<br><br>so still hope there for big women...For your info...big men also suffer a lot...and bald men also...how about impotent men(but that;'s been eradicated to a major extent by Viagra)...imagine how they feel when people dopn't want to know them or be with them for these reasons...being fat or big is just another thing to add to this list of attributes people don't want to associate with...sad but true...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know about you guys, but I would think the most healthy way to gain and lose weight is to exercise. Funny thing is I have been trying to tell my galfriend the same old thing for ages, but she seems to think otherwise. There is no easy way out of this. To lose weight, exercise. Else you will gain back more than u lost! And having muscles are better than having fats! I mean if u want to put on weight, the mass of the muscles would be better than having the mass of fats!<br>Basically this is a mind set for the gals I know. They always think that they are too fat, even if I constantly tell them they are ok (really, they are). But they are never happy abt themselves! I am known to be skinny! but for my bone structure, I know I am the right weight and size. THough I wish I was more muscluar, I don't make a big fuss out of it, even if some of my galfriends tell me otherwise.<br>The bottom line is, learn to love urself! when people see how much confidence u have in urself, they will be attracted to ur attitude! And exercise helps build that confidence!<br><br></div>
