            <div class='col-md body'>I noe the topic's Women, but it's kinda unbalanced, meaning, there's no jokes about men!! So to keep the ying-yang well balanced, here's some inventory of men's jokes<br>---------------------------<br><br>What is a woman's wildest, raunchiest, dirtiest, sleaziest sexual fantasy<br>ever?<br>A man who thinks<br><br>Why is it the only time a man is smart is when he is having sex?<br>Because he is plugged into a woman!<br><br>Man:  Great idea, bad design.<br><br>What has eight arms and an I.Q. of 60?<br>Four guys watching a football game.<br><br>How are men and parking spots alike?<br>The good ones are always taken. Free ones are mostly handicapped or too<br>small.<br><br>What do you call a man who expects to have sex on the second date?<br>Slow.<br><br>Men don't care what's on TV<br>Men only care what else is on TV (Seinfeld)<br><br>What is the difference between a man and E.T.?<br>E.T. phoned home.<br><br>There are a lot of words that you can use to describe men -<br>Strong, Caring, Loving<br>- They'd be wrong - but you could still use them.<br><br>Answering that age old question, "Why Didn't He Call?":<br>*******************************************************<br>(unknown origin)<br><br>Guys are born with a fundamental, genetically transmitted mental<br>condition  known to psychologists as: The Fear That If You Get<br>Attached to a  Woman,  Some Unattached Guy, Somewhere, Will Be<br>Having  More Fun Than You. This is why all married guys as assume<br>that all Unmarried guys lead lives of constant  excitement<br>involving  hot tubs full of naked international fashion models<br>(This is True); whereas in fact for most  unmarried guys, the<br>climax of  the  typical evening is watching an infomercial for<br>Hair-in-a-Spray can while eating onion dip straight from the<br>container. (This is also true of married guys, although<br>statistically they are far more likely to be using a spoon.)<br><br>So guys are extremely reluctant to make commitments, or even<br>to take any steps that might lead to commitment. This is why,<br>when a guy goes out on a date with a woman and finds himself<br>really liking her, he often will demonstrate his affection by<br>avoiding her for the rest of his life.<br>Women are puzzled by this, "I don't understand,"  they say,<br>"We had such a great time! Why doesn't he call?"<br><br>The reason is that the guy, using the linear guy thought process,<br>has realised that if he takes her out again, he'll probably like<br>her even more, so he'll take her out again, and eventually they'll<br>fall in love with each other, and they'll get married, and they'll<br>have children, and then they'll have grandchildren, and eventually<br>they'll retire and take a trip around the world, and they'll be<br>walking hand-in-hand on some spectacular beach in the South Pacific,<br>reminiscing about the lifetime of experiences they've shared together,<br>and then several naked international fashion models will walk up and<br>invite him to join them in a hot tub, and he won't be able to do it<br>because he is married.<br><br>A guy is reading his paper when his wife walks up behind him and<br>smacks! him on the back of the head with a frying pan.<br>He says, "What was that for?"<br>She says, "I found a piece of paper in your pocket with 'Betty Sue'<br>written on it."<br>He says, "Jesus, honey...remember last week when I went to the track?<br>'Betty Sue' was the name of the horse I went there to bet on."<br>She shrugs and walks away.<br>Three days later he's reading his paper when she walks up behind him<br>and smacks! him on the back of the head with the frying pan again.<br>He says, "What was that for?"<br>She says, "Your horse called."<br><br>*******<br><br>Nature has many laws that hold fast and true. For example, a baby ape<br>will always grow-up to be an ape; likewise, a baby baboon will become<br>an adult baboon. A baby pig will mature into a full grown pig. A baby<br>jackass will always become a jackass. A puppy quickly matures into a<br>dog; a mongrel pup develops into a cur.<br><br>Yet oddly enough, women say a young man may grow-up to be any one of<br>these.!<br><br>***********<br><br>One day, the Lord came to Adam to pass on some news.<br>"I've got some good news and some bad news," the Lord<br>said.  Adam looked at the Lord and said,  "Well, give me<br>the good news first."  Smiling, the Lord explained,  "I've<br>got two new organs for you.  One is called a brain.  It will<br>allow you to create new things, solve problems, and have<br>intelligent conversations with Eve."The other organ I have<br>for you is called a penis.  It will give you great physical<br>pleasure and allow you to reproduce your now intelligent<br>life form and populate this planet.  Eve will be very happy<br>that you now have this organ to give her children."  Adam,<br>very excited, exclaimed,  "These are great gifts that You<br>have given to me.  What could possibly be bad news after<br>such great tidings?"  The Lord looked upon Adam and<br>said with great sorrow,  ...........<br><br>"You will never be able to use these<br>two gifts at the same time."<br><br>*****<br><br>Are you her dream man?<br><br>HERE'S HOW THE SCORING WORKS<br><br>1) SIMPLE DUTIES<br>You offer to go out to buy groceries so she can watch<br>"Friends" 0<br>While you are out, you decide to buy her flowers: +5<br>But return with beer: -5<br>You check out a suspicious noise at night: 0<br>You check out a suspicious noise and it's nothing: 0<br>You check out a suspicious noise and it's something: +5<br>You pummel it with a six iron: +10<br>It's her cat: -10<br><br>2) SOCIAL ENGAGEMENTS<br>You stay by her side the entire party: 0<br>You stay by her side for a while, then leave to chat<br>with a drinking buddy: -2<br>Named Tiffany: -4<br>Tiffany is a dancer: -6<br>Tiffany has implants: -8<br><br>3) SATURDAY AFTERNOONS<br>You visit her parents: +1<br>You visit her parents and actually make<br>conversation: +3<br>You visit her parents and stare vacantly at the<br>television: -3<br>And the television is off: -6<br>You spend the afternoon watching college football<br>in your underwear: -6<br>And you didn't even go to college: -10<br>And it's not really your underwear: -15<br><br>4) HER BIRTHDAY<br>You take her out to dinner: 0<br>You take her out to dinner and it's not a sports bar: +1<br>Okay, it is a sports bar: -2<br>And it's all-you-can-eat night: -3<br>It's a sports bar, it's all-you-can-eat night, and<br>your face is painted the colors of your favorite team: -10<br><br>4:1) HER BIRTHDAY<br>You give her a gift: 0<br>You give her a gift, and it's a small appliance: -10<br>You give her a gift, and it's not a small appliance: +1<br>You give her a gift, and it isn't chocolate: +2<br>You give her a gift that you'll be paying off for months: +30<br>You wait until the last minute and buy her a gift that day: -10<br>With her credit card: -30<br>And whatever you bought is two sizes too big: -40<br><br>5) THOUGHTFULNESS<br>You are late from work and call her so she won't worry 0<br>You call to tell her you are late and that you love her +10<br>You call her to say you are late because you know if you don't,<br>you'll sleep on the couch -10<br>You call to tell her that you slept at Wayne's -30<br>You forget to pick her up at the bus station: -25<br>Which is in Detroit: -35<br>And the pouring rain dissolves her leg cast: -50<br><br>6) A NIGHT OUT WITH YOUR PALS<br>You have a few beers: -9<br>For every beer after three, -2 again<br>And miss curfew by an hour: -12<br>You get home at 3 a.m.: -20<br>You get home at 3 a.m. smelling of booze and cheap cigars: -30<br>And not wearing any pants: -40<br>Is that a tattoo? -200<br><br>7) A NIGHT OUT, JUST THE TWO OF YOU<br>You go to see a movie +15<br>it's not an with 6 car chases and 3 shootouts +25<br>and it's with one of the following actors:<br>Michael Biehn/ Mel Gibson / Matthew Fox +30<br>Brad Pitt/ Keanu Reeves / Dennis Quaid / Val Kilmer +50<br>All of the above +500<br>You go see a comic: +2<br>He's crude and sexist: -2<br>You laugh: -5<br>You laugh too much: -10<br>She's not laughing: -15<br>You laugh harder: -25<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> DRIVING<br>You lose the directions on a trip: -4<br>You lose the directions and end up getting lost: -10<br>You ask for directions +20 (are you cheating? you aren't<br>really a guy, are you?)<br>You end up getting lost in a bad part of town: -15<br>You get lost in a bad part of town and meet the locals: -25<br>She finds out you lied about having a black belt: -60<br><br>9) COMMUNICATION<br>When she wants to talk, you listen, displaying a concerned<br>expression:+20<br>When she wants to talk, you listen, for over 30 minutes: +5<br>You listen for more than 30 minutes, without looking at the<br>television:+10<br>She realizes this is because you've fallen asleep: -10<br><br>BONUS:  You forward her URL's of funny webpages (www.menjokes.com!) with<br>love notes attached: + 100<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>World's Worst Love Letter<br>************************<br><br>Dear Bertha,<br><br>I lack the bravery and endurance requisite to face you with my feelings,<br>so I am writing this letter to you in the hopes that you can read it.<br><br>I remember the first time I saw you. I don't know if I was attracted to<br>you because of your radiant personality, your sunny disposition, or your<br>gravitational pull. All I know is that once I got close to you, as much as<br>I wanted to, I couldn't leave.<br><br>And I think back to some of the trials and tribulations in our<br>relationship. Like that time you tried on that thong bikinni you said you<br>would look terrible in. I'm truely impressed by the bravery it took to<br>even try it in light of how right you were.<br><br>And I know it makes you uncomfortable that I sometimes hang out with your<br>ex, but your cousin and I hardly ever discuss you and when we do, it is<br>always positive.<br><br>Every day while I am working in the sewage treatment plant, all I can<br>think of is you. When I found that ring I gave to you floating through, I<br>knew it must have been divine intervention that had kept us together so<br>long.<br><br>When I talk to my friends about you, they all agree, you're "a whole lot<br>of woman". I couldn't have said it better myself.<br><br>With what I think is probably love,<br>Bryant<br>**********************************************************************<br><br>[This message has been edited by chong77 (edited 06 May 2000).]</div>
