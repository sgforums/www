Champion breeds more expensive but we dun need tht kind of quality... if you get local breed, it's below 1000, but it wont grow to a nice size... in fact it will look scrawny...<br><br>By they, you can never keep a husky if u're staying in HDB.... there wont be enough space.... and since u're a first timer in keeping dogs, u'll sure have lots of problems keeping a big dog.... go get a small dog first and see what it can do to your flat...</div>

AVA for not having a license for your dog and HBD for keeping such a big dog. after giving u a fine, they would ask u to give up your dog to someone else or risk having the dog sent to places like the SPCA.<br>u would need a deep pocket too. need to vaccinate, get toys, accessories, food, grooming and the occasional visit to the vet if the dog falls ill.<br><br>please think it tru properly b4 commiting to it. it is not all about u, what about ur family? they need to agree to it too. also spare a thought for the dog ya?<br>u notice how many ppl here are against u having it rite?<br>cheers~~<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hundreds of cats and dogs being put to sleep by the SPCA, but yet people go out and pay thousands for designer breeds. I remember when the 101 Dalmatians movie came out, hundreds of parents flocked to pet shops to buy Dalmatians for their spoilt little kids who were clamoring for one. Quite a number of them ended up being abandoned, put to the pound, or sold as they realized Dalmatians need quite a bit of care. Cuteness  amuses for a while, but seriously consider if you have the time and inclination to take care of a pet. Remember, everyone loves babies, they just don't like to take care of them.<br><br></div>
