              <p>I had to take more time to understand what locals pass off as
              'Imperial' English than I have ever had to, in any city of the
              world i've been in . No respect for grammar or syntax whatsoever.
               yet this ridiculous general pride in English prowess
              displayed here is baffling. a whole bunch of you need a reality

              <p>I rarely hear locals speaking "Imperial English"or even trying to pass off anything as that</p>
              <p>more often then not its our own local dialect (singlish)</p>
              <p>so maybe the problem not with your understanding but with your thinking or rather,  your attitude towards<strong> </strong>colloquial Singaporean English.</p>

              <p>No we can't. Nothing to do with rising to the occasion. Not trying to put you down but we do usually lapse back into singlish after 3-4 lines. The ones that can feel more educated and won't speak singlish.</p>
              <p>when I talk to locals I actually switch between chinese/english/singlish/hokkien with every other line. I only speak proper english if the person I'm speaking to has one of those funny accents that don't sound local.</p>

              check? to what? if people are whining about another people's accent, it doesn't matter how good your english is. You can pass all your written tests and everyone else still can't understand a damn thing you're saying when you open your mouth because the problem is with the accent.</p>
              <p>Which is why regardless of the standard of english of the person whining at the accent. We can actually understand each other here and not someone who has an accent  which comes from speaking a language most of us don't speak here.</p>

              <p>First we have to ask yourself, why are there so many foreign
              workers? The answer to that is simple, there are many jobs that no
              Singaporeans are willing to work. Construction work etc. That's why
              we need foreign workers. We have no rights to complain.</p>
