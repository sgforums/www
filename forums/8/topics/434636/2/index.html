              <p>Now Indian in Singapore is getting more and more crowded the
              city. You go to Outram Park, half of the population are now Indian
              with sandals and shortpant, speak no English and observed every
              girls that come in to MRT. You go to Jurong East every
              afternoon many of them flocking in the green grass and sitting
              around chit chat on the green pastures. Go to China Town, it's
              become Indian Town now.  In Geylang, a lot of them straying
              all over the streets. When the night comes they spread all over the
              city try to hide themselves and sleeps on HDB corner. Some of them
              live a shelterless living all over the city area. Can't they afford
              to pay the room rental?</p>
              <p>Singapore has become Singdian nowdays. Singaporean hate PRC too
              much and the government already tighten the PRC to come to
              Singapore. Many of PRC visa being rejected. But how about these
              Indian visa? Thousand of black agency in Chenai, Bombay, Bangalor
              etc are offering job for them in Singapore. They sell their herd,
              farm, house whatever just to pay them and come to Singapore get a
              job here. One they get hired in SG company then they will bring in
              the whole village come here. Why Sing gov is closing one eyes
              not to stop or at least reduce these peoples. Gov reasoning that
              Sing or Chinese peoples doesn't want to work in hard job like
              construction worker, machinery company etc. But it's not true.
              China doesn't have Indian but construction are sprouting all over
              the cities. Many Singaporean are jobless today, their job has been
              taken away by these low paid worker. Aiyaa ... don't know how to
              say. Singapore soon become Singdian ... or may be already become
              one of it.</p>

              <p>I had to take more time to understand what locals pass off as 'Imperial' English than I have ever had to, in any city of the world i've been in . No respect for grammar or syntax whatsoever.  yet this ridiculous general pride in English prowess displayed here is baffling. a whole bunch of you need a reality check hard &amp; fast</p>

              <p>Valid no doubt, nonetheless. If we are generalizing, the average should be taken as reference. To be fair, I can bet that the educated locals are capable to execute flawless English should the occasion arise.</p>
