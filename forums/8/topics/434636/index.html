              <p>Now Indian in Singapore is getting more and more crowded the city. You go to Outram Park, half of the population are now Indian with sandals and shortpant, speak no English and observed every girls that come in to MRT. You go to Jurong East every afternoon many of them flocking in the green grass and sitting around chit chat on the green pastures. Go to China Town, it's become Indian Town now.  In Geylang, a lot of them straying all over the streets. When the night comes they spread all over the city try to hide themselves and sleeps on HDB corner. Some of them live a shelterless living all over the city area. Can't they afford to pay the room rental?</p>
              <p>Singapore has become Singdian nowdays. Singaporean hate PRC too much and the government already tighten the PRC to come to Singapore. Many of PRC visa being rejected. But how about these Indian visa? Thousand of black agency in Chenai, Bombay, Bangalor etc are offering job for them in Singapore. They sell their herd, farm, house whatever just to pay them and come to Singapore get a job here. One they get hired in SG company then they will bring in the whole village come here. Why Sing gov is closing one eyes not to stop or at least reduce these peoples. Gov reasoning that Sing or Chinese peoples doesn't want to work in hard job like construction worker, machinery company etc. But it's not true. China doesn't have Indian but construction are sprouting all over the cities. Many Singaporean are jobless today, their job has been taken away by these low paid worker. Aiyaa ... don't know how to say. Singapore soon become Singdian ... or may be already become one of it.</p>

              <p>Singapore is an Tamil name.</p>
              <p>When Sang Nila Utama landed here his Indian guard was ordered to chase the "lion" away. The guard shouted "Singa por! singa por!" The "lion" then went away.</p>
              <p>Sang Nila Utama was impressed and decided to name the settlement near by -  Singa Pur.</p>
              <p>The guard was enthralled, and boasted to his fellow guards that actually he, a lowly guard has done such a prestigeous deed as naming a settlement.</p>
              <p>The whole platoon chorus "POR DAH".</p>

              <p>I have this to speak for the Indians.   Objectively speaking , the Indians are speaking English when serving customers unlike the Chinese from China who are so damn spoilt to expect all locals and foreigners in Singapore to speak to them in Chinese.</p>
              <p>If the China Chinese cannot even be willing to adapt themselves to the English speaking environment here they are jolly well go fly kite or go back to their country.   Only the evil LKY loves them and pampers them.    LKY is a traitor.</p>
