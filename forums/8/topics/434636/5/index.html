              That's assuming you think they don't laugh at such things in their own dialects on and off forums. 
              I find it hard to believe that people don't do that when there's already speculations of how the police would actually let lower caste people die in floods. 
              
              Someone I knew who was training as a tank commander in India found it amazing that singaporeans were more interested in preventing deaths of locals who wandered onto training grounds then the local police force.

              <p>To me? I don't see myself as racist. If anyone thinks I'm racist, I'd also be racist towards my own race... Bottom line is, do what the Romans do...</p>

              <p>First things first. There are more Chinese and Malays than Indians in Singapore. If all of you didn't know it,then don't wonder why the FT are replacing you.</p>
              <p>Second: All of you hate every everyone:Chinese,Indians and even yourself.</p>

              <p>I also like indian food, as one of the earlier civilisation of the world, with a history of thousand of years, indian had influenced many part of the world, by right, if they had been able to rise up and work together, they should be the powerhouse of today and not the americans or any other super powers. But sad to say, Indian themselves are very individualistic and also set their own division of peoples, these end up poor get poorers and rich get richers and the proud get prouder and so on.</p>
              <p>Other than some famous curry, buddha, nan, tosai, prata and nathan, I do not hv much associate with indians.</p>
