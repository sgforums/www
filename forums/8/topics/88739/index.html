I am from San Francisco, California.<br><br>"We need to leave this country right now. If we don't, everyone is gonna be killed in this way."<br><br>The video then showed him being beheaded.<br><br>The stunt was exposed as the Iraqi government ordered Arabic news station al Jazeera to close its Baghdad offices for one month.<br><br>Interior Minister Falah al-Naqib said this week that Arabic satellite channels were encouraging kidnappings by showing images of hostages threatened with executions.<br><br>No formal reason for the ban has been given yet.<br><br><img src="http://static.sky.com/images/pictures/1231969.jpg"></div>
