Anyway maybe it's just me but I've been seeing so many couples in heated arguments recently.

            <div class='col-md body'>people make &amp; break and make and break becoz most people cannot survive without love, or some people just cannot stand lonliness..even if not compatible, also stay together for the sake of having a partner...<br><br>for me, although still very scared of relationships after the last one, but still won't say things like i've lost faith in love and will stay single for the rest of my life...simply coz a nice relationship can bring you extreme happiness (though at the risk of extreme sadness as well), but it's something u will not experience by being single...it's just a different kind of happiness...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Even relationships that seem long-lasting had to go. A friend had his gf for more than five years since JC. They were still happily together during his NS (which is already a miracle). But when he got into the U they broke up. Yes, when they're finally back together in the same school and even after countless efforts of reconciliation she had to go. Another girl friend I had had the same experience. And it was so bad she broke down in the lecture theatre and cried for days after that.<br><br>So, maybe I'm cynical, but to all those who're attached, just you watch. Now I don't want this to sound like a curse but, I mean it happens you know -- even if your bf or gf isn't exactly yandao or chio. I think the only time where it's possible to stay with that special someone is when you're old and by old I mean when you look in the mirror you'll know you're not young and don't make heads turn anymore.<br><br>But shit still happens. Especially for people who're always craving for greener grass without realising they're already wastelands.</div>
