            <div class='col-md body'>I still can remember the November rain. She would run out from the void deck and I would follow her and watch as she danced in the rain. She would always pout her face and look at the sky as if she was talking to god. One day, when it was raining heavily, as usual while we were dancing in the rain she suddenly bend forward and gave me a gentle peck on my face while speaking in a most gentle voice, "I Love you". Those words melted my heart and for a long time, I was pulled away from the reality. I only regained my senses only to find her running up the stairs heading for home.<br><br>The next afternoon, I waited for her under the void deck with a stalk of rose that I bought from the market with all my school allowance (I was 11 then and she was 12). Sadly, She never turn up anymore. I began to ponder wondering if what she had said and with my retard reaction could had cause her complete embrassment till the extend that she might not want to meet me anymore. I waited got her that day the whole afternoon and when she didnt turn up late evening, I decided to draw her a picture with us holding hand in skeleton form and also written those beautiful words "I Love You Too, Lisa". I pasted the drawing under the pingpong table at my void deck with my rose attached to it. No one would able to retrieve that since under the table is blind spot and even the cleaner would not bother to bent down to remove it.(I know cause we have been pasting alots of notes underneath the pingpong table before)The next afternoon when I went back to the void deck, I found out that with all remaining notes around except the picture and the rose. Assumed that she had took it with her, and probably accepted my love, I decided to wait for her again. She didn't turn up. Felt GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT.<br><br>Few days later, While I was doing my school holidays homework, Somehow my mother never understand why did I cry so hard that night. I overhead my mum gossiping through the phone with my neighbour and it goes like this.<br><br>"Oh no... How could such a thing happen? So young.. such a nice girl... yah I know lisa, she always play with my boy... why would a girl want a toy gun when she doesnt play with it.. sigh... Whoever had KNOCKED HER down should have stopped<br>... such a tragic.. dont know her parents now how .... (and goes on) .."<br><br>Only then, I realised from my mum something that pierce my heart so hurt that even now, I still think of her at times.<br><br>It was raining heavily,I believe she got me a toygun (we spoke and she know I love toyguns alot)and when she was crossing the road, some unknown irresponsible driver knock her down and didnt stop to help her. She died on the spot.<br><br>For you Lisa, I remember you always..<br><br>Cold November rain kept falling on my head without any sweet goodbye,<br>thought that I would love you forever, trust me when I said I will try.<br>For you had left me without any farewell kisses tonight,<br>just bits and pieces fragments of you and me in my mind.<br>Pray that you come to my dreams every night,<br>to let me able to hold you and to love you in dreams all time.</div>
