Uni/college can offer both diploma and degree courses because they cater to different groups and definitely not the same level though.<br><br>Correct me if I am wrong: The reason why criminology is always a Master-level course is because a diploma in criminology cannot 'tan jia' one. It is like psychology; having a diploma or even a degree in Psychology doesn't make someone a psychologist - in case you are thinking along that direction. You will probably need a Master and higher.<br><br>Now, focus on your O level - now that u know where you want to go, work your way towards them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers </div></blockquote>yea i know diploma in criminology wun get me far,i already plan to get at least a degree in this area<br>as for now,i need to know where i should start<br><br>i know that parklane school<br>a private uni,altho they're affilicted with overseas uni,they are not much wanted by the foreign public uni's</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Google criminology degree and this is one of the first result to come out: http://www.kent.ac.uk/studying/undergrad/subjects/criminology.html<br><br><blockquote>Crime and criminal justice are major social and political issues. There is considerable debate surrounding key criminological questions – how much crime is committed? What causes crime rates to rise or fall? Why do people commit crime? How should we deal with offenders? How can crime be effectively prevented? This degree programme examines these issues, and explores them within a wider sociological and social policy context.<br><br>The degree initially introduces you to a broad range of criminological issues and debates, leading to more specialist and detailed study of criminological theory and criminal justice policy. You are taught by staff who have interests in policing, criminological theory, probation practice, racist violence, imprisonment, drug use, older offenders and female offenders. They work in consultation with criminal justice agencies and people from these agencies occasionally lecture on the course.<br><br></blockquote></div>
