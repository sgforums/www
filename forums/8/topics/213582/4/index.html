By the time I was making my postgrad applications, Master's was pretty much standard fare for Psych because it became the requirement for psych registration.  i figured I may as well take an extra year, get the doctorate instead and have the edge for a few more years yet.<br><br>It's getting more dog-eat-dog out there.
