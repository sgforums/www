            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Most if not all westerners will tell you that sex is a very normal thing. They can sleep with any1 they like and next morning they will forget what happened last nite.  They said sex is like breakfast, lunch or dinner. In short, they treat sex a very normal thing and should not be treated seriously if you been f***ck or you f**ck someone.<br><br>Now, remember the USa president (Clinton)? What is the F, it is totally a private matter of between two adults; one like to suck cigar and one like to give cigar to someone who loves it in the world most powerful office.<br><br>My question is why the people have such a big respond to this event?? Isn't it the Westerner already used to Sex thing?? They always say sex is very normal thing. I think they are just double standard.... But they dont admit it.<br><br>If they think the President is wrong, then they (people or westerner)should not preach freedom of sex. They should not go around screwwing in the high school, university and other places.<br><br>Wat a world!!<br></div>

They can sleep with any1 they like and next morning they will forget what happened last nite.  They said sex is like breakfast, lunch or dinner. In short, they treat sex a very normal thing and should not be treated seriously if you been f***ck or you f**ck someone.<br><br>Now, remember the USa president (Clinton)? What is the F, it is totally a private matter of between two adults; one like to suck cigar and one like to give cigar to someone who loves it in the world most powerful office.<br><br>My question is why the people have such a big respond to this event?? Isn't it the Westerner already used to Sex thing?? They always say sex is very normal thing. I think they are just double standard.... But they dont admit it.<br><br>If they think the President is wrong, then they (people or westerner)should not preach freedom of sex. They should not go around screwwing in the high school, university and other places.<br><br>Wat a world!!<br></div></blockquote>Yeah they have their f**k buddies - got a few asian and caucasian friends like that .  And guess what ....they decide to release the gory details to me as well since I am in the healthcare profession and then ask me if they can catch std. I always scare them for a week then they resume action with their buddies and then tell me all about it as well as ask me all about it etc .<br><br>Ai ya nowadays - people who you want to marry - better do an std check on them. Asian (japs screw with japs , hongkongers screw with hongkongers) and caucasian the same around in australia ... best of all is to abstain . Chlamydia on the rise and it is asymptomatic - it destroys the woman's reproductive system ( australian gahment recognise it as a health threat ) .<br><br></div>
