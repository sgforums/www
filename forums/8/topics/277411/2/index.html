They issued a warning to Malaysian rapper Wee Meng Chee.<br><br>FOUR masked men have appeared in a YouTube video clip warning a Malaysian rapper who had been accused of insulting Islam and the Malays that he would 'receive punishment' if he were to return home.<br><br>The clip echoes the video threats made by Middle Eastern terrorists. Speaking in Malay, one of the men read from a statement: 'We would like to give a warning to Namewee that if you were to return to Tanah Melayu you will receive punishment for insulting Islam.'<br>Namewee is the nickname used by the 24-year-old Wee Meng Chee, an undergraduate based in Taiwan. Tanah Melayu literally means Malay Land.<br><br>The 18-second video ended with the four men chanting 'God is Great'. Last month, Mr Wee parodied the national athem in a rap video that was also posted on YouTube. The clip infuriated many and is now the subject of a government probe into possible sedition.<br><br>Amid the uproar, Mr Wee posted a second clip in which he rapped about the discrimination against the Chinese, corrupt cops and indolent civil servants, most of whom are Malay. He also poked fun at Muslim morning prayers broadcast from mosques, saying they acted as his alarm clock. The video again triggered a flood of abusive responses from Malays, and also expressions of support from ethnic Chinese in Malaysia. T<br><br>he masked-men video clip became widely known after Malaysia's top blogger and an opposition politician, Mr Jeff Ooi, posted a link to it, asking: 'That's how Malaysians use YouTube?'<br><br>The four men who appeared in the clip, which has been watched about 7,000 times, wore black ski masks with only their eyes visible. They stood in front of a brick wall. They wore black T-shirts, with two of them also wearing what looked like military fatigues. One of them carried what looked like a sheathed dagger.<br><br>The comments posted under the video were not supportive of the scare tactics. 'This is really stupid...do not shame the Malays further,' said one posting which called the four men 'terrorist wannabees'. Another added: 'I believe that the majority of the Malays in Malaysia are moderate and tolerant Muslims who will not agree to such stupid act as shown by the 'terrorists' in the video.'<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB1i4AMRKw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB1i4AMRKw</a></span></div></blockquote>THe difference between the both of them is that the 'Terrorists' talkc0ck like sing song and Rapper Wee Meng Chee sing song like talkc0ck</div>

What's the big deal!!!!!<br><br>And them wannabe terrorist, by putting up such a video in Youtube, they're just allowing the world to stereotype that Muslims can't find a peaceful alternative to solving a problem without having to resort to killings - somemore invoking the word "God". My goodness, I have always believe that God is all loving, not all killing to resolve disputes!! What a shame to these wannabe narrow minded 4some terrorist!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Btw, I am a fulll blooded Sg!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> </div></blockquote>you think migrate so easy ah. want to migrate just migrate?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>in a country where his race is outnumbered and outclassed, he has no choice but pour out and share the truth with others in this way. if no one speaks up, this obvious racism in malaysia is never known.<br><br>as a singaporean, we're well protected, and the govt tries to make every race equal. true, racism can never be eradicated, because its so deep in all of us, but the govt does try to give equal opportunity to everyone.<br><br>you think in malaysia, things are the same ah? piority is given to malay for everything, from schooling to jobs.<br><br>and the govt does nothing to help the chinese, everything sweep under the carpet, malay gangs raping chinese girls, all that, what have they really done?<br><br>now these terrorists wannabes who think they big heroes, is the malaysian govt doing anything to find out who they are? lol they're probably clapping hand enjoying the show, then go public say they doing everything they can, while they sit back and eat their kueh kueh.<br><br>to me, critisism is fine, its the first step to any improvement. because it will lead to acknowledgement.<br><br>but threatening to harm somebody is plain wrong</div>
