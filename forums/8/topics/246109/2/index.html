            <div class='col-md body'>SS is a dreadful subject yes...but there are ways to tackle it. Firstly you need to know about the basic knowledge...like what goes on stuff like that...like the hindus and sinhalese blah blah...all the bits and pieces...<br><br>Then you need to know about the factors that contribute to the probs...like the education system, welfare and etc.<br><br>After that you cross reference...then support with evidence and details.<br><br>Finally you write your own opinion. This one is tricky and it needs a lot of practice.  But don't worry can be done de =).<br><br>Last but not least....try to read up as much as you can about the case studies.
