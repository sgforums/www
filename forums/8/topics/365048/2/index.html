              <p>i got my manpower officer to call various places today and we've
                              figured out the following:</p>
              <p>on the exactly my 22nd birthday, i will have to go down to ICA
                              and apply for something known as a "Temporary Permenant Resident".
                              Its an oxymoron I know right?</p>
              <p>Anyways, because I have to leave Singapore within 24 hours after
                              ceasing to be a Singapore Citizen without having regularised my
                              stay, I will get my TPR almost immediately according to him.</p>
              <p>Still, it is only because I am serving my National Service and
                              this TPR will expire on the day I ORD. And meanwhile, while holding
                              a TPR I can apply for a PR.</p>
              <p>Kinda sucky, having to be concerned with entry and exit permits
                              once I become a PR. according to my Sir, he says that if I leave
                              Singapore without a proper exit permit, my PR will cease to exist?
                              Is that true?</p>
              <p>Btw, between being a Singapore PR and Singapore Citizen, are
                              there any wide differences? I'm looking through, theres not alot of
                              shortcomings being a PR.</p>

              <p>Dude..you'd be crazy not to get your US citizenship and passport squared away first before you renounce the SG citizenship.</p>
              <p>Your US birthcert is not proof of a US citizenship.</p>
              <p>PR is only a residential status.  When you renounce Sg citizenship you need to surrender your SG passport too.</p>
              <p>You still need a proper passport to exit SG and entry to other country( Including US)</p>

              <p>it actually depends. a court birth cert counts as citizenship, a hospital one does not. difference is that need a court seal on the birth cert. </p>
              <p>however, as you said, being born in US gives you the right to a US citizenship, as stated in the 14th amendment. </p>

              <p>Ok lah,  my mistake . But you cannot use your birthcert to enter US already. Last time still can.. now they require a valid US passport.</p>
