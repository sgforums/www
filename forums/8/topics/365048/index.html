              <p>Hello,</p>
              <p>I'm hitting my 22y/o birthday soon and soon I have to choose my Citizenship.</p>
              <p>I have a headache though, currently serving NS and my Pink I/C is retained by SAF.</p>
              <p>Anyways the question is, because I was born in the US (and thus, am eligible for US citizenship) but am a Singapore Citizen by decent:</p>
              <p>1) Is it ok if I renounce my Singapore Citizenship the same day I apply for my US citizenship. Will I be arrested for having no reason to stay in Singapore, because I have no PR status nor any Visa.</p>
              <p>2) How long will my PR status take to be approved?</p>
              <p>3) Will I be subjected to both US and Singapore taxes?</p>
              <p>Any input will be well appreciated :)</p>

              <p>I ord after my eligible date, so its kinda messed up. In the letter sent by ICA, they say I can be charged if I dont do something about my citizenship issue by my next birthday (22nd).</p>

              <p>but i think i would be holding a US passport then, before my 22nd birthday. wouldnt that constitute as dual citizenship? and wouldnt I be charged.</p>
              <p>secondly, if I renounce my SG citizenship, will I be given a pardoned time lapse to apply for my PR status? this transfer of citizenship is indeed very confusing and messy :(</p>

              <p>btw im thinking whether i need to apply for my US citizenship
              before I can apply for my PR status.</p>
              <p>i called ICA today and the people tell me that I can take up my
              US citizenship and allow my SG citizenship to run until it expires.
              I will not get arrested during this term of dual citizenship.</p>
              <p>As for my PR status, anybody knows how long it'll take?</p>

              <p>You are US citizen by right of just being born there, but if you have all along never applied for a US passport, etc. The only document that states you are a US citizen is your birth certificate.</p>

              <p><br>the parents simply applied for a SG citizenship by descent of parents (although born outside of SG) lor... so end up using singapore passport + a US birth certificate.</p>
              <p>the girl simply have dual citizenships b4 the age of 21. and since SG no recognise dual, then SG govt will give the person who have dual as a child/young person until the age 21 years old to choose only 1 citizenship, as the person at 21 is an adult by law.</p>

              <p>i got my manpower officer to call various places today and we've figured out the following:</p>
              <p>on the exactly my 22nd birthday, i will have to go down to ICA and apply for something known as a "Temporary Permenant Resident". Its an oxymoron I know right?</p>
              <p>Anyways, because I have to leave Singapore within 24 hours after ceasing to be a Singapore Citizen without having regularised my stay, I will get my TPR almost immediately according to him.</p>
              <p>Still, it is only because I am serving my National Service and this TPR will expire on the day I ORD. And meanwhile, while holding a TPR I can apply for a PR.</p>
              <p>Kinda sucky, having to be concerned with entry and exit permits once I become a PR. according to my Sir, he says that if I leave Singapore without a proper exit permit, my PR will cease to exist? Is that true?</p>
              <p>Btw, between being a Singapore PR and Singapore Citizen, are there any wide differences? I'm looking through, theres not alot of shortcomings being a PR.</p>
