            <div class='col-md body'>Hey thanks for all the advise you guys. Yea, i thought it through. She kept defending that guy and all that. She just recently told me she is confused again. And all her answers were "i don't knows." Yea i sacrificed a lot for her and all the effort seems wasted. Not all gals r like that i hope but i have come to accept the fact that even when gals have bf, they r still looking out for someone better than their bf. That's true isn't it? this gal really meant a lot to me and it has depressed me that things would turn out this way. I guess it has made me a teeny weeny bit stronger. But it still does hurt.<br>sigh.....<br>the saga continues....<br>Wait ah...makan time...be back later to finish my story abt her<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey lilman...yea i agree. One of my friends whu knows my gf said she is very selfish and incensitive. And u r definitely right abt the part where they say "i don't know" and therefore need not make a choice and can have the best of 2 worlds.<br>Yea...my gf i admit is also a lil insensitive but i hav learnt to accept her flaw as what u cant expect of others what u expect of yourself. i gave her 100% of my love doesnt mean i will get 100% of her love back.<br>The story continues...<br>yea she kept giving me i don't knows and said she was confused and etc. We talked and she said she thought that she loved me but actually she might not have. as usual she was stressing and the word confused. she said she wanted some time off to think about it. So yea i agreed after listening to all ya suggesstions. She also told me that she never liked that guy (contradicting wat she told me earlier that she liked that guy). soon after that, i never really tokked to her as it seeing her on irc or even chatting on the fone hurts me. She was on irc and whenever she came into my channel, she would always be away. When that guy comes in, her away would go off. As irc goes, i hav all the right to pban or ban him...but i cant bring myself to do that as it would hurt her and as usual she would put the blame on me again. Now i am even avoiding my own channel becoz of her.<br>Sometimes, i really dunno what to do. The pain and hurt inside still lives. All i can do is watch from a corner, hoping time will heal all wounds.<br>thanks for all ya advise.<br>cheerios to u all</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Peepee and Shake, I can relate to you guys too. Currently overseas and my rs with my girl took a bad turn about two months ago. She also choose the method of fading away rather than brutally hurting me. I'm always online waiting for her to show up although I know she never would. I called her a few days ago asking if she missed me. She gave an answer similar to "I don't know". After much pressing for an Yes or No answer, she finally said "No". I was hurt, big time. But guess that was better for me. I rather be hurt honestly than mislead by a lie.<br><br>Let me share my story. She feels that we have some fundamental personality differences. And she sorta felt it only after I left Singapore. Kinda unfair for me as I'm not able to be there physically to defence myself. I don't think it is personal differences though. Just that I have been rather insensitive to her emotional needs due to my lack of experience and our physical separation. But I'm working on the insensitive part of me. Reading up self help book and reflecting on my own actions. It takes time but I know I'm becoming a better man. However she no longer has faith in me. She said she is just too tired to try, too afraid to be disappointed. Nevertheless, I'm still keeping my faith and trust in her. Will sort things when I return for good this June. Right now, I'm just learning to let her go. If she returns in kind, then I know she's mine (adapted from Heaven Knows).<br><br>Guys, I really love her very much. Do you think I should let her go and hold on to the faith that she will return one day at the same time? I don't want to be disappointed again...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>audlenelee, i don't quite agree with your views, something lacking in all Singaporeans is that, they tends to let their mind control them. Thinking that they're bound to lose, means they lost, but towards my past experience, i personally feels that what you fight for with patients, is what you're gonna get. About what you say as what yours is yours... are you telling us that we'll always let fate decide? If that's the case... can we only stay one side and wait for something... like you don't have to study to get full marks. Well, you fight for what you get and you wins.</div>
