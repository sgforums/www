But the truth is finally out!!!.....Yes...I feel so SHIT at first thinking why she couldn't just tell me the truth there and then....and in turn made me doubt myself.....But after a while, I am just glad that I had come to terms with it. At least I am glad that I did my best for our relationship.....It is now just plain pity that she didn't treasure my love.<br><br>Life goes on......and I intend to enjoy myself from now on....!!.....<br><br>------------------<br>You've Lost that Lovin' Feeling.....!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Miss Lee, i'm not against your view or anything, look in a different way right now... you and i both have two different views... that's what i'm trying to tell PeePee... two different view means... we're NOT consolling for sugguesting what he should do. Wheras, we're fighting to win in this debate. This problem is CERTAINLY not a debate. Besides if you love someone deeply, or course you would want your friends to bless you rather than saying, "Hey come on, he/she's not your type, jerk it off". Think about how would you felt. PeePee loves her, so there's no right for us to jerk his feeling off. Remember, NO TRY, FAILURE IS WHAT YOU GET. Well, try... that's the words for it! I bless PeePee in whatever he does, and not telling him what to do. Because we, do not know how he felt, and doesn't even know how much that love is. Or rather, the whole problem itself.</div>

I do not want to hurt anyone.<br>I am getting over her and i hope the feelings will fade soon. I dont know abt my future but i hope it will be a better one.

BUT, if ppl ard u kept on telling you the same thing, as the saying goes, "pang guan ze qin", maybe they saw something in him/her that we haven't realised? isn't that better than after the couple breaks up, then the fren said, "i knew he/she wasn't good"... isn't that worse??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi pee pee<br><br>just dropping a line to say that i think you've been really nice and committed to the relationship in standing by your girlfriend while she was emotionally confused.<br><br>I wonder how is your present situation now? There has been so many responses and you must be feeling so confused. I cant help but say that how about hanging in there for her a bit more? It is *fate* that brought you and her together. So treasure this fate and you may be rewarded with the love of your lifetime. If she chooses to go away, you know you have tried your best.<br><br>Listening to many guys complaining about how their girlfriends using *I don't know* to get away from situations, I feel... guilty? =P It takes a nice guy to tolerate this but it will take a great guy to help the girlfriend sort out her thoughts and help her think things through right?  So guys out there, are you up to the challenge like PeePee?<br><br>cheers to all the great guys out there!<br><br>------------------<br>You are my first star at night, I'd be lost in space without you<br>And I'll never lose my faith in you, How will I ever get to heaven if I<br>do<br><br>- "Lost In Space", Lighthouse Family</div>

I still have feelings for her and if i was to start another relationship now, it would be very unfair to the present gal. I might just be on a rebound. I have to control my feelings now and give myself some time to sort my feelings out. Sometimes i do see her online, i try to put on a brave front and face her but inside me it still hurts. As most of you will say, try to avoid her. But i guess she is still confused about relationships and don't really know who to choose. Even though i ain't her bf anymore, i still wanna stand by her as a friend.<br><br>Hey tammy,<br>Thanks for your concern. I am nice to give her time and all that? mebbi yea mebbi no. I know how indecisive she is n how little time she can spend wif me. I try to understand and accept her flaws. I believe looking at a person's flaws is more impt than how nice he/she is. If u can accept that, i believe u will be a very good fren to him/her. And for me, i wanna try to understand and accept her flaws. I dunno but i do hav my own flaws too, and those whu know me will know what my flaws are and wish just one day someone would understand me and accept them..sigh.<br>Yea...i am feeling alright as i have many other commitments in life. Those who know me will know my accomplishments, my problems and the things i m tied down wif right now.<br><br>Yiyi dear dear,<br>=) Thanks for standing by me all this while. Really appreciate it.

            <div class='col-md body'>What I think really happen is the failure to communicate. When there is a little problem, we tend to not talk about it as one would think it's petty to do so. When these problems accummulate over a long period, it becomes significant and by then, it'll be too late. It's like the little crack in a frozen lake. When the crack gets bigger and the whole ice sheet collapse, you can't do anything.<br><br>First of all, do you talk heart to heart with her before? Maybe you tried, but from what I gather, she is not willing to open up. From what I notice, you said that she said she was confused but you had other thoughts. Maybe you're too intelligent and refuse to be a lovefool. Either way, things would not work out as the problem has been there for some time and you guys didn't notice, or maybe you did, but refuse to do anything, in hope that things will work out. Anyway, take this as a lesson learnt the hard way. I'm sure you'll be stronger now. Someone who deserves thee shalt not be far.<br><br>Anyway, this is life and shit happens. Go watch forrest gump...nice show  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
