I sensed something wrong and asked her if there was any prob tt i could help her solve. she was reluctant to tell me abt it n i pestered her. Finally she said she likes another guy. she din wanna tell me whu he was at first n said it was none of my business but finally told me. N tt guy happens to be her best fren's bf. This guy used to like her and he used his gf, which is my gf's best friend, to bring him to her office so tt he could woo my gf. n then he wanna dump his gf...n keep on going for my gf. now tt i hav found out abt it n tt she likes him...i gav her time to choose. understood her situation n stood by her. She chose me in the end but she is still seeing this guy. n this guy came to mock me indirectly.

            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly speaking, felt a little sorry for you to have gone into this, can understand yr frustration, and how you feel- you love her so deeply yet she fall for another guy, a guy who cannot compare to u in any way cos he simply a bastard, breaking other couples up and making use of his own gf, what's worst, mock at others.<br><br>Sorry to say this but yr gf is partly to blame also. I know u love her but seriously dun think she's worth yr love. I noe its not easy to give her up but what's the point of keeping her by the side but not her heart. This way, think you will feel more like an idiot eventually.<br><br>I would advise u to give her up or u will feel more n more miserable as time goes by. If you can't, then take one step by one step lor, hopefully she will know who's really good to her.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, very sorry to know about your story. It is definitely not a stupid story, things like this happens everyday.<br><br>There are a few things you ought to think about :<br><br>Why will she develop likings for this guy in the first place ?<br>Is there already something in amiss between the 2 of you ?<br><br>It is also very understanding of you to give her time to choose, you ought to be complimented on that. It is also good to hear that after consideration, she still think you are a better choice for her. If you think this relationship is worth to keep then you ought to work on it.<br><br>What's the extend of them "seeing each other" ? Going out together or wat ?<br><br>Another issue of concern is your gf's best fren aka that guy's gf. Should your gf tell her about this guy's intention of being her bf ?<br><br>Whatever it is, good luck to you !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This shows that your gf is not committed enuff. And when there is no commitment in a relationship, it is very hard to carry on. The main problem doesn't lay on that bastard although he did play a part in it. The main problem is ur gf whose heart is still young and wanna have thrills and attentions. This is a universal problems for all guys out there so don't feel bad about it.<br><br>The tactic is.......make her love you more than you love her!!!<br><br>------------------<br>You've Lost that Lovin' Feeling.....!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess u all r right. i sacrificed a lotta time n money n put in a lot of effort in the relationship, that's why i didnt want to give up. Now it's just an empty feeling. Yea everything is not the same. She used to tell me not to call her so much as i am cirrently overseas and i would wait on irc for her to come on. Sometimes even hrs. I remembeer even skipping breakfast n lunch on a weekend just to wait for her. And she told me she only came on for me. But it seems that she came on for another guy too. There's really nothing i can do with anything happening behind my back. I trust her and give her the benefit of the doubt but she betrayed it. This guy on irc flirted with my friend and she kicked him out of the channel and my gf flared up at me saying it's my fault. When i get personal wif her, she would say it's none of my business. Now she's blaming me for something i didnt even do over a small petty matter which i would say none of her business either. I guess, sometimes gals would want their bfs to be like them to think like them but people are different and think differently. Looks like i am consoling myself here. But i give good love advise to ppl but can never help myself.<br>One advice for all of u out there...when u like someone, look at his/her flaws first and try to understand them...if u can accept them...u will make a gd gf/bf. if not, lay off the person for things wun work out fine. Tears actually flow out of my eyes when i read ya replies as those hav been touching. Made a few good points too.<br>i still dont know how i am going to settle this for i dont want her to get hurt later by this jerk. if he could use his gf to flirt with my gf...he could jolly well do it to her too. I want the best for her even though nothing works out.<br>=====================<br>the eclipse be seen thru the blind light of love.....</div>
