            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore offers millions to lure Indian films (Go To Top)<br><br>Singapore: Singapore's tourism authorities have offered hefty grants to international film makers to make the Asian nation a hub of film making. The Singapore Tourism Board has set up the "Film in Singapore" scheme wherein film makers who shoot in Singapore can claim up to half of all production costs or 5.8 million dollars. Singapore Minister for Information, Communication and the Arts, Lee Boon Yang asked Indian filmmakers to utilise the scheme at the ongoing International Indian Films Academy (IIFA) weekend in the country. "But this film in Singapore (incentive) is a financial package that we have put together and is supposed to be offered over the next three years with (in) a batch of 10 million dollars and the expences would be for another cost related to doing shoots in Singapore such as accommodation and hiring of Å local talents in Singapore as well as post-production services," saiid Yang.<br><br>Indian film directors appeared upbeat about the offer. "We should look for financing, co-structure and Asian people should be coming together and creating a comon platform of which cinema is one of the most important," said Shekar Kapoor, internationally acclaimed for his "Elizabeth" and ""Bandit Queen." The IIFA film awards eye India's almost 20-million strong diaspora and also attempt to market the nation's prolific film industry across the world. Nearly 400 Indian actors, directors, scriptwriters and producers are taking part in the three-day long IIFA awards ceremony. The awards, held last year in South Africa, are in their fifth year and compare with the Oscars. Overseas Indians generate about 100 billion dollars annually and pump back about 30 billion dollars each year into India. According to one estimate by U.S. bank Citigroup, there are 150,000 Indian millionaires overseas</div>
