              <p>Since she was once active in St Mary, you should go ask the ppl

              <p>I was thinking to write the parish priest but they have gone to other parish I think. Seeing from the list I do not recognized any of the current priest in St Mary of the Angels.</p>
              <p>I can't expect the new priest to ask around for my sake.</p>
              <p>But I think I'm gonna try anyway. Maybe get them to post it on the bulletin board. Help finding a lost love. Something like that.</p>

              <p>You apparently have not been reading this thread thoroughly. I've described her enough. If you keep on asking you don't know her. And from repeated questions to those already described you prove that you didn't ask to try to help.</p>
