              <p>I fell for a girl who attended mass regularly every saturday in
              the St. Mary of the Angels parish. I never knew her name sadly.
              when I intended to say hello and got to know her name she was never
              around. I guess she stopped attending masses in St Mary
              altogether.</p>
              <p>The problem is this was a long time ago in 2002. She was quite
              active in the church.Mostly collecting offering/tithing. Also in
              church fund raising event.</p>
              <p>The one thing that really made her stood out from the crowd was
              that she was really pretty. I mean really pretty.</p>
              <p>I know she may have been married by now but at least I want to
              know her name.</p>
              <p>Anybody attended St  Mary of the Angels in the period of
              2000-2002(up to renovating period) may be familiar with her. So I'm
              asking does anybody know her? I really would like to have a chat
              with her or something. At least I want to know her name.</p>
              <p>Funny thing is that I had been given a prophecy relating me to
              her well it wasn't about her actually it was more about me. The
              prophecy was given in Bandung in 1997 during my high school retreat
              in a monastery. All has come to pass. All except one actually. I
              still remember being told what she would 'say'(I never spoke to her
              never did she) to me during my last time seeing her from acrross
              the pews: "be strong". OMG it was already known in 1997.</p>
              <p> Thanks</p>

              <div style="background-image: none; background-color: transparent;">
              <p>I fell for a girl who attended mass regularly every saturday in
              the St. Mary of the Angels parish. I never knew her name sadly.
              when I intended to say hello and got to know her name she was never
              around. I guess she stopped attending masses in St Mary
              altogether.</p>
              <p>The problem is this was a long time ago in 2002. She was quite
              active in the church.Mostly collecting offering/tithing. Also in
              church fund raising event.</p>
              <p>The one thing that really made her stood out from the crowd was
              that she was really pretty. I mean really pretty.</p>
              <p>I know she may have been married by now but at least I want to
              know her name.</p>
              <p>Anybody attended St  Mary of the Angels in the period of
              2000-2002(up to renovating period) may be familiar with her. So I'm
              asking does anybody know her? I really would like to have a chat
              with her or something. At least I want to know her name.</p>
              <p>Funny thing is that I had been given a prophecy relating me to
              her well it wasn't about her actually it was more about me. The
              prophecy was given in Bandung in 1997 during my high school retreat
              in a monastery. All has come to pass. All except one actually. I
              still remember being told what she would 'say'(I never spoke to her
              never did she) to me during my last time seeing her from acrross
              the pews: "be strong". OMG it was already known in 1997.</p>
              <p> Thanks</p>
