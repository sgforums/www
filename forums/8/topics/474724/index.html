            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-indent: 36.0pt;">My name is Steven Tan. I am
              currently working as an engineer in Singapore.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-indent: 36.0pt;">In January 2013, I have known
              this guy Alfred through a friend. He claimed that he was doing some big
              business and knew a lot of big people. He said he was looking for investors and
              persuaded me to join him. Seeing my friend had also put in a lot of money into
              Alfred’s business, I was persuaded by him and passed him my savings of SGD 50,000.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-indent: 36.0pt;">Since then, we had met for a
              few times privately. He behaved like a rich guy and had been quite generous
              when paying bills for meal. He had even showed me his newly bought Toyota Camry
              and assured me that the business was going smoothly. He also told me that he
              had another 50 to 60 investors with him, so the risk was minimum.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-indent: 36.0pt;">In May 2013, Alfred told me
              that there was a big opportunity and asked me to put in more money with him.
              When I told him I didn’t have the cash, he persuaded me to take bank loans. I
              was reluctant initially, but he was persistent and eventually persuaded me. I
              had signed up an overdraft of SGD 150,000 and passed it to him. He said he will
              pay for the interest plus give me the profit monthly.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-indent: 36.0pt;">In August 2013, Alfred stopped
              paying the interest. He told me the business didn’t go well and he had lost a
              lot of money. He even asked me to lend him more money to recover his business. When
              I refused and asked him to return me the money, he kept delaying and finally
              told me that he could only return me SGD 10,000 and the rest have to wait until
              he had sorted things out.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-indent: 36.0pt;">My friend is facing the same
              problems, and he is only earning about SGD 2000 per month. After putting in all
              his savings, Alfred managed to persuade him to go to several different banks
              and took up loan of around SGD 70,000 to 80,000. When Alfred stopped paying the
              interest, he were going to bankrupt if not his parents took out their life
              savings and saved him. The worst part, Alfred asked my friend to lend him money
              using reasons such as need more cash to revive the business and need some cash
              to settle some debt. Out of friendship and kindness, my friend not only used
              his own money to lend to Alfred, but also borrowed from his friend to lend to
              Alfred. Alfred kept promising that he would return the money next week or next
              month, but the truth is he would use some excuses to delay and in the end not
              paying my friend a single cent.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-indent: 36.0pt;">My friend told me he’s going
              to make police report because he felt like being cheated. After some
              discussion, we think that this is a Ponzi scheme, or Alfred was not doing
              business all along and used the money on something illegal.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span>                </span>If
              you have any friends or family working or staying in Singapore or JB, please
              let them know about this guy. If you are a victim of his scheme, I urge you to
              go to report to police in Singapore to protect yourself. If he is really doing
              something illegal and is caught, only those who have reported to police will be
              innocent, otherwise, you may become his accomplice. Last I heard, people have
              gone to report police and the police are actively investigating the case. If Alfred
              happens to contact you to get money from you, you better say no and protect
              your money.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span>                </span>Please
              share this out so that no one will be his next victim.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> Summary of Alfred’s method of operation:</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: 36.0pt; text-indent: -18.0pt; "><span><span>1.<span style='font: 7.0pt "Times New Roman";'>       </span></span></span>He will tell you he runs a big business and
              persuade you to put in money with him.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: 36.0pt; text-indent: -18.0pt; "><span><span>2.<span style='font: 7.0pt "Times New Roman";'>       </span></span></span>After gaining your trust, he will persuade you
              to go to several banks to take up bank loans.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: 36.0pt; text-indent: -18.0pt; "><span><span>3.<span style='font: 7.0pt "Times New Roman";'>       </span></span></span>Then, he will tell you that he is facing some
              problems and will start to borrow money from you, and ask you to go and borrow
              more from your friends and family. All the money that you have put in with him
              will be conveniently lost.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: 36.0pt; text-indent: -18.0pt; "><span><span>4.<span style='font: 7.0pt "Times New Roman";'>       </span></span></span>He will come out with plans and ideas to recover
              the lost money, but all of them need you to put more money into them. If you
              still trust him, you will bleed to death eventually because he will break all
              of his promises and you won’t get back a single cent.</p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">Alfred (I think his surname is

              Well, since we are here, i would like to say that you are really lucky.. there are way better scams that the "alferd" could pull off, and i'd like to simply explain some of this... well, for scams to work, they will need you to pay them, in response to something else, such as they rumor to have kidnapped your child, your parents got into a car crash and they need money, blah blah blah, then they ask for payment and thats it..
              for other scams, they are worse, there are some scams in this world of which the one who got scammed gets paid! and earns more than he "invested" the scamer starts by asking for cash around a small group, and using his own money, return a percentage interest, then, he says that he needs more cash and investments, and ask you to persue your families and friends, even if you invest 1k, he;d still give you cash like, 200 then, he would ask for more, usually not from you, but ask you to introduce to your family, eventually, he pays using the other people's money to the first layer of people, who attracts even more people untill it snowballs, like that of an upsidedown pyramid, then, he vanishes, taking most of the money and returning only a part of it, and the people who earns it have no clue its even a scam and has "killed" his friends and families.
              Yours is better, if this comforts you...
              on a side note, you are way too damm greedy... i mean, why? he didnt pay you back what you started with! dont invest more inside, plus, its like like he couldnt goto the bank hiimself or goto bigger companies! think when you pay!
