That mean the non-combat-fit personnel have to blame themselve for wasting the 2 and half year being a cheap labour? Furthermore, you are only representing a small fraction of combat-fit NSmen who think so positively towards NS. You are maybe one of the lucky one who built your happiness over other's suffering. Of course, all officer will have good life off in NS arrowing the lower ranking to do all the dirty jobs. But I am not here to condemn this. i am speaking for all NSmen, to question the validity of NS for the benefit of the country.<br><br>Removing NS does not mean we be taking all military force away from singapore. what are the regular army for? Why are we buying so many advance weapons? these should made up for a regular fully trained military force in singapore who is in better position  to defend singapore rather than a large pool of low morale NSmen. So personally i think the government should spent more $$$ to develop our regular army instead of wasting resource and hindering the economic by calling up NSmen for cheap labour. I'm sure with better incentive, lots of brave and positive soldier like Mr Larry who think NS benefited them will join the army to defend our country. That will justify our $$$ paid to the goverment for national defence instead of the government pay our money back to us to defend ourselves while the extra are maybe pocketed.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 09 March 2001).]</div>

The maximum number of days the SAF can call u back for ICT/reservist trainings is only 40 days.

However, compared this to the normal 14 days of leave that a employee in singapore can take, the company will suffer loss. How would the company feel for a SINGAPOREAN employee who have to be frequently called up for ICT/reservist for 40 days leaving more urgent and important jobs undone. No wonder, some employers have to question singaporean whether they need to go back for reservist during job interview. And no wonder, more and more foreigner or PR are being employed while the singaporean are left out in the cold. If i am the employer, i will defintely employ an equally skilled PR rather than a singaporean who need to leave a project frequently for training for the company's sake. Maybe we should be asking ourselves question "Why be a singaporean?" refer to article from <a href="http://www.gn.apc.org/sfd/Link%20Pages/Link%20Folders/01Ds/220201d.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.gn.apc.org/sfd/Link%20Pages/Link%20Folders/01Ds/220201d.html</a><br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 09 March 2001).]</div>

Since the government had predicted the problem of our greying population, yet they have no good idea of solving it. so why are we paying the mp so much for? And i think you kept asking stupid question either on purpose or simply because you do not understand english. Did i say the government IS GOING OR HAD implemented 5 years NS or enlisting girl for NS? I SAID "<strong>WHEN IT COME TO A POINT</strong> where local male are the minority and length of NS have to be increased to 5 years or the government have to force girl to be enlisted for NS? what do you think will happen?" The per month salary might be a typo mistake. but the minister is getting a higher salary than normal. And they still want to increase further. Isn't this a known fact? Yes PRs have a better deal than citizen in singapore, i wonder whether we can convert to PR from citizenship.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Complaint about what?His attitude about SAF?I have no intention to be made a laughing stock at the taxi company when i go complain about a taxi driver's personal attitude towards the SAF.Imagine if i tell the company "I wanna complain your driver,when i was in his cab,he say SAF no good lah etc etc".I wonder what will the complaint handler think,ahahaah </strong></blockquote>you sound like an idiot and being stupid if you gonna complain this way. If i am the one complaining, i would had phrase it differently "I wanna complain your driver for being rude and distrubing to the customer, i thought taxi should be comfort but i really had a hard time sitting in his taxi while he is making all the noise instead of being quiet and concentrating in his driving"<br><br>When you say SAF get +2 points but -10 points, in the end it's -8 to you which is an overall bad impression of SAF to you. wouldn't this apply to others who think the same way. And i am afraid this others is quite alots including me, alot of my frns, you and your senior who is dying to ORD. So could i say OVERALL SAF does not leave a good impression but a bad one with it's overall -8 score? With it's -8 score, i don't understand why you are so pro-SAF and yet you wanna leave SAF. Isn't this a contradiction to yourself? To counter this contradiction, i suggest you sign on further in SAF to prove SAF is a good career.<br><br></div>
