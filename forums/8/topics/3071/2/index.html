It is a service which no male Singaporean can escape, not even the almighty LKY's son, Lee Hsien Loong.<br><br>So what even we got a good diplomatic ties with all the super powers? So what? When defending your own country, it is the citizens of the nation who will put up the best fight unless they do not even want to defend their one and only nation.<br><br>Look at Kuwait, do you think U.S came in one day after Kuwait was invaded? No. They waited months and months before the American came. Who put up resistance before the Americans? It is the people living in Kuwait, forming small band of resistance.<br><br>I agree N.S is useless at times but you will not regret it if a war ever comes though a war is not likely to happen but we must still take precaution. However, 2.5 years should be decrease as it hinders the developement for local males to get to the top of their career earlier.<br><br>Coming to Spies, do anyone of you think Singapore would at all have no spies? Spies are not meant for us to know, even if there is, do you think they will annouce they are training spies? Intelligence is important to any country, whether neutral or hostile, it is still important, I am sure the Government knows about it.<br><br>[This message has been edited by tango (edited 05 March 2001).]</div>

However, 2.5 years should be decrease as it hinders the developement for local males to get to the top of their career earlier.<br><br>Yes i agreed...2.5 years is too long and hinders the economic of the country. Look at all the surfacing problem in singapore. Yes we might have the defence but what's the use of the defence when our population is greying out. shouldn't we be substituting most of the manpower with technology. Shouldn't the MOD divert most of the money they s*cked from us into better usage then to f*ck us around paying us pathetically a few hundred dollars to run over mountain? Would SAF literally mean s*ck and f*ck around?<br><br>Singapore's population has only less than 75% left of native pple which is still declining with our lower birth rate. what is causing this problem? have anyone analysed the root of the problem? what will the case be when most of our young start migrating to other country for a better life? how many more males would be left in singapore for SAF to f*ck around with a pathetic pay. that's maybe what the MOD is now worry about?<br><br>What would you think when you enter the real working environment late only to find a bunch of successful foreigner 2 to 3 years younger than you working better off or maybe had settled down with a family while you are still hopping around singlehanded thinking how to start a real life while playing CS fantasicing your old time during your NS? would you still be proud that you were a commando in the SAF before? What's all these talk about being a real man when you blindly followed the instruction laid down by our leader without rational thinking? So for a punk to become a man, does that mean that you have to run over mountain, learn and speak vulgar language from camp, dig more shit etc? (Anyway, truthfully the one of thing that i learned from NS is vulgar language, before that i din know any)<br><br>what i think of the future for singapore might be just a working environment where foreigner come in to work and earn big buck off leaving the pathetic minority of local pple to struggle and defend the small country. These are my personal opinion.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kyo23:<br><br>I think if the government is willing to put more money to pay for the SAF personnel, more people will join SAF.<br><br>I am sure many males do have a interest in military life but looking at the prospect of it in Singapore and how 'great' SAF is in the international world, no intelligent male would really want to sign on unless you're on scholarship and enjoy not using your brain in the SAF except to push all your work to lower ranked officers to do it for you and while you claim the credit for it.<br><br>It is a obvious case SAF personnel lacks moral. Take a look at most of your NS friends who truefully speak from their heart. No one like the SAF life neither do they look forward to the pathetic pay.<br><br>Even if it is doing our nation a service, it does not mean we should be ill-treat. We still need a life. For N.S men, 200-500 max(if I am not wrong) salary is pathetic. Since we are doing the nation a service, so are the ministers, why are they getting pay like 1.5 million - &gt; 2million a year? While our N.S men who serve the nation with their blood and sweat gets 280?-500 SDG a month? Balance? Are NS men not serving the nation like the ministers are doing?<br><br>Well as the saying goes, we are all equal but some are just more equal.<br></div>

However, 2.5 years should be decrease as it hinders the developement for local males to get to the top of their career earlier.<br><br>Yes i agreed...2.5 years is too long and hinders the economic of the country. Look at all the surfacing problem in singapore. Yes we might have the defence but what's the use of the defence when our population is greying out. shouldn't we be substituting most of the manpower with technology. Shouldn't the MOD divert most of the money they s*cked from us into better usage then to f*ck us around paying us pathetically a few hundred dollars to run over mountain? Would SAF literally mean s*ck and f*ck around?<br><br>Singapore's population has only less than 75% left of native pple which is still declining with our lower birth rate. what is causing this problem? have anyone analysed the root of the problem? what will the case be when most of our young start migrating to other country for a better life? how many more males would be left in singapore for SAF to f*ck around with a pathetic pay. that's maybe what the MOD is now worry about?<br><br>What would you think when you enter the real working environment late only to find a bunch of successful foreigner 2 to 3 years younger than you working better off or maybe had settled down with a family while you are still hopping around singlehanded thinking how to start a real life while playing CS fantasicing your old time during your NS? would you still be proud that you were a commando in the SAF before? What's all these talk about being a real man when you blindly followed the instruction laid down by our leader without rational thinking? So for a punk to become a man, does that mean that you have to run over mountain, learn and speak vulgar language from camp, dig more shit etc? (Anyway, truthfully the one of thing that i learned from NS is vulgar language, before that i din know any)<br><br>what i think of the future for singapore might be just a working environment where foreigner come in to work and earn big buck off leaving the pathetic minority of local pple to struggle and defend the small country.
