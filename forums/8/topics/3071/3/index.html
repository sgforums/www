Did you look at TLH's case just by local presses? If it is so only, it is very much one sided. How would someone who has a daughter as a christian, be a anti-christian, someone who could speak Malay well be a anti-malay? I of course can never assure you he is 100% a good guy but at least if you deem him a traitor of Singapore, please, read his case from foreign presses, it shows another different view from a non-oppressed publishing press.<br><br>About Dr Chee, how would he be deem a crook? He is someone who fight for our rights but his concern is more of Human Rights more than that our bread and butter aspects.<br><br>However, though they are fighting for us, I do not want PAP to be kicked out of the government, what I personally and I think many Singaporeans want to see is the check of the power of the PAP and not just another single ruling party government and that's when the opposition comes in.<br><br>Every party has their pros and cons.<br></div>

As a small nation, we have no choice but to make sure we have a national defense force big enough in number to forestall a incoming war.<br><br>If one day a crazy politician, someone like Hitler, no matter what kind of diplomatic relation we hold with that country, a war cannot be prevail.<br><br>Also, I think Singaporeans should really change their attitude on, if we are being invaded by other countries, the U.N will come and save us. Of course the U.N is a world peace keeping organisation but do remember, assistance from another country will mean extra war equipments and the cost will be beared upon our own country. It is therefore, still better to have our own operational defense force all the time.<br><br>Given the current state of the SAF, it is very hard to predict if we can actually win a war against any of our neighbour. If we have the Japanese Kamikaze, nationalistic mentality, I would definitely say, no problem even if we have a war with any of our neighbours but look, the SAF morale is generally low. Regulars or even N.S men, mostly that I have talked to, know of, they only take NS as a deterrent to our own careers, not even as a deterrent force against foreign invasion. Why? SAF has bad rules and regulation, lousy pay, not even possible to be count as a career for most of the guys, it is all about rank in SAF. If I am a colonel, you listen, no democracy in SAF. If only SAF condition would improve, I am sure people will join SAF voluntarily.<br><br>However, that is not likely to happen as our money to the government ends up in LKY and sons and his bunch of ministers' coffer at the very end.<br><br>We bribe our ministers first so that they will not be bribe by others.<br><br>------------------<br>Everyone is equal, just some are more equal.</div>

BUT to say the commandos and guards are fodder units, i think you are damm wrong.<br>they are what they are, because they have special roles in the army that will make the land forces more lethal. They are not trained to be mere target boards. Each and every elements in the army have their important roles to play; infantry, guards, commandos, arty, signals, armour, engineers etc. They are all parts of the lethal land force that SAF is training, and I don't think SAF trains its valueable soldiers<br>to be just fodders.<br></div>
