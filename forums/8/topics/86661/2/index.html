            <div class='col-md body'>If there is a god, then there is no purpose of life. Why ? Because u have no control over your life. If god want u to be a loser for your whole life, nothing u can do will help. Does being a servant sounds meaningful to u ?<br><br>Isn't doing things for your own sake, out of your own freedom a purpose of its own ? I said it before in an earlier thread about the purpose of life. To be happy. Love ones and amount of worries u have will determine your level of happiness.<br><br>Let me ask u a question then. Wat is your purpose of life if there is god ? Purpose is to obey him ?</div>
