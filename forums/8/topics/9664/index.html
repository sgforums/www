            <div class='col-md body'>I just feel that all of us are racists in one way or another, it's just that sometimes, we don't realise that. Call me a racist, people. I really hate it when I needed some time to sleep in the morning and there those Malays guys are playing soccer at the void deck. Moreover, they are making a hell lot of a din and many a times, police have come to clear them all. But after a few days, they're back. Why can't they just spare a thought for the neighbours? On my part, I feel that Singapore is sooner or later going to break out a racial war if this continues on. So I've decided to migrate once I've enough money.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Have you ppl ever wonder why malays are so like that? If they are alittle bit well off than other malays, they will have the hao lian look. Fuck them lah. Most of them only drive proton with the stupid moon logo. Some of the cheapo malays still have the cheeks to change the proton logo into misubitshi logo. Whhahaha...cheapo. Today morning i saw this malay guy in the carpark, locking up his fucking proton, then he look looked at me like very hao lian. I open ruthie's honda 2300cc car, then i go to my misubitshi and open up as well. Then he look away. Of course i stare at him, he pai seh then he walked away liao.  I'm not hao lian but i cant stand their attitude.<br><br>------------------<br>Glenn Ong: " what do you think of Bananaman, honkie?"<br>Honkie: " i think it's about learning to live with your shortcoming.For example, Bananaman is a boy but he sounds like a girl, very sad for us but he is always happy, always singing like a virgin."<br>Bananaman: "ergh!!!
