            <div class='col-md body'>European researchers have found 30 previously hidden supermassive black holes<br>anchoring faraway galaxies, which suggests there at least twice as many of the colossal gravity wells as thought.<br><br>Supermassive black holes hold as much matter as millions or billions of suns. The newfound black holes were long sought but went unnoticed because they lurk behind veils of dust and are so faraway that even the galaxies they anchor are difficult to examine in any detail.<br><br>"This discovery means that surveys of powerful supermassive black holes have so far underestimated their numbers by at least a factor of two, and possibly by up to a factor of five," said study leader Paolo Padovani from Space Telescope-European Coordinating Facility and the European Southern Observatory in Munich, Germany.<br><br>Black Holes and Critical Phenomena<br>A scalar field is a simple form of matter which feels two forces only, gravity produced by itself, and its own pressure. If you try to build a ball in which the field is initially weak, pressure wins and the ball expands away leaving nothing behind. If the field is initially strong gravity wins and the ball collapses to form a black hole<br><br>There is a special critical initial strength such that the field cannot decide whether to evaporate away or collapse to form a black hole. Instead it oscillates increasingly rapidly, performing an infinite number of oscillations in a finite time. The two animations show first an evolution which doesn't form a black hole, and second an evolution which does. The initial strengths differ only by one in the fifteenth decimal place. Each frame shows the scalar field as a function of position. The gravitational field changes the frequency of the field and so the colour indicates what a distant observer would see.<br><br><a href="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gr/public/bh_critical.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gr/public/bh_critical.html</a><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since this world is currently experiencing a delightful amount of paranoia about the End of the World, or Armageddon as it is known informally, it would be a nice thing to list the known extinction level events that are currently believed to exist.<br><br>An extinction level event is a catastrophic event which could, potentially, destroy the human species. Such events, as typically conceived, would probably also destroy a lot of other species in the process. Humanity is unique among Earth's species, however, for its ability to generate extinction level events by itself, even without environmental or external intervention.<br><br>Alien Invasion<br><br>A Hollywood favourite, this one.

Usually involves 'death rays' and spaceships the size of Manhattan.<br><br>Biological Weapons<br><br>The development of biological weaponry which contains biological agents or superbugs that are extremely lethal and difficult or impossible to cure (Anthrax and smallpox being good examples). Cheap to develop, impossible to estimate the result of their use. Many governments around the world still spend good taxpayers money in the pursuit of such weapons to see how lots of people can die horribly.<br><br>Black Holes<br><br>Apparently, space is full of what is known as Primeval Black Holes: massively dense objects that are incredibly tiny. They were formed during the big bang and they spend their time drifting around the universe until they find an appropriate planet to swallow up. In this scenario, a black hole buries itself in the Earth's core, and over time begins to suck in material, until 'pop' we are all squashed into a little ball the size of an electron.<br><br>Comet Impact<br><br>A large body of material, such as a comet or a meteorite with a diameter greater than one mile could destroy life as we know it by colliding with the Earth and releasing the energy of, oooh, millions of atomic bombs, and causing a nuclear winter. Such an impact is commonly believed to be the cause of the extinction of the dinosaurs, 65 million years ago. Apparently our local space is full of candidate objects, so its only a matter of time...<br><br>Famine<br><br>Many foods eaten today are, in many ways, totally different to their naturally-occurring cousins. Wheat, for example, has been specially selected over millenia, so that it contains much more nutrition per stalk than would occur naturally. The downside of this is that these foodstuffs depend almost entirely on science for their survival. They cannot reproduce naturally anymore and their defenses against predators are totally dependent on advances in pesticide and herbicide science. If scientists begin to lose this continuous race against nature, then wheat - among other foods - will be off the menu. Permanently.<br><br>Flood<br><br>This is an event based on the Biblical myth about the world being completely covered by water, which appears to have been corroborated by similar myths around the same time. Recent findings by scientists indicate that the myths could have originated from the actual flooding of the Black Sea by the Mediterranean only 5,000 years ago.<br><br>Greenhouse Effect<br><br>Global warming takes place because of the gradual build-up of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, sources of which include cattle and people which both produce a lot of gas, things which burn stuff for power like cars and coal-fired power stations, and naturally-occurring forest fires. Greenhouse gases trap heat, so global temperatures begin to rise, and rise, and rise, commonly called the Greenhouse Effect. A projected short term effect of this rise in temperature is the rise in sea levels globally. Our neighbouring planet Venus is the victim of a runaway greenhouse effect, and temperatures there are commonly in excess of 400Â°C.<br><br>Hot Viruses<br><br>Hot viruses are devilish viruses that infect unsuspecting people and cause them to rapidly degenerate into a soup of virus-infected goo. Before death, all pores and orifices in the body start to leak blood. Examples of such diseases include Ebola and Marburg. There are no cures for these at the moment and their existence are worrying people silly.<br><br>Ice Age<br><br>By Earth standards, the last Ice Age finished very recently - only 10,000 years ago. An Ice Age now would plunge most of the Western World into a deep freeze. Some scientists believe such an event could occur very rapidly indeed, on a geological time scale - over, say, 100 years. Ice Ages tend to last, on average 100,000 years.<br><br>Meltdown<br><br>There is a perceived possibility that if the core of a nuclear reactor overheats and attains critical mass, then the remnants will bore their way into the Earth's core, with unknown but, as always, potentially horrible results.<br><br>Nuclear War<br><br>In this scenario, one country starts to fling dirty big thermonuclear missiles at another country. The other country then retaliates with even dirtier big thermonuclear missiles. Before you know it the Earth, as seen from the moon, is one hell of a firework party, and a lot of people are dying in large numbers. As a side effect, you might even get Nuclear Winter thrown in for free.<br><br>Nuclear Winter<br><br>Typically conceived as an effect of things like Nuclear War or Comet Impact, rather than as an independent cause, but if enough material is pushed into the stratosphere then this will block out direct sunlight and there will be a dramatic drop in temperature. The net effect is that most plants and, as a result, most large creatures, including us, will be wiped out.<br><br>Polar Reversal<br><br>The Earth's magnetic poles are not very stable and are continually changing position. Geological records indicate that the poles have actually changed polarity many times in the past, and that we are now due for another reversal. Little is known about the effect of this on life, but scientists think that at a minimum, pigeons will fall out of the sky. Navigation by compass will also become very difficult, potentially destroying the sport of orienteering.<br><br>The Rapture<br><br>Christian belief that as a prelude to the end of the world, the righteous will be spirited off to a higher place and the rest of us sinners will be left around to pick up the pieces. Precisely when the rest of us could be sure that this Rapture has occurred is usually not defined, and some potentially misguided souls have already voluntarily left the World in small groups with an understanding that the Rapture was upon them.<br><br>Superbugs<br><br>A number of strains of bacteria discovered recently are immune to all known antibiotics, such as E-Coli. If these strains become widespread, there is a likelihood of near-extinct diseases reappearing, such as the plague, anthrax and cholera, with death rates from such diseases similar to those of Medieval times.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br></div>
