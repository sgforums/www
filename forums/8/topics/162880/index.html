Therefore, is he short changing himself for that better flower which is possible and highly propable.<br><br>Therefore, what is contentment, what is the measure of a close perfection comes into play. Each and everyone has a "perfection" standard but to expect  prefection is not reasonable. But to not have a "standard" and just pick the first one is also no going to work out.  Based on the "prefect/ideal" that a person is looking for, if a person can find a partner who is 70-80% close to one's definition of perfection, then this is close enough.<br><br>But I feel this thread starter do not really know what she is looking for, and she's fairly young and can bid her time. And through a bit of selfish though is not letting go and leading the fellow on. The fellow is like a spare tyre for her to fall back on.  She does not seem to really like the guy anyways...  however, its just something of a gut feel... might not be true..<br><br></div>
