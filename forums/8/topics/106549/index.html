Something about his brother had an car accident or whatever... and i'm like.. Hmmmmmm.. okie.. So i avoided the heck out of him...We were discussing this with my mutual friend. Apparently he's been going around borrowing money from other people he hardly knew and was always late on his portion of rent. Consequently... i concluded that what he has been doing after work was.. hanging around Crown casino. Good one dude, last i heard he's back in Malaysia working for his daddyo.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think most of the time people spend money the moment they get their hands on it.  It was said that throughout a lifetime, on average a person have 1m running through our bank account, but why is it that most people are still poor?<br><br>The true fact is more money is not a solution to problems...in fact it will get worse...I could bet on it, if you give $$ to people who is in debt, often times, they wont pay off their debt, instead, they will get themself more debts.  Its the habbit that is the problem not the money....Poor people have poor spending habbits, thats all!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If I got a lot of cash I think I will invest in a landed property to rent out. Safe and stable way to roll more cash. Of course if you are freaking rich, I guess the easiest way is to buy up companies when they are in trouble. Tide them over the crisis and then after that you have people working to support you and your family. Wahahah</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry ya. I can't give you any advice. I'm still looking for a job much less a millionaire!

I find it strange that i survive on $200 a month when i'm studying, and i still have some reserves to lend my friends who have a monthly er... income? of 600 - 800. Its really very strange, as if the guys out there don't know how to manage their finances at all.<br><br>Of course not all guys, just a few that i've seen and known personally.<br><br>Grr. I remember got one guy use my internet (Singnet), and chalked up 1k worth of bills. My dad paid it off and he promised to return it... but that was in 1998. Now he's gone, run off to where i dunno..<br><br>But the thing about 'lending' $ to poor people is this, it is highly probably you will NOT get the money back, so if you want to lend people money, MAKE SURE you do NOT borrow from others to lend, else it'll only be a vicious cycle.<br><br></div>
