            <div class='col-md body'>i think gahmen need more campaign about courtesy and graciousness again in 4 different languages; Chinese, Malay and Indian to educate those not so educated ones and English to educate especially the influx of so many foreigners (blue collar and whilte collar) that work and stay in Singapore nowadays.

Probably due to influx of many many foreigners either as new citizens, permanent residents or just on employment pass.  Not really sure are they committed to be a part of us and live with our values or they simply bo chop and display irresponsible act.  Still think gahmen can start some old campaigns again as these new comers were not aware of some of the good campaigns that we had.</div>

They have the feel of their society belonging to them thereby render responsibility in their caring for the country.<br><br>Our foreign workers are mostly from third world countries coming here for 2 years working permit, whatever campaigns our gahmen start will not be effective.<br><br>With the influx of third world populations into our society, on surface we are in  the first world and striving foward, below lies the third world action that lack the discpline as the case of MRT blocker.<br><br>That is why for the koreans or germans, they have never like foreign workers entry, because it can erode they knew it not only destroy their employment but also the society as a whole, as for japan, they do have foreign workers, but they do the screening carefully so as to only allow certain countries the like of Vietnam to work in their shipyard, all priorty must be given to their own citizen first, if not, strike and topple of gahmen arises.<br><br>Strike and riot in these countries are not that they do not love their country, in fact they love their country more than anything else than to see it destroy both culturally and economically by some erratic or unethical gahmen decision.</div>
