            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, if you read what you quote, I already said I'm partial towards Israel. All of it is factual and can be independantly verified. Why am I only speaking for Israel? Because you're already doing the rest lol.<br><br>Anyway, the way you quote my post, it's very difficult for me to reply in context.<br><br>True, losing loved ones does strange things to people. But if you pardon their acts because of that, then you ought to be fair and objective and do the same to the Israelis, isn't it?<br><br>Are you saying only Palestinians/Lebanese have parents? Do victims of suicide bombings not have parents? Aren't the soldier kidnapped sons of someone? What about ordinary Israelis who lived through rocket attacks through their daily lives even though Israel has already evicted the Gaza settlements?<br><br>Yes there is a humanitarian side to this conflict, and I feel for the innocent on <strong>both</strong> sides, but like what Israel's ambassador to UN said, if Israel successfully disarms Hezbollah, eventually it'd be ordinary Lebanon that benefits.<br><br>When I bring up a Palestine/Arab example to acts you condemn, you conveniently say it's long past. What's passed doesn't mean it didn't happen. Besides, the militant groups of today calling on the "Annihilation of the Jewish State" was as a result of these decade old conflicts.<br><br>If you're really concern about the plight of ordinary Palestiness, then you should be hoping for the disarment of these militants. They kill innocent Israelis(also flesh and blood) and bring about repercussions on their own people. Everytime there's a glim of hope for peaceful negotiations, these groups stir up trouble.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bingo.<br><br>Fighting Hezbollah and Hamas is like fighting ghosts.<br><br>They hide their stockpile of munitions and explosives among the populance, commit acts of aggression and then bait Israel to come at them.<br><br>It's a game of dare: dare Israel to attack them in their civilian hideouts and risk civilian casualties and international condemnation?<br><br>Well, they're calling their bluff. Collateral damage is regretable, but if Israel is to be blamed, so is Hezbollah and Hamas. Deliberately stockpiling in civilians is as cowardly as using innocents as human shields, whether the people are willing or not. This in turn deserves a punitive response.<br><br>Which is why Israel designed targeted assassinations against Hamas leaders, which spooked them totally, despite their claims to the contrary. Isolated hits, maximum damage and morale sapping to terrorists cells.<br><br>Basically declaring: no hiding place is safe.<br><br>Anti-terrorism is a game where the aggressor does not play fair , does not play by the rules. But when forced on the defensive, he cries foul and plays the sympathy card.<br><br>Does he truly deserve any?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Can u blame Israel? I mean, when the country first started out, the neighbours were so hostile towards it that they waged war after war at the country, but repeatedly were pushed back, and even lost land.<br><br>Sure, the Israelis can just sit back, and demand the 2 captured soldiers to be returned, but u must see who their captors are. And when their captors are sworn enemies of the country, can u just sit back and do nothing? And Hizabollah had to add to the fuel by capturing some Israeli soldiers too.<br><br>Right now, the world wants to talk. but talk is cheap. Look at North Korea/South Kora/US. Look at Taiwan/China. Look at Israel/Palestine/Rest of Arab world. If talking can do any good, all these issues would have been resolved long ago. Yet it didn't. In the end, arms and weapons and wars will have to settle issues.<br><br>I am not advocating wars. But reality is, sometimes, action speaks louder than words. The UN is supposedly there to act as meditor between conflicts. But has it done its job at ALL?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Israelis caught using chemical weapons on Lebanon.</strong><br><br><blockquote>July 20, 2006 -- WMR reported that the Israeli military was using poison gas on villages in south Lebanon. According to a former U.S. weapons expert who served in Iraq, the artillery shell in a photo taken in Lebanon (below) is a chemical weapon delivery device. It is being handled by an Israeli Defense Force soldier and Hebrew lettering can be clearly seen on the armored vehicle. Another chemical weapons shell of the same type can be seen lying on the ground to the right. It is not known what type of chemical is in the chemical canister, however, gas dropped by the Israelis in villages in southern Lebanon has resulted in severe vomiting among the civilian population.<br><br>Media commentators have scoffed that Israel, with its relatively unique history, would ever use chemical weapons or poison gas in any war. It is precisely because of that perception that they are using such weapons. The deniability factor prevents the media from taking seriously the credible reports of banned weapons being used by the Israelis</blockquote><img src="http://waynemadsenreport.com/IDFChem.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://waynemadsenreport.com/cwshell.gif"><br><br>Israel using chemical delivery weapons in Lebanon.

            <div class='col-md body'>We all seem so adament on the "by right" of things, trying to say what shoud Israel do and why is it understandable that the terrorists are allowed to kill women and children. Let's look at things conversely shall we?<br><br>Two of your soldiers are kidnapped by a terrorist group whose sole purpose in life is your absolute annilation. Not for you to shift away to another continent where you can launch another attack, not disbanded where you can form terrorist cells of your own, but your utter and absolute annilation, ie, your mother, father, friends, wife etc have to DIE. Not shift away.<br><br>What should you do in response to them? Give them money in return for your soldiers? So everytime a terrorist needs money, let's capture a few Israelis!<br><br>Should the Israelis do prisoner exchange? Next time your friend is arrested, never mind his sentence, let's just kidnap Israelis! No longer should we respect any Israeli laws!<br><br>Should Israel seek UN and political channels to get their soldiers back? Has the terrorists ever respected any UN resolution that does not benefit them? When the UN tells Israel and the US to give more leeway to them, the terrorists keep on trumpeting the UN's words. When the UN tells the terrorists to disarm or to support their own muslim governments, they totally ignore the UN. Do you think for one moment the terrorists will bend over backwards just because an infidel, christian/western UN told them to?<br><br>So for those supporters of the terrorist cause, please answer this question: WHAT SHOULD ISRAEL DO?</div>
