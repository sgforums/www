            <div class='col-md body'>CLAMART, France - Yasser Arafat was reportedly fighting for his life Thursday at a French military hospital after losing consciousness, as anxious Palestinian officials transferred some of their 75-year-old leader's powers to Prime Minister Ahmed Qureia.<br><br><img src="http://us.news1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/ap/20041104/thumb.nyet70211042313.arafat_nyet702.jpg"><br>AP Photo<br><br>Doctors at Percy Military Training Hospital outside Paris, where Arafat was airlifted last Friday after more than two years of confinement in the West Bank, quashed a swirl of reports that he had died. But the French doctors would not say much else, and confusion ruled as Palestinians issued conflicting reports about Arafat's condition and how close to death he was.<br><br>Outside the hospital, some 50 well-wishers held a vigil late into the evening. Some held candles, others portraits of Arafat. A large Palestinian flag hung from the hospital's outer wall.<br><br>"It tears your heart up," said Mahmod Nimr, a 36-year-old unemployed Palestinian. "I can't see someone taking his place."<br><br>In an emergency meeting in the West Bank town of Ramallah, the PLO executive committee empowered Qureia to deal with urgent administrative and financial matters in Arafat's absence, said committee member Qais Abdel Karim. Qureia also will meet with security chiefs in the Gaza Strip (news - web sites) on Friday to ensure that no internal conflict erupts in the volatile area at a time of uncertainty, a Palestinian official said.<br><br>A prolonged Arafat incapacitation Â— or death Â— could have profound impact on the Middle East. There are fears of unrest among Palestinian factions, which Arafat, viewed as a national symbol by even some who opposed him, was largely able to prevent. Furthermore, chaos in the West Bank and Gaza could make any cooperation with Israel even more difficult.<br><br>On the other hand, Israel and the United States have in recent years shunned Arafat as a terrorist and an obstacle to peace, and his replacement by a new leadership could open the door to renewed peace talks. Such a scenario could affect Israel's plans to pull soldiers and settlers out of the Gaza Strip in a move not coordinated with the Palestinians.<br><br>Arafat's chief of staff, Ramzi Khoury, called an Associated Press reporter to say the Palestinian leader was alive but that his condition was grave.<br><br>"I am standing next to the president's bed, he is in grave condition," Khoury said.<br><br>In Washington, Said Hamad, deputy chief of the Palestine Liberation Office, said Arafat was in a coma. Arafat was taken to the intensive care unit after his condition worsened overnight Wednesday.<br><br>French television station LCI quoted an anonymous French medical official as saying Arafat was in an "irreversible coma" and "intubated" Â— a process that usually involves threading a tube down the windpipe to the lungs. The tube is often connected to a life support machine to help the patient breathe.<br><br>However, three Palestinian officials denied Arafat was in a coma.<br><br>"He is not getting better, but not getting worse either. He is being examined. He is not in a coma," Foreign Minister Nabil Shaath said. "There is no explanation for what has happened."<br><br>A Palestinian official in Gaza who is close to Arafat's wife Suha said she told him her husband fell unconscious after receiving a strong anesthetic for a biopsy. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, quoted Suha Arafat as saying her husband was recovering.<br><br>Israel TV's Channel Two reported that Arafat was brain dead and remained on life support.<br><br>However, Arafat's personal physician, Dr. Ashraf Kurdi, told Dubai-based Al-Arabiya television that "Arafat has no type of brain death." He also said a brain scan showed that Arafat had not suffered a hemorrhage or stroke.<br><br>At Arafat's compound in Ramallah, where leaders of the PLO and Arafat's Fatah (news - web sites) movement were meeting, Shaath said top officials were in touch with the hospital in Clamart every 30 minutes.<br><br>"The Palestinian leadership is in constant meeting to follow up on the president's health," Shaath said.<br><br>Meanwhile, about 1,500 Palestinians demonstrated in the West Bank town of Qalqiliya and 500 more in the Balata refugee camp in support of Arafat.<br><br>Israeli military leaders, including Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz, met to discuss Arafat's declining health, Israeli security officials said. The military was placed on high alert, fearing riots if Arafat dies.<br><br>The Israeli military has not moved forces to anticipated problem areas, but commanders were told to be on standby. The army has a contingency plan, called "new leaf," to deal with the fallout from Arafat's death.<br><br>On Thursday, the military also discussed possible burial options for Arafat. Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon (news - web sites) has said he would not permit Arafat to be buried in Jerusalem, which is claimed by both Israel and the Palestinians as their capital. Army chiefs said they also ruled out a burial in the Jerusalem suburb of Abu Dis in the West Bank.<br><br>The confusion over Arafat's condition escalated after Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker told reporters at a summit of European leaders in Belgium that Arafat had died. He later retracted the statement.<br><br>"It was a misunderstanding," Luxembourg government spokesman Lucien Michels said.<br><br>After Juncker's initial statement, a spokesman for the French military hospital said Arafat was alive.<br><br>"Mr. Arafat is not dead," said Christian Estripeau, head of communications for French military health services. "The clinical situation of the first few days following admission has become more complex."<br><br>Juncker's spokesman said the prime minister spoke after receiving a phone call while driving to the summit from a journalist, who relayed an Israeli television station report that Arafat had died.<br><br>Once inside the summit building, Juncker was corrected by French President Jacques Chirac, who had just visited Arafat in the hospital.<br><br>"Chirac spoke to him and told him it was not so," Juncker spokesman Guy Schuller said.<br><br>In Washington, President Bush (news - web sites) was asked by a reporter for his reaction to the report that Arafat had died.<br><br>"My first reaction is God bless his soul," Bush said at a nationally televised news conference. "My second reaction is that we will continue to work for a free Palestinian state that's at peace with Israel."<br><br>- from <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/ap/20041105/ap_on_re_mi_ea/arafat_52" rel="nofollow">Yahoo!

There was once a proposal to make the Gaza Strip the Singapore of the Middle East and this would be even more possible now with the Jews taking all their settlers out. The only problem with this plan is that the mentality there is not as good as Singaporeans and all their energy is focused into a hell bent desire to destroy Israel. If they would only sit down at a table to talk to the Jews and not throw bombs at them then things could be sorted out better.

If you have Malaysia's TV 1, you can see that Palestinians die everyday...they're being bullied by the Jews.</strong></blockquote><br>We would probably witness some major changes to middle east in our lifetime; let's see if damascus will stand.<br><br>Anyway, some extracts...<br><br>Palestine has never been the name of a nation or state. It is a geographical term, used to designate the region at those times in history when there is no nation or state there.<br><br>The word itself derives from "Peleshet", a name that appears frequently in the Bible and entered into English as "Philistine". It dates to the thirteenth century BCE, for peoples who migrated from the region of the Aegean Sea and the Greek Islands and settled on the southern coast of the land of Canaan. There they established five independent city-states (including Gaza) on a narrow strip of land that came to be known as Philistia. The Greeks and Romans called it "Palastina".<br><br>The Philistines were not Arabs, they were not Semites . They had no connection, ethnic, linguistic or historical with Arabia or Arabs. The name "Falastin" that Arabs today use for "Palestine" is not an Arabic name. It is the Arab pronunciation of the Greco-Roman "Palastina" derived from Peleshet.<br><br>and more...<br><br>1. Nationhood and Jerusalem: Israel became a nation in 1312 B.C.E., two thousand years before the rise of Islam.<br><br>2. Arab refugees in Israel began identifying themselves as part of a Palestinian people in 1967, two decades after the establishment of the modern State of Israel.<br><br>3. Since the Jewish conquest in 1272 B.C.E; the Jews have had dominion over the land for one thousand years with a continuous presence in the land for the past 3,300 years.<br><br>4. The only Arab dominion since the conquest in 635 C.E. lasted no more than 22 years.<br><br>5. For over 3,300 years, Jerusalem has been the Jewish capital. Jerusalem has never been the capital of any Arab or Muslim entity. Even when the Jordanians occupied Jerusalem, they never sought to make it their capital, and Arab leaders did not come to visit.<br><br>6. Jerusalem is mentioned over 700 times in Tanach, the Jewish Holy Scriptures. Jerusalem is not mentioned once in the Koran.<br><br>7. King David founded the city of Jerusalem. Mohammed never came to Jerusalem.<br><br>8. Jews pray facing Jerusalem. Muslims pray with their backs toward Jerusalem.<br><br>9. Arab and Jewish Refugees In 1948 the Arab refugees were encouraged to leave Israel by Arab leaders promising to purge the land of Jews. Sixty-eight percent left without ever seeing an Israeli soldier.<br><br>10. The Jewish refugees were forced to flee from Arab lands due to Arab brutality, persecution and pogroms.<br><br>11. The number of Arab refugees who left Israel in 1948 is estimated to be around 630,000. The number of Jewish refugees from Arab lands is estimated to be the same.<br><br>12. Arab refugees were INTENTIONALLY not absorbed or integrated into the Arab lands to which they fled, despite the vast Arab territory. Out of the 100,000,000 refugees since World War II, theirs is the only refugee group in the world that has never been absorbed or integrated into their own peoples' lands. Jewish refugees were completely absorbed into Israel, a country no larger than the state of New Jersey.<br><br>13. The Arab - Israeli Conflict; The Arabs are represented by eight separate nations, not including the Palestinians. There is only one Jewish nation. The Arab nations initiated all five wars and lost. Israel defended itself each time and won.<br><br>14. The P.L.O.'s Charter still calls for the destruction of the State of Israel. Israel has given the Palestinians most of the West Bank land. Autonomy under the Palestinian Authority has supplied them with weapons.<br><br>15. Under Jordanian rule, Jewish holy sites were desecrated and the Jews were denied access to places of worship. Under Israeli rule, all Muslim and Christian sites have been preserved and made accessible to people of all faiths.<br><br>16. The U.N. Record on Israel and the Arabs: Of the 175 Security Council resolutions passed before 1990, 97 were directed against Israel.<br><br>17. Of the 690 General Assembly resolutions voted on before 1990, 429 were directed against Israel.<br><br>18. The U.N was silent while 58 Jerusalem Synagogues were destroyed by the Jordanians.<br><br>19. The U.N. was silent while the Jordanians systematically desecrated the ancient Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives.<br><br>20. The U.N. was silent while the Jordanians enforced an apartheid-like policy of preventing Jews from visiting the Temple Mount and the Western Wall.<br><br>Bully you said?</div>
