            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by  M:<br><strong></strong><br>We would probably witness some major changes to middle east in our lifetime; let's see if damascus will stand.<br><br>Anyway, some extracts...<br><br>Palestine has never been the name of a nation or state. It is a geographical term, used to designate the region at those times in history when there is no nation or state there.<br><br>The word itself derives from "Peleshet", a name that appears frequently in the Bible and entered into English as "Philistine". It dates to the thirteenth century BCE, for peoples who migrated from the region of the Aegean Sea and the Greek Islands and settled on the southern coast of the land of Canaan. There they established five independent city-states (including Gaza) on a narrow strip of land that came to be known as Philistia. The Greeks and Romans called it "Palastina".<br><br>The Philistines were not Arabs, they were not Semites . They had no connection, ethnic, linguistic or historical with Arabia or Arabs. The name "Falastin" that Arabs today use for "Palestine" is not an Arabic name. It is the Arab pronunciation of the Greco-Roman "Palastina" derived from Peleshet.<br><br>and more...<br><br>1. Nationhood and Jerusalem: Israel became a nation in 1312 B.C.E., two thousand years before the rise of Islam.<br><br>2. Arab refugees in Israel began identifying themselves as part of a Palestinian people in 1967, two decades after the establishment of the modern State of Israel.<br><br>3. Since the Jewish conquest in 1272 B.C.E; the Jews have had dominion over the land for one thousand years with a continuous presence in the land for the past 3,300 years.<br><br>4. The only Arab dominion since the conquest in 635 C.E. lasted no more than 22 years.<br><br>5. For over 3,300 years, Jerusalem has been the Jewish capital. Jerusalem has never been the capital of any Arab or Muslim entity. Even when the Jordanians occupied Jerusalem, they never sought to make it their capital, and Arab leaders did not come to visit.<br><br>6. Jerusalem is mentioned over 700 times in Tanach, the Jewish Holy Scriptures. Jerusalem is not mentioned once in the Koran.<br><br>7. King David founded the city of Jerusalem. Mohammed never came to Jerusalem.<br><br>8. Jews pray facing Jerusalem. Muslims pray with their backs toward Jerusalem.<br><br>9. Arab and Jewish Refugees In 1948 the Arab refugees were encouraged to leave Israel by Arab leaders promising to purge the land of Jews. Sixty-eight percent left without ever seeing an Israeli soldier.<br><br>10. The Jewish refugees were forced to flee from Arab lands due to Arab brutality, persecution and pogroms.<br><br>11. The number of Arab refugees who left Israel in 1948 is estimated to be around 630,000. The number of Jewish refugees from Arab lands is estimated to be the same.<br><br>12. Arab refugees were INTENTIONALLY not absorbed or integrated into the Arab lands to which they fled, despite the vast Arab territory. Out of the 100,000,000 refugees since World War II, theirs is the only refugee group in the world that has never been absorbed or integrated into their own peoples' lands. Jewish refugees were completely absorbed into Israel, a country no larger than the state of New Jersey.<br><br>13. The Arab - Israeli Conflict; The Arabs are represented by eight separate nations, not including the Palestinians. There is only one Jewish nation. The Arab nations initiated all five wars and lost. Israel defended itself each time and won.<br><br>14. The P.L.O.'s Charter still calls for the destruction of the State of Israel. Israel has given the Palestinians most of the West Bank land. Autonomy under the Palestinian Authority has supplied them with weapons.<br><br>15. Under Jordanian rule, Jewish holy sites were desecrated and the Jews were denied access to places of worship. Under Israeli rule, all Muslim and Christian sites have been preserved and made accessible to people of all faiths.<br><br>16. The U.N. Record on Israel and the Arabs: Of the 175 Security Council resolutions passed before 1990, 97 were directed against Israel.<br><br>17. Of the 690 General Assembly resolutions voted on before 1990, 429 were directed against Israel.<br><br>18. The U.N was silent while 58 Jerusalem Synagogues were destroyed by the Jordanians.<br><br>19. The U.N. was silent while the Jordanians systematically desecrated the ancient Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives.<br><br>20. The U.N. was silent while the Jordanians enforced an apartheid-like policy of preventing Jews from visiting the Temple Mount and the Western Wall.<br><br>Bully you said?[/b]</blockquote>Well actually, yes.  The fact is that many are still dying out there.  That's what I meant by "bullied".  Even if Malaysia shows only the muslims suffering, they are still being bullied.  "Bullied" because the lack defense.  I thought Israel became a state somewhere AD?  I don't see how religion has got to do with territory...but I guess you can find some evidence to whom it belongs to in scriptures...This is a little biased isn't it?  I may be wrong though, but these are facts on the Jew's side.<br><br>Hey I've seen this before somewhere...</div>

If my friend is a Christian and attacks me for no good reason, does it mean that Christianity encourages violence?  No, only that the person hasn't learnt to control himself, or is misguided.  It's a pity that only bad people get attention.<br><br>As for suicide bombings, I suppose we have to try putting ourselves in their shoes.  "By killing our enemies this way, you are warning the government, to stop doing whatever they are doing" and it's a form of warning.<br><br>Take Iraq for example.  This could be a way fo saying "get out of my country" and "I'm not happy with you being here".<br><br>The people's faith there are very strong, and there is a big risk in misguidance.  Thus, some of them think it's heroic to attack people by blowing themselves up in the name of Islam, and their country.  This, of course, is wrong.<br><br>How are they supposed to declare a war with stones (they really do use stones!)?  I hear Jews dying rarely with bombs...maybe they use simple materials and make petrol bombs and <strong>moratophs</strong> &lt;--(dunno the spelling)...it comes rarely anyway.  The suicide stuff occurs more often in Iraq.  It's not a rich state.<br><br>Islam's not racist.  In the Qur'an, the Jews are given a respectful name, "People fo the Book".  The book refers to the Torrah, the Jewish hooly book.<br><br>According to my sources, Israel is not Jewish land, but I'm not that sure.  I'll have to do more researching.  It's so confusing that I think the should just split the place into 2, between Arabs and Jews, and disallow any traspassers.  Somehow let all visit the holy sites there...</div>

Your claim of the extract being false is only supported by the twist of modern history through the omission of ancient claims. There were plenty of foreign domination from it's patriachal origins to the present; persians, romans, byzantine, arab, ottoman, british, and a lil more, all the way through to when they regained independence but how such a trail of occupation is suppose to erode their long history according to you is beyond me.<br><br>and if this is gonna ping pong more pages i'll just agree to disagree.</div>

In war you run risk of losing land and the IDF withdrew from most captured territory each time to reach for peace. To add insult, when Jordan and Eygpt both captured the West Bank and Gaza Strip respectively in the 1948 War of Independence, they plundered the region, desecrated jewish graves and homes. Instead of working towards the independent state for the arabs that they have called out from Israel, they left it to rot for 19 years and denied their fellows their promise.<br><br><blockquote>Arab critics of Israel speak of Jewish migration to Palestine after World War I, neglecting to mention that there has been a substantial and continuous Jewish presence in the land for over three thousand years, and a steady Jewish majority in Jerusalem. Nor do they care to remember that when, after World War II, the General Assembly proposed to partition Palestine, this followed an earlier (1922) and illegal partition by the British which gave almost 80% of the land promised to the Jews by the Balfour Declaration to create the Arab state of Transjordan. Thus, at the time of the 1947 partition vote in the United Nations, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the Jews had already been unlawfully deprived of four-fifths of their entitlement</span>.<br><br>- Louis Rene Beres<br>Professor of International Law<br>Department of Political Science<br>Purdue University </blockquote>But let's get real, it was never about the land.
