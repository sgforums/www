In war you run risk of losing land and the IDF withdrew from most captured territory each time to reach for peace. To add insult, when Jordan and Eygpt both captured the West Bank and Gaza Strip respectively in the 1948 War of Independence, they plundered the region, desecrated jewish graves and homes. Instead of working towards the independent state for the arabs that they have called out from Israel, they left it to rot for 19 years and denied their fellows their promise.<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Arab critics of Israel speak of Jewish migration to Palestine after World War I, neglecting to mention that there has been a substantial and continuous Jewish presence in the land for over three thousand years, and a steady Jewish majority in Jerusalem. Nor do they care to remember that when, after World War II, the General Assembly proposed to partition Palestine, this followed an earlier (1922) and illegal partition by the British which gave almost 80% of the land promised to the Jews by the Balfour Declaration to create the Arab state of Transjordan. Thus, at the time of the 1947 partition vote in the United Nations, the Jews had already been unlawfully deprived of four-fifths of their entitlement.<br><br>- Louis Rene Beres<br>Professor of International Law<br>Department of Political Science<br>Purdue University<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>But let's get real, it was never about the land.

I don't see how words like "pissing existence" have got to do with this<br><br>All I know is that throughout History, there were Jewish tribes, but not a single Jewish state.  When we see whose land it belongs to, we ask the government.<br><br>I hate the media.  It's always biased.  This includes the news.<br><br>I don't think this has got to do with religion either, besides the fact that most Jews ae Judaists and most Arabs are Muslims...<br><br>And what about the palestinians now?  Is it not bad to let them get massacred now too?</div>

Muslims worship the same God too.<br><br>It would be wrong to say that the other 2 worship a different God!<br><br>Arabia has a very, very long history.  I'm not saying that Israel doesn't.  Israel <span style="font-style: italic;">does</span> have a long history and is in Arabia too, but the surrounding nations musn't be neglected.<br><br>The Kabaa is in Saudi Arabia.
