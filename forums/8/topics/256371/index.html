            <div class='col-md body'>The passengers on the bus watched sympathetically as the attractive<br>young woman with the white cane made her way carefully up the<br>steps. She paid the driver and, using her hands to feel the<br>location of the seats, walked down the aisle and found the seat<br>he'd told her was empty. Then she's settled in, placed her<br>briefcase on her lap and rested her cane against her leg.<br><br>It had been a year since Susan became blind. Due to a medical<br>misdiagnosis she had been rendered sightless, and she was suddenly<br>thrown into a world of darkness, anger, frustration and self-pity.<br>'How could this have happened to me?' she would plead, her heart<br>knotted with anger. But no matter how much she cried or ranted or<br>prayed, she knew the painful truth, her sight was never going to<br>return. A cloud of depression hung over Susan's once optimistic<br>spirit. All she had to cling to was her husband Mark.<br><br>Mark was an Air Force officer and he loved Susan with all his<br>heart. When she first lost her sight, he watched her sink into<br>despair and was determined to help his wife gain the strength she<br>needed to become independent again.<br><br>Finally, Susan felt ready to return to her job, but how would she<br>get there? She used to take the bus, but was now too frightened to<br>get around the city by herself. Mark volunteered to drive her to<br>work each day, even though they worked at opposite ends of the<br>city. At first, this comforted Susan and fulfilled Mark's need to<br>protect his sightless wife who was so insecure about performing the<br>slightest task. Soon, however Mark realized that this arrangement<br>wasn't working - it was hectic, and costly.<br><br>Susan is going to have to start taking the bus again, he admitted<br>to himself. But just the thought of mentioning it to her made him<br>cringe. She was still so fragile, so angry. How would she react?<br>Just as Mark predicted, Susan was horrified at the idea of taking<br>the bus again. "I'm blind!" she responded bitterly.<br>"How am I<br>supposed to know where I'm going? I feel like you're abandoning<br>me."<br><br>Mark's heart broke but he knew what had to be done. He promised<br>Susan that each day he would ride the bus with her until she got<br>the hang of it.<br><br>And that is exactly what happened. For two solid weeks, Mark,<br>military uniform and all, accompanied Susan to and from work each<br>day. He taught her how to rely on her other senses to determine<br>where she was and how to adapt to her new environment. He helped<br>her befriend the bus drivers who could watch out for her, and save<br>her a seat. Each morning they made the journey together, and Mark<br>would take a cab back to his office.<br><br>Although this routine was even more costly and exhausting than the<br>previous one, Mark knew it was only a matter of time before Susan<br>would be able to ride the bus on her own. Finally, Susan decided<br>that she was ready to try the trip on her own. Monday morning<br>arrived, and before she left, she threw her arms around Mark, her<br>temporary bus riding companion, her husband, and her best friend.<br>Her eyes filled with tears of gratitude for his loyalty, his<br>patience, his love. She said good-bye, and for the first time, they<br>went their separate ways. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday....<br>Each day on her own went perfectly, and Susan had never felt<br>better.<br><br>On Friday morning, Susan took the bus to work as usual. As she was<br>paying for her fare to exit the bus, the driver said, "Boy, I<br>sure<br>envy you." Susan wasn't sure if the driver was speaking to her<br>or<br>not. After all, who on earth would ever envy a blind woman who had<br>struggled just to find the courage to live for the past year?<br>Why<br>do you envy me?"<br><br>The driver responded, "It must feel so good to be taken care of<br>and<br>protected like you are." Susan had no idea what the driver was<br>talking about, "What do you mean?" The driver said,<br>You know,<br>every morning for the past week, a fine looking gentleman in a<br>military uniform has been standing across the corner watching you<br>when you get off the bus. He makes sure you cross the street safely<br>and he watches you until you enter your office building. Then he<br>blows you a kiss, gives you a little salute and walks away. You are<br>one lucky lady."<br><br>Tears of happiness poured down Susan's cheeks. For although she<br>couldn't see him, she had always felt Mark's presence. She was<br>blessed, so blessed, for he had given her a gift more powerful than<br>sight, a gift she didn't need to see to believe - the gift of love<br>that can bring light where there had been darkness.<br><br>"You don't love a woman because she is beautiful, but she is<br>beautiful because you love her..."<br><br>So if you love someone be faithful to that person<br></div>
