            <div class='col-md body'>What if your mother give birth to a "black" colour baby?<br>will he be your brother\sister?<br><br>------------------<br><br>Adolf Hitler was born the son of a customs official and a peasant girl on April 20, 1889. He was a poor student who never completed high school, and in October of 1907, Hitler saw his dreams of becoming an artist shattered when he failed the art exam. He soon developed anti-Jewish and antidemocratic conviction and then joined the army during World War I. He was in Munich and he volunteered for service in the Bavarian army.. Hitler was dedicated, and courageous, although he wasn't promoted early on because his superiors thought he was lacking in leadership qualities, ironic, huh?<br><br>Hilter joined the Nazi party in September of 1919. It was then called the Nationalist German Workers' party. In April of the next year he began working full time for the party. It was renamed the National Socialist German Workers' party. Hitler was soon elected the chairman of the party and was given dictatorial powers.<br><br>Hitler spread his propaganda of racial hatred and contempt for democracy. In November of 1993, he saw his opportunity to gain power. This was a time of political and economic chaos. Hitler led an uprising in Munich against the Weimar Republic. He proclaimed himself Chancellor of a new regime; however, he didn't have the support of the military so his plot to take over Germany collapsed. For his role in this nefarious scheme, Hitler was sentenced to five years imprisonment on February 26, 1924. He served only nine months, and while in jail, he wrote his autobiography, "Mein Kamph." He was released in December 1924 and realized that he must use legal means to assume power.<br><br>Hitler used the Great Depression of 1929 to his advantage by claiming that it had been caused by a Jewish Communist plot. Many Germans accepted this explanation and believed in what Hitler was telling them. He promised them a strong Germany, jobs and national glory. Millions of voters were attracted to Hitler's promises and as a result, the Nazi Party gained 95 seats in parliament, from a mere 12. Following the election of 1930, the party kept on expanding. Unemployment, fear of Communism, and Hitler's confidence all contributed to the growth of Nazi popularity and the ultimate collapse of the Republic in 1932. On January 30, 1933, Hitler was apppointed Chancellor and many believed that he would be easily manipulated by the large corporations.<br><br>However, the business' assumptions were wrong. Once Hitler gained power, he established himself as a despot. The Enabling Acts allowed Hitler's government to make laws without the Legislature, rendering the Legislature powerless. Hitler replaced all labor unions with one Nazi-controlled German Labor Front, banned all political parties (except for the Nazi party), and systematically installed Nazi ideals within the government and the courts. The Nazi power controlled the economy, the media, and cultural activities.<br><br>Hitler used his secret police, the Gestapo, to terrorize the people. However, the majority of citizens approved of Hitler's policies, especially the economic policies which drastically decreased the unemployment rate. His foreign and recreational programs were also widely applauded. Hitler knew that the support of the German people was a necessity for his plans to conquer Europe. To drum up support, he derided the concept of human equality and claimed the racial superiority of the Aryans. He espoused the idea that the Germans had the right to dominate all nations because they were the highest form of human beings; they were the master race.<br><br>Although Hitler's meteoric rise to power and plans for world rule were not realized, he left behind him a trail of misery, and hate. More importantly, he taught the world a lesson on the dangers of international apathy and hate propaganda.<br><br>World War II had a devastating effect of society. Not only were millions of innocents senselessly killed, but many lives were also lost fighting the war.<br><br>The Holocaust was a systematic, bureaucratic annihilation of six million Jews by the Nazi regime under the rule of Hitler. In 1933 about nine million Jews lived in the 21 different countries, later to be occupied by Germans during the war. By 1945 two-thirds of the European Jews had been killed.Millions of innocent lives were lost, not only Jews, but also Gypsies, the disabled, etc. Over three million Soviet POWs were killed. Slavs were targeted for slave labor. Thousands perished in captivity. Many such as Jehovah's Witnesses, religious dissidents, and homosexuals wer persecuted for their beliefs and died as a result of maltreatment. Concentration camps are most closely associated with the Holocaust adn are a symbol of the Nazis. The camps started soon after the beginning of the Nazi regime, and continued until 1945.<br><br>Hitler was aware, however, that his dream of power could not be attained unless he had strong allies. As a result, Germany entered into a nonagression pact with Soviet Union in 1939. To seal the pact, the two countries overpowered Poland and shared the spoils. In one short year, Hitler wreaked havoc in Europe. After easily conquering Poland, and using the Allied apathy to his advantage, Hitler soon captured Denmark, Norway, Netherlands, Belgium, and France. Britain was the only one that was able to narrowly defeat Germany's forces.<br><br>Heady with his numerous victories, Hitler made his first major mistake: he invaded the USSR in June fo 1941. However, he failed to provide his troops with provisions to survive the harsh Russian winters and severely underestimated the number and strength of his old ally's armies. Caught in a long struggle with USSR, and forced to divert his attention away from the Western Front, Hitler stubbornly refused to admit defeat. For the first time, there was dissension among the German troops, who were struggling to stem the waves of Allied soldiers. The Germans' discontent manifested itself in an assassination attempt on Hitler in 1944. Although the German officers failed, the end was near. On April 30, 1945, the infamous dictator committed suicide with his girlfriend, Eva Braun, in a bunker in Berlin.<br><br>When on Sept. 3, 1939, the German Reich received the English declaration of war there was repeated anew a British attempt to render impossible every beginning of a consolidation and thereby of Europe's rise, by fighting whatever power on the Continent was strongest at any given time.<br><br>That is how of yore England ruined Spain in many wars. That is how she conducted her wars against Holland. That is how later she fought France with the aid of all Europe and that is how at the turn of the century she began the encirclement of the then German Reich and in 1914 the World War. Only on account of its internal dissension was Germany defeated in 1918. The consequences were terrible.<br><br>After hypocritical declarations that the fight was solely against the Kaiser and his regime, the annihilation of the German Reich began according to plan after the German Army had laid down its arms.<br><br>While the prophecies of the French statement, that there were 20,000,000 Germans too many-in other words, that this number would have to be exterminated by hunger, disease or emigration-were apparently being fulfilled to the letter, the National Socialist movement began its work of unifying the German people and thereby initiating resurgence of the Reich. This rise of our people from distress, misery and shameful disregard bore all the signs of a purely internal renaissance. Britain especially was not in any way affected or threatened thereby.<br><br>Nevertheless, a new policy of encirclement against Germany, born as it was of hatred, recommenced immediately. Internally and externally there resulted that plot familiar to us all between Jews and democrats, Bolshevists and reactionaries, with the sole aim of inhibiting the establishment of the new German people's State, and of plunging the Reich anew into impotence and misery.<br><br>Apart from us the hatred of this international world conspiracy was directed against those people which like ourselves were neglected by fortune and were obliged to earn their daily bread in the hardest struggle for existence.<br><br>Above all the right of Italy and Japan to share in the goods of this world was contested just as much as that of Germany and in fact was formally denied.<br><br>The coalition of these nations was, therefore, only an act of self-protection in the face of the egoistic world combination of wealth and power threatening them.<br><br>As early as 1936 Prime Minister Churchill, according to statements by the American General Wood before a committee of the American House of Representatives, declared Germany was once again becoming too powerful and must therefore be destroyed.<br><br>In the Summer of 1939 the time seemed to have come for England to begin to realize its intended annihilation by repetition of a comprehensive policy of encirclement of Germany.<br><br>The plan of the campaign of lies staged for this purpose consisted in declaring that other people were threatened, in tricking them with British promises of guarantees and assistance, and of making them march against Germany just as it did preceding the great war.<br><br>Thus Britain from May to August, 1939, succeeded in broadcasting to the world that Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Finland and Bessarabia as well as the Ukraine were being directly threatened by Germany.<br><br>A number of these States allowed themselves to be misled into accepting the promise of guarantee proffered with these assertions, thus joining the new encirclement front against Germany. Under these circumstances I consider myself entitled to assume responsibility before my own conscience and before the history of the German people not only of assuring these countries or their governments of the falseness of British assertions, but also of setting the strongest power in the east, by especially solemn declarations, at rest concerning the limits of our interests.<br><br>National Socialists! At that time you probably all felt that this step was bitter and difficult for me. Never did the German people harbor hostile feeling against the peoples of Russia. However, for over ten years Jewish Bolshevist rulers had been endeavoring from Moscow to set not only Germany but all Europe aflame. At no time ever did Germany attempt to carry her National Socialist Weltanschauung into Russia, but on the contrary Jewish Bolshevist rulers in Moscow unswervingly endeavored to foist their domination upon us and other European peoples, not only by ideological means but above all with military force.<br><br>The consequences of the activity of this regime were nothing but chaos, misery and starvation in all countries. I, on the other hand, have been striving for twenty years with a minimum of intervention and without destroying our production, to arrive at a new Socialist order in Germany which not only eliminates unemployment but also permits the worker to receive an ever greater share of the fruits of his labor.<br><br>The success of this policy of economic and social reconstruction of our people, which by systematically eliminating differences of rank and class, has a true peoples' community as the final aim of the world.<br><br>It was therefore only with extreme difficulty that I brought myself in August, 1939, to send my Foreign Minister to Moscow in an endeavor there to oppose the British encirclement policy against Germany.<br><br>I did this only from a sense of all responsibility toward the German people, but above all in the hope after all of achieving permanent relief of tension and of being able to reduce sacrifices which might otherwise have been demanded of us.<br><br>While Germany solemnly affirmed in Moscow that the territories and countries enumerated-with the exception of Lithuania-lay outside all German political interests, a special agreement was concluded in case Britain were to succeed in inciting Poland actually into war with Germany.<br><br>In this case, too, German claims were subject to limitations entirely out of proportion to the achievement of German forces.<br><br>National Socialists! The consequences of this treaty which I myself desired and which was concluded in the interests of the German nation were very severe, particularly for Germans living in the countries concerned.<br><br>Far more than 500,000 German men and women, all small farmers, artisans and workmen, were forced to leave their former homeland practically overnight in order to escape from a new regime which at first threatened them with boundless misery and sooner or later with complete extermination.<br><br>Nevertheless, thousands of Germans disappeared. It was impossible ever to determine their fate, let alone their whereabouts.<br><br>Among them were no fewer than 160 men of German citizenship. To all this I remained silent because I had to. For, after all, it was my one desire to achieve final relief of tension and, if possible, a permanent settlement with this State.<br><br>However, already during our advance in Poland, Soviet rulers suddenly, contrary to the treaty, also claimed Lithuania.<br><br>The German Reich never had any intention of occupying Lithuania and not only failed to present any such demand to the Lithuanian Government, but on the contrary refused the request of the then Lithuania to send German troops to Lithuania for that purpose as inconsistent with the aims of German policy.<br><br>Despite all this I complied also with this fresh Russian demand. However, this was only the beginning of continually renewed extortions which kept on repeating ever since.<br><br>Victory in Poland which was won by German troops exclusively caused me to address yet another peace offer to the Western Powers. It was refused owing to efforts of international and Jewish warmongers.<br><br>At that time already the reason for such refusal lay in the fact that Britain still had hopes of being able to mobilize a European coalition against Germany which was to include the Balkans and Soviet Russia.<br><br>It was therefore decided in London to send Mr. Cripps [Sir Stafford Cripps] as Ambassador to Moscow. He received clear instructions under all circumstances to resume relations between the English and Soviet Russia and develop them in a pro-British direction. The British press reported on the progress of this mission as long as tactical reasons did not impose silence.<br><br>In the Autumn of 1939 and Spring of 1940 the first results actually made themselves felt. As Russia undertook to subjugate by armed force not only Finland but also the Baltic States she suddenly motivated this action by the assertion, as ridiculous as it was false, that she must protect these countries from an outside menace or forestall it.<br><br>This could only be meant to apply to Germany, for no other power could even gain entrance into the Baltic area, let alone go to war there. Still I had to be silent. However, those in power in the Kremlin immediately went further.<br><br>Whereas in the Spring of 1940 Germany, in accordance with the so-called pact of friendship, withdrew her forces from the Far Eastern frontier and, in fact, for the most part cleared these areas entirely of German troops, a concentration of Russian forces at that time was already beginning in a measure which could only be regarded as a deliberate threat to Germany.<br><br>According to a statement that Molotov [Soviet Foreign Minister and then Premier Vyachesiaff Molotov] personally made at that time, there were twenty-two Russian divisions in the Baltic States alone already in the Spring of 1940.<br><br>Since the Russian Government itself always claimed it was called in by the local population, the purpose of their presence there could only be a demonstration against Germany.<br><br>While our soldiers from May 5, 1940, on had been breaking Franco British power in the west, Russian military deployment on our eastern frontier was being continued to a more and more menacing extent.<br><br>From August, 1940, on I therefore considered it to be in the interest of the Reich no longer to permit our eastern provinces, which moreover had already been laid waste so often, to remain unprotected in the face of this tremendous concentration of Bolshevist divisions.<br><br>Thus there resulted British-Soviet Russian cooperation intended mainly at the tying up of such powerful forces in the east that radical conclusion of the war in the west, particularly as regards aircraft, could no longer be vouched for by the German High Command.<br><br>This, however, was in line with the objects not only of the British but also of the Soviet Russian policy, for both England and Soviet Russia intend to let this war go on for as long as possible in order to weaken all Europe and render it progressively more impotent.<br><br>Russia's threatened attack on Rumania was in the last analysis equally intended to gain possession of an important base, not only of Germany's but also of Europe's economic life, or at least destroy it. The Reich, especially since 1933, sought with unending patience to gain States in Southeast Europe as trading partners. We therefore also had the greatest interest in their internal constitutional consolidation and organization. Russia's advance into Rumania and Greece's tie-up with England threatened to turn these regions, too, within a short time into a general theatre of war.<br><br>Contrary to our principles and customs, and at the urgent request of the then Rumanian Government, which was itself responsible for this development, I advised acquiescence to the Soviet Russian demands for the sake of peace and the cession of Bessarabia.<br><br>The Rumanian Government believed, however, that it could answer for this before its own people only if Germany and Italy in compensation would at least guarantee the integrity of what still remained of Rumania.<br><br>I did so with heavy heart, principally because when the German Reich gives a guarantee that means it also abides by it. We are neither Englishmen nor Jews.<br><br>I still believe at this late hour to have served the cause of peace in that region, albeit by assuming serious personal obligation. In order, however, finally to solve these problems and achieve clarity concerning the Russian attitude toward Germany, as well as under pressure of continually increasing mobilization on our Eastern frontier, I invited Mr. Molotov to come to Berlin.<br><br>The Soviet Minister for Foreign Affairs then demanded Germany's clarification of an agreement to the following four questions:<br><br>Point One was Molotov's question: Was the German guarantee for Rumania also directed against Soviet Russia in case of attack by Soviet Russia on Rumania?<br><br>My answer: The German guarantee is a general one and is unconditionally binding upon us. Russia, however, never declared to us that she had other interests in Rumania beyond Bessarabia. The occupation of Northern Bukovina had already been a violation of this assurance. I did not therefore think that Russia could now suddenly have more far-reaching intentions against Rumania.<br><br>Molotov's second question: That Russia again felt menaced by Finland. Russia was determined not to tolerate this. Was Germany ready not to give any aid to Finland and above all immediately to withdraw German relief troops marching through to Kirkenes?<br><br>My answer: Germany continued to have absolutely no political interests in Finland. A fresh war by Russia against the small Finnish people could not, however, be regarded any longer by the German Government as tolerable, all the more so as we could never believe Russia to be threatened by Finland. Under no circumstances did we want another theatre of war to arise in the Baltic.<br><br>Molotov's third question: Was Germany prepared to agree that Russia give a guarantee to Bulgaria and send Soviet Russian troops to Bulgaria for this purpose in connection with which he-Molotov-was prepared to state that the Soviets did not intend on that account, for example, to depose the King?<br><br>My answer: Bulgaria was a sovereign State and I had no knowledge that Bulgaria had ever asked Soviet Russia for any kind of guarantee such as Rumania had requested from Germany. Moreover, I would have to discuss the matter with my allies.<br><br>Molotov's fourth question: Soviet Russia required free passage through the Dardenelles under all circumstances and for her protection also demanded occupation of a number of important bases on the Dardenelles and Bosphorus. Was Germany in agreement with this or not?<br><br>My answer: Germany was prepared at all times to agree to alteration of the Statute of Montreux in favor of the Black Sea States. Germany was not prepared to agree to Russia's taking possession of bases on the Straits.<br><br>National Socialists! Here I adopted the only attitude that I could adopt as the responsible leader of the German Reich but also as the representative of European culture and civilization and conscious of my responsibility.<br><br>The consequence was to increase in Soviet Russia the activity directed against the Reich, above all, however, the immediate commencement of undermining the new Rumanian State from within and an attempt to remove the Bulgarian Government by propaganda.<br><br>With the help of the confused and immature leaders of the Rumanian Legion (Iron Guard) a coup d'etat was staged in Rumania whose aim was to overthrow Chief of State General Antonescu and produce chaos in the country so as to remove all legal power of the government and thus the precondition for an implement of the German guarantee.<br><br>I nevertheless still believed it best to remain silent.<br><br>Immediately after the failure of this undertaking, renewed reinforcement of concentrations of Russian troops on Germany's eastern frontier took place. Panzer detachments and parachutists were transferred in continually increasing numbers to dangerous proximity to the German frontier. German fighting forces and the German nation know that until a few weeks ago not a single tank or mechanized division was stationed on our eastern frontier.<br><br>If any final proof was required for the coalition meanwhile formed between England and Soviet Russia despite all diversion and camouflage, the Yugoslav conflict provided it.<br><br>While I made every effort to undertake a final attempt to pacify the Balkans and in sympathetic cooperation with Il Duce invited Yugoslavia to join the Tripartite Pact, England and Soviet Russia in a joint conspiracy organized that coup d'etat which in one night removed the then government which had been ready to come to agreement.<br><br>For we can today inform the German nation that the Serb Putsch against Germany did not take place merely under the British, but primarily under Soviet Russian auspices. As we remained silent on this matter also, the Soviet leaders now went still one step further. They not only organized the Putsch, but a few days later also concluded that well-known friendship pact with the Serbs in their will to resist pacification of the Balkans and incite them against Germany.<br><br>And this was no platonic intention: Moscow demanded mobilization of the Serb Army.<br><br>Since even now I still believe it better not to speak, those in power in the Kremlin went still further: The Government of the German Reich today possesses documentary evidence which proves that Russia, in order finally to bring Serbia into the war, gave her a promise to supply her via Salonika with arms, aircraft, munitions and other war materials against Germany.<br><br>And this happened almost at the very moment when I myself advised Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka that eased tension with Russia always was in hope, thereby to serve the cause of peace.<br><br>Only the rapid advance of our incomparable divisions to Skoplie as well as the capture of Salonika itself frustrated the aims of this Soviet Russian-Anglo-Saxon plot. Officers of the Serb air force, however, fled to Russia and were there immediately received as allies.<br><br>The victory of the Axis Powers in the Balkans in the first instance thwarted the plan to involve Germany this Summer in months-long battles in Southeastern Europe while meantime steadily completing the alignment of Soviet Russian armies and increasing their readiness for war in order, finally, together with England and supported by American supplies anticipated, to crush the German Reich and Italy.<br><br>Thus Moscow not only broke but miserably betrayed the stipulations of our friendly agreement. All this was done while the rulers in the Kremlin, exactly as in the case of Finland and Rumania, up to the last moment pretended peace and friendship and drew up an ostensibly innocent dÃˆmenti.<br><br>Although until now I was forced by circumstances to keep silent again and again, the moment has now come when to continue as a mere observer would not only be a sin of omission but a crime against the German people-yes, even against the whole of Europe.<br><br>Today something like 160 Russian divisions are standing at our frontiers. For weeks constant violations of this frontier have taken place, not only affecting us but from the far north down to Rumania.<br><br>Russian airmen consider it sport nonchalantly to overlook these frontiers, presumably to prove to us that they already feel themselves masters of these territories.<br><br>During the night of June 17 to June 18 Russian patrols again penetrated into the Reich's territory and could only be driven back after prolonged firing. This has brought us to the hour when it is necessary for us to take steps against this plot devised by the Jewish Anglo-Saxon warmongers and equally the Jewish rulers of the Bolshevist center in Moscow.<br><br>German people! At this moment a march is taking place that, as regards extent, compares with the greatest the world hitherto has seen. United with their Finnish comrades, the fighters of the victory of Narvik are standing in the Northern Arctic. German divisions commanded by the conqueror of Norway, in cooperation with the heroes of Finnish freedom, under their marshal, are protecting Finnish soil.<br><br>Formations of the German Eastern Front extend from East Prussia to the Carpathians. German and Rumanian soldiers are united under Chief of State Antonescu from the banks of the Pruth along the lower reaches of the Danube to the shores of the Black Sea. The task of this front, therefore, no longer is the protection of single countries, but the safeguarding of Europe and thereby the salvation of all.<br><br>I therefore decided today again to lay the fate and future of the German Reich and our people in the hands of our soldiers.<br><br>May God help us especially in this fight!</div>
