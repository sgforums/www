Yes, I say he can sing but not that outstanding like you say compare to Jacky or Andy but in what class is he in to tell Singapore off? He is neither here or there, Borned in Malaysia, he got his PR here and yet living in Taiwan?  Again, it show no committment.  He raised to flame through Singapore Xin Yao but he now " cut the bridge " ..    Did you know that he wrote " Tai Sha " for a Malaysian's singer and just before she release her album, he released the same song ?  Where is his intregity ?  So in what capacity does he has to come and " teach " us Singaporean?  He should be learning a few etiquettes  before shooting his mouth off !!!  I was his fan and I was very dissappointed with him ...   there are many of his story, what he and his ex, ( the TCS actress ) do ...  they are not what we call a normal person will do ...</div>

The way he put it is like Singapore got nothing to do with his succes ( that's my feeling )..  this Moo Moo always get into trouble one ..  when he started in Taiwan, he also got ban there for a while ( can't remember the reason )..  then if I remembered correctly, the xin yao group also don't like him and stayed from him.  In one of those interview in Taiwan, he say he missed Singapore friend something like that la .,.. then hor chuan ke lian lor ....   </div></blockquote>OIC, is he married? How come Singapore made him famous and he come back and condemn singaporeans, we have our own culture mah, he must respect that, taiwan have alots of gangster you know, i think he running away from some gangster there. He looks like malay, so dark.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wat he stated dat singaporeans do not appreciate sg singers r true. many of us can agree dat.<br><br>but wat sickening to most of us is... we do not need an outsider from other country or a quitter to tell us dat. furthermore this ungrateful goner is tryin to get attention from media for his comeback. we r not going to forgive his outburst for wat he said in 24 oct 1994. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>since he claimed he is a malaysian, why did he using singapore as stepping stone afterall we cultivate this foreign talent? now dat he stay in taiwan as low profile singer why not he fuck back to his homeland instead of crawling back to sg shamelessly?</div>
