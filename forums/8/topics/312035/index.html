              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">Fidgets are a new indoor soft
              play area at Turf City. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #333333;">For parents eager to find something new to do with their kids,
              especially when it is raining, the indoor play area is bound to be popular.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;"> <strong>Unfortunately, the place seems to
              be unsafe for kids and what's even worse - the owner is careless and
              irresponsible.</strong><br> <br> On 18 March, 2008, at around 12:30pm, a 7-year-old child who was playing in the
              ball pit zone of Fidgets was hurt by a sharp cut in her inside right leg around
              the knee area. <strong>She sustained two wounds, one was 9cm long 4 -5mm
              deep, and the cut went through her skin down to her muscle; the second wound
              was beneath the first 5cmx4mm
              on the skins surface.</strong>  The gash was so deep; it was obvious that a
              sharp metal object must have caused the injury.<br> <br> A parent who was assisting the child requested for the first aid box.
              Surprising the first aid box lacked a, b, and c. <strong>When the parent asked the
              owner Sandy why the box was insufficiently stocked, the answer was there had
              been some accidents during their first week and they had yet to replenish it. </strong>The
              parent stated for a children's establishment surely ensuring the box was
              sufficiently stocked should be a primary requirement.<br> <br> After the wounded child was being sent to the Emergency Unit, the staff at
              Fidgets said they were unable to locate where the accident had occurred. A
              parent informed them that the child had indicated it was on the metal slide,
              which is part of the ball pit. <strong>The entire play area was still open at this
              time, as was the ball pit area.</strong> The incident occurred during the week which
              was the Easter break for some International schools; hence the cafe area was
              full with not a seat spare. But once the accident occurred the premises were
              almost empty. <strong>It was the parents themselves that were deterring the children
              from entering the ball pit area, and the staff had not cordoned off the
              section.</strong>  <br> <br> <strong>The parent who had administered first aid went down the metal slide to
              check, and noticed 4 exposed metal screws on the left hand side of the slide,
              each screw protruding approximately 4mm. 
              The padded area around the metal screws was covered in blood, which begs the
              question how the staff or the owner’s husband who had "inspected" the
              area were not able to notice this</strong>. The parent showed the screws and blood
              to the staff, they cleaned the blood from the area. The parent took some photos
              of the exposed metal screws. A number of parents came forward to the parent
              taking the pictures, and they stated they were happy to recount the events that
              had occurred and act as witnesses should any be required, details were
              exchanged. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;"><br> Another parent who witnessed the accident contacted her friend who was going to
              visit Fidgets with her children in the afternoon, and advised her against the
              visit. The mother who had planned the trip contacted Fidgets, she inquired as
              to whether they were still open as she had heard that an accident had occurred.
              <strong>The staff responded by stating that a child incurred a "graze",
              some netting had come loose which had been made "good", hence it was
              business as usual and all parts of the play area were open</strong>. <br> <br> <strong>An open wound of 9cm through
              the muscle was described as a "graze" - if this were the case why
              would the child have required surgery? Why would the majority of parents remove
              their children and leave the premises?</strong><br> <br> The mother of the wounded child has sent a message to Sandy the owner on the
              day of the accident. <strong>She urged Sandy the owner to take responsibility for
              the injury and make sure the safety for children in Fidgets. However, Sandy the
              owner hasn't responded a single word or taken any action.</strong></span></p>
