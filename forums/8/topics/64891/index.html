            <div class='col-md body'>1. A travel agent who doesn't give you free bags is a koo bye. That's why I always travel with Ken Brothers Reliable Air Travel. They sometimes give you more than one bag per person. Bags are an important measure of the quality of the agent.<br><br>2. Always choose a travel agent with the word "Brothers" in their name. Because their bags are always good quality one. You must have heard the song, It Ain't Heavy, It's My Brothers'.<br><br>3. Make sure your travel agent provides Chinese food throughout your trip, regardless of country. Especially in Europe. Bad enough you're in a chow ang-mor country, surely you shouldn't have to eat chow ang-mor food also.<br><br>4. Itinerary, itinerary, itinerary. More places, more value. How long does anybody need to stay and see a place? Five minutes is all you need to get a good idea of what most tourist "attractions" are about: they're old and last time got things happen there. See quickly, take photo and then hurry up go to a factory outlet or casino.<br><br>5. Your luggage should always have the following items: <strong>instant noodles</strong> (one packet for each day of your trip, vital in European itineraries); <strong>mah-jong set </strong>(especially if your itinerary does not include a casino stopover); <strong>handphone with auto-roaming </strong>(the phones on board the plane are all si beh expensive); <strong>rice cooker</strong> (you can also cook your instant noodles in it).<br><br>6. It is important to dress appropriately for travel. But comfort is not the only factor. We must show foreigners that we are not some obiang suah koo people. I recommend track shoes and a windcheater. These go well with anything: jeans, singlet business suit, safari suit, tuxedo, cheong sam. Good enough to wear in parliament, good enough to travel in.<br><br>7. Make sure your tour bus got karaoke set. It's especially useful when you have to travel through the night. Your tour-group will always appreciate a soothing song to put them to sleep.<br><br>8. Whenever you are tempted to buy souvenirs, look around. There might be pirates around selling cheap knock-offs which will do just as well for your friends.<br><br>9. Use travel as a time for personal reflection. It is important to compare everything you see with what you have at home in Singapore. When you do this, you will feel a lot better about yourself and your life. Don't forget to voice your comparisons aloud, especially to locals. If you find yourself at a loss for words, just use the basic phrase, "Singapore better one."<br><br>10. At the end of every flight or tour, don't forget to lodge a complaint about something with the travel agent or airlines. Don't shy. Small thing also can. Think hard enough, sure can find something one. But in your complaint, make sure you say that this was the trip of your dreams and that this thing ruined it forever, and now you must go Woodbridge. You never know, you might get some compensation or discount.<br><br>Happy travels!<br><br>from <a href="http://www.talkingcock.com" rel="nofollow">www.talkingcock.com</a></div>
