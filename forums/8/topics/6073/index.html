            <div class='col-md body'>hmm terence, try soc.culture.singapore on USENET. you'll need a newsreader or <a href="http://www.deja.com" rel="nofollow">www.deja.com</a>  which requires some registration thingy first. i'd say that it's got a pretty good mix of subjects...at any given time they're like 10000 or so new messages. the language and grammar is pretty ok, and they pretty much always discuss subjects of local controversy, ranging from political to technological to fluffy brainless spam. of course like any other forum, you get a suitable number of ego-masturbatory threads with lots of flaming and other shit going on. but with a suitable newsreader and thread filter, you can mark off the crap ones and choose to ignore any annoying troll of choice ... which unfortunately, is not a choice you're given in this forum. heh! &amp; yeah ..it's also useful to have a spamtrap in your email address if you leave one, to avoid getting spammed to death by some no-life individuals or bots on the group. pros &amp; cons i guess...tho i like how the messages you get are pretty fast to load cuz' they're all text &amp; binary attachments aren't allowed.  it's a really big plus...'specially if you're on a bad connection that frequently disconnects, like mine <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>can't help you there Terrence...but personally I prefer to be able to read whatever it is people have to say....even if it;s idiotic and moronic and inflamatory...It 's more real than going to a forum where the moderation is so heavy that only one or two things are allowed...<br><br>I guess it just depends on how square you want your discourse to be.<br><br>I, and i think many others, would much prefer the more natural, informal, and openness of this forum...<br><br>Besides that we can have fun here if we get too serious...as with any forum this one also has a life of it's own and goes thru different stages of inactivity, seriousness, and playfullness...and yes, idiocy....<br><br>i guess u can't really escape it....It's a lot better than reading from a forujm with rthreads which are just advertising and spam.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Terence,<br><br>I think what you are looking for is the USEnet newsgroup soc.culture.singapore.moderated. You can access this via any newsreader (ie Microsoft Outlook Express)<br><br>All the posts have to be approved by a moderator before they go up. Unfortunately, this means messages can take up to a week to appear on the newsgroup. soc.culture.singapore (not moderated) is a free for all SOMEWHAT like this forum but much more active.<br><br>This forum exercises slight moderation through the deletion/closing of offensive topics.<br><br>Perhaps why u are looking for 'some serious and more intellectual forums on Singapore politics and social behaviour' is because this is a 'Chit Chat' forum and so people are here to do just that.<br><br>Maybe you can try the other forums on this site? Like the Speaker's Corner.<br><br>Hope it helps.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm....how abt trying the link below? it isn't really what you wanted cos it doesn't pertain to s'pore or the region (looks american in flavour actually) but some of the discussions in the forum (esp. those under "great debates") may be of some interest to you. i haven't really read many of the posts but the last time i was there some of the topics were rather interesting. so u may want to check them out.<br><br>actually this web-site is the same one bangster pointed out to us in his enlightening post from the previous century, "why do pigeons bob their heads".<br><br>hope i won't be accused of taking terence away from you guys. haha!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><a href="http://www.straightdope.com/cgi-bin/ubbcgi/Ultimate.cgi" rel="nofollow">http://www.straightdope.com/cgi-bin/ubbcgi/Ultimate.cgi</a></div>
