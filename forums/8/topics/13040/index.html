            <div class='col-md body'>I think you all totally miss the point. The point is not whether you should choose RI or DHS. It is not how you should choose. The point is that the system is flawed because it requires you to make a choice which will in turn be judged by your future results! You are making a choice based on the unknown! That is not fair at all. It's equivalent to you buying a toto ticket and immediately go and place a deposit for a condo because you "think" that it will strike. Similarly, ppl are making choices because they "think" they will get certain marks in the PSLE.<br><br>I am not saying that I will perform better at RI. I am not saying that the O' levels will be easier at RI. What I am saying is that if I had been allowed to choose AFTER the exam, I would have been able to make a more informed choice.<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Seifer (edited 04 January 2002).]</div>

An extra information gained is an extra factor in ur decision. In this case, the extra information also happens to be the most deciding factor in the allocation. While it's true that you can base ur selection on ur pre-lims, you should know that the pre-lims is only confined to ur own school. The PSLE will give u a better idea of where u stand among ur cohorts.<br><br>There is no ground at all. Selecting before the result has absolutely NO benefit at all over the selcting after argument. The only reason why the MOE is not implementing it is because of a typical inflexible and resistance to change mentality found in all government sectors!<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>

But then again...the chilod should be admitted to a school that they or the parent think would be most suitable for them rite...and i'm sure that the parents will know the standing of their children. Example..if the child is just getting a constant C or B grading throughout his primary school ..it wouldn't make any sense to try to put RI as first choice rite...maybe there are some that really heng heng get very good results in PSLE..but then he will suffer in the schools since that he is just a average student constantly .<br>Think of it in another point..if a student is really that good...meaning scoring high grades in every year...maybe the parents can expect him to be admitted into a better school loe...but going to a secondary school of a lower 'grade' does not really mean that you will do worse in the 'O' levels mah..it really have to depend on the student themselves to study. No doubt that goin to RI and other good schools do have their advantages..but together with that..they have their own added stress and pressure..and there are some people that may not be able to take it and hence..actually doing worse then what they would do in a more average school..though highly unlikely..but there may have people like that..<br>Hence...being to choose a school before the PSLE results are out is just a way to ensure that the student is really choosing a school that is based on what he and his parents feels his standard is and not just on one examination alone...and there are others that would like to choose after they have been given their results..kind of like a confirmation 'go' but given our inflexible education system..maybe we will just have to live with that.....<br>Just my of view...hope that its not out of the topic.. :p<br></div>

As you will all by now, the government is looking into the system. But seriously, if you really STUDY the system carefulyy instead of grumbling non stop rhetorically and think b4 speaking, maybe you will see it too.<br><br>I am quite sure many of you are still ignorant of how the process goes. If you are a tat bit interested, go check out the straits times, if no money to buy, you can go see the online version, i wouldn't bother to show you cos i guessyou are smart enough to find it yourself.<br><br>Consider the former, or should i say the system that is in place. WIth 6 choices and selection based on merit, then to individual choices. How biased can such a selection scheme be?<br><br>I doubt there will be a significant difference in the selection done by parents and students alike even if we use the proposed system. Please study the current system before jumping to conclusions. I don't need people jumping at my throat everytime.<br><br>Anyway, this issue aroused due top a drop in cutoff pt for entry to rgs, abot a 15 pt drop which is pretty drastic compared to other schools, where the normal variance would be 5pt. Parents feel 'cheated'. Hence they bring this up to the ministry. It would seem that the ministry looked into the problem in order to appease these parents.<br><br>Now i put it to you that the current system is in no way flawed. If it is, it is to the direct basis of academic results for selection. But it does not affect pupils/parents alike in making an 'informed' choice.<br><br>------------------<br><strong>I cOnSiDeR MySeLf aN ExPeRt tOmAtO gArDeNeR sInCe aLL oF mY FrIeNdS TeLL mE I hAvE tHe mOsT CoLoUrFuL aNd sWeEtEsT tOmAtOeS.</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Life is too short to bother with tasteless tomatoes."<br></span></div>

I can give you a million choices, but if you are not going to base your selections on the actual result, what good will it do? You are afterall, just taking a stab in the dark.<br><br>As for argument on the fact that the child and parents should know better because of pre-lims etc. Then I put forward to you to scrap the PSLE totally. Just use the average result from Pri 1-6 to decide. Afterall, they are more accurate than a "flash in the pan" PSLE result right?<br><br>Okay, maybe the current system is not flawed as you would like to believe. But the fact remains that a much superior system has been proposed and the reasons for rejecting the system just doesn't cut it.<br><br>"Looking into the proposal"? Hah, only someone like you will believe they will actually look into it. Will they change?
