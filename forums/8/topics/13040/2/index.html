He thinks he's good enough, so put down all the top schools as his choices. In the end, PSLE only got 250 =&gt; failed to make it to ALL his choices. So what will happen? Chances are, he will be ding-dong-ing along and end up in a neighbour school near his house. If he had been allowed to select after knowing his 250 score, he can make a better choice by omitting all the top schools and going for maybe an above average one like Anderson Sec.<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Seifer (edited 10 January 2002).]</div>
