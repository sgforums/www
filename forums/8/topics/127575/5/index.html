As if a casino will kill many families in SG. It's just  a casino and it's only a part of an integrated resort. You know what a resort is? It means more fun places for families and friends to hang out during the weekend.<br><br>and you complained Singapore is boring... sometimes I wonder why the govt even bother to please people like you-the unsatisfiable<br><br>Wait let me guess... a resort will lead to more children landing in hosipital for being too careless while having too much fun and children being kidnapped by gangsters and forced to protitution...like that better not have resort.ya maybe a casino will really ruin us...let us just go back to the boring days where catching spiders and playing marbles are the best times of our lives.<br></div>

U think everyone like u so free ar? everything also must vote. next time want to increase cigarette price also want to vote? democracy is voting a govt to take charge of our country and that's what they are doing now. A casino is neccessary for the growth of Singapore. why dun u guys see it? the stability of a nation is more important than an individual. Would u want your whole family to be rich as a whole or just you are rich while the rest of your family work like dogs.</div>

This kind of thing not like announcing to a kid whether you are bringing them to the zoo or not leh.<br><br>Yes everyone have a voice but how the hell u manage to listen to 4 million voices? you think PAP God ar? And would you want a not so educated(not trying to look down but it's life) who base their theory on street experience to run the country?Aim to please everyone and you will fail. Simple theory also don't get it. Ain;t the Govt good enougha already? 5 days work week? NSS, ERS? What else u expect? $1000000 for every Singaporean? Don't blame the govt if your life ain't as successful as others.<br><br>Anyway results shows. Singapore is the 3rd richest country in Asia and no one has to go hungry or denied medical help becuase of a good goverment. Unfortunately there will always be some people who can never be pleased because of their selfish desires which has not being met by the government.</div>
