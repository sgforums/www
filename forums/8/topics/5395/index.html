I've been 16, and all I can say is, regardless who, all guys at the age of 16 are total morons, yes I was one myself, I look back and laugh, and no, nobody escapes this fact, we're all morons back then, even 16 year olds now or in the 80s, all morons mmkay! tee hee hee, dunno why I bashing away also, mabye it's because I'm now upgraded to an asshole? hahahaha, werd.<br><br>Gee, really, I think khakis or fitting jeans are just about the simplest choices for clothes for guys, of course u better make sure you FIT into your fitting jeans, the more muscles and butt that show, whoah the better, so jealous of guys whom are capable of that, better eat more and exercise more just so can be like them, noler, not gay, just that, all the girls tell me whoah, look at his butt, then i go *sigh*, hahaha, get it?<br><br>to ataraxia: eiAH? 15 only? so young! but mind so active! you know, I know we know nothing about you, but it's just a feeling that you're a girl who doesnt try a lot of things, you're a girl who's very conscious of your every descision, you're a girl who isn't the bubbly fun fun happy happy cheecky type...you might just feel lonely sometimes, etc, and all that is going to come back and slap you right in the face someday... tee hee hee, nola, all this general psychology, pbeh :p , but I wonder if it holds true.<br><br>you know, you're so lucky to be a girl, i mean, at least u have guys fancy'ing you or something like that, and guys approaching you etc, which makes it all much much easier, us guys, so sad, if carry a viewpoint like yours, we'll never get to know a girl whom fits our requirements, always viewed as scary, weird, silent. it's very hard to get a girl :p, basicly actually, it's just that we always focus on all posibilities and all the possibilities some people just cannot accept and then they're scared of you, cause u make them worried etc etc, make them think, yeah, basicly I'm surrounded by whateveryoucallthem people. so it's very hard to get around when you don't speak at the same frequencies, a lot of girls i know just don't want to hear what I have to say, because they really feel useless/dumb/silly after i have opinioned or something cause they dont know what to say etc, all they wanna hear is all that sweet talk, well not so much of it, or stories etc, actually yeah, kinda figured it out, but somewhere in my head I'm still telling myself I'd rather settle for someone who talks at the same frequency as me, but that just wont happen would it, wahHHh I'm crapping too much, saying things that make no sense! hahahahahaha! woooooo! shit man, too much stress I think :p</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Greymoon,<br><br>I msu say that my analysis of Atarxia is acyually the total opposite.  I haven't had any private exchanges with her or met her before, but I kind of figure alreayd that she wasn't the Suaku type.  Which was why I asked if she wanted to come tom Wong San's with me...Obviously I wouldn't ask someone who never been to those kind of places to follow me...What with all the drinking, and phisical body movements,.....it would give people like Musicwhiz a good stroke....ha ha...hope ur reading this Whiz...just having fun at ur expense...:-)  Hope u don't mind too much.<br><br>Yeah, anyway, like I was saying, I think she's crazy but in a logical way....Like she knows she's being crazy and doing really weird stuff, but she understands what's happening you know.... and I always envisioned her as the type that's really fun to be around...quite bubbly...that's just my own assumption...<br><br>hmm, what else?  i thinkt that she's not overly tall, quite short i would guess.  I hope I'm right about the phiscal thing here Ataraxia....Don't worry, I'm just using u as a springboard to sshowcase my highly analytically pschic mind.....:-)<br><br>Hmm, some of ur friends(girls ) must be a bit geeky also right?  hmmmm?....not all, but alot....<br><br>I won't analyze ur going home by 8 when ur parents say so, because that doesn't really prove anything...I used to go home almost all the time when my parents told me to...not that I'm a mamma's boy or anything...ha ha...but I thinkt hat u won't break rules just for the reason of breaking them....must be a good reason right????<br><br>Damn!!!!I'm good!!!:-)  proabbly the most talkative or animated of ur friends right?  or if not, u always got the most insightful thing to say...<br><br>Ur usual hangout:  Lido/Orchard cineplex? Wisma? Coffee bean? East Coast?....I can't really picture u as the Far East type....<br><br>Possibly a Borders type....yeah....!!!!:-)<br><br>Am I right so far Ataraxia....<br>man u must be really freaking out right now....That's because I'm standing above ur window!!!bwahhahaahahah....all 7 floors up!!!!bwasahahaha....Sorry, just felt like being crazy....<br><br>hope U can confirm my assumption of u.<br><br>Oh, yeah....as for ur looks....must be shoulder length hair right?  Sometimes tie up in one ponytail right?<br><br>Average/sweet approachable look...something like a girl next door face right?  but with a hint of animal in it.....<br><br>That's why i said somewhere that u must be living large by the amount of guys trying to mob you....ha ha...I kneww u liked it....who wouldn't.  I know I would. :-)<br><br>and given a chance, u'll more than be happy to try out pubbing or disco...if u haven't already....maybe just as an experiment, but I would have to say that it wouldn't be something that u would indulge in on a regualr basis.  Curiosity sake.<br><br>Ok, Ataraxia, I'm finfished...How did I do...?<br><br>[This message has been edited by firewire (edited 13 November 1999).]</div>

Probably she will find it adventurous, after firewire done a CLEAR and almost correct analysis of her.<br><br>How many do you think will turn up on the 20th? That is interesting....but can't join you guys anything early than 9 coz I'm working! Unless you guys pick a place really near to funan, then I will be there fast....<br><br>firewire:<br>are you guys going pubbing later on? If so, then I can ask a friend or 2 along.

I was just wondering if we were REALLY alike, so would it be "I GUESS NOT?" then opposites attract? haha! :p<br><br>ataraxie:<br>ok, no one can figure me out too, so it's nothing special, well, could be because you're a girl, and anything you do would be considered crazy to your gfs, I mean, when it comes to a guy like me, my friends jumps off every cliff before I do, only because I take my time, so when I do, they're like, "Eh? greygoon smoke grass? wah! kua jai smoke grass!" (not that i do, just example) I never say no to any challenges, but I like to take my time, see people do it first, well, being a guy, it's not hard to have a lot of crazy friends already. So I guess I have never considered to analyze you from a girls viewpoint, whoops.<br><br>15? young lo, not that it matters when it comes to maturity, mindset etc, I believe you quite a level of those qualities, but still, experience, how to say, build over time, and wise people are built out of experience, and no matter how mature or smart you are, you cant be wise enough. so how also i still wiser than you la, *brag* *brag* :p<br><br>you walk a lot, does that mean you aint no fat fat chubby baby fats girl?<br><br>Whart is DAO??? rich taitai?? OH NO! my most dreaded err...whatever<br><br>waterstring:<br>It is? it's actually a cheap analysis of myself just to see if we're the same kind of people, does that mean we're opposite?

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess that due to the overhyped up event on 20 Nov, I probably won't be going.

It's just a little risky for a young girl meeting so many older and more "experienced" guys.
