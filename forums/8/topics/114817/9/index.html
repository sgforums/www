I don't see why people have to 'campaign' against it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>nothing better to do?<br><br><blockquote><br><strong> If you join</strong>, you tend to overshoot the time spent on your computer making 'friends' online instead of real life, making you a complete no lifer<br></blockquote>this is more of a personal choice.  if a person fits the profile of an internet addict. It doesn't matter if P-member or not. Seriously. if you surf &gt; 4 hours a day. Even if you don't sign up P member ( like many regulars here), you are still a 'no lifer' .<br><br><blockquote><br><strong> Certain policies</strong> of the forum makes anonymous users the best. For example, if you were to join P membership, you would have to use credit card or something, and one of the rule of the forum states that: " Details of members will be released to authorities if needed upon investigation of abuses "; Because of the ambiguity of this statement, with no clear definition of what is meant by abuses, personal information could easily be tapped by the network and thus being detrimental to free speech. Anonymous members, however, because of no credit cards involved whatsoever, are not affected by this disturbing forum rule.<br></blockquote>This one I tend to agree. But anonymity to what extend? If you are accessing internet from singapore. Your IP is tagged to which block and unit you stay. so what anonymity u r talking about?  The ISP keeps logs of you anyway. If you happen to do anything illegal (enough for the government to come after you), u will still get caught.  If you are referring to anonymity that is abused by many who just register 'cool' names to spew their crap. Which would you prefer?<br><br>One good example, I don't see trolls in microsoft technet forums.<br><br><blockquote><br><strong> Unprofessionalism of the moderator</strong>: I do not have a personal vendetta myself but the way the moderator portrays herself or himself in which i have no due concern with, is arguably unprofessional. And <strong>excessive use of the ban button </strong>and also the incessant threatenings of banning makes this forum sound downright childish.<br></blockquote>since you are new, how do you know of the 'excessive' bannings? And did you question to what extend consitute bans?<br><br>There are many moderators here. and you only refer to 'one'. aren't you over generalising?<br><br><blockquote><br><strong> Lifeless people</strong> who build up their 'reputation' online by sucking-up and stuffs. Read a few threads and you can easily spot some.<br></blockquote>this is just a matter of perception. what is the value of 'reputation' in forums? apparently, even if someone with 10k posts are still being shot down. and you get jokers around who are taking on the admin's as well. so what's the value of 'reputation'?<br><br>I think you perceive that everyone who posts 'friendly' msgs to mod/admins are sucking up to them.<br><br><blockquote><br><strong> Disturbing Users</strong>: some people here are really complete trolls like Donal Trump and SBSK who post retarded replies and issues and thus this forum shouldn't be worth money to join.[/b][/b]</blockquote>going to the definition of 'trolls' (from webopedia.com)<br><span style="font-style: italic;">v.)

Looking 4 trouble may not be just one possibility. It has a multitude of possibilities. Try thinking in this direction. It is not Otingocni but sounds like her. It is not SibeySuayKia but acts like him. It is not XYZ but possesses a trait in XYZ. This is the hybrid, an unknown. He or she has traits found in each possibility. He or she may be a different entity. He or she may be a combined factor within one unique shell. And how are you going to find out who he or she is?

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Internet forum</span></strong></span><br><br>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum</a><br><br>An Internet forum, also known as a message board or discussion board, is a web application that provides for online discussions, and is the modern descendant of the bulletin board systems and existing Usenet news systems that were widespread in the 1980s and 1990s. An Internet forum typically exists as part of a website and invites users to start topics and discuss issues with one another. Sometimes, a forum even comprises most, if not all, of the content of a site. Compared to wikis, Internet forums don't allow users to edit the forum posts of other users; however, administrators and moderators generally have the capability of doing this.<br><br>Internet forums differ from weblogs. The former generally allow most users to post topics (sometimes referred to as "threads"), while blogs only allow one or a few users to create entries. Forums also tend to be more diversified in interest, while blogs tend to be more specific to a certain topic or subset of beliefs.<br><br><span class="large"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Features</span></strong></span><br><br>Typically, common Internet forum software will allow the webmaster or administrator to define several forums (or fora) which act as containers for topics or threads started by users. Other users can post replies to topics and start new ones as they wish.<br><br>Internet forums are divided between those requiring registration and those allowing users to post anonymously. In the former, users choose a username and password, and may be required to submit an e-mail address for confirmation. Members are often allowed to customize their board experience with special items such as avatars and profiles. Anonymous forums may enforce full anonymity or allow for pseudonymity without registration, using tripcodes derived by encrypting unique strings as identifiers.<br><br>Certain users may be given moderator privileges, which may include the ability to delete posts and topics, move topics to other forums, edit posts, or other mechanisms designed to keep the peace and uphold the rules set out by the webmaster. Who exactly will become a moderator is decided by the webmaster or by some kind of pseudorandom process possibly combined with meta-moderation. Many different moderation systems exist and webmasters are free to choose rules for their own forums.<br><br>A forum can be flat, meaning that each reply within a certain topic is listed in chronological order; or threaded, where each post descends from a parent post. Sites often provide several different views which combine aspects of both flat and threaded modes.<br><br>Many Internet forum software packages are available, usually written in PHP, Perl, or Java, and run by a CGI or Java Servlet. Data and configuration are usually stored in an SQL database (such as MySQL) or a series of text files. Each provides different features: the most basic restricting users to text-only posting, the most advanced allowing users to insert multimedia elements and formatting in to their posts using HTML or BBCode. Packages are often integrated within weblogs or news posting scripts (such as PHP-Nuke) to allow people to post comments on articles or entries.<br><br><span class="large"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other Notes</span></strong></span><br><br>It is interesting that many Internet forums tend to develop into social communities, with their own social rules and even language forming a subculture. Some members organize social events, sometimes involving extensive international travel. It is not uncommon for members to marry people (sometimes from different countries) they have met on the forum.<br><br>Despite being an Internet tool, one thus popularly supposed to be part of the trends of anti-literacy, Internet forums generate a huge amount of writing in posts. In sharp contrast to other Internet technologies such as instant messaging, many forum users often abide by correct spelling, grammar, and other rules of writing. The sheer amount of composition in such forums is sometimes thought to have exceeded the number of standard letters written.<br><br>However, it's also typical to see Internet forum communities use Internet slang so extensively that a newbie may find it difficult or impossible to interpret their meaning.</div>
