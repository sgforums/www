            <div class='col-md body'>Alamak... isn't all this part of survival. In some places of the world, ants are food and the tendency is that there is less food around and hence it becomes food for the man living in those region.<br><br>In cities and many other areas, there is abundance of food. Ants is more of a pest which can threaten and destroy our food. Hence they are dislike by many man. While the instinct for survival has made man largely what we are, there is still this emotion of compassion that can contradict this instinct for survival. I sometimes wonder if this is a safeguard build into man to prevent him from over destroying.<br><br>I believe that it is possible for some very very few man to actually rather die than to kill other living things and believe that there is a greater purpose in life than merely just to survive.<br><br>Because of this compassion in us which can vary greatly from one to another, most of us have a threshold or set of unclear and possibly ever changing limits as to what I should eat or not eat. I refer to eat because it is how most of us are indirectly responsible for the death for other living creatures. It is changing because it is situational.<br><br>So to the poster, I don't think u will ever get a clear cut answer because life is built not to be clear but to differ.<br><br>cheers<br>apples</div>
