If animals can speak, none of them would want to end up in the plate. If you care about animals at all, stop eating all meat. To draw an aritificial and culturally based line between pet animals and edible animals and shouting at people who do do the same classification is just damn arrogant and hypocritical.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kewty:</div><div class="quote_body"> coz they believe dogs r men best friends n dog r cute ma... n dogs r more of a pet than food</div></blockquote></div>
