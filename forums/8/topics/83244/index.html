            <div class='col-md body'>1.  Men like to barbecue.  Men will cook if danger is involved.<br>2.  Men who have pierced ears are better prepared for marriage.<br>They've experienced pain and bought jewelry.<br>3.  If you buy your husband or boyfriend a video camera, for the first<br>few weeks he has it, lock the door when you go to the bathroom.  Most<br>of my husband's early films end with a scream and a flush.<br>4.  Be careful of men who are bald and rich; the arrogance of "rich"<br>usually cancels out the nice of "bald."<br>5.  Marrying a divorced man is ecologically responsible.  In a world<br>where there are more women than men, it pays to recycle.<br>6.  Men are very confident people.  My husband is so confident that when<br>he watches sports on television, he thinks that if he concentrates he<br>can help his team.  If the team is in trouble, he coaches the players<br>from our living room, and if they're really in trouble, I have to get<br>off the phone in case they call him.<br>7.  If it's attention you want, don't get involved with a man during<br>play-off season.<br>8.  Men like phones with lots of buttons.  It makes them feel important.<br>9.  Men love to be the first to read the newspaper in the morning.  Not<br>being the first is upsetting to their psyches.<br>10.  All men look nerdy in black socks and sandals.<br>11.  The way a man looks at himself in a mirror will tell you if he can<br>ever care about anyone else.<br>12.  Don't try to teach men how to do anything in public.  They can learn<br>in private; in public they have to know.<br>13.  Men who are going bald often wear baseball caps.<br>14.  All men are afraid of eyelash curlers.  I sleep with one under my<br>pillow, instead of a gun.<br>15.  A good place to meet a man is at the dry cleaner.  These men usually<br>have jobs and bathe.<br>16.  Men love watches with multiple functions.  My husband has one that is<br>a combination address book, telescope and piano.<br>17.  All men hate to hear "We need to talk about our relationship."  These<br>seven words strike fear in the heart of even General Schwarzkopf.<br>18.  Men are sensitive in strange ways.  If a man has built a fire and the<br>last log does not burn, he will take it personally.<br>19.  Men are brave enough to go to war, but they are not brave enough to<br>get a bikini wax.<br>20.  All men think that they're nice guys.  Some of them are not.  Contact<br>me for a list of names.<br>21.  Men don't get cellulite.  God might just be a man.<br>22.  Men have an easier time buying bathing suits.  Women have two types:<br>depressing and more depressing.  Men have two types: nerdy and not<br>nerdy.<br>23.  Men have higher body temperatures than women. If your heating goes out<br>in winter, I recommend sleeping next to a man. Men are like portable<br>heaters that snore.<br>24.  Women take clothing much more seriously than men.  I've never seen a<br>man walk into a party and say "Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed; get me<br>out of here.  There's another man wearing a black tuxedo."<br>25.  Most men hate to shop.  That's why the men's department is usually on<br>the first floor of a department store, two inches from the door.<br>26.  If a man prepares dinner for you and the salad contains three or more<br>types of lettuce, he is serious.<br>27.  If you're dating a man who you think might be "Mr. Right," if he a)<br>got older, b) got a new job, or c) visited a psychiatrist, you are in<br>for a nasty surprise.  The cocoon-to-butterfly theory only works on<br>cocoons and butterflies.<br>28.  Men own basketball teams.  Every year cheerleaders' outfits get tighter<br>and briefer, and players' shorts get baggier and longer.<br>29.  No man is charming all of the time.  Even Cary Grant is on record<br>saying he wished he could be Cary Grant.<br>30.  When four or more men get together, they talk about sports.<br>31.  When four or more women get together, they talk about men.<br>32.  Not one man in a beer commercial has a beer belly.<br>33.  Men are less sentimental than women.  No man has ever seen the movie<br>THE WAY WE WERE twice, voluntarily.<br>34.  Most women are introspective: "Am I in love?  Am I emotionally and<br>creatively fulfilled?"  Most men are outrospective: "Did my team win?<br>How's my car?"<br>35.  If a man says, "I'll call you," and he doesn't, he didn't forget...<br>he didn't lose your number... he didn't die. He just didn't want to<br>call you.<br>36.  Men hate to lose.  I once beat my husband at tennis.  I asked him,<br>"Are we going to have sex again?"  He said, "Yes, but not with each<br>other."<br>37.  Men who can eat anything they want and not gain weight should do it<br>out of sight of women.<br>38.  Getting rid of a man without hurting his masculinity is a problem.<br>"Get out" and "I never want to see you again" might sound like a<br>challenge. If you want to get rid of a man, I suggest saying, "I love<br>you... I want to marry you... I want to have your children." Sometimes<br>they leave skid marks.<br>39.  Men accept compliments much better than women do.  Example: "Mitch,<br>you look great."  Mitch:"Thanks."  On the other side:"Ruth, you look<br>great." Ruth: "I do?  Must be the lighting."<br>40.  Impulse buying is not macho.  Men rarely call the Home Shopping Network.<br>41.  Men who listen to classical music tend not to spit.<br>42.  Only men who have worn a ski suit understand how complicated it is for<br>a woman to go to the bathroom when she's wearing a jumpsuit.<br>43.  Men don't feel the urge to get married as quickly as women do because<br>their clothes all button and zip in the front.  Women's dresses usually<br>button and zip in the back. We need men emotionally and sexually, but<br>we also need men to help us get dressed.<br>44.  Men are self-confident because they grow up identifying with superheros.<br>Women have bad self-images because they grow up identifying with Barbie.<br>45.  When a woman tries on clothing from her closet that feels tight, she<br>will assume she has gained weight.  When a man tries something from<br>his closet that feels tight, he will assume the clothing has shrunk.<br>46.  Male menopause is a lot more fun than female menopause.  With female<br>menopause you gain weight and get hot flashes.  Male menopause - you get<br>to date young girls and drive motorcycles.<br>47.  Men forget everything; women remember everything.<br>48.  That's why men need instant replays in sports.  They've already forgotten<br>what happened.<br>49.  Men would like monogamy better if it sounded less like monotony.<br>50.  All men would still really like to own a train set.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
