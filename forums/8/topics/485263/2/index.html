              ntuc fairprice employ mainly retired police officers as security guards, plain clothes and they some times i cant help but feel they treat you as thief until you queue up pay then as customers but the whole feeling of enjoying fairprice shoppping has by no means destroyed by them, you be surprise cold storag has no such in-house security or not so many like fairprice and they very customer centric, wont even let you notice their presence distrub you as they are inside office watching cctv. 
              
              ntuc fairprice wanted to cut costs so never install sensor alarm at exit and sensor labels for all items so have to employ ex-police officers as their eyes to do prowling daily, they have at least 1 to 3 walking around daily at any time depends on the size of store, wearing plain clothes tuck in or out, wear sports shoes so can run faster catch thief mah, always holding one or 2 small items wthout holding basket or pushing trolley to act as customers mah, like going to end of a lane to look at you from afar for a while you can sense it la simply, sometimes walking near you act as if they are looking at some items with no basket or trolley with them and when you make your way to the shelf they standing at, they immediately move away scared you recognize them, their target is mainly young boys and girls, young man, guys wearing corporate wear, aunty and old people they dont care one la, maybe their performance indicator is how many theifs they can catch so they try to hard to prowl and follow you around loh and look at scan your body from head to toes, especially if you are not holding any basket or pushing trolley they target you once you walk in, means you are more likely a thief, but customers have basic human rights mah to buy even one item, govt wanted us to save costs thats why build fairprice from ntuc so like that means little items we must go 7 eleven or cheers(still under fairprice) to by and spend more meh, such contradiction by fairprice. reveal all to you now. so if you dont want kena targeted, even buy one item during your lunch take a basket or trolley loh, kar ki gang kor loh, heng yi nang song loh
