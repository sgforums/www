            <div class='col-md body'>Ko kid...most singapore women don't go around orchard braless...i should know...I'm there almost every other day...they wear strapless bras...If u dun believe me, juss look at their chest and see whether you can see their nipples...if you can see it and it looks damn big, then that means no bra...but if you only see a faint hint of it, then that means they are wearing bra...especially with spaghetti straps, the material is usually of a type where you can tell if they wear or not.<br><br>another way to tell is how it bounces or moves when she walks...if she's wearing, then it's usully quite firm and perky...the braless ones sag a bit and bounce around alot!<br><br>Now I'm not asking you to go and molest their bodies with your eyes, but this is juss my observation for you so that you dun go and try it yourself...you'll end up getting slapped.<br><br>Saw this really beautiful woman at Bugis Junction once wearing braless and a very transparent tight shirt....Everyone she passed by looked and stared...even the girls...She entered the jewelry store and the guys there couldn't believe what they saw...their jaws literally dropped...and I could hear the guy having trouble saying hello to her...:-)...but guess what?...she was Japanese....so would our local women be so bold...only a few.<br><br>and it's not such a big deal anyway....the other day an AngMoh lady came up to me to ask for directions(she's about 30)...then all of a sudden she starts to adjust her breast (not her bra as she wasn't wearing any)right in front of me and started rubbing it...funny...but obviously it didn't really bother her, but I still thought it was funny.<br><br>but yeah, take it easy KO kid...it really isn't that spectacular...personally I prefer to see bras...it's so much more suggestive and leave much more to the imagination...try thinking about that before you think about braless women again.</div>

Why is it even an issue? Are you one who is worried for sagging breasts?? We all know that wearing bras that are too tight can cause breast cancer, so maybe that's why this bra thing has got to stop. Yeah and HAVE YOU HEARD of this new innovation called the strapless?? Obviously not, and why the hell are you going ard looking at chests anyway? This is sooo innane, but i can't help but laugh... young kids these days must be damn bored or something, go study for your O Levels or something, and next time, think before posting something here...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All these talk about going braless, strapless, breasts and panties are going haywire. I mean, bras and panties are just another piece of clothing meant to be worn inside, just like guy's underwears. They want to wear or not it's none of our business, even though they might catch some attention (especially in Singapore), it's nothing really.<br><br>Going around noticing whether gals wear bras or not is really 'boh-liao'. Get a life man!</div>
