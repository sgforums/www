              turned into textiles - put my fingers into the scratches left in
              the gas chamber walls by the victims, and seen the ponds that are
              still grey with human ashes.</p>

              <p>I've been to the death camps, never felt anything. Dunno why everyone is so sensitive nowadays. Now still got people want to argue about something from decades ago.</p>

              <p>Think the argument is current affair.</p>
              <p>Why does young people, who thinks its okay to make fun of the history and the people that suffered?</p>
              <p>Does it means that its history, so its okay to make fun of it, ot make light of whats happening in the past?</p>
              <p>You probably felt nothing about death camps.  No chills, no shivers, not even goosebumps.</p>
              <p>So you are insensitive.</p>
              <p>And that gives you to wonder about why other people argued about history.</p>
              <p>Was it any of your business then, to be so 'sensitive' to other people arguing?</p>
              <p>I can imagine how you are okay with it, that Japanese textbooks has merely glazed over the 2nd world war, or simply suggested that their soldiers never tortured, or rape your ancestors.  OR your grandmothers was happy to be ermm.....providing their bodies to them soldiers to eventually produce you?</p>

              <p><br>History, no doubt is written by victors. But in our modern age of the internet,  you are often able to hear from both sides, it will be morality and the veracity of it, that determines your perceptions.</p>
              <p>The survivors and the liberators of the death camps, tell no lies. The records of the intrepid resistance fighters, whom kept records, hide nothing.</p>
              <p>The Nuremburg trial, of multiple witnessess, unmasked everything that went on under the huge gay flags of the swastikas....of horror on a terrible scale that never happened on Earth before, but only when in the hands of a twisted inhuman mind called Hitler.</p>
              <p>It's not a 'If' that happened. It was a recorded fact, not only in sworn statements, but on 35mm journalist film reels as well.</p>
              <p>Today, tragedys continue on, some reported, some not. But never forgottened, as survivors come forth to tell forth the ordeal they went and suffered through in time to come</p>
              <p>In our peaceful land called Singapore, we are indeed and truly pampared, but only because of and through the sheer hardwork and sacrifices of our forefathers,  it would be easy to write off or ignore such terrors while sipping cafe latte with our friends in starbucks, relinquishing the past as dead and forgottened history.</p>
              <p>However we are one common race on Planet Earth, our bio-sphere homeworld - the human race.</p>
              <p>What can happen to others, can happen to us. Thus we must always stand together, with our common fellow human beings,before nationalities and other differences that may place us apart, to never, ever, repeat history, by making the same mistakes made, for we all have an honour bound obligation to protect and leave a better world for our next generations, the way our forefathers in Singapore had left for you, me and us all a better Singapore, if not yet the best she could be without our help to each other and to our fellow humans of the world now.</p>
