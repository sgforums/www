              <p>i do not dispute your right to live your life like that... but please try not to say this to those whose lives are still affected by this evil..</p>
              <p>also try to take a peek out of your little hole you hide in.. you'll be surprised how fucked up your words are, and how you have just pissed on the bones of the innocents..</p>

              <p>No.</p>
              <p>I have friends whose parents lived through that period and who lost relatives to the concentration and extermination camps and in the fighting.</p>
              <p>I have been in cities that were looted of their treasures, liquidated and levelled, and built from scratch after the war.</p>
              <p>I have come face-to-face with the evidence - mountains of suitcases and belongings, sacks of hair shaved from victims to be turned into textiles - put my fingers into the scratches left in the gas chamber walls by the victims, and seen the ponds that are still grey with human ashes.</p>

              <p>Why do you think Vicki Zhao had poo thrown at her for wearing an Imperial Japanese flag? Or that Prince Harry was condemned for wearing a Nazi uniform?</p>
              <p>Look at it this way: Would you take a baseball bat from a crime scene and put it in your trophy cabinet, or turn an oddly-shaped piece of shrapnel into jewellery, also for vanity's sake? To consider these icons "nice to look at" is to say that they are meaningless, when they aren't.</p>
              <p>So unfortunately, your opinion is flawed. Fashion is loaded with meaning, and what you wear makes a statement about you. Which is what the TS is trying to do (stand out from the crowd).</p>

              <p><br>Aaah! Kuali baba finally finally,you are starting to look things from another perspective. Which is great, truly appreciated by me. Thanks. Thats why i think too, red armband.</p>
              <p>As for your 1st sentence, I agree with u, but to being with, there wasn't a need to flame him at the 1st place. In fact i feel for that poor boy. He just started a thread with innocent fashion perspective but he was targeted by certain forumers with another mindset or 'had a bad day'. Which I think isn't fair to him.</p>
              <p>And for your 2nd sentence, its ok. I appreciated ur comments.</p>
              <p>3rd sentence, I said earlier on to TS " do what you want, but be prepare for the consequences "</p>
              <p>You see Kuali, It has been great to engage in a conversation with you. And If i say any harsh words earlier on, I apologise. I respect all your opinions, thats why you see I only reply to your qoutes on me, I didn't even bother to reply to those who weren't fair in their thinking.</p>
              <p>It has been great, Kuali. Thanks</p>
