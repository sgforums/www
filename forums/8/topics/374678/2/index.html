              <p><br>exactly.. which is why i said that the nazis perverted the swastika...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and gobez.. what we are talking about is that instead of finding out why you pissed off everyone, and why we take you for an attention seeking punk (want to be "less boring"), you just went and got all defensive..</p>
              <p>you do not even know the history and the atrocities of that hated sign.. and you wanted wear it.. you didn't want to find out, and when we told you, you lashed out against others..</p>
              <p>you chose wallow in your own ignorance..</p>
              <p>and you held it up like a badge of pride..</p>
              <p>that, is immaterial because it is ultimately your own waste of your life</p>
              <p>what pisses people off is that sign you chose.. speaks of wanton evil and bigotry.. of an evil so horrific that there is a law against it in the land which spawned it...</p>
              <p>you did not even stop to think why there is a law against it in Europe?</p>
              <p>all you thought about was your own vanity.. you wanted to be "less boring"</p>
              <p>oh well.. go ahead.. be "less boring"...</p>
              <p>and you spit on the bones of the 6 million Jews who died in the Holocaust... and you flip the bird on the millions of Poles, Slavs, Romanians, Gypsies which were murdered... and you piss on the countless soldiers who died to rid Europe of the scourge of Nazism..</p>
              <p>and yes.. it is THAT intense...</p>

              <p><br>exactly wad i meant :D never mind enuf said anyway i found out what i asked for anw so i cant be bothered to listen to the Bear preach about all the evil hitler and frens did.</p>
              <p>FYI just because i was ignorant i asked, you could just tell mi "this is evil its bad its anti-Jew", i ll get the point straight. Instead wad did u do? you just labelled me as attention seeking and continue to criticise me as if i was morally corrupted and i should be damned fer asking. I was honestly just looking fer an answer and tts all. Also, didnt u get the point that "ok im not going to use the swastika any longer and asking fer other suggestions"?From my point of view, you DID not. If u did get the point, you wouldn't be here telling all hitler's sins, i just want to get my point across to u " i understood already i get the point", do you have to be so bloody worked up over this?</p>
              <p>Fine i admit im ignorant and all but u are clearly overreacting.</p>

Of course i would have checked wif myself that that statement is invalid before rebutting against you right? That's basic common sense for someone to disagree wif another's statement before engaging in a rebuttal. Had i agree why the hell would i type another chunk of text?</p>
              <p>And i don't need you to just copy and paste to me smth i can check up on a dictionary.fyi u are contradiciting yourself as well from the third paragraph, you can only "state" after making a conclusion unless you are that stupid to just shoot rubbish out from ur mouth without processing it wif your brain. And yes you are indeed concluding that im overconfident from your point of view and that is precisely what im unhappy about and thus i made my point to  you that your opinions of my confidence are totally uncalled for and unnecessary.</p>
              <p>And i believe you must have did that without reading through the whole chunk of text on the other page for you to criticise wantonly without even putting urselves in the shoes of both me and the other forumers who are against my topic.You just happen to chance on this thread,know that majority are against me and decided to take a stand without careful consideration.</p>
              <p>Although the tensions are diffused,by a person of ur age, don't you know that after a fire started and extinguished, a simple spark can reignite the blaze? You are no different from hitler, he was just playing on past greviances and fueling them in order to rise to power etc etc, just like how you are sowing discord.( fyi this was brought to my knowledge after i researched on hitler and frens after seeing why other forumers are against my topic as stated)</p>
              <p>Yes you agree that both are malignant, my question is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">more.</span> Presuming there's two criminals, one commited murder, one shoplifted. Yes both did wrong but which deserve the death sentence? Also, i admitted and apologised fer my mistakes.What about you?</p>
              <p>And assuming you are a student with 6 years of primary education and 4 years of secondary education, you should have the intellect to comprehend what im trying to convey.The mistakes i make are merely typos and shortforms. I'm still typing in standard english to get my message to you loud and clear.(heck i even included examples and metaphors)</p>
              <p>Thus "please do make ur reply more explicit and clear as it really is quite difficult to read with the spellings mistakes made." is another illustration on how unnecessary ur comments are. How difficult is it to read a few typos and spelling mistakes? Unless you are mentally weak, i can understand, assuming you are not, i really fail to understand why you are having so much difficulty in reading my response.</p>
