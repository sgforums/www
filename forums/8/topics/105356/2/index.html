Got it in 1991 and the staff were pretty well-versed in dealing with it.<br><br>Personally, I had more trouble with tetanus toxoid.  With dengue, my temperature went from 37.5 to 42 in three hours, I got checked into the hospital and slept for 12 hours.  Apart from feeling like I had a bad case of the flu, the only other side effect was that when I got out of bed to go to the loo the next morning, my legs gave way.<br><br>Apart from that, it was the usual stuff - blood tests, put on a drip for a week until I was discharged.  No big dramas.  The medics were a fun lot and I had a rollicking good time while I was warded.</div>
