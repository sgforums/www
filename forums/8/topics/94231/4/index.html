            <div class='col-md body'>Supremist's posts say a lot about his self worth. Even assuming you are treated like a God here in our country by some people, can you hold that same  head high back in your country among your own peers? Or can you only, like so many others, continually compare yourself to someone inferior (in your  own warped opinion)?<br><br><strong>Is your sense of self worth measured only by the length/width/size of your member?</strong> I mention this only because I keep seeing you bring it up.<br><br>In any case Nelstar (and some others) shot you down rather well, so i shan't bother to debut some of your more ludicrous claims. Until you post more that is.<br><br>*Pauses to applaud Nelstar*<br><br>But I still have to say this, Supremist look at your country now. The high and mighty USA, it's in a decline right now. Your politics are a international joke. Just for effect I shall quote Mark Twain<br><br><blockquote><strong>It could probably be shown by facts and figures that there is no distinctly American criminal class except Congress.</strong></blockquote>That, coming from a <span style="font-style: italic;">American</span> man who died more than 90 years ago. But that same quote still applies even now. Perhaps more now than ever before.<br><br>It's in a such a mess today because of self centered, ignorant citizens like you who think the American dreams will last forever. Descendants who spit on their fore-father's values, hard work and what they fought for; with their own self-satisfied sense of moral/intellectual superiority and decadence.<br><br>I'll write more, but i have to go now, maybe later tonight ... till then ...<br><br>PS : Call all the women you bed "chink" in their faces. Better yet, print our all your posts and show it to them. If you're really all that Godlike, they'll probably thank you, then proceed to wash your feet. But no, you don't dare (to do the fore-mentioned) but back in your homeland you do? I laugh at that because that only makes you a typical coward who can only gather courage in numbers.</div>

I NEVER asserted this to be correct. I just tried to build on this false illusion. Typical chinks, instead of rectifying this huge gaping hole, they loved<br>to curse others back.<br><br>Second: I would like to introduce you about America. The real america I lived in and not the one where you suppressed Singaporeans saw on your 'very impartial and unbiased' news paper 'The Straits Times'. The real america is one where people are no longer religious, where churches preaches more about the superiority of Whites than jesus's teachings. This isnt what's happening in only some small pocket states.. FACE IT CHINKS this is happening all over AMERICA. Just ask those chinks who studied in american high schools, gangs of whites just pull up a CHINK NERD and scream in their face, 'YELLOW NIGGAS'. Whites are no longer as rich and influencial as they used to be. Because of this poverty problem, and the fact that stupid 'CHINKNA' tried to destroy our economy... whites nowadays in America are angsty and felt more hatred towards Chinks and other minorities. Infact, Americans have grown more xenophobic that ever since. We simply do not welcome yellow people into our white country.<br><br>Third: So you think im nazi? HAha. No way man. Im just propagating the United American Sentiment. After 9/11 we no longer view outsiders the same.<br><br>Fourth: So so many of you dont treat Whites warmly? Haha, what a large sample size to conclude this. FACE it kids. Just walk out of Orchard and see that FAT AMERICAN KID (high school dropout - antisocial - poor - ugly) with that smashing Chink 5lut of yours. We simply love to romp their asses. And what can chink man do? Hey, YOUR country still depends on us too.<br><br>Fifth: Oh ye, my dad is working under a Chink boss. But so? My dad's only a high-school dropout. It's completely laughable. Look at hordes of Chink graduates roaming the streeets out their for a meagre. Look at the number of Chink professionals in their 40s without jobs. Haha. That's why I say Chinks are plain suck-ups.<br><br>Sixth: In case Elindra is defending chink girls again, oh ye, i'll be fair to chink girls. Not all admire whites. BUT many do. Hey, if you're not accepting this truth.. there's not much i can say... after all only those who feel strongly against this case will reply, right? Those silent majority, those chink girls partying with white boys out there, dont even have time to come to this forum.<br><br>Seventh: [to bu qi fan or some chink shit name] Oh course i dont dare to call chinese 'chinks' here. Who dare to do that when u singaporeans have some stupid yellow boys dyed with OUR blonde hairs, with BLUE color contact lenses, speaking OUR english language coming after me with some cleaver. But back in USA, we do. We openly call chinks 'Big YIGGER' on the streets.<br>Eigth: Caesar said we're not christians. Haha. you're right. A YELLOW christian is a trueblue one you mean. We're a christian country. and Singapore's christians is a YELLOW convert christian. See, in many domestic churchs, not those in cosmopolitan cities, there's a rule that says 'Whites Only.' or in some others 'Blacks Only'. comeon chinks, u're simply not welcomed in USA.&gt;&gt;&gt; But i guess i am very welcomed here! I went to the durian stall yesterday and that Chink SLitty Eyes Durian seller bowed very low (what a suck-up) and tried to talk to me in English! Haha he cant say english a shit. After all he's selling some shit fruits too.<br>Ninth: And i despise waitresses who, when attending to my family in a restaurant, tried to push up some hybrid ACCENT. Yucks, our appetite is spoilt.<br>Tenth: And our American community here enjoys pushing Chinks around. My friends' Dad is the director of a SINGAPOREAN company here. He owns a convertible. My friend would drive me around in that car. Next time u see a black MERC convertible in Orchard roaming the streets, with 2 chink girls at my backseat laughing, you know its me and my friend. Do stop to say hello. Can you imagine that chinks, im going to screw ur girls that very nite. And they jump on bed willingly too!</div></blockquote>I think instead of attacking him, we should read what he says and THINK about the so called foreign talents we are inviting into singapore. They are 3rd class ang moh who CANNOT make it in their own countries so they decide to try out our little country. SO everyone ....think about the ang mohs at the top of the scales above our own singaporeans. I think it is about time we as singaporeans should bring up our own kind instead of the foreign talents.</div>

In China, there was an upstart<br><br>In Singapore, this phenom is widespread. And I think part of it has something to do with our history, or the lack of it. We were under English colonial rule, and when we gained independance as a democratic sovereign state, because of geographic reasons, our security (and hence survival and economic development) was linked to our relations with the single democratic superpower in the world, that is, the USA. This was out of necessity. But this I think, created a sense that we, as a Singapore state, a society, had always been dependent on Westerners. The young people of today embrace the American culture, for some people the way they talk, the attitude, etc. But if Britain had been the dominant superpower in the past century, then the young people of my generation would be embracing British culture, maybe adopting exaggerated British accents. The point is that we do not have a strong Singaporean culture, right?<br><br>Supremist had made some harsh comments, and he'd gotten some flame in return. I cant fathom whether his intentions are to help us realise that this white whole thing of the whites getting preferential treatment is happening, or he finally can't stand another local girl talking to him in a faux american accent or wat.<br><br>Supremist, initially, it seemed like you wanted to provoke some discussion on the issue so that we can understand it better and improve the situation. But then you've insulted the non-whites in so many of your subsequent posts.<br><br>But at least it's allowed some of us here to see that this looking down on ourselves, this is crap, alright.

            <div class='col-md body'>look you retards, don't you get it? just admit that we're Chinese and be proud of it! I've met many idiots who go ranting "i hate china i dont wanna be chinese" and it just pisses me off. i feel utterly ashamed that there are "chinese" like these that exist and its no wonder that for the past 150 years the world has despised Chinese because we brought it upon ourselves by being such idiots who just wont accept the fact that our skin is yellow and who refuse to change for the better. Look at the Japanese, German, and even those 3rd world viets they're all bloody proud of their heritage so why can't we be proud of ours too? do you mean to say that 5000 years of Chinese culture cant be compared to the others? Back when the world was still living in stone houses and fighting wars with crude metal blades we were building grand palaces and cities of evenly cut brick, gold, jewels etc... Until We Chinese stand up and say "look I'm proud to be Chinese, fuck all that Japanese or Taiwanese or American hip-hop bullshit culture", we will continue to be despised. and as for you Supreme whatever I have American, Australian, Japanese and even Brit friends who are such nice people and who never resented or minded the fact that I am Chinese and I'm proud to be Chinese. And all those who suck up or let me put it nicely, "cosy up" to caucasians you're simply a fucking disgrace because it is people like that who cause the caucasians(the redneck/white supremacist whatever) comunity to despise us. So if you're so ashamed to be Chinese or Asian just fuck off and bleach your skin like MJ you can be white all you want and guess what, caucasians aen't gonna accept you either! and also, aren't majority of the doctors, scientists, computer engineers in America either Chinese or Indian?<br><br>ps stop all that singlish crap...if you wanna speak English speak proper English if you wanna speak Mandrin speak proper Mandrin don't jumble up everything and FUCK TAIWANESE "chinese", they're not real Chinese studies have shown that they descended from some who knows what tribe.</div>
