            <div class='col-md body'>Part 1 - The Vietnam War<br><br><strong>The French in Vietnam</strong><br>What?<br><br>Background Information<br>Perhaps the most important fact about Vietnamese history has been the consistency of organized resistance to foreign domination. When the French, in the mid-19th century, established tentative control over the southernmost provinces of Vietnam (which they called Cochin China), Vietnamese government officials ("mandarins") withdrew and refused to serve them. When the French expanded to central and northern Vietnam (Annam and Tonkin), they were met by a forceful resistance movement led by the educated elite of the country, who mobilized peasants to fight the French in pitched battles and guerrilla raids. Even after Emperor Ham Nghi -- in whose name the Vietnamese struggled -- was captured and exiled to Algeria in 1888, the movement continued. Ultimately, sheer military force enabled the French to subdue the land, if not the people.<br><br>By the turn of the century, Vietnam was "secure" enough for the French to begin to exploit its resources. Politically, the country was administered by French nationals, with the assistance of Vietnamese at low-level, low-paying jobs. State monopolies on the production and sale of alcohol and salt were imposed, raising the price of both beyond what many Vietnamese could afford. A state monopoly on opium was also established, ensuring large profits for foreign distributors.<br><br>Huge tracts of land in southern Vietnam were turned over to French settlers and Vietnamese collaborators. The resulting plantation system of agriculture transformed southern Vietnam into a rice exporting area, while per capita rice consumption in Vietnam itself declined. Taxes of every kind multiplied.<br><br>Mines and rubber plantations were opened with the help of contract workers who could be fined and jailed if they tried to leave their jobs. Educational opportunities for the population actually declined during the period of French rule (except briefly during World War II), and legal political participation by Vietnamese was limited and strictly controlled. Protest movements were re- pressed by force, driving many Vietnamese -- including the future president of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh -- into hiding and exile.<br><br>Known for a long time as Nguyen Ai Quoc (Nguyen the Patriot), Ho organized nationalistic young women and men into a League for Vietnamese Independence (abbreviated in Vietnamese as Viet Minh) in 1941. Although Ho was himself a Communist, indeed a founding member of the French Communist Party, he insisted that independence could only be achieved through the united efforts of Vietnamese of all classes and political persuasions.<br><br>During World War II, Vietnam was governed by not one but two foreign powers -- Japan, which exercised overall control, and the Vichy French government, which had surrendered to Germany in 1940. The Viet Minh worked behind Japanese lines, supplying information on Japanese troop movements to America's O.S.S. (Office of Strategic Services), helping downed American flyers escape to China, and -- having received some arms and supplies from the 0. S. S. -- building a small guerrilla force.<br><br>In March 1945, Japan ousted the Vichy French and assumed direct rule over Vietnam; the Viet Minh stepped up their anti-Japanese activities. By the time Japan surrendered to the United States, in August 1945, it represented the strongest political force in Vietnam. On September 2, 1945, using the words of the American Declaration of Independence, Ho Chi Minh proclaimed Vietnam a free and independent country. His hope was that his wartime allies would restrain the French from attempting to dominate Vietnam ever again. Instead, the British, in the south, and the Nationalist Chinese, in the north, enabled the French to return. Within a year, the Viet Minh was once more fighting for the independence of Vietnam against the French.<br><br>Although the United States disapproved of French tactics, the desire to support its European ally, combined with a growing concern over Communist power in Asia, led first President Truman and then President Eisenhower into close cooperation with the French war effort. By 1954, when the Geneva Conference brought a temporary end to fighting in Vietnam, the United States was paying over 75 percent of the French war costs.<br><br>Despite the Viet Minh's massive victory over the French at Dien Bien Phu, the United States tried to persuade the French to keep fighting. The Eisenhower administration even considered the direct use of U.S. military force, including combat troops and nuclear weapons. Neither the British nor the U.S. Congress was enthusiastic, however. Eisenhower and Secretary of State Dulles ultimately acknowledged the Geneva Agreements, which divided Vietnam at the 17th parallel, a temporary demarcation line meant to separate French and Viet Minh forces until elections scheduled for 1956. Ho Chi Minh firmly controlled the area north of the line, while the area south of the 17th parallel was put in the hands of the conservative nationalist Ngo Dinh Diem. It was hoped that the nationwide elections scheduled for 1956 would lead to national reunification.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Vietnam War - part 2<br><br><strong>America's Commitment to the War </strong>(1954-1965)<br>Background Information<br>After the defeat of the French at Dien Bien Phu and the signing of the Geneva Accords of 1954, the U.S. shifted its support to Ngo Dinh Diem, a conservative nationalist whose prominent American friends included Senator John F. Kennedy and Vice President Nixon. As a Catholic in a Buddhist country, Diem needed a base of support in the south and found it in the large population of refugees (some 900,000) -- most of whom were Catholic -- who had left their homes in the north, aided and encouraged by the U.S.<br><br>With the certainty of firm American backing, and this new domestic base, Diem refused to hold the elections agreed to at Geneva. Instead he organized a referendum that gave the people of the south a choice between himself as president or Bao Dai as an elective monarch. Diem won handily, getting more than 605,000 votes from Saigon's 405,000 registered voters.<br><br>In opposition to Diem's increasingly harsh and authoritarian rule, the National Liberation Front (NLF, later branded "Viet Cong" ) was formed in 1960. To reinforce Diem, the new American president, John F. Kennedy, dispatched Green Beret "advisers" in 1961 and provided increased military aid, including American-piloted armed helicopters, as the guerrilla war expanded. By spring of 1963, South Vietnamese opposition had reached the point that Buddhist monks were demonstrating dramatically against Diem's rule and the war by self-immolation. Diem lost the confidence of the Americans as well as his own people; and, with the Kennedy administration's encouragement, an army coup deposed Diem. On November 1, 1963, Diem was killed by the Vietnamese military who took over from him.<br><br>Following the ouster of Diem, there was no Saigon regime that survived without American support; and of the several that were ousted, American involvement was critical in every case. Only with the coup that put Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky in power (June 1965) did the U.S. feel that it had a satisfactory political instrument to work through. Subsequently, the U.S. was unwilling to countenance any coup; and when there were challenges to the power of Thieu and Ky, the U.S. threw its full weight behind the two of them.<br><br>President Lyndon Johnson (following the assassination of President Kennedy -- eleven days after the shooting of President Diem) sought to sustain his domestic social programs (the "Great Society" ), amidst ongoing worries about the international consequences of the "loss" of South Vietnam (the "domino theory" ). Congress overwhelmingly passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution on August 7, 1964, giving the president broad war-making powers; and, in February, 1965, the U.S. began strategic bombing of the north, believing that this could bring Hanoi to pressure the NLF to stop fighting in the south -- something Hanoi neither would nor could do. The first U.S. Marines went ashore in a direct combat role at Danang on March 8, 1965. Soon thereafter, American civilian and military personnel came under frequent NLF/Viet Cong attacks. In January 1968 even the symbol of American power and presence, the U.S. Embassy, was besieged. Presi- dent Johnson proposed a Mekong River development project as a nonmilitary continuation of U.S. involvement in Vietnam. At the same time he vowed not to be "the first [American] president to lose a war."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Vietnam War - Part 3<br><br>The United States Takes Charge (1965-1968 )<br>Background Information<br>When he took office, President Johnson made two promises with respect to Vietnam: he would not "lose" it and he would not send "American boys" to die there. Johnson failed to keep either pledge.<br><br>By 1965, 184,000 American young men were fighting in Vietnam, and many were dying. They fought forces organized by the National Liberation Front (NLF) into guerrilla units and stable village militia. The NLF was a coalition native to the south, made up largely of peasants. Many South Vietnamese noncombatants aided the NLF by supplying military information, food, medical services, homemade weapons, and recruits. In return, the NLF organized village self-defense, established schools, encouraged local irrigation projects, and, in general, functioned as a government throughout large areas of the south. North Vietnamese army combat units didn't arrive until March-April 1965. As late as 1967 there were only 55,000 regular North Vietnamese troops in the south. The bulk of the fighting, until mid-1968 or 1969, was in the hands of 240,000 NLF soldiers, who engaged 525,000 Americans and 685,000 Saigon army soldiers.<br><br>Native to the villages of the south, the NLF guerrillas, lightly armed and thoroughly familiar with the territory, proved to be a formidable adversary. Because these troops were often difficult to distinguish from the population itself, U.S. military commanders resorted to such "pacification" tactics as "free fire zones" and "search and destroy" missions. "Free fire zones" were areas in which anything that moved was assumed to be an enemy and attacked; "search and destroy" missions frequently responded to a single sniper attack from a village by destroying the entire vil- lage and relocating its surviving population. In this way, every Vietnamese, of whatever political affiliation, became a potential enemy to American soldiers. Some of these soldiers referred to the Vietnamese countryside as "Indian country," and, echoing 19th-century cavalry soldiers, many claimed that "the only good gook is a dead gook." By 1966 "free fire zones" were enlarged to areas of several square miles within which saturation bombing by B-52s or shelling by massed artillery cleared the land and made it uninhabitable by either NLF troops or the local peasantry. It was this decimation of the land, more than anything else, that filled the refugee camps in the safe areas near Saigon and other cities.<br><br>In 1967 the so-called "Phoenix Program" was initiated. This "pacification" program was intended to eliminate the NLF leadership (or anyone identified as such without corroboration) through assassination.<br><br>Something of the nature of the war in these years can be captured by statistics. <span style="color: blue;">Although South Vietnam was presumably a friendly country we had come to aid, U.S. forces had dropped 1,388,000 tons of bombs on it by 1969. Ground ammunition expended amounted to 1,374,000 tons during the same period; and in the first nine months of 1967, alone, varieties of highly toxic crop defoliants (most of it Agent Orange) were sprayed on 965,006 acres of land. Overall, American troops expended 500 times the quantity of ammunition used by the NLF; and if the bombing of the north is added to the tonnage dropped on the south, the total is a stunning 4.5 million tons (1965-1969) or 500 lbs. of explosives for every Vietnamese man, woman, and child.</span><br><br>And still General Westmoreland called for more American troops, requesting an additional 200,000 in 1968. As the costs of the war rose, in both moral and material terms, Johnson's top advisers became increasingly skeptical of U.S. military estimates of the situation. Moreover, such influential men as George Ball and Clark Clifford privately turned against continued American escalation of the war. After the January 1968 Tet offensive, in which guerrillas attacked no fewer than 34 provincial centers, 64 district towns, and every major city in the south -- to the apparent surprise of the American command -- Johnson was strongly urged by his advisers to reject West- moreland's request. On March 31, he called a bombing halt on much of the north (bombing of the south continued) and declared he would devote the remainder of his presidential term to seeking peace rather than re-election.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Vietnam War - Part 4<br><br><strong>'Vietnamization ' to 1975 </strong>(1968-1975)<br>Background Information<br>On November 3, 1969, President Richard Nixon officially unveiled his "Vietnamization" program. The purpose of this program was to gradually transfer combat operations in Vietnam entirely to the South Vietnamese army. Peak American troop levels of 543,400 fell to 334,600 by 1970, and had diminished to 156,800 at the end of 1971. The 'Vietnamization' program was meant to implement Nixon's 1968 campaign promise to bring the fighting to an "honorable" end. With this policy, the South Vietnamese assumed a greater combat role and consequently suffered an increase in their casualty rate. However, serious questions arose concerning the South Vietnamese military capacity and willingness to take the offensive. At the same time, American military capacity was itself affected by morale problems that included high levels of drug abuse and racial tension.<br><br>Despite the decrease in troop strength and lowered morale, military actions actually expanded during these years. U.S. and South Vietnamese forces invaded Cambodia (1970) and the South Vietnamese, supported by the U.S., invaded Laos (1971). These overt incursions stirred controversy in the United States, particularly in Congress and among college students (although covert military operations, including secret bombings, had been conducted for nearly a decade -- mainly in Laos).<br><br>With American troop strength declining, the North Vietnamese initiated a broad offensive in March 1972 ("Easter offensive" ), to which Nixon responded with an unprecedented bombing campaign throughout Vietnam that included the mining of Haiphong Harbor.<br><br>If the nature of the war had changed on the U.S.-Saigon side, it was also transformed for the NLF and the North Vietnamese. NLF casualties as a result of the military failure of the Tet offensive, the various "pacification" programs conducted by the C.I.A. and the U.S. Army, and the ongoing bombing and defoliation efforts were enormous. Slowly the weight of fighting shifted from southern-born and organized guerrilla units to main-force North Vietnamese regular army troops. In the 1972 spring offensive and, more tellingly, in a final offensive in 1975, the war finally became that which the United States had always claimed it was: a war for the unification of Vietnam by force, under Hanoi's direction.<br><br>By the fall of 1972 both sides had reached a state of military stalemate. The situation facing the Nixon administration was almost brutal in its simplicity: how to extricate American troops without betraying what the President took to be a commitment to the Thieu government.<br><br>A breakthrough occurred in the peace talks that had been going on between Washington and Hanoi in Paris since 1968. Concessions on both sides yielded an agreement that National Security Adviser Kissinger (negotiating for the U.S.) was confident would fulfill Nixon's pledge to end the war with honor. The Thieu regime's firm resistance to this agreement surprised the American government. To persuade Thieu that the U.S. would not desert him and to demonstrate to Hanoi a U.S. commitment to a separate, independent South Vietnamese nation with an anti-communist leadership, Nixon ordered the heaviest bombing of the north in the history of the war ("Christmas bombing" of 1972). Shortly after this twelve-day offensive, the Paris peace agreement was signed.<br><br>The Paris Accords allowed North Vietnamese troops to remain in place in the south, and, for the first time, officially recognized the existence of the NLF and promised a future political role for its constituency. However, the agreement also permitted continuing American military supply of the Thieu government.<br><br>Violations of the accords began before the ink was dry. It seems likely, in retrospect, that the United States would have re-entered the war -- certainly the air war -- had Congress not intervened. On July 31, 1973, Congress voted to end all bombing in Indochina and to ban any future military moves in the area without prior Congressional approval. Nixon's requests for aid were consistently cut down (although it should be noted that the U.S. did send $7 billion to the Thieu regime from 1973 to 1975; for the same period, China and the Soviet Union supplied Hanoi with $1.5 billion in aid). It became increasingly clear that the Saigon government was on its own.<br><br>Although the American people and Congress had essentially disengaged from the war, the fighting continued between 1973 and 1975. The inherent weaknesses of the South Vietnamese government, no longer bolstered by American military participation, resulted in its ultimate defeat.<br><br>Saigon fell on April 30, 1975. The war had come to an end.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Vietnam War - Part 5<br><br><strong>The War at Home</strong><br>Background Information<br>The war in Vietnam became the most unpopular war ever fought by the U.S. government. Opposition to it grew into an "anti-war movement." The civil rights movement -- at its height in the early and mid-1960s -- created a climate for protest. Many of the earliest anti-war activists had been directly involved in the civil rights movement. Opponents of U.S. government policy in Vietnam built coalitions with advocates of equal rights for ethnic minorities and women, environmental activists, and supporters of "new life-styles." This eclectic grouping -- dubbed the "New Left" -- was loosely organized, agreeing only on the demand for the immediate withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam.<br><br>The first anti-war protests were held during President Kennedy's administration; as the war continued and escalated, the number of protestors increased. For example, an antiwar demonstration in Boston in 1965 drew only 100 people, while a similar demonstration in the same place drew over 100,000 in 1969. The original protestors were predominantly white, middle- class, college students; but the college students were eventually joined by a representative cross- section of the American people. As Americans from every ethnic and social class began to turn against the war, so more and more members of Congress began to express their doubts publicly. In White House meetings, a few government officials began to privately express their doubts as to the wisdom of a continuation of the war. Civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., began to speak out against the war, seeing that the conflict drained money from domestic social programs and realizing that a disproportionate number of combat troops sent to Vietnam was black. A poll conducted in 1965 found 60 percent of Americans favoring military involvement in Vietnam; by 1967 polls began to show a majority opposed to the war; and by 1971 over 60 percent were opposed.<br><br>From the very beginning, protestors engaged in civil disobedience by publicly burning their draft cards or refusing to report when drafted. In 1965 there were only 380 draft evaders prosecuted; in 1969 there were 33,960. It is estimated that over 100,000 fled the United States to avoid conscription; while a sizable number chose civilian alternative service or even prison over participation in the military.<br><br>The strength of the anti-war movement was demonstrated by the opposition to the war within the armed forces. While the draft evaders were, like the early protestors, mainly white and middle class, deserters (50,000 to 100,000) tended to be of various ethnic and class composition. After serving in Vietnam, many veterans returned opposed to the war. Some formed an organization called the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, which held a dramatic march on Washington, D.C., in April 1971. At that time the veterans threw their combat medals at the Capitol building in a vivid demonstration of their feelings.<br><br>As the protestors grew more vocal, so did those Americans who supported the country's role in Vietnam. Increasing animosity arose between those arguing for an end to the war and social change at home versus those supporting government policy and fearful of dramatic social change. The government's attempts to squelch the opposition also grew, sometimes exploding into violent confrontation. In 1970 students at Kent State and Jackson State Universities were shot and killed while peacefully demonstrating their opposition to the war. With questionable legality, the F.B.I.; C.I.A.; the U.S. Army; and local, urban police forces infiltrated protest groups, tapped their telephones, photographed their meetings, and created secret files on innumerable Americans.<br><br>With President Nixon's decision to end the draft and bring home the remaining American combat troops in 1973, there was a notable decline in anti-war activity; and broad-based, anti-war coalitions began to dissolve.<br><br>It is difficult to gauge the effects of the anti-war movement. While many Americans were, undoubtedly, exhilarated by their ability to publicly protest decisions made by their government, other Americans were appalled by such a show of, what they considered to be, disrespect for the government during a time of war. It is safe to assume that the protestors had some influence in bringing an earlier end to the war -- although the extent of that influence is still in dispute.<br><br>What is indisputable is the effect of the anti-war movement on domestic politics -- particularly on the presidential campaign of 1968. The magnitude of the protests lent support to the strong primary showings of Eugene McCarthy and Robert Kennedy; influenced Lyndon Johnson's decision not to seek re-election; and contributed negatively to Hubert Humphrey's presidential bid. The Nixon administration was forced to recognize the growing strength of the protests in its policy-making on Vietnam. If nothing else, the size and frequency of the demonstrations, and the extensive media coverage, guaranteed that not only Americans and Vietnamese were paying attention, but that "the whole world was watching."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Vietnam War - Part 6<br><br><strong>Epilogue</strong><br>Since the War<br>The legacy of the war has been one of violence and destruction for the people of Indochina. Each country -- Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam -- remains pockmarked with bomb craters; its productive capacity well below prewar standards; some of its land poisoned by the lingering effects of toxic defoliants; its people exhausted.<br><br>In Cambodia, the forces of Pol Pot, having overthrown the American-installed regime of Lon Nol, instituted a rule of revolutionary terror domestically and initiated increasingly threatening border conflicts against its one-time ally, Vietnam. Vietnam's response to these attacks was a successful invasion of Cambodia (now Kampuchea). The Vietnamese installed the government of Heng Samrin -- a Cambodian regime friendly to Vietnam and, most commentators agree, preferred by Cambodians to its murderous predecessor.<br><br>Tension increased between Vietnam (supporting Heng Samrin) and the People's Republic of China (supporting Pol Pot). China decided to "teach Vietnam a lesson" by invading Vietnam in 1979. Ethnic Chinese living in Vietnam were subject to varieties of repression and attack, leading several hundred thousand to flee north to China by land. A majority of those who fled Vietnam, did so in makeshift boats, even at the risk of their own lives. This latter group was joined by many southern ethnic Vietnamese who found economic and political conditions in Vietnam too difficult. These so-called "boat people" are now part of a new diaspora, a kind of permanent refugee population produced, directly, by the length and depth of the thirty-year war that tore Indochina apart.<br><br>Another casualty of Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia has been the normalization of relations between Vietnam and the United States. The U.S. cited both the invasion and Vietnam's harsh treatment of ethnic Chinese in Vietnam as the reasons for breaking off all discussion -- either of promised aid or of future diplomatic relations. Washington's decision was, at least in part, motivated by a new U.S.-China alliance. An unwillingness to negotiate with Vietnam reflects U.S. support for China's (pro-Pol Pot) position.<br><br>Foregoing neutrality in the Sino-Vietnamese dispute, the United States chose alliance with China and continued enmity toward Vietnam. The United States in the 1980s has yet to come to terms with the war it entered -- essentially as a funding agency -- in the 1950s, and withdrew from -- ambiguously -- in the 1970s.<br><br></div>
