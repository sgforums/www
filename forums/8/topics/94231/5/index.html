I've met many idiots who go ranting "i hate china i dont wanna be chinese" and it just pisses me off. i feel utterly ashamed that there are "chinese" like these that exist and its no wonder that for the past 150 years the world has despised Chinese because we brought it upon ourselves by being such idiots who just wont accept the fact that our skin is yellow and who refuse to change for the better. Look at the Japanese, German, and even those 3rd world viets they're all bloody proud of their heritage so why can't we be proud of ours too? do you mean to say that 5000 years of Chinese culture cant be compared to the others? Back when the world was still living in stone houses and fighting wars with crude metal blades we were building grand palaces and cities of evenly cut brick, gold, jewels etc... Until We Chinese stand up and say "look I'm proud to be Chinese, fuck all that Japanese or Taiwanese or American hip-hop bullshit culture", we will continue to be despised. and as for you Supreme whatever I have American, Australian, Japanese and even Brit friends who are such nice people and who never resented or minded the fact that I am Chinese and I'm proud to be Chinese. And all those who suck up or let me put it nicely, "cosy up" to caucasians you're simply a fucking disgrace because it is people like that who cause the caucasians(the redneck/white supremacist whatever) comunity to despise us. So if you're so ashamed to be Chinese or Asian just fuck off and bleach your skin like MJ you can be white all you want and guess what, caucasians aen't gonna accept you either! and also, aren't majority of the doctors, scientists, computer engineers in America either Chinese or Indian?<br><br>ps stop all that singlish crap...if you wanna speak English speak proper English if you wanna speak Mandrin speak proper Mandrin don't jumble up everything and FUCK TAIWANESE "chinese", they're not real Chinese studies have shown that they descended from some who knows what tribe.</div></blockquote>Assert a little more self-control as this is a free forum and strong language is undesirable especially in a place like Chit chat.<br><br>No one here is ashamed of being Asian or Chinese. You should tell that to your pals if they are doing that. I know you will do a fine job in that, probably bloody their noses if required.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Anyway the community here especially love SouthPark, they love the Red Indians South PArk Series, where conspiring RED indians brought yellow people from China to spread SARS to kill others.

However, please do not generalise.<br><br></div></blockquote>That's very true.When I was much younger, in my early teens, my mindset was that of a true-blue kentang, worshipping all things American blindly.I was putting down our own ethnic culture and our vibrant identities with nary a regret.I've been to Korea, Japan, Mexico and America.You can call me a well-travelled person, due to the fact I've relatives all over the world and my family does travel quite a bit.I'm appalled to hear Americans who think they are the know-it-all , being in the dark about Asia, not mention even Europe.This impression of Americans changed from people who possessed great intellect all over to on of pity and sadness.The ghettos of Upper Brooklyn were laid bare for all to see during my project presentation for Geography during my college days, and I can still remember the gasps of astonishment when they hear me describe the sorry conditions the average American black has to live through, all the police brutality of the white-majority police departments, the measly welfare checks.It pains my heart to see one nation with a noble founding intent reduced to such a colossal hulk of a rotten skeleton.<br><br>But then again, I've met others who are not red-necks and "trailer park trash" culturally , but are able to appreciate the differences in society and culture and treat everyone equally.You see, right now, from my interactions, I believe that we have amongst us people who are more educated and aware about the world around us than Americans who seem to setting global policy based on their own national interests.I'm not putting down America as a whole, it's just there are elements who choose to remake her into Elmer J.Fudd than someone like Franklin Delano Roosevelt.<br><br>P.S.The poseurs I see on the streets today are so sickening.And Supremist, I appreciate your candour and I do not take offence at the fact you use the derogatory term "chink", because I know the climate in which you were brought up in.There are bigots and misguided, ignorant fools in every society.Rather than getting hot and bothered over them, let the ones who are aware and enlightened get together to pool ideas.</div>

And please be more informed... KKK is long DEAD! Haha it no longer exists nowadays. Stormfront in America hardly has any members! So stop refering to me as a KKK guy! Don't be a loser. If you wanna prove me wrong show me some solid evidences, even SiBeiSuay can do better than you dudes. --&gt; and pls, do confront this social crisis issue --&gt; dont banish it away and then continue acting like whites (know why? cus we americans will laugh!)<br><br>2) Wait a second, did someone say the langauge most widely used is Chinese? Hmn, what language are yellow people using here in this forum? What language are most yellow people speaking in Singapore? Chinese? My FOOT! Chinese (my chink friends told me) is a stupid, hard language that is very LOW-CLASS. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>3) And my views do not only represent myself! IT is the voice of Americans here.. or maybe even the WHITES here. Most of the time we just laugh silently! Who was the white author who wrote in streats long ago admiting that he came to singapore not for the jobs but for some girls? Hey, get real. This is real-life. Do you know we have all-white churches here in Singapore? You dont!<br><br>4) Wow, someone say AMERCIANS are bastards. Wow. What's the yellow country who quickly pointed out that they are long-time American allies and will support America in the war? We're hungry capitalist? True.. but you chinks are also TOO.information. Look at chink singaporE! Look at the biased content of the Straits<br><br>5) Well, at least we have CNN, the Onions, Fox, and other news sources for Times. Suppressed fools.<br><br>6) Adrian pang is an exception. But most white girls here who DARED to take on yellow people say they've very very very very SMALL (6cm) dicks.

Haha i never paid any chink girls before. My homies also didnt pay any chink girls for sex. Read my earlier story, they're willing to jump on bed not for money. and many even pester white americans for marriage! JUST LOOK AT THE STREETS OUT THERE. Pls pls acknowledge this point, its too evident, i would say.<br><br>10) Oh yes, we descended from British. Now what's the link? Other than we're doing better than britain now?<br><br>11) oh yes, i heard desperate Chink man in Singapore love to pound some cheap white russian asses for S$100.. isnt it just so fargin ironic?<br><br>12) American girls dont want us? You're getting out of hand... all ur facts are wrong!<br><br>13) and now to Nelstar: Cool you went big apple? Did they get discriminated cuz u're yellow? Pls don't cry!<br><br>14) Oh yes, white 5luts love yellows. My neighbour Mear told me she used to f*ck this yellow man but she's afraid her deep sinking pussy will fracture yer small limp d1ck.<br><br>15) Oh Americans are dumb? Oh ye, but we're highly employed in Singapore. We earn more $$ (much more) though we 'mayb' be dumber than chinks.. haha isnt that funny? and somemore its chinks so employ us.<br><br>16) Yankees?

Well, ok, that means all WAmericans living in Singapore are delusional and funny. I need not stress that our community thinks the same way, do I? Our community is a close-knit one, after getting displaced a world apart, we all think along the same line in this pro-west chinatown you call Singapore.<br><br>Hey, only a small portion suck-up to whites eh?

He knows more than you do, chinkie.<br><br>Expatriates do not live with their family. Of course not! Here are the 2 main reasons (dont dispute them, we're expats. not you chinkie.)<br>a) WAmericans love to find chink mistresses here. So they normally dont bring their family along<br>b) WAmericans DO bring their family here, after all, many Chinaman bosses sponser expats family to come here, living in luxury, while distressed local chinks beg for a job.<br><br>Seriously pal, in whites' eyes, we really despise suck-up countries and people. Malaysia is far more that your chinkiepore.<br><br>Man, can't you just look at all these REAL examples?<br><br>a) Oh, we whites having lotsa fun with chinks at night. My friend once had a threesome, 2 chinks 1 angmoh. And one of the chink is attached to a Chink guy. Well, just some after-work stuffs, perhaps.<br><br>b) Good local examples like Beatrice Chia and some other 'homegrown' local chink actresses who confess 'I never dated a local before'.<br><br>c) Locals having small dicks.<br><br>d) The famour books 'Sarong Party Girls' and 'Hardship postings:' ; hey you mean they print this out of nothing?<br><br>e) MWK, another forum user, agreeing with me that this is the case, though stressing (not the majority).
