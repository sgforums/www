            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys I think I know why mr hump tan ass is getting so pissed..I just read this article on the world economy today guess what, companies in the west are firing their caucasian staff and hiring asian CEOs and workers...even Phillips is planning to retrench thousands of Dutch workers and hiring cheap labour from China. 40% of the world's top companies' CEOs are asian, DHL, Yahoo, BMG, Coca-Cola are all headed by asians. same syndrome in the 80s, us asians go over to America, buy up their companies and land and they bitch about how we're stealing their country and now with red neck bush in the white house they're doing even worse than the 80s...how many US companies are actually US owned? Chrysler? They're owned by a German company. AOL Time Warner? an Arab is the largest shareholder. Microsoft? They depend on Indian labour to survive. Yahoo? Co-founded and owned by a Chinese. Even the US government employs non-whites, Colin Powell? Elaine Chow?  Condoleeza Rice? The thing is all non-whites an the west are allowed to have their own whatever rights groups..black-rights, asian rights, yadayada and white people aren't allowed to have a white rights groups..what do western government label white rights groups as? Nazis/Racists blah blah. Forget it people, he just cant accept the fact that the east will be overshadowing the west in this century. oh well, let him bitch all he wants...in case he accuses us of being un-democratic....talkign about democracy and the straits times, Supremist, do you dare say CNN isn't pro-government? they covered up about the deaths of so many US soldiers in Iraq. You wanna talk about Christianity? The first Christians were Jews, Jesus was Jew, I never heard anything about white people in the Bible. Now to Talking about boring Chinese shows, yea I have to admit that most are boring low budget films with cliche plots. What about Hollywood then? yea big blockbusters...wait..aren't all these big Hollywood hits directed by non-white directors? John Woo? Steven Spielberg(He's Jewish). Who saved America's economy? Alan Greenspan, He's non-white he's Jewish. Not being proud of one's roots? Americans are probably the most jumbled up people in the world,all kinds of blood flow in their veins...French, German, Irish and they can't even speak the language of their ancestors. Supremist, sprechen sie deutsche? parlez vous francias? They don't even make an effort to trace or even know about their roots, talk about not being proud of one's heritage..phhelh...<br><br>Get the message?<br><br>ps to Supremist, Your dad takes home S$9000 a month? sorry man, my dad makes US$36000 a month, paid by an "ang moh" boss. who said asians aren't valued by companies? think expats are wealthy? think again, its all company money. with their salary alone they wouldn't even afford a toyota corola let alone a flat.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's read about the history of the so-called founders of the modern world<br><br><strong>The Western Response </strong><br><br>The foreigners were especially irritated by the high customs duties the Chinese forced them to pay and by the attempts of Chinese authorities to stop the growing import trade in opium. The drug had long been used to stop diarrhea, but in the seventeenth and eighteenth century people in all classes began to use it recreationally. Most opium came from Turkey or India, and in 1800 its import was forbidden by the imperial government. Despite this restriction, the opium trade continued to flourish. Privately owned vessels of many countries, including the United States, made huge profits from the growing number of Chinese addicts. The government in Peking noted that the foreigners seemed intent on dragging down the Chinese through the encouragement of opium addiction.<br><br>[See Opium Factory: The stacking room at an opium factory in Patna, India. Opium smuggling upset the balance of trade and destroyed China's economy.]<br><br>In the meantime, the empire faced other problems. The army became corrupt and the tax farmers defrauded the people. The central bureaucracy declined in efficiency, and the generally weak emperors were unable to meet the challenges of the time. The balance of trade turned against the Chinese in the 1830s, and the British decided to force the issue of increased trade rights. The point of conflict was the opium trade. By the late 1830s more than 30,000 chests, each of which held about 150 pounds of the extract, were being brought in annually by the various foreign powers. Some authorities assert that the trade in opium alone reversed China's formerly favorable balance of trade. In the spring of 1839 Chinese authorities at Canton confiscated and burned the opium. In response, the British occupied positions around Canton.<br><br>In the war that followed, the Chinese could not match the technological and tactical superiority of the British forces. In 1842 China agreed to the provisions of the Treaty of Nanking. Hong Kong was ceded to Great Britain, and other ports, including Canton, were opened to British residence and trade. It would be a mistake to view the conflict between the two countries simply as a matter of drug control; it was instead the acting out of deep cultural conflicts between east and west.<br><br>The French and Americans approached the Chinese after the Nanking Treaty's provisions became known, and in 1844 gained the same trading rights as the British. The advantages granted the three nations by the Chinese set a precedent that would dominate China's relations with the world for the next century. The "most favored nation" treatment came to be extended so far that China's right to rule in its own territory was limited. This began the period referred to by the Chinese as the time of unequal treaties - a time of unprecedented degradation for China. The humiliation the Central Kingdom suffered is still remembered and strongly affects important aspects of its foreign policy. Meanwhile, the opium trade continued to thrive.<br><br>The British and French again defeated China in a second opium war in 1856. By the terms of the Treaty of Tientsin (1858 ) the Chinese opened new ports to trading and allowed foreigners with passports to travel in the interior. Christians gained the right to spread their faith and hold property, thus opening up another means of western penetration. The United States and Russia gained the same privileges in separate treaties.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>A Brief History of Chinese Immigration to America</strong> - part 1<br><br>Today, in considering America's rich immigrant history, and the hundreds of nationalities which have come to the United States to seek a new home, we are keenly aware of the hardship and often rejection faced by newcomers as they attempted to assimilate into American culture. For countless immigrants, the struggle to arrive in America was rivaled only by the struggle to gain acceptance among the population. Yet what if the acceptance you had worked so hard to achieve from your new countrymen was suddenly stripped away leaving only the cold neglect of a nation that had turned its back on your people?<br><br>Unfortunately, this is the true story of one of the United States' largest immigrant groups: the Chinese. For them, what at first appeared to be a welcoming embrace from their new country quickly turned sour amidst a slew of anti-immigration policies enacted in the 1880's. For more than 80 years, American sentiment towards Chinese immigrants remained ambivalent, often appreciative of their contributions towards the nation's growth, but still reluctant to offer them full recognition as U.S. citizens. It wasn't until 1965 that the last of America's restrictions towards Chinese immigration was finally repealed. Today we celebrate the persistence, fortitude, and sacrifice which has symbolized the history of Chinese Americans; and we pay tribute to their accomplishments as a people who continue to create lasting impressions in the development of the United States: our Nation of Immigrants.<br><br>A Welcomed Arrival . . .<br><br>Immigration to the United States from China began primarily in the middle of the 19th Century. As more of the American West was becoming settled, several waves of Chinese immigrants arrived in the country eager to pursue the opportunities awaiting them. For the most part, these immigrants consisted of young male peasants who came in search of economic success. Fueled by news of the California Gold Rush, they arrived in America looking to strike it rich with hopes of being able to send money back to their poor rural homes, or of returning to China in a few years with newly acquired wealth. Unfortunately, this wealth was never realized for most of the newcomers in this early stage of Chinese Immigration. While some toiled as panhandlers looking for the elusive "Gold Mountain" of California, most moved to fill the void of low-paid labor created by America's rapidly expanding industries. Wool mills, as well as shoe, and garment manufacturers were among the most common employers of Chinese immigrants, especially in the West where, by 1880, 25% of California's workforce was of Chinese descent. Some immigrants even started their own factories, profiting from the highly competitive atmosphere.<br><br>Others moved to support the growing need for labor in areas such as mining, land development, and irrigation. In particular, the advanced agricultural knowledge possessed by many of these first immigrants from China was greatly appreciated on the developing farms of the West. Chinese farming techniques along with thousands of migrant agricultural laborers combined to allow the new western states to become more self-sufficient in their food production. Until this point, the American West had been largely dependent upon suppliers in the east.<br><br>In addition to this vital contribution, many scholars now credit Chinese workers with easing tensions in the South following the Civil War. Once free, many former slaves chose to leave the South rather than continue to work on the plantations as paid laborers. By moving to quickly take up the labor shortage caused by this situation, Chinese immigrants not only helped the ailing southern economy to recover, but also reduced some of the backlash against freed slaves.<br><br>Still another crucial American accomplishment that was achieved primarily with the aid of Chinese immigrants was the Transcontinental Railroad. Approximately 15,000 Chinese were hired by Central Pacific Railroad as it stretched into the western frontier. These workers created a vast network of track that opened up untapped resources not only in California but the northwest as well. The path of the railroad also spurred development of the surrounding territory which many immigrants cultivated into profitable farmland.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>A Brief History of Chinese Immigration to America</strong> - part 2<br><br>The Door Is Closed . . .<br><br>However, this acceptance did not last for the Chinese immigrants. Even as they continued to contribute to the country's progress, American sentiment towards the Chinese began to grow more strained. Fear, ignorance, and post-Civil War depression combined to create an isolationist atmosphere and a suddenly hostile home. As the Chinese population in America increased, many of these immigrants came together to form primarily poor Chinatowns in virtually every major US city. These became targets for anti-immigrant protests and riots that often resulted in violence. Chinese immigrants may have been targeted due to the increasing belief that immigrants were occupying too many jobs within the city. Because Chinese Americans were living together in such close-knit communities within these cities, they drew the brunt of the anti-immigration sentiment. Pressure upon these immigrants became so fierce that some chose to leave the country altogether; their American dream had been shattered.<br><br>For those that remained, things began to normalize with time. However, new policies enacted by the government sought to prevent further immigration from China. In 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act based upon the belief that,<br><br>"in the opinion of the Government of the United States the coming of the Chinese laborers to this country endangers the good order of certain localities with the territory thereof . . ."<br>It completely prevented Chinese without family already in the US from entering the country, thus effectively halting all immigration. The law serves as the first in US history to ban a specific racial group from entering America. Only diplomats, merchants, and students were allowed access into the country and Chinese Americans were denied the right to apply for naturalization. To enforce the law, the Angel Island Inspection Station was built in San Francisco in 1910. All Chinese entering the country went through an interrogation session and were then either allowed to enter the country, detained in prison-like barracks, or deported. For 30 years Angel Island processed close to 175,000 Chinese who came to America only to find that the door had been closed on their people.<br><br>Making Policy Match Ideals . . .<br><br>In time, America began to realize that the treatment of Chinese immigrants was contrary to the very foundations of the country. Awareness was raised by the protests and court challenges of Chinese Americans lobbying for their relatives who were still denied admittance. After a fire destroyed it in 1940, Angel Island was never reopened. Finally, in 1943 the Chinese Exclusion Act was repealed allowing immigrants already in the US to bring over family members from China. 1952 saw the passage of the Walter-McCarren Act allowing first-generation Americans to apply for citizenship. Throughout the 60's, Chinese Americans made particular gains into professional arenas: medicine, corporations, and politics. The 1964 Immigration and Nationality Act removed the last barriers to Chinese immigration initiating a new era in the history of America's melting pot.<br><br>A Dream Realized . . .<br><br>Since 1965 Chinese immigrants have entered the United States for a variety of reasons, most of them quite different than during the Gold Rush days of the 1800's. Today many well-educated and highly specialized immigrants come to America seeking jobs in fields that their ancestors never envisioned, including the profitable high-tech and engineering fields to name a few. California continues to serve as the Ellis Island of the Pacific coast, but today it is because more Chinese Americans are hoping to "strike-it-rich" in Silicon Valley instead of on Gold Mountain. Through their contributions, America continues to offer the hope of economic success while remaining at the forefront of scientific and technological advancement.<br><br>For other Chinese immigrants, America serves as a symbol of something higher than monetary prosperity. It represents the hope of freedom from intolerance based upon one's particular views. For this reason, many Chinese immigrants have since sought asylum in the US from the political upheaval and human rights violations prevalent in much of eastern Asia. In the eyes of the early American colonists and the founders of the Constitution, the United States was to represent the ideals of acceptance and tolerance to those of all walks of life. At times, it seemed that America's treatment of the Chinese Immigrant could not have been farther from this vision. Yet today, the ideal lives on, and the Nation forged by the labor of immigrant hands continues to serve as the shelter against the storm, a home where all may speak.<br><br>Chinese Americans have also made an indelible mark upon what can be considered the national "American" culture. Their customs, their food, their dress, their art, and their voices have been added to the Nation of Immigrants to create the unique melting pot experience of the United States. The list of Chinese Americans who have won fame and fortune through individual achievement is almost too great to mention. From Congressman David Wu, to the 1996 Time man of the Year Dr. David Ho, to World renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma, the list goes on and on. Sports and entertainment, computer technology, software, Internet companies, and scholastic research represent only a small sampling of the areas that have thrived as a result of the contributions from Chinese Americans.<br><br>For a country once coined "The Great Experiment," the history of the Chinese immigrant in America serves as a heroic story of perseverance and commitment to a dream. In welcoming newcomers from this unique population, we welcome our role in setting the example for all nations and we continue to uphold the traditions that have enabled us to enjoy progress on so many levels. This year the American Immigration Law Foundation salutes the Chinese immigrant for her courage, fortitude, and faith in the American dream.<br><br></div>
