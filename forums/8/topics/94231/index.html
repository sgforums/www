            <div class='col-md body'>***<br><br>this is a interesting article i wrote. im white american and male. read much about some threads saying 'would u rather be white or others if u were allowed to choose your race'  and i would like to offer my perspective.<br><br>if singapore is really gearing up for democracy, the moderators should let this thread flow and not lock it.<br><br>if you have other friends, send them my article and post ur comments below<br><br>***<br><br>Hello Singapore.<br><br>Actually I aint no outsider here, I lived in good o' Singapore, a rainy, suppressed and colored country for almost 15 years. I was born in Buford, North Dakota. I still remember one incident back 2 years ago when I was talking to this Chinese girl in a MRT train. She asked me where I was from. ' Buford, North Dakota, ' I said, feeling low, embarrassed to recall the poor town I was born. ' Wow, that place must be a great place to live, ' she replied. I was shocked.<br><br>What she and other Singaporeans didnt know is that Buford is almost a ghost-town in North Dakota. People living there straddles the poverty line. Amenities were scarce, internet access was almost unthinkable. But her attitude towards the Western World, especially that of the mighty United States Of Amercia, is often slanted and prejudiced. Most Singaporeans assume Whites are rich, and the Western hemisphere reign over the rest of the colored world.<br><br>I gamely asked her, ' What about Singapore? Isn't it a good place to live? '<br><br>' Hell no. Singapore is so low-class. I prefer the USA '<br><br>' What about China? Isn't that where your ancestors came from? '<br><br>' You must be kidding. I HATE China. '<br><br>Above is only a simple illustration of my point I am going to deliver today, but nonetheless reflective. Frankly, my grandparents were very poor back in Buford, and have to depend on state welfare for a living. My own parents weren't much better. They barely completed high school - My Dad became a Taxi driver and my Mum stayed at home to look after me and my brother. My Dad, the sole breadwinner, barely brings home US$800 a month, and my younger days in Amercian was a slew of horrible domestic fights, smashed bottles and other typical American violence. When I was 8 years old. Things started changing.<br><br>First, at the local church in Buford, one of my Dad's close friends told him of a Chink country in Asia, rich and peaceful, called Singapore. I guess you realise that my terms I use are strongly racist and descriminating - but that's how White Americans behave (of course not infront of colored people but when Whites are talking among themselves).<br><br>My Dad's initial responses were that of a reluctant no. Our foremost fears were that we're of a different race, our family is poor and were afraid to get a headstart. My parents were also only high-school dropouts. We're classical rednecks, is what americans would call.<br><br>But we eventually moved here.<br><br>It was a shift from hell to heaven. Or from trash to gods.<br><br>When we arrived in Singapore, we barely had any friends. I was 10 then. We turned to a local Catholic church. Their members were swarming around us, trying to drive in a good impression on us. They treated us very very well - though my family is poor and lowly educated. My dad eventually got a job in a local company as product supervisior that one of the church members is working in. My Dad's initial pay is around $2200. 3 Years later, my dad was promoted to the title of product manager. He now earns around $9400 every month.<br><br>Our family were surprised at our new-found wealth. More flabbergasted was that now our family has lotsa friends - yellow, browns and indians. Back in Buford, neighbours hardly interact. I had always thought that Singaporeans were very friendly and neighbourly people until I read recently that Singaporeans are becoming more and more cold. But what about my case? As another American kid in my Singapore American School tells me, "it's typical, those chinks and asians love to suck up to us, White Americans.'<br><br>I went into the Singapore American School. Pure white, was what I expected to see of the school population. But there are Chinks inside the school! I asked them why did they want to study here when they have a good education system outside. A typical reply: ' Our parents are afraid that a Singaporean certificate will not be internationally recognised.'<br><br>The word American itself speaks volumes about excellence. American is a posterboy of perfection. Everywhere in Singapore I go, armed with that body of blonde hair and blue eyes with crisp American accent, people treated me warmly. Store keepers, Taxi drivers, stewardess, every every Singaporean I met treated me like god. Not to forget, many Chink girls also fell in love with me.<br><br>I would like to admit that Im a virgin no longer (aint heck a unusual thing back in good ol' USA). Many Singaporean girls are willing to jump on bed with me. I was 16 when I started having sex. I used to have a Chink girl who was 8 years older than me. I also enjoy taking photos of naked chink girls when i went on bed with them. And i circulate them to my american friends.<br><br>I always thought that Chink girls are very conservative. Who knows that everytime i have sex, its mostly the girls' initiatives. Also they always confided their fantasy of marrying me and living in 'pleasant' America, in their words.<br><br>In conclusion, I would like to thank Singapore for being my paradise.<br><br>And Btw, that girl i talked about in the start of my article is a hua chong (issit correct? i dont know chink names) junior college girl, acting demure but actually very slutty inside (as in towards me only and not asian men - beckham say they have small dicks? haha). Cant imagine such high educated girls have such slanted views <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree with meow too.......<br><br>and for your info......one of the reason that teenagers are dyeing their hair blonde is because they want to look different and it is a fashion statement.....<br><br>to think that you said such things about Singapore and its people which gave you and your family a chance. You may still be staying in poverty in your hometown!!<br><br>one traditional chinese value which you definitely do not have is GRATITUDE!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>dear lemonie and meowmeow,<br><br>i have nothing against singapore except that its chinky. what i hate most about singapore is that its people have very serious social identity problems. people i met refused to accept chinese language and other cultural stuffs and loosely labelled such cherishable traits as being 'low-class, crude and gross.' they themselves think they're whites. once i was talking to my friend (a female chink) in marine parade and she told me that, 'Singapore is the USA of the east.' Well, that night i really showed her what USA guys are good at  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>but i do love chink singaporeans girls. really lovely, and as many of my white friends agree, even more willingly to jump on bed than our american swingers back home.<br><br>last time checked out some bars where couples go. saw a lot of chink females + white males. i wonder how asian men think (anyway issit true their dicks are like earthworms! haha)<br><br></div>

(truth is, chinese tourists bring in the most bucks.. correct me if im wrong) bt the idea of white supremancy is simply ridiculous.. talk about socialists crap.<br><br>roughly thats the whole idea..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually when you are on the internet it really open up your eyes. I've met my fair share of dumb Americans which I really place the label 'white trash' or 'red necks' Hell!! Some can't even speak their own language properly!!! Majority know nothing about what is going on around the world.<br><br>Never have I once put down our country. To be honest most I've spoken too have been truely impressed and they are shocked to find out I'm Asian. Reason? They have the idea that Asians can't speak English properly.<br><br>As well, what I can say is that most Americans are not as well-travelled as us and I've known quite a handful who have not even eaten a shrimp/prawn before. So, please don't get the idea that all Asian girls worship you guys. I've my fair share of Canadian and American friends and business partners and none of them have such bigoted views like you do.<br><br>There will always be a small percentage of people who suffer from the 'Colonial Syndrome' and wanna live 'The American Dream'. However, please do not generalise.<br><br></div>
