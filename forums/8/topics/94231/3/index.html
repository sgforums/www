            <div class='col-md body'>Storm, thanks for sharing your life story. very interesting that these get aired out in the open.<br><br>I am Chinese Singaporean and do agree with most of what you said. Some of my best friends are white (US, European, Americans). ALL have well paying jobs in Spore.......and ALL have caught the 'yellow fever'. It is a white man's paradise is SG for the most part.  I agree that being white itself will almost guarantee you WILL get laid after a night out.........with at least an average looking girl. As these are my best friends, I get to read all their emails, SMS's from women and see all the pictures taken during their romps on their mobile phones and I can verify that they are not BS. Most are decent SG women and not outright sluts like you mentioned. Jobs wise, those in Sales seem to have a charmed life. Receptionists never screen their calls since they have a foreign accent, and these lower level people automatically assume that angmo accent=must be someone important. I used to have a white guy working as part of my team (on a local salary level however) and he got allocated all the toughies by me. ALL have turned and have done business with my company as a result of him servicing them. I will hire a white guy again to be part of my team since my guy was poached by the competition, who gave him a 3x salary increment (see, these are the guys who spoil the market). The guy who hired him? A Chinaman  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  who thought he was doing too great job.  And I knew of all the side 'benefits' this guy got on the side from the receptionists of the comapanies he visited........after all his mobile calls were forwarded to me after he left. Many many strange calls from women looking for this guy on a non-work related basis.<br><br>Am I bothered? Not at all. Jealous? Sometimes, that life is so easy for these friends of mine.  But I've learnt to accept a long time ago that life is not fair, and it's what we make out of it that makes the difference. Well, I beat the shit out of some of these white friends of mine on the golf course, so we level in one way or other   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> In any case, I have a lovely family with 2 boys while these guys are squandering their hard-earned money on drinks/ smokes/ hotel bills........ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Some guys just have a charmed life, while others have to work harder. We have to learn to accept these and move on, and build the future we want with our hands and brain.<br><br>However, I have to correct you on one point. These chicks you mentioned are typical victims of stereotypes that white=rich more than anything. Most folks want to have a good life for themselves and their descandants, which is why we have Filipino women working as maids here. Sorry to say this, but given an Andy Lau lookalike or a Brad Pitt lookalike, and all things being equal, I believe it's more likely that most SG girls will go for the Andy Lau lookalike if they are looking for someone to marry.<br><br>I think the truth hurts for most of the forumers who may just be starting out in life and having problem relating to the opposite sex face-to-face; perhaps a little more comfortable spending time in front of a computer? Most of the Singaporean males I meet do have a problem trying to relate to the opposite sex, and it's more of a confidence problem than anything. NS and the Singapore school system has built the Singaporean male into a very subservient creature and that's what killing us.<br><br>Let's face it, such is life. Which is why I guess we have Filipino maids in SG. Let's count our blessings and I'm glad you have a blessed life in SG so far, but don't forget to give thanks to God who provides so abudantly for you <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
