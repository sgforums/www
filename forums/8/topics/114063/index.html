            <div class='col-md body'>She walked into the room and at once knew it was him. Sebastian.. A glass of wine in one hand, his other freely gesturing while he entertained.. she darted behind a passer-by so that she can get in for a closer look. Ah... every morsel of him is still there, fresh on her memory as they are on his face. Will he remember me? she ponder..<br><br>Who could blame him if he didnÂ’t? she had left him fifteen years ago for a ang mo.. she had no choice under the circumstances then.. they had no money Â– and could never make ends meet.. When charles offered her a way out, she took it. she took it unashamedly as she craved to escape the torturous life in singapore.. she went to london and started anew, eventually marrying charles... But she never forgot Sebastian..<br><br>Fifteen long years, she thought of him day and night.. he was very sweet and caring to her, although the path was never easy, they learn so much about life together.. the only occasional luxury outing was picnic on simple bread and butter and tap water, sun bathing in east coast... How could you forget someone easily for whom you would have sacrificed your life?<br><br>But she left him, unashamedly. Had she come to re-claim him? Could Sebastian and charles accept each other? she had no answer.. After all these years of remembering and thinking, she still did not know. And perhaps never would.. charles must have known about Sebastian Â– he knew about her scrapbook.. But he did not question.. Neither did he ask why she had to make this trip to singapore... He understood that she needed to complete this chapter of her life...<br><br>Â“Ladies and gentlemen,Â” the organiser raised his voice. Â“We are very glad to have Mr Sebastian Yap signing his second book, Â‘Streaming OnÂ’. So if you will form a line here, please, Mr Yap will be signing your copy.Â”<br><br>Sebastian took his seat behind the table and immediately a line snaked out in front of him.. she joined the queue, with her well thumbed copy of Â‘Streaming OnÂ’ pressed against her heart.. she peered round to admire Sebastian sitting there, quietly and obediently putting words on paper, just as she had watched him countless times.. The way he held his pen, with his left hand lying awkwardly near, covering the words he had just written.. How many times had he smudged his palm thus? she smiled as tears began to well up.. Love and pride had filled her..<br><br>Then came her turn...<br><br>She slid the open book into his receiving hands.. thinking, should she call out his name, just perhaps this once, this one last time? and promise not to do it ever again.. He probably hates her, and he probably would not recognize her.. Fifteen years is a long time. Would he still remember? Why was she here? This is very silly. What was on her mind? Just to see him? Or was she hoping for more? Would she be happy looking at him from afar, or would she be tempted to reach out for him too?<br><br>Â“For whom should I sign it?Â” Sebastian asked, the very picture of calmness.<br><br>Â“Sorry?Â”<br><br>Â“What name should I put down?Â”<br><br>Â“What? Oh... Mrs Koh.Â”<br><br>He smiled at her sweetly. Then the smile faded as he examined her face.. Had he recognized her? Was he searching the vestige of his memory for the one who had given him up? Would he summon enough anger, even in public, to toss her book to the ground?<br><br>The pregnant pause lasted an eternity. Â“You seem to have read this many times,Â” he said, fingering the dog ears..<br><br>Â“Four,Â” she replied mechanically..<br><br>While he scribbled on the title page, her eyes fell again on his left palm, awkwardly close to the writing hand.. It was smudged with ink from the fountain pen.. How many times had she smacked that very same hand whilst teaching him to write properly? How many times had she kissed it again those very same evenings while he was asleep.. fond memories unfold by itself and she fall into despair...<br><br>Finally, he closed the book and handed it to her with both hands.. she turned away before he could see her tears rolling down.. she dashed through the door before he could get up.. Not that he would be getting up. To him, she was just another reader, another autograph hunter...<br><br>As she sat on the plane back to london, she put the book on her lap.. He had always wanted to write a book and now he had two.. Could he be prouder of it than she of him? she finally mustered enough energy to open the book with her shaking hand, for she wished to touch his handwriting with her wrinkled forefinger. He wrote:<br><br>Â‘Those many picnics by the east coast, all motivation for my dreams.<br>Forever yours, Sebastian.Â’<br><br>A drop of tear fell, smudging Â‘ThoseÂ’...<br><br></div>
