The peasants and commoners do uprisings together with the leaders. Ming dynasty was founded by a peasant called Zhu Yuan Chang. Liu Bang was also of peasant stock but he is known as the founding father of Han. History just repeats itself ...the communist party in the Mao days- peasant stocks because if u have some royal blood....ur prevented from getting into the party.<br><br>Let's not forget Sun Yat Sen....true he didn't invent liberal democracy but he was trying to reform China ...his writings in 1905 - was based on socialism , democracy and nationalism. And the british were still imperialistic at that time like most european nations (except maybe france) .<br><br>Think about how the french became a republic . It was bloody . Peasants and commoners executing the nobility. Of course, napolean bonaparte came along and made it his cosy empire until he got overthrown for another republic again. USA also wrangled it way out of imperialistic British hands by war- deaths of american and british soldiers, then went on to the civil war between the yankees and southerners but it became a democracy after that. Not forgetting the poor native americans and aboriginals who those so called democrats/imperialists were trying to exterminate.<br><br>Liberal democracy was created  out of greek philosophies - and in ancient grecian and roman times democracy will exist for a short period of time before it reverts back to feudal lords and caesars . If you look at all implementations of liberal democracies, it always involved a history of bloodshed.<br><br>Now for opium wars, Victoria's Britain were forcing the chinese to open their markets to opium. You don't see the british selling opium to its own. Opium was banned in britain. Victoria's Britain would have been charged for human rights infringement in these modern days. In fact the british were pretty much trouble makers internationally during the rule of Queen Victoria and after...look at the middle east (screwed up because they wanted to divide and rule), china,even ireland and Australia. Victorian Britain was busy dumping convicts on australia and exterminating aboriginals. I vote the British as the International Troublemakers of the 19th and 20th century.<br><br>China didn't have time in those days to go inventing airplanes....the chinese were too busy  struggling for survival . The Europeans were busy cutting her up while the Japanese were busy invading her and the useless manchurians were busy ceding terrirtories.<br><br>You can think how great the european history is  but I still like being a descendent of the ancient chinese .  Even the great French General and Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte respected China for its potential prowess , once quoted " ' China! There lies a sleeping giant.Â  Let him sleep on.Â  When he awakes he will shake the world.'<br><br>face the facts remain, Chinese and Indian cultures are 10,000 years old , great and ancient compared to most european history. <strong> So no biggie about european and american history - it's overhyped and the reason why we ,asians, are learning about them is because the westerners were busy articulating how much they are better  </strong></div>
