              <p>Hmm... I thought of that but what can they do? Unless it is true that  circuit breaker can trip due to lightning which striked
                                              the building thus causing a surge in the wiring (I read it on the net, anyone expert in this?) and the lightning rods is indeed faulty but I have no way to prove that it is faulty.</p>
              <p>It can also be other reasons why it is always my house's circuit breaker that kena tripped which I have no idea what can be the other cause currently. What I can do now is to suck thumb and wait for the ligtning strikes to be over before I can reset my circuit breaker.</p>

              <p>So your building must be damn lucky to get struck all the time there is lightning right? Geez.</p>
              <p>The most likely problem is your Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker being more sensitive, probably from wear and tear. Replace it with a new one of another brand should do the trick. Get an electrician to do it, its not that expensive, should be less than 40 bucks.</p>

              <p>When I moved into my resale flat about 2 years back, it was already close to 20 years old, and same like you, power tripped during lightning storms also. Until one fine day, dad got the electrician to replace it, and no more such thing.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, should ask a qualified electrician to check your box for any fault.</p>
              <p>Also call up TC and ask them to check too.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I would assume that it is the ELCB that trip. But even it is the MCB, get it replace. It's not expensive if you know how but may have to pay a little more if you get an electrician to do it.</p>
              <p>It is very unlikely to be the lightning conductor but it ever happened when the DB/ Fire Alarm Panel was place directly on the opposite wall.</p>

              <p>I would assume that it is the ELCB that trip. But even it is the MCB, get it replace. It's not expensive if you know how but may have to pay a little more if you get an electrician to do it.</p>
              <p>It is very unlikely to be the lightning conductor but it ever happened when the DB/ Fire Alarm Panel was place directly on the opposite wall.</p>

              <p>Circuit breaker in my home always get tripped everytime lightning strike during raining day. Wonder anyone in the same plight as me?</p>
              <p>There is nothing I can do but wait for the lightning to stop striking everytime during raining day if not the curcuit breaker will just keep tripping thus no point resetting it.</p>
              <p>I see other people home (e.g. my neighbour) still have their power on even when lightning strike. Any reason why its always my home that kena blackout?</p>
              <p>What's up with the lightning rods on top of my hdb flat anyway? I read that circuit breaker can trip due to lightning which striked the building thus causing a surge in the wiring.</p>
              <p>Apparently, the lightning rods on top of my hdb flat is not doing it's job well in attracting the lightning to strike it.</p>
