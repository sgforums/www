            <div class='col-md body'>7When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison<br>8and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth -Gog and Magog - to gather them for battle. In number they are like the sand on the seashore.<br>9They marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of God's people, the city he loves. But fire came down from heaven and devoured them.<br>10And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever.<br>11Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. Earth and sky fled from his presence and there was no place fo rthem.<br>12And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books.<br>13The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was judged accoring to what he had done.<br>14Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death.<br>15If anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.</div>
