Its easier as well, for a young impulsive single individual, who have nothing much to loose, to start the 'rebellion action uproar' than a middle aged man, with the concern of losing his job, and his stable income to keep his family, house and car going.<br><br>In a way, its good to complain and let the load off your chest rather then build it up deep within, and let it out with a weilding chopper one day.</div>
