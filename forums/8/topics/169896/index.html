I think there are a lot of ppl out there who just whine abt anything and everything. I must admit, that I myself am guilty of that. It's like you know there is some disparity or unfairness in a particular issue, but you know that there is really little you can do. So, the only avenue for resentment is to whine and pick on the little things that you know you'll not suffer any recriminations from. A good example is the situation in your school. People are unhappy, fees are rising. But u question yourself how many ppl are willing to stand up for it? The answers are pretty obvious. So, why should I get myself into it then?

So, the only avenue for resentment is to whine and pick on the little things that you know you'll not suffer any recriminations from. A good example is the situation in your school. People are unhappy, fees are rising. But u question yourself how many ppl are willing to stand up for it? The answers are pretty obvious. So, why should I get myself into it then? Thus, at the end of the day, ppl will just accept it.  </div></blockquote>hmm.i dont agree.<br><br>in most places like hongkong, taiwan, korea..etc(just name few asia country), they have leader to lead them to voice out their disparity.<br><br>as for in singapore when something happen...we will 1st wait for a hopeful hero to lead them..but when someone really stand up, we clap hand and walk away. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> and make the kuando hero malu. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
