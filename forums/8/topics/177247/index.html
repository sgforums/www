            <div class='col-md body'>Nowadays, somewhere at Yew Tee Industrial Estate, I noticed that there are plenty of illegal cigarette peddlers around the area.

Some toss bags of cigarettes on the road.<br><br>It was the start of the work day for contraband cigarette peddlers who have been regulars in that area.<br><br>For them, this was the perfect time to make a killing as dozens of workers left their workplaces to the bus-stops and carpark.<br><br><strong>LAY IN WAIT</strong><br><br>They stood in broad daylight, flashing their illegal wares, in full view of passing traffic along Woodlands Road.<br><br>Little did they know that it would be the end of the line for their business as the police and customs officials lay in wait.<br><br>As cigarettes changed hands for cash, the authorities struck.<br><br>About 30 to 40 of them swooped down on the illegal dealers who were still in the midst of their transactions.<br><br>They were caught by surprise. They had nowhere to hide.<br><br>They tried to run or blend in with the rest of the workers. Some even flung their plastic bags of wares on the street.<br><br>But they were too slow as the authorities could tell them apart from the rest of the other stunned eye-witnesses.<br><br>Mr Gopinathan, who was buying groceries at a provision shop nearby, said he thought a fight had broken out at first.<br><br>Said the Indian foreign worker who is in his 20s: 'I heard shouting and then we saw people dressed like construction workers chasing other construction workers.'<br><br>Three Indonesians selling unpaid-duty cigarettes were arrested in the raid, said spokesmen from the police and Singapore Customs.<br><br>Another man, an Indian national, was arrested for buying one packet. He was fined $100.<br><br>He, along with the three dealers, were detained, handcuffed and taken away in a white van.<br><br>A total of 175 packets of unpaid-duty cigarettes were seized, worth a market value of $1,925.<br><br>The duty and GST on these cigarettes amounted to $1,311.<br><br>The cigarettes were sold for between $5 and $5.50 per packet. Normally, one packet costs between $8.50 and $11.<br><br>The New Paper was at the scene about 15 minutes after the raid started.<br><br>As the police checked the illegal dealers' belongings and goods, the dealers appeared subdued and frightened, keeping their heads bowed throughout.<br><br>Officers also combed the nearby wooded area.<br><br>Armed with 1m-long canes, they beat about the undergrowth for hidden packets of cigarettes.<br><br>The grassy patch in the industrial estate was littered with empty cigarette carton boxes and plastic bags.<br><br>By then, the traffic along Woodlands Road - between Stagmont Ring Road and Yew Industrial Estate - had slowed to a crawl.<br><br>The police also blocked the entry into the industrial estate. None of the illegal dealers escaped arrest.<br><br>One motorcyclist thought a VIP motorcade was the cause of the traffic slow-down.<br><br>The commotion also attracted passers-by as they craned their heads from buses and from across the street for a closer look.<br><br>The raid involved officers from the police and Singapore Customs.<br><br>They arrived in lorries and cars a few hours before the raid, disguised as factory workers. Some were even dressed as joggers.<br><br>One factory worker, who declined to be named, said that normally he would buy a packet from the illegal peddlers on his way home.<br><br>'Luckily, I didn't buy today,' he muttered before hurrying away.<br><br>The New Paper had reported on the activities of these illegal dealers last year.<br><br>Of late, they have been targeting students in the vicinity, resulting in some school principals keeping watch to stop their students from buying the cigarettes.<br><br>The place has also been raided several times.<br><br>Despite this, shopkeepers in the area predict that that the illegal dealers will return in full force.<br><br>Said one: 'After a raid, it's all quiet for a while because they are scared. But you'll see... they will always come back.<br><br>'During the recent Chinese New Year holidays, they got even bolder. They would walk across the main road and try to flag down buyers in cars.'<br><br>The shopkeepers also admitted that they are losing out to them, but didn't want to reveal the extent of their losses.<br><br>The three men arrested for selling the cigarettes were charged in court on Saturday.<br><br>If convicted, they could be fined up to 20 times the amount of tax evaded or jailed, or both.<br><br>(Source: The New Paper, 6/2/06)</div>
