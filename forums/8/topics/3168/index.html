What you suffering now is 1/2 3 yrs ago which was many time less at ur fathers time.<br>I feel officer today are too soft, I rem my sgt said the best welfare is tough trainning. which is true if there is war or tough times.<br>About the job, well we are the people taking the heat. While we writing reports, the men taking off(s). So issit true officer have better life. We do a lot of unseen jobs, secondary appointments.<br>As for pay, which is the cause of many unpleasent discussion among many officer. I am from poly, but my batch who sign on as specialist earn more then me by $200-$300 more. Even those under trainning is earning more. No where else in the world you can find a superviser earning less then the men.<br><br>SO mabe you should see the whole picture.<br><br></div>
