            <div class='col-md body'>Recently, had heard from a friend of mine something ridiculous that actually happened at her workplace.<br><br>There was a male colleague who joined her department few months back...<br><br>My friend and him clicked on rather well and chatted a lot about anything under the sun.<br><br>However, a female colleage (Mother of Two) was actually jealous that my friend and that male colleague clicked on rather well..... (Dunno whether becos' she married an old hubby or her r/s was somehow on the rocks)<br><br>This "Evil" auntie began to back stab my friend. She spoke bad things about my friend in front of the guy (Put words in her mouth).<br><br>The guy asked my friend and she said nothing of that sort. Why would my friend wanna speak bad things about someone whom she can get along with as a friend? In the end, the guy started to be closer to that  "Evil" auntie and stayed at a distance from my friend.<br><br>This kind of guy really dunno how to differentiate between the "saint" and the "devil"...<br><br>This spelt the end of their friendship... My friend was rather down that this actually happened... However, I told her not to be down.<br><br>In fact, I felt happy for her that she had seen the true colours of that guy, being so easily swayed by some devils.............<br><br>Not worth to have such a friend...
