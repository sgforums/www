            <div class='col-md body'>...by the flickering candle-light, the three little pigs were in deep thought.<br><br>"The wolf is approaching fast. Our booby traps will not hold him for much longer. We need to build fortifications and we need them NOW."<br><br>"If we want haste, then we should build houses out of straw. I can gather the materials in one day and finish assembly by the next."<br><br>"No, straw will not hold. We should build houses out of sticks. It will take a few days to gather these from the woods and a few more to put them together. But it should be able to resist wolf attacks much better."<br><br>"My brothers, you underestimate the strength of a wolf! We need a house of bricks. True, it will take a week to prepare the materials and another week for construction, but it is the ultimate defence against wolves and all other predators."<br><br>"To increase our chances of survival, let's build our houses differently. Speed or strength... we can't have both."<br><br>The three little pigs started building feverishly, but the wolf was nearly there.<br><br>On the third day, the wolf arrived at the door of the first little pig. The straw house was built in two days, and the pig had spent a day resting.<br><br>"Little pig, little pig, let me in."<br><br>"Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin!"<br><br>"Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll ram your house down!"<br><br>The house of straw finally fell, but the pig was energetic enough to escape with some injuries.<br><br>On the sixth day, the wolf arrived at the door of the second little pig. The stick house was just completed and the pig was tired.<br><br>"Little pig, little pig, let me in."<br><br>"Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin!"<br><br>"Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll ram your house down!"<br><br>The house of sticks lasted longer, but in time, it fell too.  Luckily the wolf was worn out by the repeated ramming and couldn't catch the escaping pig, who escaped with minor injuries.<br><br>On the nineth day, the wolf arrived at the door of the third little pig. The brick house wasn't due for completion until five days later. The pig was still building desperately and was caught completely by surprise.<br><br>"Little pig, little pig, let me in."<br><br>"Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin!"<br><br>"Then I'll huff and I'll puff... and oh look there's a hole in your construction"<br><br>So the wolf sneaked in to find a frightened and completely exhausted pig inside.<br><br>And ate him up.<br><br>******<br><br>If you like this type of stories, read more of these at<br><br><a href="http://realparables.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://realparables.blogspot.com</a><br><br></div>
