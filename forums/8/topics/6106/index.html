            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... does that mean that the guy feel he has no feelings for u anymore coz u kept going out with other guys? If it is, then u shld change this side of u if u wan him back!<br><br>If its due to other reason, then if u really like him, wait for him to change his mind again. This may take time (I took &gt;3 yrs!), so dun do it unless u really really llike him ok?<br><br>Since there are other guys ard, u and u are still so young, why not juz let go, treat everyone as a fren and look ard somemore. come on!

            <div class='col-md body'>LOL. When I read this, it reminds of an almost exact same scenario, only at that point in time, I was like, 4 years younger than the 2 main characters.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Only, in my case, it was a really classic tragedy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>But anyway......<br><br>IMO, if its <strong>THAT</strong> urgent, I would suggest the girl come right up to the guy, and tell him straight in the face that she likes him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> If we're talking about the typical guy, being subtle almost never works. (or maybe it applies to me only....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> *Shrug*)<br><br>Now, once the girl has done that, she would probably have the guy's absolute attention for the next 2 to 3 days, during which she can make her move to erm.... endear herself further to him, or to give up even trying. I mean, 2 to 3 days is a pretty "safe" period of decision.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>He'll probably be thinking stuff like "Oh my gosh !!! She likes me !!! She told me straight in the face !!! What does she like in me ??? Am I being lead on the string like a puppy again ? Am I being set up ? Waitamin... what if she <strong>REALLY</strong> likes me this time ? No way... she broke my heart so many times, this can't be real.... But just what <strong>IF</strong> this time is real, and wouldn't I be a sucker if I don't try it out ? But I would really be one if its a hoax again...."<br><br>Basically, the guy would be in knots asking himself questions and such, trying to figure out what he did right/wrong.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> When he's still trying to figure it out, the girl should (ideally) probably go all out, and tell him that she wants him to be her bf and stuff.<br><br>Drop all that, guys should do the asking, reputation, and face stuff. In love and war, it depends on whose faster, and gets the objective first. Think of it as a strategy plan. Emphasize this to your friend. The only thing that would make all this fail, is when the guy has <strong>TOTALLY</strong> given up any hope of even having a relationship with the girl, and is totally convinced that he's gonna be played for a fool again.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> (If that's the case, just have her tell him to give it a try, and if he isn't convinced by then, fine, go ahead, leave. Both of you would be better off.)<br><br>Erm.... one thing. I hope your friend isn't going to use such tactics to lead the guy on again. I wouldn't wish what I went thru on anyone.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>"A Gentleman is not an implement."<br>-Confucius, Analects, 2:12</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>To me the secret would be to remind him of the past and the times he has had when he fell in love with the girl. I dunno how true this is for other guys .. but for me .. once I have liked the girl before .. there is always a kinda feeling for her .. no matter wat.. and reminding him of the past .. as in sweet memmories .. is probably a man's weakest point. Guys tend to think of the past alot .. Of course you gotta remind him of the good memmories .. dun even go into the bad ones .. guys are emotional creatures too !<br><br>------------------<br>ZeroS</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with the straight in his face strategy......whoa that would definitely get my attention!<br><br>If the gal follows it up with 2-3 days of all out attack, I think my knees would buckle, and I wouldn't even care about her leading me on......If she wants me that bad I'd just jump in and ask questions later!!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Incidently for the gals out there......the all out attack is INCREDIBLY attractive to some guys like me.......<br><br>I mean if even if I have only some attraction for her that approach would really get in deep.........<br><br>Oh man I guess I juz like unconventional gals.</div>
