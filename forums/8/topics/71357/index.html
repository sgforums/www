There is what you can tax loop holes which are legal. Besides, I meant 'hiding' by not being known as being a billionaire to the public eye. There are some people in Singapore ie like Ong Beng Seng and Quek Leng Beng who love the lime light and being under the spotlight, while others like Henry Ng and other names you have never heard of but they're billionaires in Singapore.<br><br>Actually, most billionaires when questioned are'nt satisfied with what they have... ie they want more... its endless...<br><br>If you put US$5million in a 30year US T-Bond earning 5% interest (which is quite low given the duration), you will earn $250,000 a year in interest. Will you be satisfied with that? Tons of people, would'nt and want more and more and more... greed the root of all evil... Instead, they will try ways to invest it and put more risk to garner more and more money... some risk losing all of it and end up bankrupt...<br><br>I find Singaporeans are getting too greedy, want more but want to work less... so demanding, so impatient... just last week i went to the hospital and this indian woman cut the queue(it was a queue for sars checking) and the chinese woman threw a barrage of lewd remarks, but the indian woman wanted to see her child who was dying already in the ward...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">If people have to hide their fortune, that also means that they cannot directly own/invest in public company, they need to go through the private ones</span>.</strong><br><br>The accounting loop hole here can be using a pte ltd company and using that company as an investment holding ie it does your stock trading and property investments. To make it more unknown, people usually setup a company in Bermuda or the virgin islands, which then setup a company in Singapore. Thus, to trace back who the owner is will be harder. The advantage is that you get tax benefits(tax less earn more...). As a singaporean, you just cannot remit funds back to sg because those funds can be taxable on return as the IRA will do a search and question whether the funds are legit. However, thats another loop hole to passby... more complicated.<br></blockquote></div>
