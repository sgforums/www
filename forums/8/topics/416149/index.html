              <p>To those who think Singaporeans are poorly mannered (well, SIngaporeans are, but...), have a read of this excerpt of the first two paragraphs from this article from The Economist Nov 20 2010:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Friends and neighbours.<br>-----------------------</p>
              <p>Walk into the inn in the Hokkiado village of Akanko, and everything from the welcomeing cry of "irasshaimase" to the taciturn old man grilling chicken on the fire seems quintessentially Japanese. Until, that is, you hear all the customers speaking Mandarin. The Chinese have flocked to this area since it provided some of the settings for a 2008 Chinese blockbuster comedy, "If You are the One".</p>
              <p>The local Japanese were shocked when the early arrivals used the onsen, or spas, to do the unthinkable: they washed their clothes in the hot tubs. There is still some tut-tutting about Chinese customs- the elbows on the table, the lack of familiarity with flushing loos- but if not for these visitors, the tourist trade in the area would be half dead.</p>

              <p>no wonder people like you smell cheena army like perfume fart. you can have all the army hardware but with no true combat experience cheena is good as sitting ducks. now got show to see cheena putting NK in front and US bcking SK behind. the war must be cheena instaiagte 1</p>

              <p>Anyway, in Singapore, we can be pretty unique in some sense. Culture differs from country to country so who's to judge?</p>
