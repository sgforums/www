Essentially, these people were standing on the teacher's side.<br><br>Then we had the student welfare committee. These guys were well loved obviously for their job is to plan parties, excursions and most importly, they fight for longer breaks, extra sporting facilities.

            <div class='col-md body'>Absolutely. But sadly, people 3 times as old as you and I, wise and where we put into their hands our future,  fails, or I would say refuse to see this. Now Johnny is doing an extremely well as a counsel but biting and chewing us up as chairman of welfare.<br><br>But who else can we blame other than ourselves. For when we had a chance to choose our chairmans, it was us the students who elected Johnny.</div>
