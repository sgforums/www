              hi, I would like to find out if you guys gets calls from financial planners often. I keep getting call from one of the subsidiary of ocbc. I didn't really grab the name but the number was 65910723. I also got call from different extensions such as 65917030 and a few others. 
              
              they called me with intervals of weeks and even month. can this be classified as harassment as I already express my disinterest in their product. it seems my number is being recirculated around in their data base and I am so sick of receiving their call in the middle of work. 
              
              does anyone knows what I can do? is there anything legal actions which I can take?

              <p>I just received a call yesterday. My phone is a little soft, so I can't hear what that guy was mumbling. I just hear the words bank, etc.</p>
              <p>Normally I try to be polite and don't put down the phone down immediately. Afterall, they are doing a job. So I told him I'm not interested, which in most cases, the other party would say thank you and put down the phone. Instead, he acted as if there was no reply, and continuing mumbling at his side. I wonder how he is going to close any sale with cold calls with his monotonus and unenergetic mumblings.</p>
              <p>I have no choice but to just cancel call to cut him off.</p>

              <p>I'll usually say no, but some people dun take no for an answer and they will ask why, try to keep on persuading u... For these cases, I'll just end the call...</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Well, there are actions to implement a new Act to deter this type of calls... Heard there's a quite a hefty fine but it shld take quite awhile before the Act gets implemented...</p>

              ya loh. I understand they are doing their job. I usually will let them talk for a while before indicating my strong disinterest. something like yrs loh. I told him I bz, would like to receive email instead. then he spend the next few min explaining why he cannot email and should meet up. 
              
              the worst is those who reply rudely when they realize its an dead end. I've just collate my call history. it seems they have call me 4 times!
