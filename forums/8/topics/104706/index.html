            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="color: red;">WHY MUST BE PAY TV LICENSES FOR SHOWS AND MOVIES THAT SUCKS!<br>ALMOST 500,000 tv subscribers pay $100 a year! that means 50 million a year and not including advertisements!<br><br>BE LIKE SYDNEY COMMUTERS! REFUSE TO PAY FOR TV LICENSES TIL the standard of dramas IMPROVE</span>!!!!</span><br><br>1. Why aren't they like those american dramas?<br><br>Those american dramas have gun fire, police chase, fighting with cops<br>with a standard "handgun" , we also rarely get to see snipers..<br><br>I REALLY NEED to SEE a MOVIE in which a singapore building gets raided by<br>police..Seriously,i really wanna root for the underdogs which has been losing in dramas..<br><br>Last time, i saw a movie in which a battle between a royal family and the USA threatens to become a war...until diplomats intervened..<br><br>And we could see those "real battleships and F-14 , F-18 taking off from aircraft carriers"<br><br>in Singapore Navy show, we see a navy ship firing off a missile at a sampan...<br>wad kind of sai is that?<br><br>at least fake a navy ship challenging another navy ship..and swat team lar!<br><br>Another example is that a show, could also portray a battle between secret agents like those Jang Dong Gun style..swat team and everyone..<br><br>Seems like all the police man in "Singapore" only uses handgun<br><br>and all the policeman in singapore "wins" at the end of the day!<br><br>bull shlt!<br><br>i hate seeing stories in which "policeman" wins all the day..<br><br>man , it seriously stirs up my stomach..<br><br>3. Why is Singapore shows can't even fight Malcolm in the middle or Simpsons?<br><br>Malcolm in the middle is a funny comedy..everytime i watch it...i feel very<br>"elated" and i just love to watch the simpsons doing their funny antics..<br><br>In singapore? always the same love shlt and whole family do things and business and stuff...<br><br>PLEASE...in singapore doesn't mean the story MUST be about life in singapore!<br><br>Suggestions for new drama..<br><br>1. A loving dad could actually pretend to someone who is a international terrorist in disguise...with a cache of AK-47, bazooka in his own backyard..<br>While he is a loving father..he also uses the internet..and he happens to fall in love with a women who is a CT...and sparks flew..and 1 day..<br><br>The leader of the terrorists organisation has to confront..the gal whom he fell for....And the story could be like "Will Love overcome everything??"<br><br>2. Bringing foreign actors COULD help if your own actors is good..<br><br>3. Im going to write new scripts..to send into mediacorp..<br><br>4. Looking at singapore drama makes me reminded of my daily life..<br><br>Singapore seriously needs more reality TV after eye for a guy...<br><br>5. Or we can create a future scenario..or whatever...<br><br>10 THINGS ive learned from MediaCorp..<br><br>1. Police never dies, Criminal dies<br><br>2. Police only uses japanese cars on TV..<br><br>3. Police only uses hand guns<br><br>4. Terrorists are dumb and they lose out<br><br>5. If a police gets injured and lie on a floor, he will definitely get a ambulance to come over..<br><br>6. It's always police chase theif and not the other way around<br><br>7. The police himself will always face love problems.<br><br>8. He will be the hero , Enemies willl always become lovers like on all dramas on Channel 8..<br><br>And btw, why can't the media corp make a movie about a terrorist getting hold of a tank and fires it onto a building?<br><br>Why must it be about family? Money no enuf, 12 storys , all jack neo shows..<br>haiz..<br><br>Even the submarine navy shows, supposing to be exciting..becomes boring..<br><br>Y? no torpedos fired...everything peace and everyone lives happily ever AFTER..<br><br>no gory shows, no sex , no nothing..<br><br>Why can't we have a enemy taking control of a own home fighter jets and attack ourselves?<br><br>[/code]</div>
