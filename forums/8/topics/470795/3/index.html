              <p><br>Out-of-School Activities<br>• Parental consent is required for all activities conducted outside<br>school hours. If a student is absent on the day of the activity, no refund<br>will be given to payment made (unless otherwise stated).<br>Behaviour Outside School Premises<br>• While in uniform, students are not allowed to loiter or gather in<br>public areas before and after school hours. Public areas include HDB<br>void decks and shopping malls.<br>• Students are expected to go home immediately after dismissal.</p>

              <p>Items That Must Not Be Brought To School<br>Students are not allowed to bring items that are:<br>• dangerous and/or harmful<br>• unedifying or corrupting<br>• of high cost and/or or valuable<br>• disruptive to teaching and learning</p>
              <p><br>*Parents are to seek form teacher’s permission if there is a need for<br>their child bring a mobile phone to school.</p>
              <p><br>While the school has in place some safety measures, students are<br>expected to exercise self-responsibility for their own belonging. The<br>school is not responsible for the loss of student’s items if he /she has<br>been negligent in taking care of his/her own belonging.<br>Thus, students are strongly advised not to bring expensive or valuable<br>items to school.</p>
              <p>A whole-school approach is adopted in the management of student<br>discipline.The focus is on students to reflect on the offences and<br>mistakes made and learn from the experiences. Students are made to<br>reflect on their involvement in the offences committed and parental<br>involvement is sought to work together to address the matter.</p>
              <p>In the interest of your children, assistance is sought from all parents<br>to work with the school to ensure that they carry school bags of<br>appropriate weight.</p>
              <p><br>Here are some guidelines for consideration:</p>
              <p><br>Items not to be brought to school<br>1. Electronic devices: radios, cassette tape players, compact disc<br>players, hand-held games, electronic/video games, pagers and<br>cellular phones, etc<br>2. Chewing gum<br>3. Weapons: real or toys such as pen knives<br>4. Card games of any kind<br>5. Any other item; that would disrupt the learning process<br>6. School bag with rollers for the safety of all students.</p>
              <p><br>Buy bags made of lightweight material which have as few compartments<br>as possible. lf possible, the straps could be adjustable and come with<br>cushions. The design and length of the strap will prevent the students<br>from hunching.</p>
              <p><br>Supervise children when they pack their bags to ensure that they pack<br>according to the timetable and avoid bringing unnecessary items to<br>school such as cards, heavy toys, metal rulers and big umbrellas. If<br>coloured pencils are needed, they should only bring a 12-pack coloured<br>pencil box, not a 36-pack. A pencil case should be confined to one with<br>space only for essentials.</p>
              <p><br>Check that only the relevant workbook (eg. Workbook A or B) for a<br>subject is packed, not both.</p>
              <p><br>Avoid carrying large drink bottles, unless it is absolutely necessary,<br>such as in cases of students with health problems. Fill the drink bottles<br>in school, as the school is equipped with water coolers.<br>The following maximum weight of each school bag and its contents<br>should be observed for the different levels:<br>P1 : Not more than 3.0kg<br>P2 : Not more than 3.5kg<br>P3 : Not more than 4.5kg<br>P4 : Not more than 4.5kg</p>
              <p>Responsible Ownership</p>
              <p><br>Parents should help to ensure that children’s belongings (such as school<br>bag, uniform, jacket, water bottle, food container and books) have their<br>names and classes written or pasted on them. In this way, if things are<br>misplaced, the rightful owners can be easily traced.<br>It would also be helpful to remind children not to leave their belongings<br>lying around. Children can be taught to keep things in their proper places.<br>Valuables<br>Students are not allowed to wear jewellery (eg. chain, bracelet, ring)<br>or other valuables to school. Wrist watches should be kept simple with<br>basic functions.</p>
              <p><br>Pocket Money<br>Food prices in the canteen are kept low because of the low rental for<br>stalls. A bowl of noodles, mee rebus, mee siam or lontong costs 60 cents.<br>Drinks are sold at prices ranging from 30 cents (glass) to 50 cents<br>(packet).<br>Children may get free cold water from the water coolers.<br>Parents are advised to give only a reasonable amount as pocket money.</p>
