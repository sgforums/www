              <p>Someone mass mailed me this blog entry to me which is on blogspot but does not have an address. Anyone has any information on the below blog "characters"?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>_________________________________________________________</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Sunday, 6th July 08 Yesterday, we brought Kylie out shopping. She needed this badly, someone to keep her company. The break up has been quite a blow to her, no one to turn too. Thank God, she has my wife as friend. Initially, when Aggie told me about this colleague, I was like, okay. But when I first met Kylie, I got interested to know more about her. Reason, I want to know how come a pretty face like her will get dumped.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yesterday is only the third time I met Kylie. I still think she is a stunner, good looking and has a figure like Aggie. The stupid boyfriend (ex) of hers is either crazy or is there more to it? Anyway, my job is to just drive them around today and maybe cheer Kylie up with my lame jokes LOL.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Picked her up at her apartment near Queenstown, nice area. Once in the car, I was quick to loosen things up by asking her about her apartment and stuffs. I ended up talking more than Aggie to her. I think Kylie is very sweet. Aggie just sat there and glad that Kylie enjoyed the small talks. We had lunch at Ridout MacDonlads tea garden, and I believe Kylie enjoyed our company. She was very open and was able to just share as we go along. Kylie asked me many questions about me and my work and seems impressed with me. I think Kylie and I have a very good vibe. I even told Aggie, “I like your friend Kylie, she is very sweet and I think we should spend more time with her to keep her mind off things”. My wife agrees and was even suggesting on the next outing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For a while, I can’t help but to keep stealing a few peek at Kylie from time to time. Thinking how sweet a 20 plus year old lady she is, young with a bright career ahead. Mostly importantly of all, I thought it is nice to have someone looking up to you that way. Some lustful thoughts about this young colleague Kylie, but I know Aggie is the love of my life and we are happily married. Moreover, she is Aggie’s friend. It would be crazy. I pushed it off as a fantasy that we all have sometimes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our plan for the day would be catching a movie (Wanted) and do some shopping in town. Park the car at 8th Floor of Shaw Centre and we chat our way happily to the ticketing booth only to get some lousy seats. The movie was okay for me and didn’t think the girls enjoyed the movie at all. All they care about was some real shopping.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I basically spent my next 2 to 3 hours walking around aimlessly while the girls go spend some serious money. When they left, I followed them all the way to Taka. All these time, I was looking at Kylie from the back, looking at the hour glass figure and slim long legs which earlier attracted me to Aggie when I first met her. Still on the fantasy and I can’t help but to feel guilty towards my near perfect relationship with Aggie. We are barely 6 months into our marriage. Well, from my earlier entries, you know I do sometimes have some temptation but never do anything about it. Anyway, I don’t think I ever have the guts to do something like that. And definitely not to my wife’s friend. It’s wrong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At 7pm, we were supposed to meet at Far East Plaza for dinner. Aggie and Kylie did not arrive until 8pm!!! It was late and we were scouting around for a dinner place. We ended up back in the car, along the Katong road near our place. We thought some local road side food is a good idea as Kylie hardly gets to eat them anyway.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She tried the so called original famous katong laksa for the first time. She must have really like it cos she said she never really like laska before. She asked if she can have it the next time again. We chat over late dinner. Very soon, it was 10:30pm. I cannot believe what I asked next. I simply asked Aggie without thinking, “do you think Kylie wants to stay over since it’s late?” Where am I going to sleep then? In no time, I realized Kylie is in the shower.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It’s nice to have a guest staying over though, preparing and something we never done before seems fun. Even more so (to me), when it is a sweet and good looking lady. Aggie has passed Kylie some t-shirts and shorts to choose from. Anyway, out from the shower, Kylie was obviously braless in a loose white t-shirt. All I can imagine was, this is the same white t-shirt Aggie wore at times we make love.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As Aggie head for the shower, Kylie make her “first move” which I thought was quite obvious or you can say I was being too sensitive. I have offered Kylie to sleep on our bed while I will hit the floor, Kylie told me it’s fine, I can sleep on the bed too, she then said Aggie can be in the middle. I was shocked but kept quiet. Aggie would not have allowed this anyway. I didn’t dare to look at her, though I can see her smiling at me from the corner of my eyes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The girls were chatting on the bed and very soon I felt asleep on the floor in the <strong><strong>SAME ROOM</strong> </strong>with my wife and her lady colleague.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When I woke up in the morning, I found myself hugging my wife on her left while Kylie is on the other side of the bed. I must have come up to the bed like what I would have normally done when I am on the floor. Aggie woke up soon. She somehow managed to get out of bed without making a lot of noise, at the same time, she gave me a kiss and whispered to me to continue sleeping.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At this moment, I felt very weird yet excited. I am on the bed of my wife and I with another woman. My eyes were opened and looking right over at Kylie’s face. My heart was beating very fast but my breath was quiet. I questioned myself if this was a dream. All of a suddenly, Kylie opened her eyes and looking right into me. I apologized and quickly said softly, I just came up and Aggie is in the toilet. She didn’t say a word but smiled and rub the back of her right hand on my face. Sensing Aggie will be out of the toilet anytime, I quickly got out of the bed. Kylie eyes are shut as though nothing happened.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Here I am blogging while the two girls went to East Coast for breakfast, still pondering over what actually happened"</p>
