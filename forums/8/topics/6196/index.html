I'm able to travel, setup new structure for AP centre. Conduct dist. training, playing with new product where no one has it in the world. Also, my company is a MNC in the world.  The prospect is just too good for me to go..  Many pples envy me.  Not to mention i'm only a diploma holder.I don't mind working long hours..from 8.30am to 12am sometime ...go back to work maybe on sat and sun( typical workaholic).<br><br>But somehow..someone offer to sponser me to study for the  next 3 years...All expenses....with nothing in return!  How could i just leave everything like tht and go study. in additional to this...My love life is effecting my work and my study 's decision.  I also cannot just leave behind my friend when they need me.  Too many decision to make...<br><br>Well, i can see tht your BF is really afffecting u.... It's not always good to become friend when u knoe his existence will still affect your life.  Sometime it;s goodto just ask him to leave your life completely and never to see him again. At least, u can concentrate on your study.  I think u can 't leave him noe it's beccoz he somehoe still exist in your life.  U still think tht u need him to survive...in life, no one really need another one to survive...U live for yourself.<br><br>In life, we just got too much stuff to think abt.  Wonder when we will be able to see thru' all this "disturbance" in life..... But somehoe life sitll got to carry on.....<br><br>Anyway, gotta go work noe...Really feel like going to the sea and se ethe sunrise noe... Sadly, i cant....Take care yourself , sparkle...  Anyway, u mind writing thru; email? Somehoe when two troubled hearts meet they tends to understand each other better.. I don't like to spread my love story ard and telling pples abt wht happen.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, hey, seems like a lot of love lorn out there. *sigh* Is it the valetine's or what?<br><br>Sparks:<br><br>I been following your love story, since something like a month back. *smiles* I'm sorry it happen, and at such a crucial time. It suxs doesn't it? To love someone and not be loved back, it's a sad thing isn't it? No, I'm not wallowing in your failure, nor, am I offering any pitiance. I been there, and I know the pain, but I got over it quick enough not to let it drag on for too long. Maybe it's my rational self, maybe it's just that, I dun want to feel too much pain, but one thing I know for sure, I survived. Read my sob story? *smiles* Now to me, it's just a learning experience, I'm sure yours would be too. Sense and raionality plays a big part here, but of course, it can't be force into anyone.<br><br>Forgeting someone is difficult, and it would be if you force yourself to do so. How you know if you have really forgotten? That day, I was just in the forum, Maya posted the sob story competition thingy, I tried to think of something and it just came back to me. In simple words, one of these days, while you are taking a shower, listening to a song, eating, walking, or just plain bored, and you suddenly think of him/her, then you would have fogotten, by then, I suppose, you would think of the happenings, think of the pain that you went through to forgot, but the pain would be no more, only the scar would be left to remind you of your mistake. And the scar would be your prize, your prize in life which is unique to yourself. I may sound abstract here, but it's my thought, and I can think of no better way to share it with you. You may not be able to understand now, but you might later in life. As for now, finding a new love might hide your feelings from yourself, but it will eventually come back, trust me, I tried, and they always find me. Now, i'm alone, I enjoy it, I dun need the love of others to keep me going, I love myself, and that will be enough for now, if someday, a gal come along, and she open my mind, and I find that I need more than that, I will just fall in love again. That's how it works for me, and it's working fine.<br><br>To love again, you will need a key to open your heart, and that key you will find in a man who needs yours. *smiles*<br><br>Cantofire:<br><br>Stupid? Crazy? Nar... just a little lost. It's perfectly alright to feel that sense of lost, especially just when you give your love away. Personally, I would not give up, just like that, it's gentleman of you to ask your friend to chase her, but just know that, you too have a equal chance. The question is  Do you love her enough to go against the odds, do you? I can't answer that for you. You want her to be happy, but how sure are you that your friend would make her happy? Could you not provide her with more happiness if you tried? I can only ask the questions but you will have to provide the answers.<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 worth</span></strong></div>
