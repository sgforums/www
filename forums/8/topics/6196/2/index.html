            <div class='col-md body'>well, i may be at the age of what u people consider too young for love, but i have experienced what maya said....."if you hook up with someone you don't really love, you'll feel that all the things you do for him and let him do to you are obligations because he's been so nice to you.  Sooner or later this sense of being "forced" makes you start to resent him.  After this everything will go downhill."<br><br>to tell the truth, it happened not too long ago, so it's still fresh in the head.....b4 the relationship, i had a thinking like u. or even when i was in the r/s....ie i could grow to love him eventually. but i realised i couldn't.....till todae, i still feel bad about "lying" to him bout my feelings.....<br><br>don't really know how to make up for it, but i know that no matter what i do to make up for what i've done, it will still be of no use. other than loving him back, and not hurting him anymore, don't think there could be any better ways.<br><br>but well, like what they say, the scar will still be there. i believe, if i had gone on with the r/s, or tried loving him back (after stabbing him in the back) with all my heart, i would still feel bad and guilty. i would be bounded by my feelings of guilt.....<br><br>well, guess what i'm trying to say, is that being single has its bout of fun, and vice versa for being in a r/s. s for me, studies come first now!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> act, to tell the truth, think i'm afraid la. but hee~ using studies as an excuse. ;P</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks all for all your responses...yeah..i think i shouldnt be doing that too..I tried imagining myself with one of the guys who was after me, but i have no feelings for him...and asked myself..would i want a r/ship with him?? the answer is no..he likes me, but i dun like him...so i can't imagine myself being together wif him..so well..just try my best to be forget lor....<br><br>but as i got rid of this thought, another thought came up to me...wondering if there are any expert or professional "lover" out there who know how to seduce girls..if there are...if u can help me seduce the third party and make her stop hounding my ex, i'll be eternally grateful...i dun have her particulars, just her email address...i think i really sound like a bad girl now...dun scold me lah...it's just this girl is not that the innocent and simple type of girl...i dunno what her intentions are, she's the one who keeps pestering my ex, and i think he "weakened" when she keep sa3 jiao1. i'm not saying that after she's gone, i'll have the chance to be with him again..i won't want to be wif him again after what he did to me. But still dun wish to see him get cheated by this girl...she actually turned up at his house during CNY informing him only when she was already at the mrt station, and she only just broke up with her bf. She even asked my ex if i was okay!! wat a hypocrite..if she's really concerned about me...why bother to come into the r/ship in the first place?? does she really love him? if she does, i will wish them well, but sad to say, it's quite obvious that she's just thinking of getting a good catch, knowing that my ex drives. even my ex's mum is wary of her. so anybody can seduce her away????<br><br>sometimes guys are jerks, but there are also girls who are just as shameless...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sparks:<br><br>Glad that you given up the thought. Well as for seducing the girl, I doubt anyone with their sense up there would offer their help. *smiles* Put it this way, what's the point? Yes, your ex may escape it this time, but understand this,  <blockquote>catch the man a fish and he could eat for a day, Teach the man to fish and he can eat for his lifetime</blockquote> I think your ex will need a lesson in life so that he may grow from the experience. I do not see the point in helping him in this manner, the next gal like that comes along and he falls for the trap again, so you gonna get another guy to help you with the seducing? Think about it, I suppose you are better than that. Sometime in life it's not whether we fall down or not, it's whether we get up again. Help your ex, by blessing them, you feel better, and maybe they will just end up right. A gal like you deserve better in life, go on, live your life like you never did.<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 worth</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Do unto others what you want others to do to you. Why do you want to cause harm to others? Coz she took someone you love away and you want revenge?? Or as you said, you think she is going to hurt your ex. I do not think you are really in some position to gauge their relationship. In fact I think you should be more gracious and give them your well wishes. It is their life and their choice.. let them live with their decision be it good or bad.<br><br>Get on with your life, do what you need to do now. There are still many guys around.. good one and who are able to appreciate you and perhaps you might be able to love. Give them and yourself a chance.

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow sparkle. You have so many replies, comments, and offers of help i thinkk it may be quite useless for me to ad danythign ontot it.<br><br>I'll keep it short but decidedly a bit different.<br><br>ey, being 25 (almost 26), you can gather that I've proabbly gone through quite a few heart aches myself...which I have.  Not easy actually. but it gets easier each time it happens..maybe the pain gets dulled or you have just become acclimitised to it (by george i speeled it wrongly).<br><br>Fighting feelings is not an easy task.  An uphill one all the way, but sometimes it's worth it.<br><br>My first real luv I coudln' do anythign about savign any kind of freindship after she ran off with some other guy becasue i had come tio singapore.  Difficult to keep in contact when it's like this.<br><br>The second luv of my life cheated on me after two years together.  The developement to when she cheated on me was not an easy or pleasant one....with her seeing less and less of me and then finally dissappearing until i couldn't even contact her*(which is a really shitty feeling cause you keep dialing even thoguh u kno whtat noone will pick up)....<br><br>Eventually she just told me that she slep twith another guy and that she had been seeing him for the last month or so and had fallen for him.<br><br>At first I was damnz angry, but afetr afew days i realised that no matter what, nothing would shatter what i did have for my ex.  It won't make me forget that i used to love her and that i still do love her.  No matter how bad shee has treated me, i couldn't make myself forget that.<br><br>And It was because of that feeling..a sense of  obligation to the past maybe...that made me cuck up my own pain and start talking to her again within a few days of the event.  It was painful to say the least to have her tell me about how wonderful he was and all that...to hear about his great love making abilitites..(shit!!!)....<br><br>But ultimately I remained friends with her.  and even to this day we still call each other up during birthdays or special events or when we just miss those times together.<br><br>And it has made all the difference to my life in relation to my past and her...Instead of feeling angry and resentful, now all i feel is this a different kind of love for her and I know that because i managed to fight my own pain and take the time to be her friend thru it all(even thoguh she proabably didn't deserve it)...I know that she feels the same way.<br><br>And sometiems we'll start talking about old times and all the thigns that we used to do together and we'd laff and tell each other how much we missed one another..and she would still apologise for hurting me so badly.<br><br>I feel no hate or diguust for her.  I am glad that i remained frineds.  But it depends on ur own strength.  When i did it, i didnt do it to gain anything back...so dun look for anything from him...<br><br>for me i was able to salvage the bitter sweet memories..and instead of just me feeling it i can now share it with her also...and it has made all the differnece in how important she was and still is to me even though we only talk 2 ro 3 tiems a year...<br><br>It's all your choice sparkle....The pain never stays...but what u feel will always be there.<br><br>call me stupid or romantic, but I always believed that you never stop loving somebody...The feelings may change but I think that it is stil there.  If you loved someone once then you will love them for all time...Somewhere in your heart is that feeling , you just need to know it and have some kind of contact within yourself to realise it..and still manage to feel it when you need to feel it......Thats' why my ex's are still so important to me...Because i won't forget how i sued to feel for them..and no matter what they did to me it's still that feeling that we shared that is most important..above all other feelings..be it pain or displeasure or sour grapes....<br><br>It all depends on how you want to view yourself...how important is it too you to remain friends with him....It's not alwasy easy and most people relaly cannot do it because they can't overcome the emotion that is present..anger, dissappointment, rejection, dejection,..whatever.....<br><br>I hoep you can see another point of view from reading this sparkle...I won't ask you to email me because i think you have a lot of supporters asking you already..ahahhaahha<br><br>but if need be i am probabaly the easiest person to contact in this forum...:-)<br><br>Do what you feel will ake you happy..short or long term...hate him if you must..thats' just my message..but it doesn't mean that it is the only alternative...think about it...hate is only tmeporary...<br><br>ps-i also consider sabo-ing the guy ..but...instead decided to be mature about it....we are yougn after all and nothing is written in stone.....<br><br>All the best sparkle..writing this ...brought tears to my eyes..seriously...a mixture of old memories and old pain..but all good...wouldn't give it up for the world.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks all once again..<br><br>firewire: what you've said has given me some hope. It's really nice to see that pple can change romantic love to pure friendship. i wish to be able to do that too. As for hating him, i dunno why, i just dun feel hate. No matter what he has done, till now, i dun hate him. Disappointed, yes. But not hate.<br><br>I'm not trying to sabo them (i dun think i am!). Guess maybe my approach is wrong...should just let him choose what he thinks it's right for him, even though the pple around him are worried. If they succeed, all the best. If not, maybe he would learn from his own mistake. guess there is really nothing i can do.<br><br></div>
