            <div class='col-md body'>SLIM 10 SUIT 29 jun 03<br>What favour? Rayson 'made 30% profit'<br>Andrea denies using colleague to buy pills at a discount<br><br>By Elena Chong<br><br>IT WAS Rayson Tan Tai Ming's misfortune to end up being sued by actress Andrea De Cruz because he did her a favour by buying some slimming pills for her, said his lawyer yesterday.<br><br>It was no favour, countered Ms De Cruz, 29, who said that her MediaCorp colleague made money from selling her the pills.<br><br>If he didn't make a 30-per-cent profit from the sale, she said, then he could call it doing her a favour.<br><br>'I am very sad by that fact,' she said to questions posed by Mr Tan's lawyer, Mr Lok Vi Ming, who suggested she was ungrateful for the favour, had made his client an 'additional scapegoat' and 'bit the very hand that served you'.<br><br>She denied making use of Mr Tan, 38, to get the pills at a discount, and to save herself the trouble of going to the shop and being recognised.<br><br>Mr Tan's wife, actress Chen Liping, 38, was the celebrity who endorsed Slim 10 in the advertisements.<br><br>Ms De Cruz claims the pills caused her liver to fail. She was near death when she had a liver transplant in May last year. The donor was her fiance, Pierre Png, 29.<br><br>She is suing Mr Tan, Slim 10 importer Health Biz and its director, Semon Liu, 33, and distributor TV Media, for negligence.<br><br>In her affidavit, she said she personally knew of others who had bought pills from Mr Tan, including actress Lee Ying Zhu who plays her mother-in-law in the Channel 8 drama, No Problem, and a sound technician at MediaCorp.<br><br>'I believe that Rayson was running some sort of business selling Slim 10 and had sold me the pills in the course of his business. He certainly did not buy the pills for me, as a favour to me,' she had said.<br><br>She refused to retract that statement in court yesterday after she had learnt from Mr Liu's affidavit that Mr Tan had charged her $130 for a packet of pills for which he paid $100.<br><br>'He sold me the pills at $130. So I would not believe that he was not running a business and did not make a profit,' she said.<br><br>Mr Lok told Ms De Cruz that she ascribed the 'worst of intentions' to his client by accusing him of making profit from her on those three occasions he did her a favour.<br><br>Time would tell whether he had made a profit, she responded.<br><br>Of her evidence that she last took Slim 10 on April 8 last year, Mr Lok suggested that she had plucked the date 'out of thin air' because it was close to the onset of the symptoms of liver failure.<br><br>She denied this.<br><br>She also denied that the date was chosen to strengthen her case.<br><br>After denying she had changed her mind about when she started and when she stopped taking the pills, she finally conceded she had made many changes to those dates.<br><br>'You have written an entirely new script as regards the consumption dates of the pills so that it could benefit your claims,' said Mr Lok.<br><br>She disagreed.<br><br>When Mr Lok said his client should have left it to someone else to do her the favour so she could sue that person, Ms De Cruz said: 'I can't answer that.'<br><br>Asked by her lawyer, Mr Raj Singam, whether she was sure she had taken Slim 10, she said she had no reason to doubt it. Also, Mr Tan did not sell her anything else besides Slim 10, she added.<br><br>Asked why she had taken out the lawsuit, Ms De Cruz said in a voice choked with emotion that she and her family had suffered tremendously.<br><br>'People have died from taking Slim 10. There is no way I could ever wish this upon anyone. I don't ever want this to happen to anyone.<br><br>'I fear for my life really. I fear that, financially, I will not be able to support myself. I am drained. I have no more insurance coverage. I can't stay in the hospital.'<br><br>Mr Lok stood up to object, saying that all this was in the affidavit. Justice Tay Yong Kwang said there was no need to repeat everything.<br><br>Ms De Cruz, whose mother was in court for the first time yesterday, said she could not afford to pay her hospital bills if she got sick, and she would be on medication all her life.<br><br>She takes Prograf, an immunosuppressant that keeps her body from rejecting the transplanted liver but leaves her weak and vulnerable to other illnesses.<br><br>'It is perhaps the most expensive pill that I have to take for life. If I didn't take action against all these parties, this could happen again.<br><br>'Someone else would die. I am not going to let that happen,' she said, her voice breaking as the tears rolled down her cheeks.<br><br>The case continues on Tuesday.<br><br><img src="http://www.straitstimes.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2003-06-29/0929slim10.jpg">Ms De Cruz (left) denied making use of Mr Rayson Tan (right) to get the pills at a discount</div>
