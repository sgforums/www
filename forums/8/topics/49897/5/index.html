            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Distributor says pills Andrea bought were not Slim 10 </strong>22 Jul 03<br>TV Media's ex-director claims they were not in HSA-approved boxes as sold by distributor, and so 'definitely not Slim 10'<br><br>By Elena Chong<br><br>THE Slim 10 trial took a surprise turn yesterday when it was claimed that the slimming pills MediaCorp actress Andrea De Cruz had bought were 'definitely not Slim 10'.<br><br>Mr Wilfred Wong Hock Meng, testifying for the pills' distributor TV Media Holdings, said he did not know what she had bought except that the pills were unpacked and came in a variety of product containers.<br><br>Mr Wong, the former regional marketing director of TV Media Holdings who now works for its owner, told the High Court that they were not in Health Sciences Authority-approved boxes.<br><br>'Andrea never bought Slim 10 in boxes approved by HSA, the approved product that was sold by TV Media. That was a completely different product. That is my case.'<br><br>Another point he made was that Ms De Cruz had begun taking the pills way before the advertisement on Slim 10 was aired on Channel U on Dec 28, 2001.<br><br>His point was that she could not have relied on the ads but would have found out about the pills earlier from Ms Chen Liping, a TV actress who endorsed the pills, when they were both acting together in a Chinese serial, No Problem.<br><br>But he denied that TV Media knew that TV celebrities and personalities were getting the pills from its importer, Health Biz, with which it had a distribution agreement.<br><br>When the pills were recalled in April last year and during the refund exercise in May, he said TV Media found that some were returned in plastic bags, silver-foil packets and thick vials, which were unlike those packed by Health Biz and marketed by TV Media.<br><br>It led the company to believe that the market had counterfeit and parallel import capsules.<br><br>Ms De Cruz, 29, had earlier testified that she was so convinced by the 30-second Slim 10 TV ad featuring Ms Chen, 38, that she decided to try them.<br><br>She had bought the weight-loss pills from her colleague and Ms Chen's husband, Mr Rayson Tan Tai Ming. The pills made her very ill and she had to be given a liver transplant.<br><br>She is now suing Health Biz, its director Semon Liu Kelun, 33, TV Media and Mr Tan, 38, for negligence.<br><br>The trial in the High Court is in its fifth week.<br><br>Yesterday, lawyer Simon Tan, who is representing Health Biz and Mr Liu, spent much of his time showing e-mail messages to demonstrate that Mr Wong was interested only in making profits.<br><br>Mr Wong had sent the e-mail messages to his New Zealand and American bosses.<br><br>One said: 'With the suspension of Slim 10 sale (till when?) we cannot expect the S$2.0 mil level. We'll work our forecast and inform you.<br><br>'The Retailers would run out of stock in about 2-3 weeks time. We will prepare strategy (make a good story!) to inform them appropriately of the stoppage of supply to them.'<br><br>Referring to his many allegations against his clients, Mr Tan accused him of being unscrupulous to the extent of 'jilting' Health Biz and Mr Liu at the 'altar of liability'.<br><br>Later, Mr Wong caused a roar of laughter when he laced his answer to Mr Tan with similar images of courtship and marriage.<br><br>Referring to Mr Liu's sales of the pills to Mr Rayson Tan, Mr Wong said: 'Talking about jilting at the altar, here he is marrying me and he has his mistress waiting in the honeymoon suite.'<br><br>In reply to Mr Tan's accusations that he was driven by profits, he said that like any organisation, TV Media had to make money. But that did not mean it disregarded everything else, despite being in a 'weak financial position'.<br><br>He denied that he cajoled or insisted that Health Biz write an appeal letter to HSA to revoke the voluntary recall of the pills as otherwise, it would sound the 'death knell' for the product.<br><br>It was also not his idea to send the appeal to save TV Media, he said, although he conceded earlier that Slim 10 was his company's elixir of success.<br><br>Disagreeing that he was prepared to let Health Biz be the 'fall guy', he said: 'The die has been cast. The events are already in motion and happening.<br><br>'Of course you cannot say we knew when poison was found that we have to stand by him, because he has or his manufacturers have misled us all the way, taking advantage of our trust.'<br><br>The hearing continues.<br><br>TV MEDIA MAN'S CLAIM:<br>Health Biz director had problems<br>collecting money from actor<br>HEALTH Biz director Semon Liu Kelun allegedly told TV Media's then regional marketing director that he had problems collecting money from actor Rayson Tan Tai Ming, to whom he was selling Slim 10.<br><br>The conversation took place during a business trip to Taiwan in March last year, said Mr Wilfred Wong Hock Meng, 49.<br><br>'In one conversation, he told us that he was selling to Rayson and that it was such a nuisance to sell to him because, as a celebrity, he takes from the stocks and does not pay for them. He had problems collecting money,' he added.<br><br>TV Media's case is that it did not know Health Biz and Mr Liu were selling the China-made diet pills to TV and media personalities between December 2001 and March last year.<br><br>Neither did it know that Mr Liu, 33, was selling them to others in miscellaneous packages, and not in the approved containers.<br><br>'During the recall, when we suddenly discovered people coming with funny packages, my instant reaction was to take them and give them to our lawyers, to give to the Health Sciences Authority for investigation,' he said.<br><br>He also said that when asked, Mr Liu denied that the pills were available for purchase at MediaCorp<br><br><strong>25 Jul 03<br><br>[b]It's Andrea who betrayed friendship, actor tells court<br>By  Elena Chong and Karen Ho [/b</strong>]<br><br>EMOTIONS ran high in the High Court today when the man who allegedly sold Slim 10 pills to MediaCorp actress Andrea De Cruz, took the stand to give his version of events.<br><br>Accused by Ms De Cruz of having betrayed her, actor Rayson Tan Tai Ming, 38, said: 'I think she has betrayed my friendship, she made use of me to do things for her and now she turns around and claims that I'm not her friend, just a colleague.'<br><br>Advertisement<br><br>During her testimony on June 24, Ms De Cruz, 29, had said Mr Tan, who was no more than a 'trusted colleague', had profited from selling her the pills.<br><br>Ms De Cruz had insisted that she had bought the pills from him out of convenience and because he sold them to her at a discount.<br><br>Mr Tan related how friends and relatives had asked him to buy the pills for them after they saw how much weight his wife, Chen Liping, 38, the poster girl for Slim 10, had lost in two months.<br><br>He said he was surprised when Ms De Cruz asked him to buy the weight-loss pills for her because he felt that she didn't need to lose any weight.<br><br>He tried dissuading her but she persisted. He relented only because one couldn't refuse one's 'relatives and friends', he said.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>23 Jul 03<br><strong>TV Media man: No reason to doubt government licences<br>Distributor's ex-director also alleges that the pill Andrea bought was 'illegal' and she was 'part of illegal transaction' </strong><br><br>By Elena Chong And Karen Ho<br><br>FOR the second day running, Slim 10 distributor TV Media's former regional marketing director Wilfred Wong Hock Meng, 49, showed formidable resilience when he took the stand yesterday.<br><br>He was accused of, among other things, failing to conduct independent checks on the Chinese manufacturer of Slim 10 or its associated products, as well as on businessman Semon Liu Kelun, 33, and Health Biz, the company that imported the pills<br>Under cross-examination, Mr Wong denied that he relied solely on the assurances of importer Health Biz and its director on the safety of the weight-loss pills.<br><br>He said that what had been most important to TV Media was the Health Sciences Authority's (HSA) approval and licences.<br><br>MediaCorp actress Andrea De Cruz's lawyer Wendell Wong asked whether he had any other assurances apart from those given by Mr Liu and the 'mere sight' of the HSA's licences.<br><br>'Our government agencies are respected. They don't dish out licences like that.<br><br>'If I see a licence from HSA, there is no reason for me to say it was a slipshod thing,' said Mr Wong.<br><br>He is now the sales and marketing director of Pacific Media Global Sourcing which owns TV Media, the company which is being sued by the 29-year-old actress for negligence along with Health Biz, its director, Mr Liu, and actor Rayson Tan Tai Ming, 38.<br><br>He said that before September 2001, anyone could bring in Chinese proprietary medicines (CPMs) as they were not regulated.<br><br>'After that, HSA came in and implemented strict regulations to license and approve CPMs for sale in Singapore. The objective was to make sure that all CPMs were safe for Singapore,' he said.<br><br>Slim 10, he added, was one of the first products to undergo this scrutiny.<br><br>It was therefore only reasonable to expect that the product was properly cleared.<br><br>Lawyer Wendell Wong said TV Media had been ignorant of the negligent way in which Health Biz and Mr Liu conducted their business.<br><br>The witness replied that it was normal business practice to check on certain things, but not everything.<br><br>'If I am a tour agency and I sell SIA tickets, do I have to know how many times SIA checks its aircraft? How well SIA pilots are trained? Do I have to go into their books?<br><br>'The licences are given by the authorities to not only protect the customers but also people downstream,' he said.<br><br>When the lawyer said that the airline had a 'duty of care' to its passengers, Mr Wong retorted: 'Where is my 'duty of care' to Andrea? She did not buy Slim 10. She did not buy from us.'<br><br>He said Ms De Cruz 'threw caution to the wind' for a mere $19.90 discount when she bought the unmarked capsules from her colleague, Mr Tan.<br><br>'To make matters worse, all these pills came in different, different rojak of containers.<br><br>'She bought them from someone whom she did not even consider her friend.'<br><br>'She considered him a colleague. A friend is someone you trust,' he said before being interrupted by counsel.<br><br>He then waved a silver-foil packet taken from his daughter's cornflakes box to demonstrate his point that the actress bought pills in a similar wrapping - not the ones distributed by his company.<br><br>If she believed that Mr Tan was running a business, as she had claimed earlier in the trial, she should have asked for receipts, he said.<br><br>The medicine she bought was illegal and she was 'part of an illegal transaction' under the Medicines Act.<br><br>This was because Mr Tan did not have a licence to sell the pills, he added.<br><br>Mr Wong agreed that Slim 10 was the 'huge goldmine' that TV Media had been waiting for, but denied that the company was 'blinded by profits' at the expense of customer and product safety.<br><br>Profit, he said, was in every company's mind but to say that it was foremost in TV Media's mind at the expense of its clients was 'ridiculous'.<br><br>'We were not running a charity, we were running a business,' he said.<br><br>He disagreed with the lawyer, who said that TV Media was unwilling to upset the 'golden goose' it had just found, because Mr Liu had opened up a new world of marketing to it.<br><br>He told Justice Tay Yong Kwang that TV Media's one 'fatal error' had been to do business with Mr Liu in the first place.<br><br>The two men no longer speak to each other.<br><br>The hearing continues tomorrow.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>JULY 27<br>Body image a big deal<br>THE WAY I SEE IT<br><br>THE suit brought by actress Andrea d'Cruz against parties who sold her the diet pill, Slim 10, has had its TV moments, but as the court eventually retires to rule on the case, bystanders will be left with a cautionary tale about the price of wanting to be thin.<br><br>On the issue of responsibility, a couple of incidents in the trial had my attention.<br><br>One was the part played by the Health Sciences Authority. The other was actor Rayson Tan's statement that his wife took Slim 10 while pregnant.<br><br>It came out in court that the HSA had tested samples of Slim 10 when the distributor, Health Biz, applied for an import licence in 2001, but had ignored the results from an independent laboratory hired by the distributor. The lab, Setsco, had found trace amounts of fenfluramine, the substance suspected to have caused Ms d'Cruz's liver failure.<br><br>On the stand, the HSA's Dr Bosco Chen Bloodworth had said: 'Even if you find something here, you would still need to do your own analysis to confirm. Normally, the laboratory will not be bothered to refer to it.'<br><br>It makes you wonder how things would have turned out if it had bothered.<br><br>Of course, the HSA reacted in exemplary manner when two women who had been on Slim 10 fell dangerously ill. It whisked the supplement off the shelves on April 15, and conducted its own tests, which found fenfluramine and another controlled substance, nicotinamide, this time.<br><br>The following June, the HSA found an additional 'adulterant' in Slim 10: 'thyroid gland components, the active principles of which are substances controlled under the Poisons Act.'<br><br>Anyone hearing this now might think it a bit rich, though: Why wasn't any of this detected when Health Biz submitted its licence application the year before?<br><br>Clearly, the HSA cannot ensure that every product in the market is safe, nor should it have to do so. The onus is on importers of supplements and herbal remedies not to poison their customers.<br><br>But HSA should state unambiguously whether its checks are rigorous enough so that as little as possible slips through the cracks before a product goes on the market.<br><br>After all, the public looks to the gatekeeper to keep the bad juju out.<br><br>By the end of August, the HSA had tested 163 weight control supplements and 45 Chinese medicines available here for slimming. All were cleared.<br><br>The business of thin is a fat one, and will be as long as there is demand for slimming products, and methods.<br><br>The appetite to be thin doesn't look like abating any time soon. Much as we like to cavil against the cancerous idea which has been perpetuated by the media, Hollywood, and business corporations that thin is perfection, it is a trend which has persisted for 40 years.<br><br>The message, according to studies, has become culturally entrenched, pervading all age groups and socio-economic classes. Women are vulnerable whatever they weigh. Slender as she was, Ms d'Cruz felt that she had to be slimmer to get anywhere in showbiz.<br><br>While a small number of women will go on to develop true eating disorders, there are many who will engage in risky behaviour just to achieve their ideal weight in the shortest time possible.<br><br>Indeed, the second thing which dismayed me during the hearing was to hear that TV actress Chen Liping had continued taking Slim 10 for a while when she was pregnant, which seems like a rather dangerous thing to do.<br><br>The relationship between a negative body image and risk taking behaviour is a complex one, taking into account many factors, such as an individual's mental state, stage of life, personal history, and the characteristics of the society she lives in.<br><br>There are two choices in tackling this: either we roll over as victims, or we try and fight this fallacy, both as individuals and a community.<br><br>As a community we in Singapore have not done enough to debunk the ridiculous notion that women should aspire to be underweight.<br><br>It may be like swimming against the tide to take such a pervasive idea head on, but capitulating could mean far worse, as the tragic stories of the Slim 10 victims tell.<br><br>The Victoria state government in Australia is trying at least. It is working on gender portrayal guidelines that it will promote to the advertising industry to try and improve the way women are depicted in advertising.<br><br>Singapore, with its love of campaigns, should consider a programme to promote a healthy body image among our young. Schools could include self-esteem courses; community health groups could conduct workshops on how to be healthy at one's weight, rather than thin at any cost.<br><br>Many will say, there's nothing wrong with wanting to be thin. I say, there's something wrong with never liking yourself over 45kg.<br><br>As someone constantly looking for the perfect diet, I received a rude wake up call one day when my four-year-old daughter stood in front of the mirror in an empire-cut dress and moaned: 'But it makes me look fat.'<br><br>I realised that I had to take the blame for what was happening in her head.<br><br>Body image attitudes are developed in childhood. The strong messages of body shape, sexual attractiveness and beauty learnt by children are learnt well before puberty. It's with them that we can break the downward spiral.<br><br>If it's about who's responsible, then we all are.<br><br>(E-mail: sharonl@sph.com.sg )<br></div>

Liping is not a three-year-old kid. She can make her own decision... Would I still be a human being if I did that?'<br><br>He also denied that he was afraid to be seen as a 'Slim 10 seller' because his acting contract prohibited moonlighting.<br><br>'I totally disagree.

            <div class='col-md body'>Andrea labelled as 'heartless, greedy'<br>By Elena Chong 31 Jul 03<br><br>BEFITTING the drama that has surrounded the Slim 10 hearings, the last witness said in the High Court yesterday that Ms Andrea De Cruz was not only heartless but also solely motivated by greed<br><br>Slim 10 poster girl, Ms Chen Liping, 38, a MediaCorp artiste whose husband, Mr Rayson Tan Tai Ming, is being sued by Ms De Cruz for allegedly selling her the diet pills, said: 'She changed the meaning of friends just for the sake of money.'<br><br>Ms De Cruz, 29, is seeking more than $1 million in damages from Mr Tan, 38; the importer of the pills, Health Biz; its director, Mr Semon Liu Kelun, 33; and distributor TV Media.<br><br>She claims that she had to undergo a liver transplant in May last year because the diet pills damaged her liver.<br><br>Commenting on the suit against her husband, Ms Chen told a packed courtroom that she and her husband could not believe that Ms De Cruz, who they had thought was a good friend, was actually suing him.<br><br>But when Ms De Cruz testified that Mr Tan was not a friend, only a 'colleague', the scales fell from their eyes, said Ms Chen.<br><br>'This confirmed that she is heartless. She is doing all this for money,' she said.<br><br>When her husband and Ms De Cruz were cast as husband and wife in the Channel 8 drama No Problem in December 2001, they got along well and were 'closer than very good friends', Ms Chen added.<br><br>Apart from sending him SMS messages, Ms De Cruz confided in him about her relationship problems and an operation to remove a lump from her breast, she said in court.<br><br>Ms De Cruz even told him about how much she and her fiance Pierre Png, 29, earned, said Ms Chen. She added her own friends of 20 years did not know what her salary was.<br><br>'They were on such good terms, like the husband and wife in the drama. I don't know whether she was play-acting,' she said.<br><br>She stressed that she and her husband did not run a business selling Slim 10.<br><br>Even though she was the spokesman for Slim 10, she had not gone around asking people to try the product. However, others had asked her to buy the pills for them after seeing that she had lost weight.<br><br>She lost 3kg after taking the pills for 10 to 14 days, and 8kg in two months with no side effects, she said.<br><br>This was before Slim 10 was officially launched in November 2001.<br><br>Ms Chen said people who accused her husband of putting her life at risk were 'talking nonsense'.<br><br>She took the pills on her own before they were approved by the Health Sciences Authority because she had been convinced by Mr Liu, who had lost weight after taking them.<br><br>She said she felt very hurt that her husband had been dragged into all this just because he helped Ms De Cruz.<br><br>'In the past year, we have suffered a lot. Salt and vinegar have been added to our wounds by this action...' she said.<br><br>During his 2 1/2-hour cross-examination, Ms De Cruz's lawyer, Mr Raj Singam, suggested among other things that Ms Chen's husband had profited from selling the pills and she was trying to 'cover up' for him as a 'dutiful' wife.<br><br>The court erupted in laughter when she asked whether he had said 'dutiful' or 'beautiful', to which counsel replied: 'Beautiful is also possible.'<br><br>'Why should I help him? I am sitting here to tell the truth. I am not trying to hide anything,' she said.<br><br>When the lawyer said it was not his client who wanted to take action against Mr Tan but that she was acting on advice, Justice Tay Yong Kwang remarked: 'Raj Singam is asking her to direct her anger at him.'<br><br>Laughter was again heard around the court.<br><br>The lawyer said his client had had no reason to doubt that the pills were safe. So had it been fair on the part of the defendants' lawyers to say Ms De Cruz was 'the author of her own misfortune'?<br><br>Ms Chen then said Ms De Cruz was different from her. She said her liver and her heart were not the same as Ms De Cruz's, bringing mirth to the gallery once again.<br><br>Asked to react to the fact that Ms De Cruz would be on immunosuppressants for the rest of her life and that her liver could fail at any time, Ms Chen said she and many others who did not know her had great sympathy for Ms De Cruz.<br><br>Asked by Mr Tan's lawyer, Mr Lok Vi Ming, whether the premature birth of her son in June last year had been a joyful event, Ms Chen said in a cracked voice that he had been much smaller than other babies and their hearts ached at the time.<br><br>She also said that they had been very disturbed when Mr Tan received a letter from Ms De Cruz's lawyers.<br><br>'We were very worried because we had never had anything to do with the law,' she added.<br><br>The hearing ended after 26 days with a total of 21 witnesses called.<br><br>All parties will make their written submissions next month.<br><br><img src="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2003-07-31/h401.jpg"><br>'She changed the meaning of friends just for the sake of money...This confirmed that she is heartless.' - Mediacorp Studios artiste Chen Liping (left), on fellow actress Andrea De Cruz, who is suing her husband Rayson Tan -- ONG CHIN KAI</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Best of Slim 10 drug drama </strong>3 Aug 03 Straits times<br>A scriptwriter for a Hong Kong drama series could not have done better. The Slim 10 hearing had it all - tears, angry outbursts, and even a staring incident. the $1 million suit filed by MediaCorp actress Andrea De Cruz captured the public imagination for 26 ANIL MENON looks on the 10 most dramatic moments.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>'Pills destroyed my life'<br><br>THE plaintiff, Ms Andrea De Cruz, who had been on the stand for two days, collapsed during a marathon cross-examination on June 25. She had to be taken out in a wheelchair and was warded at Gleneagles Hospital for a day<br><img src="http://www.straitstimes.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2003-08-03/2201.jpg"><br>"Our dream was always to have at least six children," - Ms De Cruz, referring to herself and her fiance Pierre Png.<br>The actress had twice broken down the day before while describing how the liver transplant had turned her into an invalid and accused Mr Rayson Tan of having betrayed her trust by selling her the pills which almost took her life.<br><br>'Our dream was always to have at least six children,' she said referring to herself and her fiance Pierre Png, 29. 'I guess that will not happen in this lifetime.'<br><br>She also maintained that she began taking the pills after seeing advertisements for Slim 10 in January last year. This conflicted with what she had told doctors at Mount Alvernia Hospital where she was admitted on April 16 with hepatitis and the dates she had given her transplant surgeon Dr K.C. Tan. But she insisted she did not recall telling anyone that she had started taking the pills earlier.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>'You have only yourself to blame'<br><br>WHEN Ms De Cruz was back on the witness stand on June 27, Mr B. Rao, the lawyer for Slim 10 distributor TV Media, made it clear she was not going to be treated with kid gloves. He accused her of being 'the author of her own misfortune' by not seeking medical advice when she felt unwell after taking the pills.<br><br>This led to an emotional outburst from Ms De Cruz, who not only stoutly denied she was to blame but also said she regretted taking the pills which 'nearly took my life'.<br><br>The next day, she said Mr Tan - whom she described as only a 'colleague', not a friend - had not been doing her a favour by supplying her the pills because he was running a business selling them and had profited from it.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>'Normal life after transplant'<br><br>AN EXPERT witness flown in from Britain by TV Media, Dr Julia Wendon, 45, a senior lecturer and consultant at King's University Hospital in London, said on July 2 that Ms De Cruz should, like many other liver transplant patients, be able to lead a normal life and have children.<br><br>Speaking from experience and evidence in medical literature, she said there were few things transplant patients could not do. They take part in the World Transplant Games, doing particularly well in swimming and sprinting, she added.<br><br>Dr Wendon, who took the stand the previous day as well, ruled out Slim 10 as a cause of liver failure. She said the more likely culprits were spirulina, a blue-green algae Ms De Cruz had been taking as a health supplement, or a virus.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>'It'd take 480 pills at one go'<br><br>ANOTHER expert witness called by TV Media, Dr David Anthony Joyce, 50, an associate professor of pharmacology at the University of Western Australia, dropped a bombshell when he claimed in court that Ms De Cruz would have had to take 480 Slim 10 pills at one go for them to cause some sort of liver damage.<br><br>He said each Slim 10 capsule was found to have just 1.4mg of N-nitroso fenfluramine, which belongs to a class of chemical compounds called nitrosamines. Ms De Cruz took 12 pills a day, which added up to only 16.8mg of the compound.<br><br>'I do not know of any nitrosamine that is so potent that would cause acute liver failure at a dose of 16.8mg a day,' he told the court.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>'I was torn apart inside'<br><br>THE man whose liver saved Ms De Cruz broke down in court on July 7 while recounting his efforts to keep up her spirits as her body weakened.<br><br>Actor Mr Pierre Png said he was 'torn apart inside, watching this beautiful girl I was going to marry slowly deteriorating and seemingly losing her mind'.<br><br>He spoke of how she had hallucinations and suffered acute pain when a needle was inserted between her ribs to take a liver sample for biopsy.<br><br>However, some of his testimony was challenged by the defendants' lawyers, who accused him of having a selective memory. The main bone of contention again was when Ms De Cruz had started and stopped taking the slimming pills.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>'I am not being bullied'<br><br>DR K.C. Tan, who performed the transplant surgery on Ms De Cruz, almost lost his cool on July 11 when he was being cross-examined by Mr Rayson Tan's lawyer, Mr Lok Vi Ming, and Slim 10 importer, Health Biz's lawyer, Mr Simon Tan.<br><br>Sparks flew and there were allegations of bullying as the lawyers questioned the 49-year-old's competence as an expert and said he could not be an unbiased witness because he was still attending to Ms De Cruz.<br><br>A day earlier, Dr Tan had said that Slim 10 was most likely to have caused Ms De Cruz's liver failure. He said he based his conclusion on the Health Sciences Authority's notifications on the adverse reactions to Slim 10. He also said the period during which the pill was taken was irrelevant.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br></div>

He had earlier said the pills had worked like a charm on him, reducing his weight from 135kg at the end of 1999 to 69kg at the end of 2000.<br><br>He said he rued the day he got permission to sell the pills here as he would otherwise not have been facing a lawsuit. He came to the support of Mr Tan, who he said had only helped his friends get hold of the pills.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>'Andrea never bought Slim 10'<br><br>THE former regional marketing director of TV Media, the pill's distributor, created a sensation on July 21 by arguing that as far as he was concerned Ms De Cruz had not bought Slim 10. Mr Wilfred Wong Hock Meng, 49, said she had bought unpacked pills in a variety of containers.<br><br>'Andrea never bought Slim 10 in boxes approved by HSA, the approved product that was sold by TV Media. That was a completely different product,' he said.<br><br>Under cross-examination the next day, the articulate Mr Wong refused to wilt. When lawyer Wendell Wong accused him of having been ignorant of the negligent way in which Health Biz conducted its business, he retorted it was normal practice to check on certain things, not everything.<br><br>'If I am a tour agency and I sell SIA tickets, do I have to know how many times SIA checks its aircraft?' he asked.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>'Who knows all our pain and suffering?'<br><br>EMOTIONS ran high in court when Mr Rayson Tan Tai Ming took the stand on July 24, and accused Ms De Cruz of betrayal.<br><br>'She made use of me to do things for her and now she turns around and claims that I'm not her friend, just a colleague,' he said.<br><br>Mr Tan said he and his wife, Ms Chen Liping, 38, the poster girl for Slim 10, had gone through a lot of anguish because she had taken the pills longer than Ms De Cruz, and was pregnant.<br><br>When their baby was born premature last year, they could only cry, he said. The birth occurred four days after he received a letter from Ms De Cruz's lawyer.<br><br>He stressed that he was not a businessman selling the pills, but only someone who helped friends and relatives get them. The couple were convinced of the pill's efficacy when they met Mr Liu and he showed them old photographs of himself in which he 'looked like a pig'.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>'Andrea is heartless and driven by greed'<br><br>ON the last day of the hearing, July 30, Ms Chen Liping came out in defence of her husband and accused Ms De Cruz of being heartless and motivated by greed.<br><br>She told a packed courtroom that she and her husband could not believe that Ms De Cruz, who they had thought was a good friend, was actually suing him.<br><br>But when Ms De Cruz testified that Mr Tan was not a friend, only a 'colleague', the scales fell from their eyes, said Ms Chen.<br><br>When her husband and Ms De Cruz were cast as husband and wife in the Channel 8 drama No Problem in December 2001, they were 'closer than very good friends', she added.<br><br>She emphasised that she and her husband did not run a business selling Slim 10.<br><br>The feisty Ms Chen provoked much mirth in the gallery before she broke down while speaking of her premature baby.<br>THE CAST<br>Key players<br><br>Â• High Court judge: Justice Tay Yong Kwang<br><br>Â• Plaintiff: Ms Andrea De Cruz, 29, MediaCorp actress who had to have a liver transplant<br><br>Â• Defendant No. 1: Health Biz, the company that imported Slim 10 from China<br><br>Â• Defendant No. 2: Mr Semon Liu, 33, a director of Health Biz<br><br>Â• Defendant No. 3: TV Media, the company that distributed Slim 10 in Singapore<br><br>Â• Defendant No. 4: Mr Rayson Tan Tai Ming, 38, MediaCorp actor who supplied Slim 10 to Ms De Cruz<br><br>Witnesses include:<br><br>Â• Dr Julia Wendon, 45, a senior lecturer and consultant at King's University Hospital, London<br><br>Â• Dr David Anthony Joyce, 50, an associate professor of pharmacology at the University of Western Australia<br><br>Â• Mr Pierre Png, 29, MediaCorp actor and Ms De Cruz's fiance<br><br>Â• Dr K.C.
