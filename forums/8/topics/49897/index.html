            <div class='col-md body'>Slim 10 lawsuits begin in High Court<br><br>By Asha Popatlal<br><br>The multiple lawsuits by Andrea De Cruz against those linked to Slim 10 began on Monday at the High Court.<br><br>The television actress is suing everyone involved in importing, selling and promoting the diet pills in Singapore.<br><br>Advertisement<br><br>There was plenty of excitement when Andrea De Cruz arrived in court accompanied by her fiance Pierre Png, her sister and her brother-in-law.<br><br>But they had an even bigger surprise waiting for them in the courtroom.<br><br>It was packed with people who wanted to see the local celebrity couple.<br><br>"It's quite an interesting case. It's quite big. People died. It's about fat burners. The interest is there...I came in the morning but I came a little late. I couldn't get a seat or a ticket. They told me to come again in the afternoon but it's full again."<br><br>"I'm very interested in the case because not only are celebrities like Andrea involved but there are also ordinary people."<br><br>Unfortunately for these curious people, not much happened on the first day.<br><br>In an anti-climatic move, the entire morning was spent with the lawyers in the judge's chambers making decisions on administrative matters and the admissibility of certain evidence.<br><br>The case only started in the afternoon with Dr Chia Siew Cheng, the first of the medical witnesses, taking the stand.<br><br>Dr Chia, a gastroenterologist, testifed about Andrea's condition when she first examined her for liver problems.<br><br>Andrea was also scheduled to take the stand to tell her story, but her appearance has been delayed to the second day.<br><br>Over the next three weeks, other key players like Semon Liu will also be taking the stand.<br><br>According to lawyer Raj Singham from top law firm Drew and Napier, Semon Liu is the "brains" behind the import of Slim 10 and his company did not test all the pills for poisons.<br><br>Another key player is TV Media which advertised the pill as a "safe" herbal product.<br><br>Also taking the stand will be fellow actor Rayson Tan, whom Andrea said sold her the pills.<br><br>According to the opening statement from Andrea's lawyer, Rayson sold her Slim 10 twice for $260.<br><br>But it is understood Rayson's position is that the issue of Slim10 came up in a casual conversation and there was no contractual agreement.<br><br>The case continues on Tuesday.<br><br>(23 Jun 03)<br><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/42860/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/42860/1/.html</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Read the case in the Straits Times and Wanbao.<br><br>So sad.  They were such good friends (I mean Rayson and Andrea).<br><br>I'm more concern whether Rayson Tan is guilty or not.  On one hand, Andrea accuses him because he sold her the drugs.  On the other hand, Rayson said that it was Andrea who approached him.  He helped her, because he could get some good discount from the supplier.  Chew Chow Meng and Carole Lin admitted that they did buy Slim 10 from Rayson Tan.  But they also mentioned that they were not approached by Rayson.  Instead, they took the inititative to ask him.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Andrea's pain<br>Actress was suffering from hallucinations, doctor tells court<br><br>By Elena Chong and Karen Ho<br><br>ACTRESS Andrea De Cruz was suffering from hallucinations and sleeplessness when she was admitted to hospital shortly before being diagnosed with liver failure, the High Court heard yesterday.<br><br>Dr Chia Siew Cheng of Mount Alvernia Medical Centre said that the MediaCorp artiste was jaundiced and complained of abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea and fever when she first saw her at Mount Alvernia Hospital on April 16 last year.<br><br>The gastroenterologist said Ms De Cruz had told her that she had taken slimming tablets up until three months earlier.<br><br>Dr Chia was the first witness to give evidence in the civil hearing, which opened yesterday.<br><br>Ms De Cruz, 29, is seeking damages from five defendants for her liver failure which she says is directly linked to the Slim 10 pills she took between December 2001 and early January last year.<br><br>They are the Chinese manufacturer Guangzhou Yuzhitang Health Products Co, importer Health Biz, its director, Mr Semon Liu, 33, distributor TV Media, and her colleague, Mr Rayson Tan Tai Ming, 38.<br><br>The weight-loss pills contained fenfluramine, an appetite suppressant which is banned here.<br><br>Ms De Cruz would have died, except that her fiance, actor Pierre Png, donated part of his liver to her for a transplant in May last year.<br><br>Mr Png, 28, was in court to support her yesterday. The actress' sister, Wendy, her brother-in-law Kevin Pereira, her secondary school friends and members of Mr Png's family were also present.<br><br>Reporters and curious bystanders were not allowed into the courtroom once the public gallery was full.<br><br>Policemen on duty later issued 45 green and yellow 'non-transferable passes' to those present so that they could attend the afternoon session.<br><br>About 20 lawyers from four different firms sat along the two bar tables as well as in the press seats. Several were furiously tapping away on their laptops during the hearing.<br><br>Dr Chia, who constantly referred to her clinical notes during the 2 1/2 hours that she was on the stand, said that on one occasion, Ms De Cruz had told her that she had suffered from hallucinations for the past two to three months.<br><br>'When she closed her eyes, she said she would see people she did not know. She also had not slept in the last two days and was feeling frustrated,' she said.<br><br>Cross-examined by lawyers for the defendants, the doctor said she had been unable to find the cause of her patient's severe hepatitis despite running several tests.<br><br>She then consulted another gastroenterologist, Dr Richard Guan, for a second opinion.<br><br>'I believe Dr Guan has 10 years more experience than me. I know his interest is in hepatitis. The reason I called him was that the patient and her family members wanted a second opinion. That also helped to appease their anxiety,' she said in reply to Mr Tan's lawyer, Mr Lok Vi Ming.<br><br>Dr Chia, who has been practising since 1984, said Ms De Cruz had told her she had taken antioxidants Spirulina and Pycnogenol as health supplements for 2 1/2 years, but stopped in March last year - a month before being admitted to Mount Alvernia.<br><br>The actress was transferred to the National University Hospital on May 4 and underwent the liver transplant at Gleneagles Hospital on May 7.<br><br>Her lawyer, Mr Raj Singam, said in his opening address that, despite the success of the transplant, there was a lifelong threat that her body might reject the liver, so she must take steroids, immunosuppressants and vitamins for the rest of her life.<br><br>When the case adjourned for the day, a visibly pale and weary Ms De Cruz said she was feeling 'okay, but drained and very tired'.<br><br>She is expected to take the stand today.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">DAY 1 OF SLIM 10 SUIT</span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hearing opens for TV actress' Slim 10 suit<br>SINGAPORE -- MediaCorp actress actress Andrea De Cruz began a High Court lawsuit on Monday seeking damages for liver failure she alleged was caused by taking the Chinese-made Slim 10 diet pills.<br><br>Ms De Cruz appeared in court at the start of what is slated to be a three-week trial accompanied by her fiance, Pierre Png, who donated part of his liver to save her life last year.<br><br>The 29-year-old actress alleged in a statement her lawyers submitted to the court that the Slim 10 pills nearly killed her.<br><br>'Shortly after consuming the pills the plaintiff's liver failed dramatically and she came close to losing her life,' the statement said.<br><br>'She was saved only by a successful liver transplant from her fiance.'<br><br>The statement said that although Ms De Cruz survived the ordeal, she would never fully recover. It said that the incident was 'a painful experience which has left her physically, emotionally and mentally scarred for life'.<br><br>The statement alleged that the pills were not 100-per-cent herbal as claimed by the defendants, and in fact contained potentially fatal poisons including fenfluramine.<br><br>She is suing five defendants, including distributor TV Media, importer Semon Liu and his company, Health Biz, as well as MediaCorp actor Rayson Tan, who allegedly sold her the pills.<br><br>Lawyers for four of the defendants - the Chinese manufacturers of the pills have since disbanded and cannot be traced - said in court on Monday that Ms De Cruz's liver failure may have been caused by her travels to Thailand or by eating raw fish.<br><br>Monday's hearing was taken up with evidence by Dr Chai Siew Cheng, who treated Ms De Cruz when she turned up at Mt Alvernia hospital suffering hepatitis-like symptoms in April last year.<br><br>She is expected to give evidence in court on Tuesday. -- AFP<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actress Andrea De Cruz is taking the stand at a trial that is attracting lots of interest<br>THE Slim 10 saga returns to the legal limelight today.<br><br>Apart from the celebrity parade, the case could set a precedent for suits against sellers of defective products.<br><br>Previous cases involving the diet pill were limited to examining the licensing and administrative lapses on the part of the product's distributor, importer and seller.<br><br>In the first civil action over Slim 10, the High Court will hear medical and other evidence on how the pills led to MediaCorp artiste Andrea De Cruz, 29, suffering liver failure.<br><br>Ms De Cruz, who began taking the slimming pill in December 2001, will give her side of the story when she takes the stand as the first witness in her negligence suit against five parties.<br><br>The five defendants are Chinese manufacturer Guangzhou Yuzhitang Health Products Co; Health Biz, the importer, distributor and seller of the pills in Singapore, and its director, Mr Semon Liu; distributor TV Media and MediaCorp actor Rayson Tan Tai Ming, who allegedly sold Ms De Cruz the pills.<br><br>Her case is unprecedented in that there has been no reported case here, or in the region, of parties being sued for negligence over a product.<br><br>As such, some lawyers say the findings of the court may determine whether other people may want to take up similar claims.<br><br>The three-week trial, scheduled until July 11, will be heard by Justice Tay Yong Kwang.<br><br>The television artiste, who is seeking general and special damages for her injuries, almost lost her life after taking the weight-loss pills, which contained fenfluramine, a banned appetite suppressant.<br><br>Fenfluramine has been known to lead to swelling of the thyroid gland, heart-valve disorders and liver toxicity.<br><br>Celebrities figuring in the case will be Ms De Cruz's fiance, actor Pierre Png, 29, who donated part of his liver to her to save her life in May last year, and her colleague Rayson Tan, 38.<br><br>Mr Tan's wife, actress Chen Liping, 38, was the model for the Slim 10 advertisements.<br><br>The Chinese manufacturer is unlikely to be in court as lawyers have been unable to serve a writ on it.<br><br>But distributor TV Media will be flying in two liver experts from Britain and Australia as witnesses.<br><br>They are forensic pharmacologist and toxicologist David Joyce, an associate professor at the University of Western Australia, and Dr Julia Wendon, a senior lecturer attached to King's College Hospital's liver unit.<br><br>TV Media was fined $64,000 in July last year for selling the pills to pharmacies without a wholesale dealer's licence and for continuing to supply the product after the health authorities had recalled it.<br><br>In recent months, TV Media, whose business has been hit by the scandal, closed its last three TV Innovations retail outlets at Centrepoint, Bugis Junction and Shaw Towers.<br><br>Rounding off the defendants will be Health Biz, and its director, Mr Semon Liu, 33.<br><br>In September last year, Health Biz was fined $45,000 for breaching licensing regulations and failing to keep import records.<br><br>Sixteen charges under the Poisons Act and one for failing to keep records were withdrawn against Mr Liu, who was acquitted.<br><br>Ms De Cruz, who will wed this October, has claimed that she has been emotionally scarred by the whole episode.<br><br>For the rest of her life, she has to take, on and off, a cocktail of vitamins, steroids and immunosuppressants.<br><br>Among the more than a dozen people who had complained of health problems after taking the slimming tablets was logistics executive Selvarani Raja, 43, who died from liver failure on June 1 last year.<br><br>At a coroner's inquiry in March this year, the State Coroner found that the Slim 10 pills that she took to lose weight killed her.<br><br>Her sister has, through law firm Drew &amp; Napier, sent letters of demand to several potential defendants.<br><br>Mr R. Raj Singam and Mr Wendell Wong will act for Ms De Cruz.<br><br>Mr Simon Tan will act for Health Biz and Mr Liu; Mr B. Rao and Mr Gino Hardial Singh will act for TV Media, while Mr Lok Vi Ming and Mr Kelvin Poon appear for Mr Tan.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Totally agree... Now she can say whatever she wants, like wanting to have a lot of babies, not feeling well etc. But if she not feeling well, how come she can still participates in the variety shows and hosting the outdoor programs like the "stepout singapore" at Marina Square area. She can sue the manufacturer (obvious! For using a banned product) and the distributor (cos they never check properly before bringing in the medication). But she is the one to decide if she wants to buy and use the product! And if she wantsto get a cheap lobang and get from Rayson, then that's her own problem.
