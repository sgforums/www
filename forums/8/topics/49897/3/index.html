            <div class='col-md body'>StraitsTimes<br><br>Andrea convinced by colleague's diet pill ads, court told<br>Ms Chen Liping's weight loss was astounding, she says, so she bought pills from colleague's husband Rayson Tan.<br><br>By Elena Chong and Glenys Sim<br><br>THE disputed roles of a husband-and-wife celebrity couple provided most of the sparks during the third day of the Slim 10 hearing.<br><br>Certainly, Mr Rayson Tan and Ms Chen Liping, both 38, were said to have had parts to play in how actress Andrea De Cruz came to down the slimming pills which would land her in hospital.<br><br>Mr Tan, a defendant in the suit, allegedly sold her the pills. Ms Chen, his wife, was both the actress' colleague and the model for TV advertisements that, Ms De Cruz says, convinced her to buy the product.<br><br>The advertisements began screening in January last year and were produced by Slim 10 distributor TV Media, also a defendant.<br><br>The company's lawyer tried to downplay the role that these commercials could have played in Ms De Cruz's decision.<br><br>After all, Mr B. Rao put it to Ms De Cruz on the witness stand, she would have seen fellow colleague Chen Liping in person, as they were shooting the Channel 8 TV series No Problem together.<br><br>She would not, he said, have needed advertisements to tell her that Ms Chen had lost weight.<br><br>But Ms De Cruz insisted she had relied on the 'totally convincing' commercials: for instance, on the before-and-after pictures in both the English- and Mandarin-language versions of the advertisement, images which provided evidence of her colleague's 'astounding' weight loss.<br><br>This weight loss, she maintained, was simply not noticeable before the filming of No Problem, a Chinese-language drama.<br><br>And, during filming between December 2001 and early last year, she said she had not seen Ms Chen that often as her scenes were mostly with Mr Tan.<br><br>So it was the 30-second advertisement - played in court on Tuesday and replayed again yesterday - which had clued her in to a remarkable loss in weight, she said.<br><br>Earlier in the day, Mr Tan's role had been in the limelight.<br><br>Mr Rao noted that, in his affidavit, Mr Tan recalled Ms De Cruz sending him an SMS to order more pills.<br><br>This was on March 21 last year, the lawyer argued, showing that she had already finished or was about to finish a batch of pills and was keen for a second lot.<br><br>She was so keen, according to Mr Tan's affidavit, that she subsequently also 'called me to request that I help her purchase another two bottles'.<br><br>But Ms De Cruz gave a different account when quizzed in the witness box.<br><br>She said she did not remember sending the SMS.<br><br>When asked, 'Did you indeed call?', she replied firmly, 'Not that I can recall'.<br><br>It is Mr Tan's argument that he did not solicit her business but had supplied her the pills as a favour.<br><br>In fact, according to his affidavit, he had actually advised her against taking any more pills as she was 'already very slim'.<br><br>Ms De Cruz, who said she began taking the pills around the end of her filming of No Problem in late January or early February last year, denied this yesterday.<br><br>Just when she began taking Slim 10 was another question mark.<br><br>She told transplant surgeon K.C. Tan that she had taken the pills three times a day from November 2001 to February last year. Yet, the Slim 10 advertisements only started running in January last year.<br><br>When Mr Rao asked her how it was that Dr K.C. Tan had recorded those dates in his report, Ms De Cruz said that she had no idea and did not recall speaking to the doctor before her transplant.<br><br>Her fiance, actor Pierre Png, 29, donated part of his liver to her in May last year to save her life.<br><br>Asked why she had bought the pills from Mr Rayson Tan which were in unmarked vials, sachets and plastic bottles, she said those pills were exactly the ones she saw on television.<br><br>'I had no reason to doubt that they were not Slim 10.<br><br>'It was, after all, sold to me by the husband of the spokesman for Slim 10,' she added.<br><br>Ms De Cruz appeared steady and composed on the stand until late afternoon when she suddenly felt unwell.<br><br>The High Court case was then adjourned until today.<br><br><img src="http://www.straitstimes.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2003-06-26/h2a.jpg">Ms Chen Liping's (left) weight loss was astounding, said De Cruz, so she bought pills from colleague's husband Rayson Tan.</div>

'I guess that will not happen in this lifetime.'<br><br>Describing how Slim 10 diet pills had devastated her life, she said she used to be healthy, active and outdoorsy.<br><br>After undergoing a liver transplant in May last year, she got sick easily and frequently. The medication she takes to prevent her body from rejecting the liver her fiance donated, made her tired and ultra-sensitive to the sun.<br><br>She was giving evidence in the High Court trial in which she is claiming more than $1 million in damages from four parties involved in the distribution and sale of the diet pills that she claims caused her liver failure.<br><br>Video: Watch Channel i News Clips on this<br><br>She said that about 2 1/2 weeks ago, her blood platelets dropped to a dangerously low level and she found a lot of blood in her mouth.<br><br>'It was a big shock for us because I had just passed my one-year transplant date. We were all very excited and happy that I had made it to the one-year mark,' Ms De Cruz said.<br><br>Dr K.C. Tan, the liver surgeon who performed her transplant, advised her to stay in hospital, but she refused to be warded because she had exhausted her insurance policies and could not afford to pay any more hospital bills.<br><br>Ms De Cruz broke down as she told how her relationship with her future husband had changed as a result of the transplant.<br><br>'He goes on outings on his own, he goes to the gym while I can't, he swims and cycles, and I am not able to join him in such activities any more,' she said.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>'The 30-second advertisement that changed my life forever...'<br>Andrea says Liping's weight loss convinced her to try Slim 10 pills<br><br>By Elena Chong and Karen Ho<br><br>A 30-SECOND television advertisement for Slim 10, featuring MediaCorp's Chen Liping, was held up yesterday as the reason actress Andrea De Cruz took the pills which allegedly caused her liver to fail.<br><br>The 29-year-old told the High Court that the commercial, run by company TV Media, was so convincing she decided to try the weight-loss herbal pills for herself.<br><br>And to prove her point, she asked her lawyers to show the commercial, run in 2001, in Chinese and English to a packed courtroom.<br><br>She had said in her affidavit: 'The TV Media advertisements were very believable because Liping was well known for having been pudgy, and here she was in the advertisements looking so slim.<br><br>'It was totally convincing.'<br><br>So, Ms De Cruz, who was working with Madam Chen and her husband, Mr Rayson Tan Tai Ming, 38, on the Channel 8 drama No Problem in December 2001, asked him to order her some pills as he knew the importer's boss.<br><br>She ordered three batches of the China-made pills and consumed the first two - comprising two test tubes and two aluminium-foil packets - from late January or early February to March last year.<br><br>Before she could collect the third batch, she was warded for severe hepatitis.<br><br>Mr Tan is one of four defendants being sued by Ms De Cruz. The other three are the pills' importer, Health Biz, its director, Mr Semon Liu, 33, and distributor TV Media.<br><br>The manufacturer, Guangzhou Yuzhitang Health Products Co, has not been served the writ yet.<br><br>When asked to react to Madam Chen's statement in her affidavit that her husband felt betrayed by Ms De Cruz, she was visibly upset, and said in a raised voice: 'If Chen really knew the word betrayal... if she knew what the meaning was, I don't think she would even have dared use it.<br><br>'Betrayal is when a trusted colleague sells you pills that nearly took your life. Further betrayal is when you found out that this colleague actually profited while you were hanging on for dear life.'<br><br>She added: 'I had a lot of stamina. I thoroughly enjoyed what I did. After taking Slim 10, everything has changed.'<br><br>During the proceedings, she got testy when Mr Simon Tan, lawyer for Health Biz and Mr Liu, pressed her repeatedly about when she had taken the slimming pills.<br><br>He pointed out that she had told Mount Alvernia Hospital's Dr Chia Siew Cheng she had taken them between December 2001 and early January last year, but said in her June 6 affidavit 'that I started taking the pills sometime in late January or early February 2002, and stopped taking them in April 2002'.<br><br>She said under cross-examination that she was 'slipping in and out of consciousness' during her stay in hospital.<br><br>Referring to the death a year ago of another Slim 10 taker, logistics executive Selvarani Raja, Ms De Cruz said: 'I feel that what happened to Miss Raja could have been a reflection of how my life could have turned out. She said in her last days that she wanted justice to be done and she is watching over me.'<br><br>Ms De Cruz, her hair in a neat chignon and dressed in a long-sleeved, ruffled white blouse and fitted grey pants, started off the second day of the court case smiling and looking refreshed.<br><br>But as the day progressed, she began rubbing her temples and massaging her neck.<br><br>She asked for two short breaks - once at 11.55am, when she broke down, and later at about 3.40pm, when she broke down again. She was trembling and told Justice Tay Yong Kwang that she had a bad migraine.<br><br>The case was adjourned after that until today.<br><br></div>

Her medication increases the risk of skin cancer and she fears going out in the sun, she added.<br><br>She also said she feels having children with fellow actor Pierre Png, now her fiance, would be too risky for her. Png donated part of his liver to save her last year, and the couple have tentative plans to get married on Oct 18 this year.<br><br>'Our dream was to have about six children,' she told the court. 'I've just given up on the idea.'<br><br>The pills' Chinese manufacturer is also named in the suit, but Ms De Cruz's lawyers said they were unable to serve the company court papers because it had abandoned its offices.<br><br>She is also suing the pills' distributor, TV Media, and actor Rayson Tan Tai Ming, who sold the pills to her, the documents said.<br><br>Another Singapore woman who took the pills, 43-year-old Selvarani Raja, died after suffering liver failure. Five women died in Japan.<br><br>A Singapore coroner ruled in March that there was proof the pills killed Ms Raja and that the importers and distributors were criminally negligent.<br><br>The Government has filed criminal charges against Health Biz. If convicted, the company faces a maximum fine of S$165,000 (US$92,000). -- AP, AFP<br></div>

The actress' sister, Wendy, her brother-in-law Kevin Pereira, her secondary school friends and members of Mr Png's family were also present.<br><br>Reporters and curious bystanders were not allowed into the courtroom once the public gallery was full.<br><br>Policemen on duty later issued 45 green and yellow 'non-transferable passes' to those present so that they could attend the afternoon session.<br><br>About 20 lawyers from four different firms sat along the two bar tables as well as in the press seats. Several were furiously tapping away on their laptops during the hearing.<br><br>Dr Chia, who constantly referred to her clinical notes during the 2 1/2 hours that she was on the stand, said that on one occasion, Ms De Cruz had told her that she had suffered from hallucinations for the past two to three months.<br><br>'When she closed her eyes, she said she would see people she did not know. She also had not slept in the last two days and was feeling frustrated,' she said.<br><br>Cross-examined by lawyers for the defendants, the doctor said she had been unable to find the cause of her patient's severe hepatitis despite running several tests.<br><br>She then consulted another gastroenterologist, Dr Richard Guan, for a second opinion.<br><br>'I believe Dr Guan has 10 years more experience than me. I know his interest is in hepatitis. The reason I called him was that the patient and her family members wanted a second opinion. That also helped to appease their anxiety,' she said in reply to Mr Tan's lawyer, Mr Lok Vi Ming.<br><br>Dr Chia, who has been practising since 1984, said Ms De Cruz had told her she had taken antioxidants Spirulina and Pycnogenol as health supplements for 2 1/2 years, but stopped in March last year - a month before being admitted to Mount Alvernia.<br><br>The actress was transferred to the National University Hospital on May 4 and underwent the liver transplant at Gleneagles Hospital on May 7.<br><br>Her lawyer, Mr Raj Singam, said in his opening address that, despite the success of the transplant, there was a lifelong threat that her body might reject the liver, so she must take steroids, immunosuppressants and vitamins for the rest of her life.<br><br>When the case adjourned for the day, a visibly pale and weary Ms De Cruz said she was feeling 'okay, but drained and very tired'.<br><br>She is expected to take the stand today.<br><br><strong>WHO SHE'S SUING </strong><br>1 Manufacturer Guangzhou Yuzhitang Health Products Co<br><br>2 Media- Corp actor Rayson Tan<br><br>3 Health Biz, the company that imported the tablets<br><br>4 Health Biz boss Semon Liu<br><br>5 Distributor TV Media<br><br></div>
