            <div class='col-md body'>IQ or EQ is just a measure of a quality in that person. later borns tends to have lower IQ than first borns, and usually first borns would pair up with later borns, and vice versa. However, having lower IQ may not mean that your partner is not able to master a skill, and therefore he/she will be better in that field when it comes to socializing with people in that subject. If you're do not have that knowledge, I wonder who would be the one who is embarrassed... ehheh~ Therefore IQ or EQ is not really that important as both have their own area of expertise.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Bear:</div><div class="quote_body">IQ or EQ is just a measure of a quality in that person. later borns tends to have lower IQ than first borns, and usually first borns would pair up with later borns, and vice versa. However, having lower IQ may not mean that your partner is not able to master a skill, and therefore he/she will be better in that field when it comes to socializing with people in that subject. If you're do not have that knowledge, I wonder who would be the one who is embarrassed... ehheh~ Therefore IQ or EQ is not really that important as both have their own area of expertise.</div></blockquote>Err, Bear, that's technically incorrect.  Regardless of the test used, the formula for IQ is (Mental age / Chronological age) * 100.  If your IQ is 110, you have the ability level expected of someone 110% your age.<br><br>The implication of this is of course that if your ability level remainsd constant, your IQ drops as you get older.<br><br>Regardless of the test used, a score of 100 is always the average and the standard deviation is always 15.  A rule-of-thumb interpretation of a standard deviation is that it results in a difference that can be observed without the need for using a test.  In other words, a person with an IQ of 115 and above would be easily recognisable as having higher-than-average intellectual abilities.<br><br>As for hoganrock's question, I typically score between 137 and 142 - in my profession, I often play guinea pig for colleagues.  I wouldn't say that I have difficulty interacting with people who are one standard deviation on either side of my score, although the MENSA crowd can occasionally be a pain in the arse.  That said, if someone does not offer an intellectual challenge, I usually lose interest quickly and walk away.</div>
