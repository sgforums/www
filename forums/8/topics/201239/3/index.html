E.G. seoul garden. Prepare a small cake for her (NEVER EVER GET A CAKE WITH FULL OF CREAMS ) u know la, girls always say they are fat liao dowan eat so much cream so be considerate abit and get her a small cake. Then during the cake cutting time, stand up and <span style="color: blue;">sing her a romantic love song</span> loudly so that all her frds can hear u. after the song then u start the birthday song.<br><br>Consequences :<br><br>1) she'll be touched but if she really have no feelings for u she'll reject u. But on the other hand u have achieved ur goal to give her a memorable birthday.<br><br>2) she'll be so touched that she cried out tears of joy. and now is ur chance to attack by giving her a pat on the back and pass her a tissue. U might have a slight chance to be with her too.<br><br>Either ways u will still leave a memorable birthday for her to remember for life. Good luck </div></blockquote>Seem like a greaaat idea~!!.

            <div class='col-md body'>think of the song urself. u know the girl best, so think of a suitable song for her. it can be in english or chinese whichever u feel more confortable singing in. even if u forget the lyrics try to continue singing the whole song by changing the lyrics here and there to make it into a song of love proposal. u need good brains to do this.</div>

Just be yourself and you will never be able to get your feelings across to her for eternity.<br><br>I think you're too young and immature to even try this kind of stunt anyway, so you shouldn't even try it. Reason is because you as a guy, has no balls nor ability to approach and converse with the gal that you liked...and yet you want to do something special for her. This kind of action isn't exactly going to please any gal, it's going to be a huge turn-off unless she also secretly liked you. If that is so, then you wouldn't have lost your balls wouldn't it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Instead of coming here and criticise our post and rejecting our ideas with your limited understanding, why don't you show a bit of gratefulness and shut that trap of yours? IF you do not know how to restrain yourself in reality, then you'll just end up pissing everyone around you in real life.<br><br>I've already told you the truth but you merely wanted something more and contradicting to your initial post. Please do not even bother to try any of our ideas cos it doesn't comes from you and you will fail cos you will never be able to do it naturally.<br><br>And please leave that poor girl alone and don't bother to terrorise her with our stunts, it's going to be her 17th birthday soon and you don't deserve her at all. She deserves to be with someone alot better than you.<br><br>Come back to reality please. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div>
