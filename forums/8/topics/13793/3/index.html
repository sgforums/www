They SERVED the countries WELL (in terms of maintaining WEALTH and STABILITY... In a sense...)....<br><br>BUT I CAN'T deny what you had just SAID... Although there're really some 'theories' behind it... They're VERY LOGICAL creatures... Perhaps that's what make them 'GOOD' and at the same time makes them 'BAD'... PERSONALLY, I think they should be more HUMANE... Their ORIGINAL(?) 'sense of touch' is LOSING with the people... But they're SMART creatures... They're still 'touching' but on the 'RIGHT SPOTS' and in the 'RIGHT WAYs'.....<br><br>They CONSTANTLY mention that SINGAPOREANS are LOSING their INTEGRITY and SENSE of GRATITUDE.... I say they MOST PROBABLY have NOT... And for those SAD CASES who HAVE CHANGED.... WONDER WHO TAUGHT THEM SO...?<br><br>The LAUGHING STOCK recently is to implement that people gives SUGGESTIONs as CONTRIBUTIONS to the COUNTRY's GROWTH... I KNOW it's a GREAT IDEA IF REALISED.... But AT THE SAME TIME I also WISH to KNOW who's getting the HIGH PAY and STILL can ask the people to get their JOB DONE? When the PEOPLE can't even AFFORD to take care of themselves...<br><br>SINGAPOREANS are NO IDIOLS... WE can be PEACE-LOVERS... WE can be EDUCATED... But when you're talking about a WALKING TIME-BOMB... SINGAPORE's TOO SMALL a PLACE for such an EXPLOSION....<br><br>When MAJORITY of the PEOPLE THINK you're WRONG.... Do you STILL INSIST that you're 'RIGHT'....? What's MILLIONS after MILLIONS when you're just MADE of FLESH and BONE... Waiting to be BURIED one day....? GO GET YOURSELF A RELIGION... JUST ANY RELIGION WHICH TEACHES HUMANE....<br><br>------------------<br>In LIGHT I shall FEAR NOT. FOR what I AM is CUT so DEEP inside of ME.<br>I LIVE my FLESH and SOUL ONLY to BLEED for the OTHERS.<br>FEAR ME NOT. FOR I AM YOUR 'MASTER'. GIVE YOU STRENGTH. FOR YOU ARE MY 'ENEMY'.<br>DEVIL PHRASE I<br><br>I have no 'friends' nor 'family'.<br>I hold no past and see not future...<br>These are just samples of illusions....<br>I don't exist, but I shall live ETERNITY.....  DEVIL PHRASE II<br><br>Though NOT the RIGHT thing to do,<br>This might be the ONLY NATURAL thing to be...<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Just like heat</span> is produced when work done...<br><span style="font-style: italic;">EVIL</span> is the GENERATION of SYSTEM FLAWS... <strong>DEVIL PHRASE III</strong><br><br>In DREAMS you CAN NEVER DIE.....<br>For YOUR LIFE is about the EXISTENCE of....<br>Your Happiness.... Your Sadness... Your Pain.... Your Pleasure....<br>Like a painted sky, when it rains... All CEASE to BE...    DEVIL PHRASE IV<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Through Chaos the Devil gain strength,<br>to face the lord, his Creator.<br>Through his questionings, he recovered his true existence...<br>Good &amp; Evil, Can they co-exists in harmony?</span>  DEVIL PHRASE V<br><br>When Law &amp; Rules are there,<br>they are NOT about JUSTICE.<br>While reality &amp; dreams are there,<br>they are NOT about SURVIVAL..<br><br>And Life &amp; Death NOT about LIVING...<br>Good &amp; Evil NOT about definitions....<br><br>IF truly there is EVIL, it is NOT just one of its kind......<br><br>DEVIL'S SEVENTH PHRASE<br><br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>
