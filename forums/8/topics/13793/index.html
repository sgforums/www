No right??<br><br>There were so many events that could have led us on a strike against Malaysia / Indonesia - for example, Habebe / Warhid's conversation which accuse Singaporeans / Singapore, Mahathir increasing the price of water for sale to Singapore, Malaysia complaining Singapore's CPF policy to Malaysian and Tanjong Pagar railway etc etc<br>Still we never go on strike. It's beacuse we are quite contented with our lives.<br><br>But look at Indonesia and Malaysia - they have resources that seem like a endless flow of river, they have manpower thousands times more than Singapore, they have land space which is the size of thousands of singapore put together.....<br><br>yet they are still not contented.<br>What the hell is wrong with them??  you tell me?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rapture (edited 26 February 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agree to some extent. Singapore are not really content with their life. It's just that the government policy had made everyone apathetic.<br><br>Rapture think b4 you complain why singaporean never go on strike but others do. Do you dare to go on strike in the first place? It's a controlled country, everything you do, you will feel controlled. That's the reason why singaporean is considered gutless. When it's controlled to such an extent, everyone think the government is in-charge, anything happen is not their problem but the government. Everyone is being apathetic and scared of trouble. Nobody dare to speak up even for themselve, who ever dare to speak up for others then? When LKY made a mistake do you dare to speak up and point out his mistake publicly? Well, the thinking of a typical singaporean is not to bother too much, as long as there is job, there is salary, they are happy. Even if the prices go high up, they can only grumble and do nothing. Worst come to worst the smart and rich one will migrate to other places with their money.</div>

Then you tell me why Singaporeans are gutless to strike?<br>If you say it's because the government catches people who strike, didnt other countries do that as well? Note that the police from China/Korea catches strikers, yet the strikers dont care too !<br></div></blockquote>These strikers don't care because they have the same mentality as those religious fanatic. They think that there's a heaven waiting for them up there when they did something and die for their faith and they will be remembered. Do you then? When their fellow pple or faith are being insulted upon, they will just strike back. Sound familiar? Same idea why the fish is defending his faith so much that he don't care whether his love one or friends will leave him or not? There's a heaven waiting for him, why should he bother about the well-being of others who's not in line with him? Singaporean are mostly educated and more practical. Most understand belief is just a belief, there's no need to indugle into such thing seriously when they got a life to take care of. Furthermore, we are cultivated to be apathetic by our system. Who will bother to strike?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 26 February 2002).]</div>
