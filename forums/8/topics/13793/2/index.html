            <div class='col-md body'>I think the 'problems' mentioned in Rapture's 1st original post... Mainly POLITICS... Very TIRING thing to say... I HATE POLITICS.... (And HISTORY, I ALWAYS FAIL my HISTORY...)<br><br>MALAYSIA's WARNING. It's COMMON. Ever since the SEPARATION of Singapore from Malaysia and gain its INDEPENDENCE.... There'd always been SPARKS of WARNINGS... JEALOUSY? Maybe? After what Singapore have achieved through its SEPARATION from Malaysia... This can be EXPECTED... PERSONALLY, I think Malaysia should view Singapore just like the way Singaporeans were asked to view China... As a FRIEND but NOT FOE... But I think they're really just MAKING USE of EACH OTHER...<br><br>Indonesia and LKY's CLAIM... NOTHING PERSONAL... Speaking up for LKY this time... 1st CRUCIAL POINT to note.. TERRORISM's IMPACT on USA. Which country ain't afraid of it? The MUSLIM COUNTRIES... Are they the CULPRIT and BAD GUYS? I GUESS not (for now)..? Should some PSYCHO from other RACE or RELIGION go do some 'display' in their countries? I guess NOT? Or it shall be END OF DAY SOON.... TOTAL CHAOS.... THINK Singapore. Like FireIce's mention. Small Red Dot. TERRORISM's IMPACT on SINGAPORE. Do you THINK we have SO MANY people to be KILLED? Should LKY be CRYING OUT and PANIC? YES. For WHO? SINGAPOREANS.<br><br>INDONESIA however VIEWS it from a DIFFERENT POINT. They're being more like DEFENSIVE than AGGRESSIVE. MUSLIM's recent 9-11 CRASH with USA. INDONESIA and MALAYSIA feels at THREAT. MALAYSIA is 'responding well'. INDONESIA's ADVANTAGES had TURNED AGAINST IT. BIG PIECE of LAND and LOTS of PEOPLE. INDONESIA has always been 'known' for its CHAOTIC to a certain extent. When USA attack OSAMA. INDONESIA gov. has to WORRY about its PEOPLE. NOW here comes the SANDWICH. INTERNAL CHAOS and EXTERNAL PRESSURE to 'clean up terrorists'. LKY's REMARK is DEFINITELY a NUISANCE. If not a THREAT. Just like HOW Pakistan MADE USE of USA to RID its ENEMY. They FEAR LKY riding the same cloud, what more SINGAPORE definitely have the ADVANTAGE with USA over INDONESIA?<br><br>KNOWING THIS. LKY still have to work FAST. For his GREATEST FEAR (If he has already REALISED IT) is NOT the TERRORISM at PRESENT. It's EVEN FAR BETTER than that. TERRORISM HAS TO BE REMOVED. NO FURTHER ELABORATION as this is a DANGEROUS MINDSET.<br><br>Like Bigdeal has MENTIONED, there's LITTLE we can do about the situation. It's also 'good' enough. The LAST THING we can use is MORE TENSION?<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">SEPARATE ISSUE</span></strong><br><br><strong>Rapture</strong> that is very true but have you ever seen Singaporeans going on strike in the streets, burning Indonesia flags, scolding Mahathir outside Malaysian embassy? No right??<br><br><strong>delerium</strong> It's not because Singaporeans are contented. It's because Singaporeans generally have no guts; just know how to complain and do nothing.<br><br>1st for delerium. Nothing personal. It is PRECISELY the SAME MIND FRAME which brought the TERRORIST out to their WAR AGAINST the WORLD. They're NOT CONTENTED. And they've GOT GUTS. And they DECIDED to 'do something about it'.<br><br>2nd for Rapture. We have a MIXTURE of people here in this CONTROLLED COUNTRY. Some FEAR of TROUBLE. Their 'selfish gene' ask them to take care of themselves 1st, just the way they're TAUGHT. I remember Jack Neo ONCE SAID in his movie 'Money Not Enough',"UNLESS the government ask us to burn the other countries' flags, if not why we burn it? Wait kena fine?" Or something like that... In Singapore, we're TAUGHT to be DISCIPLINED (Have you served your NS?). Do you KNOW the DIFFERENCE between TERRORIST and STRIKERS? TERRORIST are ORGANISED and WORKS on DESTROYING EXTERNAL TARGET(s). However, STRIKERS usually just WORKS on GAINING INTERNAL OBJECTIVE(s). TERRORIST are usually EXTREMIST. STRIKERS depending on their level<br>of work. For the MORE EXTREME CASES, innocent people (difer terrorist in the sense that 'innocent people' are often targets or 'can be sacrificed'. Whereas, in this case it's usually unintentional) get killed or injuried. 'Internal Destruction' (talking about destruction within a country) usually occur rendering in the LOSS of $$$ and making the country more VULNERABLE to EXTERNAL ATTACKS and INTERFERENCES. BOTH TERRORIST and STRIKERS is OUT to CONVEY their MESSAGES because they ain't heard. But should be ADOPTED only in 'DRIVEN to the WALL' cases or in STRIKERS' CASE, MILD LEVEL. But STRIKERS's LEVEL of WORK also depends on the CONSEQUENCE of BEING CAUGHT after its work is UNSUCCESSFUL, also taking into CONSIDERATION the POSSIBILITY of another FORM UP would be MORE DIFFICULT. When HANDLED with EXTREME FORCE, STRIKERS can often be POTENTIAL TERRORIST.<br><br>The FACT is Singapore gov. do NOT like unneccessary INTERFERENCE of SINGAPOREANs into their PLANS and ACTIVITIES.<br><br>HMM... HOPEFULLY, the WORSE won't COME ALIVE?</div>
