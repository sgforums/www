            <div class='col-md body'>It seems that this year's star awards results are quite unexpected. People like Sharon Au, Michelle Chia, Ivy Lee and Cynthia Koh are being voted into Top 10 and Best actress respectively.<br><br>Heard the results and still quite surprised. Anyway, we can guess who are already in the Top 10 (regulars like Zoe, Fann, Eve, etc) but 'dark horses' like Sharon, Michelle and Ivy are quite unexpected.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually i'm pretty surprised that people would say that the results are pre-picked just coz they showed the footage of Thomas Ong thanking his supporters...I mean...he is quite popular, and it makes sense for TCS to make contingency plans in case he really gets into top 10. it doesnt take a lot of effort to just ask him to imagine that he and won and ask him to say a few words &amp; filming it down...if he didnt win, then no need to show lah...but if he did, then at least he gets to say his thanks...this kind of scenario is quite familiar in awards ceremony...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think that the results are really "pre-packed" though there times which really looks like it. A pre-recorded thank u speech might mean that they let the winner know first and do the pre-recording after the result is finalised. If you have watched "933jin Qu Jiang",u'll also see a pre-recorded thank u speech.<br><br>A feel that TCS takes care of the reputation of their Ah Ge &amp; Ah Jie first.Ppl like Zoe &amp; Fann is like a sure nominee for the best actress award.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well Raychel, I agree that Ivy Lee did immprove on her acting, however, the award in question is the 'Best Actress', not 'Improved the Most Actress'.<br>Therefore, I feel that Cynthia deserved the prize...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well SuKii...<br>it may not be the "Actress who improved the most" award, but let me tell you something and see if it makes sense to you.<br><br>if she improves her acting, she won't just be a pretty face on TV. so, maybe some pple might change their minds abt calling her lousy and they may even start liking her. that way, she has more fans and is more popular. yeah?</div>
