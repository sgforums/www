            <div class='col-md body'>To fall in love is easy... to make another person fall in love with you needs proper planning. Why is it so easy for others and difficult for some? Its all in the mind - those who believe it is easy will show ample confidence which draws - while those who feel it is difficult will give hinder you as you stammer, you feel uncomfortable, etc. Such signs are so easily recongise by the opposite gender which puts you in a disadvantage unless they already fond of you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Never have a gf for 21 years doesn't mean that there is something wrong with you. It simply means that its not the time - and this time is set by YOU, when you decide to do something about it. Disatisfaction beings about action, driven by your emotional needs for a someone there. BUT this disatisfaction must not cloud your rational sense to chase anybody on the street or anyone which you will ultimately regret because they doesn't even fit your bill OR you have little feelings, BUT you chose to give a chance to see how a relation is like. Such will only end in disaster. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>To make first move = to make her fall for you. It does not take need Takuya to do all that - but he has the advantage though. Before you began your campaign, you have to know what you are looking for. Going through the market without knowing what you want to get will only cause delay. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>After the initial stage of knowing yourself and find that she is suitable or close to 85%, you may began. My advice is that look for somenoe, whose looks factor is around or 1 - 2 points above you. It would be easier to execute plans.<br><br>For your case, I suggest you go by Direct Flow Stealth - in my unorthodox teaching - which means that you are advancing in the dark at a steady pace. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Casual friends &gt; friends &gt; good friends &gt; best friend/girl friend<br><br>This cycle will advance or retreat according to the effort put in to mantain and built. If you believe in platonic friend, it will advance to the best friend path unless you want it to steer the other path.<br>Direct flow refers to building a stable foundation before advancing to the next stage. Some people are able to jump stages -but for you, just leave it as it is <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Making moves in the dark = do not acknowledge your liking to her... yet. I suspect that you may not hide your actions and may made it seemed all to direct. Change your thoughts of her as 'A GOOD friend' instead of someone you want to go after - this is very effective. Regardless of what moves you want to execute, remember: ALWAYS be yourself, because when you are being yourself, you are in your MOST comfortable mode. This is confidence and everyone should be with or like you for who you are. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The must have in your first move: Confidence (whatever you want to do, DO it as if you have DONE it a MILLION times, don't stammer, don't act strange) and etiquette, a reasonable talker. If you can't even communicate well with her - forget about making the first move. If you are able to communicate, she will feel comfortable in your presence because she can talk to you and not end up watching TV (Unbeatable III) while eating in Kopi Tiam (Char kwey tiao, no hum), and all that are more interesting than you. When she feels comfortable with you - her barrier to you is reduced, which means more susceptible to your moves. Advance steadily and gradually, DO NOT pause for a moment because it may be the turning point. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Then when you deemed that she has fallen for you, strike when the iron is hot. NEVER dilly dally until someone else comes about and take whats yours - too late to regret. When woman has overflowing emotions and you pop the question, you should be able to get her unless other unseen factors is hidden behind the picture. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers, (Courtesy of Unorthodox teaching - CloUdiSm)<br><br></div>

Basically confidence is an energy that makes you feel at home with yourself and the force that could allow you to perform task without breaking out beads of cold sweat that reveal that you are a newbie. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Look at those 'xiao bengs' on the street for example: You find them a nuisense deliquent that waste resources in Sg, but the key is that they DON'T view it the way you do, by smoking, exisiting in groups, become rowdy made them 'cool' - they will feel good. (Confidence follows) If a bald old man with beer belly walk down the street thinking that he is cool, he will be cool. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Dance as if you are a pro...<br>Live as if you can live forever...<br>Love as if you will never get hurt...<br><br>*Shit forget original saying, but the feel is something like that.*<br><br>Confidence derive from sources that gives you security and certaintly. A baby find that he could walk a few steps before losing his balance gains confidences from that few steps - baby preception lies within the steps NOT within the falling. Which means, you will gain experience and confidences from the attempt you try because thats where you will learn from it. If you have hundred of people telling you how to make the first move, without your initial first step, you can't walk a mile. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Bend your perception to your advantage - If you feel that communicating with someone you like is stressing and makes your body undergo physical and emotional changes, PSYCHO yourself that the person you will be speaking IS your best friend - someone whom could make you feel comfortable with. Feeling at ease allows you to think, speak cohesively. Together with your own hint of humor - this is charming. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Difference between man and woman - if a group of people are performing on the stage, the woman will tend to notice the best dancer first, while the man, the best looking one. So what does this prove? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Woman looks into inner factor like status, money, character, etc and man being the visual mammal - very subjected to physical looks and figure. So confidence brings up those inner factors and enchance it - a winning catalysis. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you would want further elaboration of what Yunhaier has suggested,you should go to the Relationship section of a bookstore and pick up the relevant self-help books there.But it is no point reading only,you need to apply the principles in real life.So you need lots of practice! Practice it with anyone,not just pretty gals.You should start practising with normal looking gals first,then as your confidence soars with success,slowly start working on prettier gals and then your romantic interest...<br><br>Tell you something.If a gal sees a guy at ease with other gals,she will feel that the guy is something and will have a good impression of him.<br><br>I was in the same situation as you last time.But I have made good progress after following and [/i] practising the principles that Yunhaier mentioned here.Of course,I may still stammer and get a bit nervous at times,but learning is a lifelong process...<br><br>Oh yes,another way to boost confidence is to watch inspirational shows such as The Shawshank Redemption and October Sky if you have not done so.Trust me,your outlook of Life will never be the same again.<br><br>Good Luck and may the Faith be with you.
