There're some lonely rich people around, but if there were so many rich people, they wouldn't be called rich anymore, will they?<br><br>It's hard to state a real requirement for a partner. How do you put in words requirements such as "I want someone I can connect with, talk about anything under the sun with, i don't want someone who is only capable of talking about a narrow spectrum of things.." How do they find a match like that? So if you wanna find someone whom you can connect with, the SDU would not be a good place. There are only so many superficial traits you can name about your ideal partner, but for most things, it's about gut feeling and feeling comfortable with the person.</div>
