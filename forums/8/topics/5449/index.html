            <div class='col-md body'>I was walking by the newspaper stand today when the newpaper caught my eye with one article, usually i buy the straits times but anyway i bought it.<br><br>Inside it was one article that talks about singaporean women going for caucasian guys more and more these days in preference to singaporean males and they talk about why it is so. The resulting conversation was well, dissapointing for singaporean guys and may well rip out the entire ego of guys.<br><br>In one specific conversation with a singaporean female it was quoted that<br><br>"Most single Singaporean women are bright, articulate and sophisticated, but the men are a bunch of deadmeat, loony looking losers."<br><br>In the article it also implied that out of the females interviewed, majority of them thinks that Singaporean men are too conservative with no real intelligence and they plan ahead for everything which makes them dull.<br><br>Kind of saddens me to know that females have this kind of perspective towards guys these days. But the interviewed people were just a minority of singaporeans  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Would love to hear more from females regarding this issue.<br><br>Have a beautiful day<br>Regards,<br>Llyndarae</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know whether u have read my posting before about the whole ang moh and local debate....I know musicwhiz has...<br><br>Anyway, if u missed it, it was exactly about this subject.  While I do agree that many local women do find their men quite dull, a lot of them are ok with it.  Besides most local women still prefer local guys...I'm guessing that it must be the old asian values thing...but I also have a feeling that as they start to break away from these same"values", they will start to see other possibilities....<br><br>...and as sad as it may sound, if u r looking for the really chiao girls, u better be prepared to be just as sophisticated and happening as them.  I have come across many, many instances of the fact that Singaporean women are more open and outgoing than the men.  Just go to any pub or disco and you'll see that it's the women who are out there swaying to the music and having fun....most guys would just stand around...not all but quite a lot.  The imbalance in thinking between local men and women are growing wider and wider....<br><br>...So to all u very conservative guys out there, if u want a pretty and happening chick, be prepared to pay the price....But then again, u might be lucky and snag a looker who is cool with the conservative type.:-) ha ha, don't we all wish right.<br><br>It is universally true that as a person becomes more and more exposed and educated about other people and cultures, the more they will start to break away from the mold that brought them up....Let's look at it this way...<br><br>If u were someone who really enjoys life and it's unpredicatabilities and posiibilities, would you feel satisfaction being with someone who has a hard time expressing such emotions for those same things?  It's like, I wouldn't go and try and get a girl who is totally a study-holic while I'm the party animal type.  While it does happen, I tend to think that it is rare...It's a matter of wanting to be around people who share the same kinds of feelings and toughts as you...I would like to believe, but maybe there's more to it than that.  Maybe these women just think that local men just have small cocks compared to ang moh guys...Who knows?  But definately it has a lot to do with wanting to be with similar groups of people who think like you or can accept u for your thoughts and actions...and then there's the percieved idea that foreigners are less likely to judge them and more likely to allow fun and unpredicatbility to be a part of that relationship....Maybe it's true, maybe it isn't....but the thought is there u see...<br><br>So ultimately, local guys do have to start to see that they can't keep to their ways of thinking...Actually they can, but u must be able to adapt to this new world.  Very, very few modern women would go for a guy who walks around orchard dressed in full ming Dynasty clothing talking and thinking the way they do back then....Obviously they will begin to look for the people who have kept up with the times...<br><br>The winds of change are coming guys, and I know, as a memeber of the same sex, that guys are terrible at accepting change.  We prefer the status Quo....Women...What can I say, u need only to look at how often they change their clothes, handbags, shoes...etc... and it speaks for itself.<br><br>How many of you guys are still wearing clothes from last year?  i know I've been wearing the exact same sets of clothing for about two years now...Hey, they're still cool ok.:-)   Change is just not part of our vocabulary....but let this be a prelude of things to come guys....let it be a warning and let it instigate you to start to change.  and it doesn't mean having to forget everything u believe...it means add to it, grow and expand yourself...Our women have...let's not dissappoint them!!!!!!Yeah!!! Guy POWER!!!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe they just need an excuse to hong the ang moh guys cos they r more exotic?<br><br>In my circle of friends/acquantances, the guys are definitely more happening. But who gives a fuck, TNP is fulla shit anyways.<br><br>The very reason they publish such an article is to get as powerful a response from the male population as possible. In fact, I have this strong feeling that they'd run an article featuring the men critisizing women in a short while.<br><br>They just want reaadership to go up.</div>
