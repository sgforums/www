              <p>You're right. Socio economic conditions are much much better in Queensland/NSW than in Singapore (i cant say for the rest of Australia).</p>
              <p>But Is that the only detail you can provide? "Youths own cars". Have you actually been there and seen what cars they own? You probably think you are worldly just by having been
              abroad for a while- if you have even lived abroad in the first place
              (not 3 days 2 nights packages for $888 plus 2nd pax free).</p>
              <p>Most of the cars youths own are 2nd hand crap, i know because my 1st car was in oz and it was crap, just like my friends were. ANd when we came to Sin city, we were amazed at how new the cars were, and at such quick turn over rate.</p>
              <p>But while we're doing comparisons and on the subject of cars, i find it interesting how fully fledged license holders in Sin city can get into far more traffic accidents than their aussie counterparts. It is my belief that aussie full licence holders are much more experienced than their singaporean equivalents. Since learners licences in queensland become full-licences only after 4 years of safe driving with no mishaps.</p>
              <p>Anyway,</p>
              <p>I know what you are doing Worldlybusinessman, because i used to be as critical, but i've learned to not judge and condemn sin city since I have no right to vote or lobby to change things. I can only do economics comparisons in my essays and offer suggestions.</p>
              <p>I'm sure you on the other hand, are not a foreigner, you're most likely intimately connected with sin city via citizenship. Rather than just implying that life is better else-where and trying to get people to flee or feel bad about living here, try offering something more constructive.</p>

              <p>Huh?????  I am really not sure where you got this idea from....</p>
              <p>When you referred to Oz youth.... perhaps you referred to those Asian kids whose parents migrated over here.  Some of the international students drive better cars than the locals do too!</p>
              <p>Even if they do drive/own fancy cars, they are more likely taking out car loan and paying it off themselves without the aid of the parents.</p>
              <p>People have to realise that cost of living here is higher (hence minimum wage) and cars are a lot of cheaper in Oz.  Aussie kids usually have to earn pocket money from their parents by helping out in the house chores.  Once they reach legal age to work, they will go and work, usually at MacDonald, KFC, Supermarkets, Service Stations etc.</p>
              <p>Like someone mentioned, they do have to start paying rent to their parents if they opt to stay at home after they have completed their studies.</p>
