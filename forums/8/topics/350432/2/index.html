              <p>You're right. Socio economic conditions are much much better in
                  Queensland/NSW than in Singapore (i cant say for the rest of
                  Australia).</p>
              <p>But Is that the only detail you can provide? "Youths own cars".
                  Have you actually been there and seen what cars they own? You
                  probably think you are worldly just by having been abroad for a
                  while- if you have even lived abroad in the first place (not 3 days
                  2 nights packages for $888 plus 2nd pax free).</p>
              <p>Most of the cars youths own are 2nd hand crap, i know because my
                  1st car was in oz and it was crap, just like my friends were. ANd
                  when we came to Sin city, we were amazed at how new the cars were,
                  and at such quick turn over rate.</p>
              <p>But while we're doing comparisons and on the subject of cars, i
                  find it interesting how fully fledged license holders in Sin city
                  can get into far more traffic accidents than their aussie
                  counterparts. It is my belief that aussie full licence holders are
                  much more experienced than their singaporean equivalents. Since
                  learners licences in queensland become full-licences only after 4
                  years of safe driving with no mishaps.</p>
              <p>Anyway,</p>
              <p>I know what you are doing Worldlybusinessman, because i used to
                  be as critical, but i've learned to not judge and condemn sin city
                  since I have no right to vote or lobby to change things. I can only
                  do economics comparisons in my essays and offer suggestions.</p>
              <p>I'm sure you on the other hand, are not a foreigner, you're most
                  likely intimately connected with sin city via citizenship. Rather
                  than just implying that life is better else-where and trying to get
                  people to flee or feel bad about living here, try offering
                  something more constructive.</p>

              <p>Fren, international student driving 2nd hand car or those below 21 yrs old driving it is ok. Its because they just got their new license for the locals and their parents dont want them in a accident with their brand new shiny car. International students want to save $$$ as they are going to leave the place after a few years anyway and mobility is important for them as public transport does not go everywhere in Aus. This true especially if u are working as yr workplace  may be situated at some obscure corner in Tasmania or Brisbane. Public transport in Aus will go to major landmarks like shopping areas and universities, schools or city but not to some corner. Somehow public transport is much better in Melbourne and Adelaide. For these ppl car makes it so much easier</p>
              <p>And mind u if u dont have a garage or gate (with alarm system) to lock/park yr car, very soon u will see yr new BMW or ferrari car scratched, damaged by teen pranksters. So some ppl buy old cars .</p>
              <p>There are many reasons.</p>

              <p>what u dunt understand?. basically they are using fixed ticket prices, which means that someone travelling short or long distance basically pays the same under the weekly or monthly ticket .</p>
              <p>one eg. $70 for a monthly ticket which u can use unlimited times on bus and trains.</p>
              <p>For those who dont travel often n public transport, its better they buy the one time fare ticket.</p>
              <p>Still there are lot of ppl in melbourne who do travel on bus and train. During the rush hours, u can see as much ppl as in singapore.</p>

              not more than 2000 bucks, then when they graduate and need to leave
