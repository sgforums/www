              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Even though now the storm is more or less weakened and moved away from Hong Kong towards the Chinese mainland. However, the HKG airport especially Cathay Pacific check in counter is currently in very messy situation. </span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>The check in situation is so horrible. As almost everybody is queuing almost at the same lane. Each queuing lane have about hundreds passengers. All of them are from different kind of passengers. Examples, passengers being retimed to another flight, seeking refund, check in bags for normal flight, transit passengers etc. Basically everybody travel via Cathay pacific are queuing at the same lane. Can you imagine how worst it is?</span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>There is no proper segregation between the counter, no broadcast or any announcement to directed to the passenger what they should do and which counter to go. Nobody knows what’s going on and the counter staff also seems unsure of the arrangement. Basically, it is very messy over there. </span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Furthermore, there is nobody to picks up any hotline. Be it is in Singapore hotline or Hong Kong hotline. </span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>My bf is still queuing now and I already try my best to do whatever I can over at Singapore. Overall, I'm very disappointed with Cathay Pacific arrangement. They seems like do not have a proper contingency plan to handle this kind of situation. </span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>P.s. Other check in counter such as SIA, United Airline etc is still in a very smooth operation and they don’t face this kind of situation. </span></p>

              <p>Ya. This unexpectd Typhoon really cause a lot of trouble. However, lucky my bf in the end manage to get himself a ticket and return to Singapore by yesterday night. But he waited for this retimed ticket from 6.30am till 1pm. The reschedule dept timing change from 0855hrs to 1640hrs. Given no choice but to wait in the airport all the way to wait for check-in and boarding.</p>
              <p>Ohya. due to the messive situation, the check in counter has been split into 2 part. 1 side is for you to get your boarding pass. Another one is for you to check in your bags. Please imagine that after you queing for abt 4 hrs for boarding pass and once you receive it, you got to start queing for the check in queue. ITS ALSO takes 2-3 hrs lor!!!!!</p>

              <p>It is easy to say other carriers like SIA and United Airlines handled this situations well and complain about CX crisis managment. All you need to consider is that CX alone cancelled 113 flight the previous day and there is another 100 flight scheduled for Saturday after the airports reopen (this does not include the 100+ flight by Dragon Air as well). There are a totally of 20,000 stranded CX passengers with another 30,000+ passenger that are supposed to travel on Saturday. When you consider all of this, there is no way any carriers can handle all the passengers at the same time. If this happens to SIA at their home airport, I am sure the same situations will problem will happen as well.</p>
              <p><br>Also saying CX are known for their crisis situations is simply false, every airline has crisis contingency plan for situations like this. At HKIA, CX organized dedicated counters for the rescheduled flights passengers. Counters for stranded passenger who are on standby. Counters for regular passengers who are supposed to fly on the day after the airline resumes operations. So CX does have dedicated counters for different purposes. It could be the fact that the sheer number of passenger simply overwelm all the counters availalbe. We have to remember that it is not very often that an airline will cancelled 80% of their daily flight at their home/hub airport. So to say CX is infamous for it crisis management are probably someone who don't understand what CX has done to assist passengers and who don't understand the sheer size of the problem. CX is well known for its operational efficiency, usually CX can recover service disruptions and (ie: to get stranded pax to their destinations) recover their regular schedule within 24 to 48 hours or so, where in other carriers this will usually takes up days to weeks. So I am sure CX handled the situations as best as it can given the size of the problem.</p>

Counters for regular passengers who are supposed to fly on the day after the airline resumes operations. So CX does have dedicated counters for different purposes. It could be the fact that the sheer number of passenger simply overwelm all the counters availalbe. We have to remember that it is not very often that an airline will cancelled 80% of their daily flight at their home/hub airport. So to say CX is infamous for it crisis management are probably someone who don't understand what CX has done to assist passengers and who don't understand the sheer size of the problem. CX is well known for its operational efficiency, usually CX can recover service disruptions and (ie: to get stranded pax to their destinations) recover their regular schedule within 24 to 48 hours or so, where in other carriers this will usually takes up days to weeks. So I am sure CX handled the situations as best as it can given the size of the problem.</p>

              <p>WOW Wowpeter~ I agree with I-like_flings that you seems know CX for so well. Or you just simply cut and paste from a newspaper article ? Or maybe you are working with them? </p>
              <p>Airlines may have many different types of contingency plans so as to handle many different kind of incidents, but if those plans are not working or not effective at all perhaps they need to review the plan regularly.</p>
              <p>Please bear in mind that this is not the first time that HKG having storm or typoon weather, as such Airline should be more prepared while handle this kind of situation.</p>
              <p>The real fact is others airlines in HKG really doesn't face as much problem as CX. Hence, there is no problem on my sentence at all. Furthermore, you are not there in the first place. Unless you are telling me that you also one of the passenger in HKG at that point of time and you are perfectly fine and happy on the arrangement.</p>
