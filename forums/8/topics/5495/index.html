            <div class='col-md body'>Not very wholesome advice from Killjoy.<br><br>Before you "kao" a chio bu, ask yourself, what are the qualities you have that you think we attract them? Make the most of those qualities. If you still can't, just face it.. maybe you do not have what it takes to attract that particular chio bu. I'm sure one will come along soon who will like those qualities. So.. cheer up!<br><br>Point to add: looks isn't everything, wouldn't want a bimbo..<br><br>Cheerio!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh please, do grow up.  i agree with hui-neng: with this kinda attitude, no girls, let alone chiobu, would want to be approached by you.  take a look at the girls around you! maybe there's a few nice girls who aren't as chio but really worth a second look.  on the other hand, forget it.  perhaps they don't deserve someone as shallow as you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is no specific way to "kao chiobu" as you stated in your first post. Though i do not really agree on using such words to describe the woo-ing process which i hope you are referring to.<br><br>The thing that people will tend to go for people with pretty faces will always remain and there isn't a way to get rid of that thought either.<br><br>But mind you, if you have the thought that the person you are "kao-ing" (in reference to your usage of words) must have a pretty face. Just think in the sense that others will probably choose people from your point of view too, so what are the chances that it will click it off?<br><br>And Kintaro, I notice you have a fetish for japanese girls because they are prettier than singapore girls. Where did you get the impression that they are pretty than singapore females? Have you been to Japan before and stayed there for some time before, then coming to the conclusion that japanese girls are prettier? Or are you another one of those that got hooked onto Japanese-culture just recently by the new wave. Where did you find these japanese girls that are prettier than singapore ones? From magazines? Singers? or others?<br>And from how many interviewees do you think they chose to be this one or two people to shoot in their magazine, do as a idol singer or others?<br><br>My.. look at the time, its early in the morning ..its time to wake up guys.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, i do agree that japan has some pretty intersting culture; but if we were to equate and compare our singapore 'chio bus' and 'lians' with the city japanese girls, i think the japanese scene is more decadent, where it is common to see little japanese school girls getting sugar daddies.  sex for pocket money to buy their pradas and what have you.  and that isn't really underground mind u, its an 'open' industry with ads, telephone numbers, agencies etc.  i'm sure glad singapore (girls) is not like that (yet?).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>kintaro: your attitude towards Singaporean females is sickening.  you mean you are blasting half of singapore's population because of a few ahlians?? then wouldn't it be easier for us girls to blast singaporean guys just coz of some ahbengs?<br><br>btw, if you really dig jap gals, please, do us singaporean girls a favour and migrate to japan (that is, if you are rendered qualified for it).  in the meantime, please cease sprouting such ridiculously over-generalisations.</div>
