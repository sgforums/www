              <p>This is what happened today @ True Spa</p>
              <p>I held a gift voucher to enjoy hydrobath and full body massage for two and made the appointment two weeks ago.When I got to True Spa today, I was told that my name was not on their appointment list. Strange! True Spa gave me a reminder yesterday but I am not on appointment list. Screwed up!</p>
              <p>After 30min of arguement, we could finally enjoy the gift voucher. After the spa service, I experienced the most discriminating customer service I ever had.</p>
              <p>The lady who I had been talking to for appointment and reminder came to meet us. She is a sales personnel. After apologising her mistake for ASSUMING that I was on free trial voucher (though I had repeated what was written on the gift voucher on phone), she asked if I am Malaysian. I didn't dress up for spa session (who would?), or hold a branded bags but that does not mean I am Malaysian. Neither do I speak with Malaysia accent like her who mentioned that True Spa has another branch at 'gabbage'.</p>
              <p>But never mind. I gave her a chance to tell us about the package that she was promoting.</p>
              <p>When we told her that we need more time to consider the plan because we don't have much time for spa, she said the following in mandarin with her malaysian accent.</p>
              <p>"Alot of our customers at True Spa are doctors, lawyers and professionals, they are so busy, flying around and they have time to spend at Spa. Then you, who work fixed office hours, should have time to spend at spa".</p>
              <p>She has obviously judged and discriminated us. She needs to step outside her tiny world at True Spa / kampong to see the real Singapore society. Doctors, lawyers and other professionals are not the only group of people who can be busy.</p>
              <p>When we declined to sign up, she revealed her 'charcoal' face and walked off with an attitude.</p>
              <p>That is the service you will get True Spa. <strong>DISCRIMINATION</strong>.</p>

              i went this evening too.
              
              reception staff dam attitude. couldnt even find my booking. had to ask my name (seach records), who called you (search same records again), what time your booking (search again), whats your contact number...
              
              while waiting at the 'lounge' area, i was pretty appalled at the hard sell attitude of the sales people. some of the demure guests, had that cornered and no where to run look. some of the sales staff even gave a black face and changed to sour tones when the guest declined to buy.
              
              my massage session was so so only. firstly i was promised a 45min session on the phone but it only lasted 15mins. 
              
              once back into the 'lounge' i was presented with a $2k package which i declined repeatedly as i wasnt looking to pay such a high amount. 
              
              eventually the staff gave a whatever look and let me leave.

              <p>this kind of spa is a waste money. you go there to relax, and now ending more stress and angry. Obviously, you are pissed off, else you would not write in the forum.</p>
              <p>the spa industry is going to collapse like bubble tea soon, dont sign up for package now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> I can tell you that you spend the same amount $3k to buy a message chair, and decorate your house with plants, lights, and scents you get the same quality of effect. just think about it.</p>
