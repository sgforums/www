            <div class='col-md body'>For one I think he does not knows what he wants,<br><br>1) He most probably wants to make it stay that way, and to me, spending time on the phone means nothing, he is just bored with all that spare time on his hands now that he has one less commitment in life, and dun expect it to last too long, he will most probably grow out of it.<br><br>2 &amp; 3) What promise? You gonna wait?!? So he gonna go out and play around while you the nice gal wait for the badboy to come back? If he knows that you 2 are gonna be together, why does he even bothers to go into other relatioship at all? why is he looking for variety?!? Gosh, he must be a born liar to make you believe that. I think it is just a lame way to make you wait for him, least he should not be able to find anyone else. Like Asure said, spare tire. If he says he needs time to sort things out, I can understand, but I doubt he is, from the way you put it, it is most probably that he is comtemplating another relatiohship at this moment and dare not make a promise.<br><br>Sparks, I say no point, waiting for him, he ain't worth it, open your mind, I think you know the answers, it is just accepting them that is difficult. Why carry on wasting the time? You could be looking for someone better with these time you have, I think your ex, is not wasting any time, so should you!<br><br>I am not trying to rub on your wound, but you just gotta see the big picture and accept it.

            <div class='col-md body'>Get the hints that he is trying to give.  He just wants to be friends with you.  All promises are made to be broken.<br>1.  Calling you, like someone else says, is to kill boredom.  And he knows that you will definitely keep him company.  To maintain friendship with you, maybe due to the fact that you can help kill his time and boredom or that you still have some usefullness that he would like to "deploy"?<br>2 n 3.  Who knows the future?  Promises are made to be broken.  Today, he can say this but tomorrow, his action can be another.  Or maybe he likes to practice NATO (no action, talk only).<br>Truth is painful and who wants to go through this stage?  However, like I always mentioned, this is life.  It is a stage we have to go through when we are down on our luck.  I would think that it is time for you to let go of this "relationship".  Get on with your life.  See how much you have missed as your life was once centered around this person.  Look for all your long lost friends.  They could be waiting patiently for you.  They would be there for you during this period.  Don't contact him.  Let him contact you if he wants.  However don't wait for him.  Move on with your life.</div>
