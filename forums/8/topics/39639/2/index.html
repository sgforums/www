            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by nismoS132:<br>[b]the choice to exclude polys and Us from the closure is probably because of their curriculum. it's not as easy as say stop 10 days go holiday come back and continue due to the amount of projects and deadlines among all the students.</blockquote>As poly students, we all understand that. However it is the general opinion that they are willing to make up for the lost time in whatever way. After all, most people would not mind building a backlog if it means having some time to decide if they want to stay at home and protect themselves or not, rather then having no choice and going to school.<br><br><blockquote>the govt is also hoping to count on the fact that they're more matured and would be wise enough to give school a break should they be infected.</blockquote>Unfortunately this is hardly the case, if anybody knows human nature, esp. the attitude of poly students. Most who have a cough or flu-like symptoms will attempt to write it off as a normal flu and go to school anyway (who likes to think that you kenna SARS). And there's another factor, those who are in the starting stages and are only mildly sick, and not sick enough to warrant them seeking medical attention or suspect something is seriously amiss (just a little under the weather).<br><br>While most of these cases are harmless flus and colds, all it takes is one case of SARS to infect a sizeable population within the polytechnics, and worse, the nature of polytechnic education means you see the same large population multiple times in a short period of time, giving you a higher chance to infect many individuals as compared to say, infecting random passerbys. All it takes is just one index case within the polys to start off a bushfire, and due to the decentralized nature of some of the schools, where the students travel all over the poly and sometimes share labs with those from other courses as well, it cannot be said that simply closing off one school or course in the poly will contain the outbreak. Everybody is at risk.<br><br>And we've had heros who said that they have had contact with  SARS victims, and go around blowing air into people's face. Teenagers think they're invincible and it wun happen to them. All it takes is just one. I'm sure they can control an outbreak in a national school of 1,000 quickly by isloating the related people. Imagine having to triage 6,000-15,000 which is a typical poly population.<br><br>If anything, the closure should have focused on such insitutions to show that the govt. is serious about taking REAL measures to combat this, not just some half measure that is aimed at quieting parents. That in alone is the most effective way of quieting the panic.<br><br><blockquote>from the evident fact that we have kids running around treating this 10 days as a holiday shows the kind of mentality they and most other singaporeans have. what would be the point of closing down the polys and Us with a much more stringent curriculum if they're not going to stay home anyway?</blockquote>I'm not sure about the rest, but know that I'll certainly go out when needed and avoid crowded areas... and I'm sure there are some sensible people around in the polys... probably much more so then the spoon-fed uniforms.</div>
