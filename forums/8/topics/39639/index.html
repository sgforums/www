Becos by the time most pple who are infected seek treatment for it, they would have been contagious for quite a time liao, the only way to pre-empt it effectively is to go to the doctor over ever slightest bit you feel unwell and spend tons of cash on tons of false alarms.

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok lets face it. How many of you all in polys, unis or ites seriously  wans to stop school because you are seriously worried about SARS? I dare say less than 50% of those who are making so much noise just wans a holiday or for the sake of "EQUAL TREATMENT".<br><br>The reason being given is that these people would be more matured to know when not to attend school if he/she is sick. This means, the GOVERNMENT are treating us as adults. If they seriously close down everything, they jolly well close down all companies and all people working can stay at home. What would that come to be? Precisely because workers and students in ITE, Polys and Uni are treated as ADULTS, thats why the government trusts these people will know when to stay at home if needed.<br><br>So, when the government treats u all like kids, u all complain. When the government treats u all like adults, u all also complain. Hard to please huh.<br><br>Anyway, i am now looking for work, it doesnt affect me. But seriously think, if u think the government needs to close down poly and uni temporarily, very soon, companies, businessess, bus drivers, taxi drivers, air stewardesses, pilots, NS men will start to demand they get that right too. See the picture now?</div>
