            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Sowing The Seeds of Faith</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">All Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, ...</span><br>~  Timothy 3:16-17<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>The Bible Â— carefully read and well-worn Â— was the most important book in GerritÂ’s house. His home was a house of prayer, where many tears were shed for revival in his church in Heemstede. Almost a generation later, his prayers were answered as that very church became the centre of an upsurge of faith in Holland, part of the Great Awakening in Europe.<br><br>When she was about eighteen years old, GerritÂ’s great-granddaughter had a dream about him. He was walking through a beautiful park with her and he said, Â“When you sow some seed and put it in the ground, this seed will make a plant and this plant will give seed again. ... You, my dear Corrie, are the daughter of my grandson. ... You are a plant, blooming from my seed. I will show you something that will never be changed. It is the Word of God.Â” In the dream, he opened his Bible and said, Â“This Book will be the same forever.Â” He then told her, Â“Plant the seeds from GodÂ’s Book and they will grow from generation to generation.Â”<br><br>Corrie ten Boom did just that. She planted GodÂ’s Word in hearts and minds around the world. Information learned in textbooks is continually updated. Courses of study change. The truths of the Bible, however, are absolutes. Its promises are sure.<br><br>[This message has been edited by ^colette (edited 30 October 2000).]</div>

Either that, or they extend an invitation to you after they read your posting for more than a week.<br>By the way, good try.
