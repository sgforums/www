            <div class='col-md body'>MUMBAI (AFP) - An Indian anti-terror court on Tuesday sentenced Bollywood movie star Sanjay Dutt to six years in jail for illegal weapons possession in connection with serial bombings in Mumbai in 1993. ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>The sentencing immediately sent shockwaves through the song-and-dance film industry, which has long been accused of links to Mumbai's criminal underworld.<br><br>Dutt was convicted last year of buying guns but was cleared of the more serious charge of conspiracy in connection with the attacks, which killed 257 people at injured at least 800 others.<br><br>The "Black Friday" bombings were allegedly staged by Mumbai's Muslim-dominated mafia in retaliation for deadly Hindu-Muslim clashes and the demolition of a mosque by Hindu extremists.<br><br>"Sanjay was not a minor at that time. Acquiring a weapon of this nature suggests the character of the person, and is contrary to the law," anti-terror judge Pramod Kode said as he read out the sentence to a packed courtroom.<br><br>The hugely popular Dutt, known for his tough guy roles in Indian cinema, faced a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. He has already served 18 months on remand in the mid-1990s, and had requested that he be allowed to stay free on probation.<br><br>In a further blow to the actor, the court refused to allow him to remain free on bail pending his appeal to the Supreme Court. He was also fined 25,000 rupees (620 dollars). He was taken into custody in Mumbai's dingy Arthur Road jail.<br><br>"I made a mistake 14 years ago... Pray for me," said Dutt, 48, who was trembling after hearing his sentence.<br><br>Dutt was the highest-profile figure connected to the 1993 bombings case, and Tuesday's hearing wrapped up more than a decade of legal proceedings that have resulted in 100 convictions.<br><br>Of those convicted, 12 were given death sentences and 20 others got life sentences.<br><br>The alleged masterminds of the blasts, Dawood Ibrahim and Tiger Memon, have been on the run since 1993. Indian investigators say they were aided by Pakistan's intelligence service but Islamabad has denied any link.<br><br>Dutt has always maintained his innocence, arguing that he had bought a Kalashnikov assault rifle to protect his family from sectarian violence.<br><br>But chief prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam told reporters that this was "not good enough an excuse."<br><br>"Dutt is a good actor and a celebrity, but this does not give him a licence for illegal action," he added, saying the superstar had been given a "fair trial."<br><br>In recent months, the burly Dutt has been filming non-stop to close out his existing filming contracts.<br><br>Dutt, son of a politically prominent Hindu father and a Muslim mother honoured for her acting, has long been tagged Bollywood's original "bad boy" by taking on roles as gangsters and anti-heroes, and an off-screen life wracked by drug abuse and two failed marriages.<br><br>In recent years his star has risen with the hugely popular "Munnabhai" films, in which he plays a wisecracking mobster trying to turn over a new leaf.<br><br>In the second of the series -- "Carry on Munnabhai" -- the ghost of Indian independence icon Mahatma Gandhi steers Dutt's character onto the path of righteousness and true love, all the while dispensing old-fashioned lessons about honesty.<br><br>Bollywood was meanwhile in shock over the verdict.<br><br>Actress Kirron Kher said she was "shocked and saddened," arguing Dutt "has suffered enough for 14 years (and) he has been exemplary in behaviour."<br><br>Film producer and director Mahesh Bhatt said the sentencing was a "body blow."<br><br>"I cannot say the sentence was not fair... (but) six years is too strong," he said.</div>
