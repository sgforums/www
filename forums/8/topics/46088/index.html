From what to wear for work/ school, what to take for lunch to even what to do for the next moment. Decision-making is definitely as impt as the air we breathe in every moment, one wrong move &amp;....it's unimaginable. Fortunate ones may have the second chance to un-do their last decision, some may never &amp; be living in regrets forever....</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: green;">I'm making a decision to salvage a situation. A situation which seems to be bleak, or perhaps, I'd prefer to address it as a kind of fear I have tt i deemed the situation so. Well, anyway, who knows what future brings or the decision we gonna make won't turn out good? Yes, future is unpredictable but I can control the present. Hope tt everyone who has a fear for something, someone or oneself, make use of your control to make decisions in life, do your utmost for the present coz future is unseen and never to let regret to your fren.... </span></span></div>
