Many a times, while crossing the zebra crossing near my place of work, you have drivers just running across the zebra crossing when pedestrians are standing by the side, waiting to cross. About 5 times, the cars run across the zebra crossing even when pedestrians are on it. I myself experienced it twice, the car narrowly missing me by inches. One time, I was trying to cross the road fast, so that the cars wont have to wait too long, and what does this driver do? Drive faster to 'race' me. What mentality is this? The driver was a middle aged woman.<br><br>So, I have half a mind to video tape the incidents from now on. Before crossing, I may just turn on my handphone camera and if I experience such a case again, at least I can quickly video tape it as it happens.

Fine if the group is walking very slowly and not yet on the zebra crossing, by all means the driver can slowly go over the crossing if he is already at the zebra crossing (far end).

But some places really bobian, must move the car slowly slowly in front. For instance at orchard the crossing near scotts shopping centre. If the driver lets everyone cross, there will be no chance for the car to move at all. Pedestrains also play a part. I have often seen some crossing the zebra without even looking whether there is incoming traffic and just dash across.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

For the able bodied, as guan lan as they may be, how slow can they be, right? I mean, a person in the right mind won't stop right in the middle and dare you to crash him right? If you want, just honk him/her.<br><br>As for the group thing, I think it can't be helped. It's just the way it is. I have been in the car stuck at the zebra crossing as well when group after group passes. I know the feeling. But impatience is a good reason to be reckless? I hope you seriously don't mean that. And yes, for those places at orchard road where the flow of people is non-stop on weekends, I think honking to signal you wish to drive through and then slowly inching by the driver is the right way. Because groups on the zebra crossing are strangers, a group who wants to let the driver past does not mean another group is thinking the same way. So yes bo bian, driver has to do so at some point in time, I understand it.<br><br>The road is designated for drivers to drive, if a person jaywalks and gets knocked down, I agree its totally the jaywalker's fault. But the zebra crossing is designated for people to cross right? Why even this small patch of striped road those drivers also want to vye with pedestrians? Is that the mentality of "I drive therefore I own the road" applying to even the zebra crossings?<br><br>Before people lose track and think I'm starting a war between drivers and pedestrians, please re read my original post... Thanks!<br></div>
