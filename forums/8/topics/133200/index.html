            <div class='col-md body'>Me have 4 Singaporean gf before , 2 indonesia and 1 thailand . Lastly I still choose a Indonesia Chinese as a wife ,<br><br>Y? Singapore girl too proud of themselves as a Singapore born and always think that other 3rd world country is lower class , Some even never been to the place and from the news they only see the chaos , They never even see the local where they live and have a family , What I can say is that country which surround Singapore have a better mentality in term of having a family . What a guys really what from the family  , it is that someone will stand by him even at the worst situation and most important not complaint , Can Singapore girl do that ?<br><br>I have been out of job when I work in Indonesia and my gf find way to borrow money and save on everyday spending and the best part she never even argue about not having enough money . She always paint a very good picture as long as I have leg and hand sure we will find a way out . There is many ppl going after her at that time but still she stick with me . She left me when I am comfortable for I am Chinese and she a malay.Her parent object it very long already . It is sad but I donÂ’t want her to be with me leaving her friend , relative and other which is very important to her , she dont want to live in Singapore . No more sad story lets back to topic or I will go off topic .<br><br>Singapore girl always want guy to care and support then and will start to compare other ex bf what they can or did , Worest still , comepare with their friend and always use the best one , They never compare to their which have been cheated or even beat by their bf . I use to have rather pretty gf due to I go for look when going after gf , they would compare what last bf or ppl going after do for them and I cant , They do understand that ppl rich and ppl going after them will always very good  to them and after a serious relationship it cant always be the same .<br><br>That y in Singapore break off is very normal . many argue started and final is break off and the girl still insisted is guy fault , If a guy  always argue this kind of thing with gf , u think how long we guy can take , So when some other gal come into your path we guy normally will give up a bad relationship hopping to get a better one . If we never try we donÂ’t know , at that situation we guy will think that no matter what , it will still be better than this<br><br>So Singapore girl  wants to tai tai , than let them become one for they donÂ’t understand when a man have too much money and time they will do lots of thing that the wife  will not know . For their eye is cover with monies and branded goods .<br><br>If for me to compare Singapore and other country girl I been with , Ha Â…. Cannot compare la . Singapore girl can become a very good gf and play partnerÂ…That is all I can say Â…. No flaming , just a experience , I not mean everyone to have to same thinking<br></div>
