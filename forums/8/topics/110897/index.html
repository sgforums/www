I feel like a moron now and a loser for having trusted people and helped them so much and give in to people so much that I myself suffered and I suffered in silence.  I do not intend to go out and make any so call "friends" cause there are more people who are out to cheat and take than to put equal effort into friendship. My other silblings/friends who I don't lend money to, calls me when they need my help to listen to their issues, or help them out in the form of physical labour, but these people quickly disappear the moment things settle down and can never be contacted when you ask them for any help. There are many pathalogical liers that I've the misfortune to have met and let them suck me dry, than I care to name while previously I try to distance myself after that or tell myself  to let it be but I've had enough. I have to take care of myself cause my own health is failing and there is no help any where.  Call me a pessimist cynic, but I don't believe in anything anymore. All of these things and all of life is really one big wah yang and I hope it quickly ends.<br></div>

And my forecast came true. the other day, I commented I wish buses don't always have the mobile TV cause it was noisy. (I was travelling from Bedok reservior to Punggol - 1 have to change 3 buses and 1 NEL line. I assure you, there is no quick way to get to Punggol from Bedok and it takes 1 hour on average.)<br><br>He said I was spoilt by him - I don't know if I should take it as a joke or take it seriously but I suspect this is really what he felt cause he made the same comments about ferrying his family members. He only had his car a couple of weeks and this is his first car. He had no savings at all so he asked me to help out. Already his colleagues asked him to tell me to help him with his monthly installments and other bills (but I am only a gf!). So I really feel obligated to help weather I want to or not. I felt that if I don't help him, I am sure his family and colleagues will have lots to say that I am unsupportive and I am heartless enough to let my bf fork out that money. People are bit.ches! They don't know when to control their tongues.<br><br>So I struck a deal. I rent from his mom a flat (another long story and I pay fully for the whole house in case I am again accused of making his mother loose money renting to me which his mom will tell me at every opportunity. Its my bf who insisted I move there although it cost me so much just to stay there and its so inconvenient) and told him to just pay the balance to her every month so that I wanna avoid any missed payments and issues. Also I think his monther should also help him out instead of all rely on the gf to fork for everything. This is the easiest way and it will be better for him than to have to pay me back one lump sum which he cannot.<br><br>So as i said. Being nice only gets me a load of sh|t. People, don't ever be fooled!<br>Love is just a figment of your imagination. Money is real. You sweat and suffering at work to make that money is real.<br></div>

(I was travelling from Bedok reservior to Punggol - 1 have to change 3 buses and 1 NEL line. I assure you, there is no quick way to get to Punggol from Bedok and it takes 1 hour on average.)<br><br>He said I was spoilt by him - I don't know if I should take it as a joke or take it seriously but I suspect this is really what he felt cause he made the same comments about ferrying his family members. He only had his car a couple of weeks and this is his first car. He had no savings at all so he asked me to help out. Already his colleagues asked him to tell me to help him with his monthly installments and other bills (but I am only a gf!). So I really feel obligated to help weather I want to or not. I felt that if I don't help him, I am sure his family and colleagues will have lots to say that I am unsupportive and I am heartless enough to let my bf fork out that money. People are bit.ches! They don't know when to control their tongues.<br><br>So I struck a deal. I rent from his mom a flat (another long story and I pay fully for the whole house in case I am again accused of making his mother loose money renting to me which his mom will tell me at every opportunity. Its my bf who insisted I move there although it cost me so much just to stay there and its so inconvenient) and told him to just pay the balance to her every month so that I wanna avoid any missed payments and issues. Also I think his monther should also help him out instead of all rely on the gf to fork for everything. This is the easiest way and it will be better for him than to have to pay me back one lump sum which he cannot.<br><br>So as i said. Being nice only gets me a load of sh|t. People, don't ever be fooled!<br>Love is just a figment of your imagination. Money is real. You sweat and suffering at work to make that money is real.<br></div></blockquote>actually u dun have to put in so much commitment de.. try getting ur money back and if able leave him ba.... tats y i always tell myself head how big wear how big cap....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The best thing is to not lend your friends money.<br><br>Most of the times, when money is concern, relationships will be hurt. If your friend doesn't return the money to you, you'll definitely feel cheated, unless of course the sum is less than $10.<br><br>When that happens, it's hard to ask back for the money, and your friend probably knows that he owes you money, but pretends to forget about it. He'll avoid you and ta-dah! A rift in the friendship because of monetary issues.<br><br>I once had a friend who borrowed $50 and promised to return it in the following week. He took 24 'following weeks' to return it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

I was saving all the rainy day money, for myself, in case nothing works out, I would need to get a house of my own and at that point, at least I have some $ to get a roof and not sleep on the streets.  I don't think anything will ever come back, just don't want to go on and fork out any much more. Heart's cold.  I think I had been kind enough to everyone.<br><br></div>

Its always easy to say as an outsider but if you are the one in the relationship and your girl ask for money because she needs it to cure her illness. You would not lend her the money knowing it will never come back? Or wait till the day you need cash flow and you need to ask your gf, then she gives you this line that she cannot lend you $ cause as you said above. What would you feel?<br><br>Besides, this is a forum, so if you don't like the topic. Then don't participate. If people just wanna voice out, hey its anyone's freedom. Its always easier to say than do. If you are like as you describe, then good luck. I know many people both sexes don't like such a kind of person. I had friends who count till the very last cent and divide out the GST even, and make sure everyone pays up fully and cannot owe anyone any money.<br></div>
