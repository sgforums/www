            <div class='col-md body'>In the first place, if ur boyfriend have difficulties in paying for and maintaining the car.. He should not have buy it since its a liability and U should have advised him against it. Well, I guess its another case of " People have, I also want" attitude.<br>Wanting a GF to pay and maintain a car.... Geezz..<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mistyblue:</div><div class="quote_body">I reject cause I know he will say that I waste his time (which he did feel so as he said it to me as well) and he feels he is expected to ferry me and he feels tired and like a ahmad. And my forecast came true. the other day, I commented I wish buses don't always have the mobile TV cause it was noisy. (I was travelling from Bedok reservior to Punggol - 1 have to change 3 buses and 1 NEL line. I assure you, there is no quick way to get to Punggol from Bedok and it takes 1 hour on average.)<br><br>He said I was spoilt by him - I don't know if I should take it as a joke or take it seriously but I suspect this is really what he felt cause he made the same comments about ferrying his family members. He only had his car a couple of weeks and this is his first car. He had no savings at all so he asked me to help out. Already his colleagues asked him to tell me to help him with his monthly installments and other bills (but I am only a gf!). So I really feel obligated to help weather I want to or not. I felt that if I don't help him, I am sure his family and colleagues will have lots to say that I am unsupportive and I am heartless enough to let my bf fork out that money. People are bit.ches! They don't know when to control their tongues.<br><br>So I struck a deal. I rent from his mom a flat (another long story and I pay fully for the whole house in case I am again accused of making his mother loose money renting to me which his mom will tell me at every opportunity. Its my bf who insisted I move there although it cost me so much just to stay there and its so inconvenient) and told him to just pay the balance to her every month so that I wanna avoid any missed payments and issues. Also I think his monther should also help him out instead of all rely on the gf to fork for everything. This is the easiest way and it will be better for him than to have to pay me back one lump sum which he cannot.<br><br>So as i said. Being nice only gets me a load of sh|t. People, don't ever be fooled!<br>Love is just a figment of your imagination. Money is real. You sweat and suffering at work to make that money is real.<br></div></blockquote></div>
