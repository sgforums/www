The point of threads in forums or threads is about topics and discussions and not condemn whoever or the person that posts, unless its usual known troublemaker.  Its very easy to spot troublemakers and their style and best way to deal is to ignored.<br><br>Of course whoever says bad about the persons who post should be expected to be rebutted hard and not get away with it.<br><br>We can discuss on topics and what's written to any level,  but never ever condemn the persons that wrote it.<br><br></div>
