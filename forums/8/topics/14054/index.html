            <div class='col-md body'>The threads in here are kinda boring, so I'll start my own.<br><br>Okay, let's clear some things up first:<br><br>Capitalism: An ECONOMIC system<br><br>Democracy: A POLITICAL system<br><br>Communism: A POLITICAL system.<br><br>Socialism: An ECONOMIC system.<br><br>Communism, by the Engels and Marx's Communist Manifesto, called for the overthrow of capitalism. (I realize communism doesn't imply Marxism, but this is how I'm backing what I'm about to say.)<br><br>Karl Marx believed that the capitalist system, which produced the Industrial Revolution, would eventually destroy itself in the following way.<br><br>Factories would drive small artistans out of business, leaving a small number of manufacturers to control all the wealth. The large proleteriat would revolt, seize the factories and mills from the capitalists, and produce what society needed. Workers would control the government in a "dictatorship of the proletariat", as Marx termed it. After a period of cooperative living and education, the state or government would wither away as a classless society developed.<br><br>This final, classless phase is what Karl Marx called pure communism. It's what communist communist governments should work towards.<br><br>Marx's phase order.<br><br>1. feudalism and/or absolutism<br>2. capitalsim<br>3. socialism<br>4. communism/complete socialism<br><br>A reason some believe communism never worked is because every nation that had ever experienced communism didn't follow through Marx's phases correctly. Though Russia was a bit industrialized, it was for the most part still a feudal monarchy. There were serfs in Russia up until the beginning of the 20th century and far too many farmers for Russia to the move right on to the "step" of communism. Many believe communism would work, provided you industrialize beforehand.<br><br>Still, I can see how a communist system wouldn't work because it's contrary to human nature. The entire "people are lazy" is a rather clichÃ©d argument against communism, so I'm not even about to go into it.<br><br>One theoretical perspective in sociology is the conflict perspective, which follows in the tradition of Karl Marx. People who employ this perspective focus on those forces in society that promote competition and change.<br><br>According to Marx, it is capitalistm that is contrary to human nature, and communism, if done correctly, is in keeping with human nature. Marx believed that no human would choose to work, if they could do otherwise, and thus the capitalist is going against human nature by forcing the worker to work to survive. Since that capitalist controls the means of production, the completely dehumanize the worker by making him perform labour against his own desires and wishes to produce something to make the capitalist richer. Thus the worker is reduced to being only as valuable as what he can produce. So the worker is doing something dehumanizing to produce something that is not human to make someone who is not the worker richer. This is how it is against human nature.<br><br>I've been reading a lot of Marx recently, and it's very fascinating reading. I won't do a very good job conveying what Marx was saying, since Marx was a genius and a very good writer, and I am neither.<br><br>On Vietnam War<br><br>First, Ho Chi Minh sought aid from the US in gaining independence for Vietnam. He hoped the Americans would follow through on their promise to end the evils of colonialism after WW2.<br>Second, he read a declaration of independence modeled on the Tom Jefferson's, not on the communist manifesto or anything else promoting marxist-leninist teachings.<br>Third, Ho dissolved the Vietnamese Communist Party in the 50's, in the hopes that he could appease the Americans who he knew were anti-communist.<br>Fourth, throughout the late 50's and early 60's, Ho stopped violence against American and ARVN troops, in the hopes that the promise of the Geneva Conference regarding Vietnam would be recognized: that Vietnam would have an election on the issue of independence and unification. South Vietnam, on the advice of the US, refused to allow these elections to take place.<br>Fifth, Ho held general elections in North Vietnam to determine leadership. He won.<br>All of these point towards Ho as first and foremost a Vietnamese nationalist, and a communist a distant second. I believe that if the US had not made Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnamese people their enemies, Ho would not have sought military, economic, and social aid from China and the USSR. Ho was given no choice: he could see Vietnam united using Soviet/Chinese support, or watch it be forever divided by the Americans and their allies.<br><br>Reasons Vietnam War was a disaster(for the U.S.):<br><br>1. U.S. did not have a clear idea of who they were fighting<br><br>2. U.S. lacked an idea why they were fighting and who they were fighting<br><br>Know your enemy and know yourself, and in a thousand battles a thousand victories. Know yourself but not your enemy and for every battle won a battle lost. Know niether and frustration is sure at every turn.<br><br>3. U.S. spent too much time defending everything they took.<br><br>Defend your front and your rear is vulnerable. Defend your Left flank and your right is vulnerable. Defend your right flank and your left is vulnerable. Defend your rear and your front is vulnerable. Defend everywhere and there is no where you are not vulnerable.<br><br>4. U.S. let them attack where they were not.<br><br>All above quotes are attributable to the greatest war philosepher ever, Sun-Tzu.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When Marx wrote his Manifesto (with Engels), and for a number of reasons. Britain and Germany were both super capitalist states back then, way more capitalist than America has ever been. Particularly Britain, a country that sucked all the resources out of the numerous colonies that they held with military power (as did several other European states, Belgium was particularly cruel). There's your Evil Empire.<br><br>And as such it had more than enough problems to criticize from a Communist perspective considering that Marx was a German (German Jew to be exact) who lived in Britain (well at least when he wrote the Manifesto, in the British Library).<br><br>British workers had few rights and little legal protection, e.g. no minimum wages or maximum working hours, so there would really be no reason to look to another continent (North America) for capitalist oppression when there's plenty to go around right where you live. And yes, I said CAPITALIST OPPRESSION. I might as well have said slavery. Read up on worker conditions in 19th century European industries, and I trust you'll agree that Communism isn't really a bad idea in proper historical context.<br><br>Stalinism is not Communism. Consider why and when Communism was first conceived. Sure it's idealistic, but it's essentially a humane theory, not evil.<br><br>To the people who say that communsim doesn't work, well it doesn't work in our rich modern world, but it works much better than capitalism in a world where there is little capital, i.e. the world 100 years ago and back. And its principles works excellently in miniature (tribal) societies and families. Of course you may call your family "democratic", but the basic principles of democracy are identical to the basic principles of communsim. In fact, communists believe communism is the only true democratical form. Personally I think that notion is outdated, not because its ideas are inherently wrong, but because its values don't apply to our society anymore. There really are no oppressing capitalist powers in the Western World today, but you'll find a lot of communists in countries where they do survive.<br><br>And communism and democracy are not mutually exclusive. In fact communism in its true form almost demands democracy, to prevent people like stalin from occuring.(But it failed sadly)<br><br>So communism isn't evil.</div>
