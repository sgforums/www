            <div class='col-md body'>Hi people,<br>just read some interesting posts by Rinoa about her romance problem and thought of sharing mine to everyone here too :<br>I'm now experiencing a farnie feeling which, i believe is an extension of a crush. I got to know of girl, through my friend, (both of them coincedentally are from the same country as Rinoa's friend). I didn't get a chance to speak to her much, but i've been unable to get over her, probably due to her looks - so that means it's a crush, yes?<br>So, i tried to get to know her better, and they say the way to make a girl happy, is to, what else, send her a gift. And i did, her favourite one too, chocolates.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>But however, she must have misunderstood my intentions and till now has been silent towards my emails n icq messages (yes, we used to be quite chatty over ICQ). I gathered from friends that she's close to everyone but once she suspected your intentions, she will give u the cold shoulders...so does that make her hypocrite?<br>I wonder if in the near future, when i get to know another girl, and after we can clique, will that same feeling be manifested on her due to my previous failure? Love is such a complicated issue. I fear of losing another friend because i'm too quick to express my feelings towards her (not to my current crush, but to the next one who can clique with me.) But, isn't it much better to say it out than let the opportunity slip by? I'm pretty confused man...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well....several things to deal with here.<br><br>Firstly, about the girl. I dont know what she's like but perhaps she's just been maxxed out or tired lately. Too coincidental? Probably.<br><br>Ok well on to the next possible reason. Youknow sometimes, dealing with a person who has a crush onyou may be just as hard as dealing with the feelings you expereince when you have a crush on someone, especially if you don't feel anything for the person. You still want to maintain the friendship, yet don't know how to stop him/her from liking you. While your not a bitch/bastard, you just want to settle everythin ASAP. Unfortunately, some people figure that the best way to do this is to make the person dislike you,then when everything's cool, try to fix the broken pieces of the damaged friendship. Not a very good method to use, but it's probably one of the most obvious.<br><br>Some people handle openess and frankness well. Others react violently to surprises or when they're caught off guard. Maybe you told her too fast or at a wrong time (life's a bitch  ain't it).Whatever the case, it's best to remedythe situation ASAP. Send her another email explaining yourself. Or call her. Coz right now, she prob thinks you're just another John after her. Shewon't have much of an impression till you tellher your side.<br><br>Personally, I rank friendship above anything else. I had a crush on this girl who's like my best friend and I so messed everything up for a good 1.5 weeks coz I put her in a fix. So I sent a couple of super-long emails explaining everything and eventually everything was settled and it's back to normal,or perhaps better.<br><br>What I'm saying is that if it's a crush, it'll come and go. If she doesn't like you now, don't jeopardise your friendship with her. Clear it up, and move on. You'll never know. Maybe fate will deal you a better hand in the future, but while r/s may not last, a solid friendship  will.<br><br>Plus, by building a friendship, you'll at least know her better.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh yeah, you did nothing wrong. It's always good to be open and frank, whether your in a r/s or not.<br><br>Just be sure you actually mean what you say, you're pretty sure and what you say is justified and with reason. Coz if you do,then no one can fault you and you'll be safe.<br><br>Be tactful too.<br>Words, everyone can use.<br>How to use words effectively, only some can master.<br><br>Just don't be a casanova and say "I love you" to every other girl who you remotely have a crush on.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey thanks Zip<br>I think i'll take up ur 2nd suggestion but some queries, supposed she's not thinking abt what i've been thinking, won't it complicate the situation?<br>As for your 1st suggestion, nah, she hasn't had much impression of me yet like u said, the entire relationship's one sided. Furthermore, i just sent her chocolates with nothing but best wishes for her exams.<br>I'll like to here more from everyone here though, i'm sure more people like you will be able to relate their experiences.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Oh one more thing to Chief, i love your site, i think it's breaking the tradiational social barrier in Singapore, get what i mean? In fact, i've sent an email to criticise the blantant reporting by TNP, however, to my agast, the editor replied to me on the failure to display my email citing space restrictions...God believes !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i thk your crush's reaction is very normal, common reaction amongst gers if they dont reciprocate your feelings. you didnt really know her (ever spoke to her over the fone? gone out one on one? gone out together more than once?) and you gave her a box of chocs w/o any reason (wishing her gd luck for her exams sounds like a lame excuse just to give her smethg.. sweet if she likes you, wierd if she doesnt), i thk it's safe to say most gers wld give you the "cold shoulder". but it isnt exactly that. she doesnt like you, and prolly doesnt even know you tt well so she has no idea how to go abt rejecting you. in most cases, if the ger conts being frenly, the guy wld take it as a sign tt she likes him (actually he'll take anythg as a sign, and this goes both ways, for guys and gers) and does she really want tt?<br><br>well, in future, just get to know your OOD first, as a friend and a person before going further. strike only when you're certain (80%/70%) tt she likes you too and i thk you'll have less of these problems..</div>

I just LURVE yr situation juzaguy....reminds me so much of the damn fixes i've gotten into during my (sorry to say this) weak attempts at trying to know a gal better cos i liked her face...nope, dint succeed..hehe <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Seriously, i really think prettier gals are much more sensitive to this kinda give gifts, purposely try to get to know her strategy...and once they know, if they alrdy decided to draw the line at "just friends" there's basically nothing you can do to improve yr chances...my advice to you is: try to salvage the frdship, though i seriously think damage is done...happened in my case, and the frdship wont be able to develop so fully as it would have...<br><br>Hmm...i suppose another piece of my advice to you is not to chase those pretty crushes of yours UNLESS you look good, or are bloodly rich(to chase mercenery types)...from my frds and my own experience...instead pick a pleasant-looking gal whom has great character or can click with you very well....really think you will have a much higher chance of success if you dont have either of the above, the relationship will last longer and be much more fulfilling in the long run....yeah i'm a cynic who doesnt believe in love at first sight, but lust at first sight, and that love is a thing developed over time...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Good Luck!!</div>
