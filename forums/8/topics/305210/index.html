              <p>i was in a hurry so din test the pen but the main thing is to highlight the cheating method.Even if i had tested the pen, there would still be ink as the pen lasted a few days of writing. so its not competely out of ink when i bought it.</p>

              <p>I was told while at a Popular bookstore that they don't allow testing of pens at the pen rack simply because there will be small kids who will use them to draw all sorts of things on the pieces of paper provided. But you can always approach one of the staff around for paper to test on and they will most likely give it to you.</p>
              <p>TS probably got one that was tested by many kids. :lol:</p>
