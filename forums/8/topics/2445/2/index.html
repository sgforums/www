            <div class='col-md body'>I haven't watched the show Stigmata yet. I don't think there is such a lost portion of the gospel. The gospels are just a testimonial to what Jesus did while He was here and how He brought salvation to men.<br><br>But what they said about the definition of a church is correct. The church is not the buildings we see. The church is a place of Christian worship of God. And to us, you can worship Him anywhere; on the bus, in your room, at your workplace, etc. The church is the body of Christ, and when we come accept Christ as our Lord and Saviour, we are baptised into his body. So why should there be buildings with the crosses on top of their roofs and name them churches when you can worship and experience God virtually anywhere? Well, it's where we can get together and share our mutual passion for God. It's where we encourage each other if another of us needs help.<br><br>Jesus came to bring peace. He did so by coming as a baby, not Hercules. But born to a carpenter, in the stables of Bethlehem. Being hunted down by Herod's men, who felt threatened by the existence of a "King of Jews". He was not born of a prince, wielding power to bring war. He broke down in the garden of Gethasame, praying for strength to see the work of salvation to be completed in him. Though he was innocent of the accusations, he did not retaliate even with a simple whimper when he was being tortured, stripped naked, humiliated and spat at. If his intentions were not of peace I do not know what He was thinking when he went through all that. He knew from the fall of Adam, that he will be coming to be mortal, to die and to rise again. All in obedience of God, for our salvation.<br><br>God does not condemn, that's why He renewed His covenant with us through Jesus. Only over-zealous, self-righteous Christians do. And I'm sad to admit that it is true. But their intentions though insensitive are well-intended. I applaud Jasonnex's impartial view and open-mindedness. I do hope I am not in the process of playing down anyone's beliefs, if I did, then I beg for your forgiveness.<br><br>I do hope from reading this thread of discussion that you will have a better understanding of what Christianity is really about. If you had misconceptions or doubts about it I'm willing to share my side of the story. But it's up to you to accept it. I hope and pray to that you'll be blessed by what I have shared and am going to share with you.<br><br>"I will tell of the kindnesses of the Lord,<br>the deeds for which he is to be praised,<br>according to all the Lord has done for us-"<br>Isaiah 63:7<br><br>[This message has been edited by iamsilly (edited 22 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa<br><br>You wrote : Â“U have the right to remain who u are but ultimately there is only one True God for u to accept him and serve Him faithfullyÂ”.<br><br>That is absolute nonsense. The belief that there is a one True God and to serve him faithfully means sacrificing your right to remain who you are. If everyone remains who they are Â– good, mediocre, evil, bad etc Â– they cannot accept True God on His terms and conditions for the demands of serving a God  involves accepting His terms and conditions which contradict your right to be whatever you want to be.<br><br>On the other hand, if you mean that different people have a right to remain who they are but at the same time proposing a True God (with specific terms and conditions) who demands faithful serving and is necessary for Eternal Life then it is malicious and absolutely immoral to think of conflicting lifestyles as a right when there is an absolute. For example, if you know that a glass of wine is poisoned but refuse to warn people since they have a right to choose (or not to choose) then your prior knowledge makes no sense of the right. A right is not a right when a possessed knowledge (or belief) makes the choice under the auspices of personal rights untenable. This knowledge or belief makes the notion of right immoral.<br><br>General,<br><br>The thought that all religions and beliefs lead to the same God is absolute bullshit and only for the lazy and feeble minded. It is a cop-out from intellectual probing.<br>This belief is different from pantheism (the belief that God is manifested everywhere).<br><br>Think of Islam, Taoism and Christianity for example. They all have specific terms and conditions in their construction of ideology and the deity they serve. The beliefs at some point will deny the beliefs of other religions thus making a distinction between Â‘truthÂ’ and Â‘falsityÂ’. Can a God be true and false at the same time? As such faith in any belief will involve an ideological and more importantly, a LOGICAL contradiction with the rest. Hence how can something (or God) be Â‘somethingÂ’ and Â‘NOT that somethingÂ’ at the same time.<br><br>Can a circle be a square at the same time?<br><br>Please THINK.<br><br>cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Terence,<br>I think Rinoa's saying that, no matter what you have done in the past, no matter who you were. You still will be able to choose him by grace and mercy. In the process, of knowing and accepting Him, you have thrown your past away and living your life as someone who believes in him.<br><br>We have told you which glass is poisonous. You still have the right to believe us or not. Outwardly, they look the same but the one that is not poisoned means a "restricted" life. The other that was pointed to be poison appears appealing with the fun that comes with it. Sometimes people just ignore the warning of poison if they see that the one that is supposedly poisoned has other benefits. We can only say that our right to choose is forfeited when we see someone put the poison in the glass and asked us to choose. The fact is we do not know whether the poison was put in the glass until we really drink it. And when does the poison take effect is also another factor. If in the case of eternal life coming with the non-poisoned glass, you'll only know if the poison is real if judgement comes or you died.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by iamsilly (edited 22 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I want to let people know that i dun speak from an unpriviledge position....I am an x-christian.....<br><br>the reason why I left was because it was making me sick...the way everyone around me was acting towards other people...there was this pretense of serenity and peace towards fellow man but during cell meetings they would blast these saame people....I remember what made me finally quit...I was at a meeting and they told me that they were going to have some kind of session where they walked around the neighborhood and prayed for all the lost souls who weren't listening to the words of christ....That was it for me...I felt so sick to my stomache I almost puked on their floor.<br><br>I love the ideaology behind christianity as I do buddhism or Islam or whatever religion that doesn't preach non-tolerance....but I am sick of the people who worship it...<br><br>Please dun get me wrong and think that I am against the religion itself....I've read everything that jassonnes has written and although it sounds good and a bit too ideological...how many christians out there are really different from what they should be...I, and I know many(even other christians can back me up io this), know that a lot of christians are judgemental like hell...I would even make a move to say that most do...From Sanfrancisco to Texas to Singaproe...I hear the same things coming from their lips...like they have something programmed into them and they can't break away from their own thoughts even if they wanted to...and this one Christian guy even told me that Christians are probably the most problematic people I will ever meet...haiz..but then again I already knew that from my own experiences...<br><br>Now I know that all you people iout there will feel a need to defend yourself, but what I want you to know is that I am not targeting the religion but the people who worship it.  many of them have one tracked minds...all they can do is talk about god and how wonderful he is...almost like they were trying to convince themselves more than anythign else.<br><br>The problem with a religion like Christianity and Islam is that they are of pure origins and their concepts are pure...and as anybody would know..the mor epure something is, the more prone it is to fundamentalist mentality...That's why you see so many people worshiping it for the wrong reasons...and in the process making life difficult for others...<br><br>I love the reading the bible and I like learning from it...it does have a very special meaning..but as God is my witness, I will never align myself with any organisation which has almost zero tolerance for others(others encompasses everything from race to religion or socila status...).  I shall be my own person and have my own thoughts...so much more meaning in my beliefs when I know that they are independant of outside and peer influences....<br><br>And can't I also believe in the same doctrines as islam and Christianity...but I choose to follow my own road in relating to God...Why do they tell me it's wrong...Why must i align with a grouping or organization???  it's wrong and has no meaning at all...<br><br>What meaning is it for people to blindly follow...are these people the saved?..and us, the others damned because we choose our own paths?<br><br>I am so tired of hearing from my christian friends how terrible it is to be following other beliefs or religions...and I can seriously say that I dun think they realise how judgemental they all are...<br><br>And I dun base my observations from one incident or place onli..as I have said, I've lived in Texas and in San Francisco, Antioch, forgot the other place already, and now Singapore....and all these places produce the same type of people...It's almost like christianity has become a giant clonign factory...<br><br>And here all this time I thought that what mattered most was your personal relationship with God and your fellow man...<br><br>And Why must we live on the premise of sin and salvation...Life is life.  You live it, enjoy it, make the most of it...I truly , madly, deeply, believe that life is not about making yoursself or others feel like they should be guilty for being who they are or how they live, unless it's causing pain and hurt to others....<br><br>And I've met people who are non-chrostians who have more humanity in them than chriostians have...more warmth and personability than most shcristians I've met...Something that you can feel...unlike a lot of Christians who seem to be putting on a front of generosity and niceity because theiur religion says that it should be so...<br><br>Tehrein my belief is in the religion, but not in it's followers...<br><br>and for sure I will kenna flamed for this, but I hold fast to my belief...as they have condemned me I speak out against what I see has become of people...<br><br>will write more when I can digets the above posts more...and when I finihs my work<br><br>peace to Everyone living on this planet...</div>

And forgive me for blasting the<br>atheists here as well. Your reasons for<br>disbelief in God is pure nonsense and<br>illogic. Imagine someone telling you "I<br>do not believe in God because he has been bad<br>to me", so is this person saying God exists<br>or does not exist?<br><br>For those christians who think that I have<br>been sexually abused by christians when I was<br>young, and that is why I think that<br>christianity is a social ill, you can<br>basically go to hell too. You cannot believe<br>that a person can sincerely and honestly<br>think that christianity is a social ill.<br>Come on, look at the plank in your own eyes,<br>to paraphrase Christ's own words.<br><br>And also, I personally do find the character<br>of christ inspiring, do not think of me as<br>a christ hating chap because I think that<br>christianity is a social ill (which of<br>course, it is). So do not ask me to open my<br>heart to him, when it is not even closed at<br>the same time.<br><br>And for Jasonnex, if you claim to be open<br>minded, I want you to read about all major<br>religions of the world with the same<br>intensity I do. Quit telling me to open my<br>mind to christianity when you show blatant<br>ignorance in all other major religions in<br>the whole world.<br><br>ps : my favorite book in the Bible is<br>Ecclesiastes, because of the naturalist<br>theme inside.

They're all bald, got the tok-tok drum somemore, clothes all baggy one... itz like an asian hip-hop rap group... *sigh*... jesus would definitely turn in his grave hehehe...<br>one more thing abt the sin stuff... i tot all everybody in the world is considered a sinner by christians, even christians themselves becoz of the original Sin? da whole adam &amp; eve &amp; apple incident? so i dun think christians should say they are free of sin... at least my christian frenz here tell me abt dat...<br>well, i know i'm gonna get killed for this... but i just wanna say it... one of da reason why i go to church... is coz there are SO MANY CUTE GERS THERE!!!!!!!! heehee... dat sure is an incentive to go huh? sollie... i dun mean to offend any christians out there k? but churches are a fertile grounds for dating... peace out!</div>

Congratulations, you have single-handedly undermined the entire 2000 year old ideology of Christianity in one fell swoop. I didnÂ’t know you were an atheist.<br><br>Also, check this out, Genesis Chapter 9, verses 8, 9 and 13<br>Â“ The God told Noah and his sons Â‘I am making a covenant with you and your descendantsÂ…I have placed my rainbow in the clouds, it is a sign of my permanent promise to you and to all the earth.Â”<br><br>This is explicit proof of a theological/biblical claim to GodÂ’s existence knowable to us in our lifetime so how can you say Â‘youÂ’ll only know if the poison is real if judgement comes or you diedÂ’? when this passage clearly says visual evidence of God can be seen by everyone?<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Ps. I am not anti-Christian or anti-atheist. But IÂ’m certainly anti-people who donÂ’t think for themselves. I rather talk to a Christian who can tell me the logical and moral reasons for his decision than a no-brainer Â‘I hate all ChristiansÂ’ atheist. At the same time I rather spend time with an independently thinking and reasoned atheist than a silly bible-bashing Christian who runs with the rest of the herd.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'll try to. This time in a less orthodox way.<br><br>Say there are 2 religions, A and B.<br>Imagine that the values and beliefs of these two religions are not the same, i.e. what is right for A is wrong for B. Say these values and beliefs are X, Y and Z.<br><br>We get this,<br>A = X, Y and Z<br>B = -X, -Y and -Z<br><br>So far so good. Now consider how some people think that all religions lead to the SAME God. Hence religion A and B, even though their values and beliefs contradict each other, lead to the SAME God which means,<br><br>God = (X, Y and Z) AND (-X, -Y and -Z)<br><br>This is clearly illogical. For let us say that X belief is the belief we must love all men. The negation of X would be we must hate all men. So how can a single God command us to love and hate all men at the same time?<br><br>cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thing is, ngkaihoe, religion to you is, in short, a BIG JOKE.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> You say that you appreciate this and you disregard that and then you delve into all the other religions but the verdict is, you're really just showing what you know about these religions and saying, oh this is yummy, and no oh that sux... Then in the end we discover you don't believe in anything at all...<br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>For those christians who think that I have<br>been sexually abused by christians when I was<br>young, and that is why I think that<br>christianity is a social ill, you can<br>basically go to hell too.<br>--------------------------------------------<br>It's a possibility, no? Why should anyone rule that out? You have girls who got raped by their dads and grow up to be misandrists. You have guys, who while aren't gays, turn out to be misogynists. Isn't sexual abuse a common cause for many psychological inclinations? And btw, do you at all believe in hell in the first place? A very important question, imo. If you don't that's great, cos I wouldn't be going anywhere by virtue of what you said.<br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>Quit telling me to open my mind to christianity when you show blatant<br>ignorance in all other major religions in<br>the whole world.<br>--------------------------------------------<br>Thing is, it doesn't mean that the more you read about the world's religions, the more you can actually relate to them. It's everything to do with experience. If in those 26(?) years of your life you have been a Christian, a Buddhist, a Muslim, a Taoist, a Shintoist, a Judaist, a Zoroastrian, a Satanist, etc. then it's something. You really don't just read the Bible like Ali Baba and say you know Christianity inside out. You don't just look at how *some* Christians behave and declare that Christianity is a social ill. And what, oh that book rocks! Oh man, "cubist inspiration from Job"! Or "wow, the Revelation inspired me to code BuayaICQ v2.0..." I mean... so what? It's like declaring that Buddha has a sixth toe, Mohammed has a nine-inch long whatever.. so what.. does that even paint an image of what you would become should you adhere yourself to the faith/s concerned?<br>Similarly, would you like it if some critic, instead of describing and reviewing the functionality of BuayaICQ, concentrate instead on the origin of the word Buaya? I could come up with a verbose and descriptive history of Buaya. I could delve into the anatomical details of Buaya. But that still doesn't guarantee I would understand the ICQ, the programming aspect of it, no? After all, your software is named after Buaya, just like Christianity is named after Jesus Christ, Buddhism after Buddha, etc??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&lt;quote&gt;"for those who believe in christ will go to heaven".&lt;/quote&gt;<br>I admit that im not very knowledable in the bible, though i've read it over and over again since young as a "story book".  But I'd like to interprete the above quote as that those who believe in the TEACHINGS of Christ of "love thy neighbours" etc.  The key is Divine Love.  There are many "Masters" or religions that teaches that in essence.  I dont take it that u must believe God through Christ himself personally.<br><br>I find ngkaihoe's posting very interesting.  I agree with him to a certain extend that it has become a social ill, with all the dogma.  However, what do you define as "social illness"? In a more religious though, i agree.  But in this "practical and sinful" world, its probably a necessity. Ppl are divided into classes, not really because of religion.  Rather, i feel that religion is used as a tool to do that.  Humans like to feel superior, even amongst themselves.  Does the rich like to instill communism, and share their wealth with the poor, so much so that they become equal in wealth and social status?<br><br>Im not saying that all christians are bad, but one of the reasons i dont declare myself as a Christian (though i was a believer...and probably still am), is because i cannot accept the so-called "rules and concept" that Christians MUST practice.  I have no wish to become a Christian that condemns non-christians who are loving and kind.<br><br>Terence: sorry but i'm not convinced by your reasoning of why "its bullshit for people to believe that all religions are toking abt the same God or similar".  Im just offering a different view, say someone passes the same msg to different ppl, but yet different ppl interprete it differently.  Thats why i feel that one should not follow blindly to what a preacher says.  Who knows if what he interpretes is correct?  Same thing as studying, why should you believe fully in the lecturer?  Although most of the time you may be wrong, but the point is the process of Questioning to gain more understanding. Many times, God is what humans made him up to be.  Some believe that God likes this, some believe God likes that.  So they come up with different way of worshipping.  Im not saying Satanism is the way of God.  But if the essence of the religion (be it different way of practising) is DIVINE LOVE, i would view it as the same.  Im not referring to ALL religions, but those of the same essence.  Many christians like to stick blindly to their bible.  But the bible is afterall, interpreted and written by humans.  Who is to say its 100% accurate in what msg God is trying to relay?<br><br></div>

Seems like you're the one thinking other people are having a problem with you. And when we defend Christianity, somehow you like to see yourself as the victim and we are the prosecutors. That's so extremely delusional. And you can't even envision that I'm not victimizing you. And that you can't believe that I'm sincerely and ever so devotingly trying to convince you that we're not out to victimize non-Christians and rendering them sinners.<br><br>To you, it is IMPOSSIBLE for anyone to<br>sincerely and honestly think that<br>christianity is not a religion of victimisation and penance.
