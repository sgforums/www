            <div class='col-md body'>I'm gonna say this again... u guys got to take a look at the movie Dogma... I dun think its in release in Spore though... ngkaihoe, u should check it out... its very funny but it has substance. The movie is abt 2 angels who were kicked out of heaven and plan to get back into it through a loophole in the Catholic Church System when some Cardinal, with the authorization of da Pope(someting like dat) announced dat anyone who walk through the door of his church will have all his sins cleanse... there's dat special term for it and i forgot... a term which means that if the Catholic Church has sanctioned an action it becomes like a Word of God or someting like dat lah....<br>anyways, the movie tries to give its own view of Jesus coz in the Bible, there is no mention of Jesus from age 12 - 30... and there are more stuff to it... u'll definitely like it ngkaihoe... maybe u can download from internet... if spore gov't ban half-life for violence, they'd probably ban this movie for too much religious controversy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Leyton, no offence, I'm trying to highlight the other side of the story. Imagine we are all in a cinema watching a great movie. All of a sudden someone screams "There's a bomb in here!! Everyone get out!" The interruption may construed as rude or insensitive by many people, especially when everyone is really enjoying themselves. I am drawing a parallel to someone who is comfortable in his religion and this Christian comes telling them that they need to get out of their religion.<br><br>I may be on the extreme side of the spectrum using a life and death situation as an example, but the emphasis on a Christian's preaching is about spiritual life and death.<br><br>I think it's just that we view things differently.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

I'll try anyway... do you understand hanyu pinyin?<br><br>When you said it is not possible for people to reach the same destiny thru' different god, I was thinking maybe it is still possible...<br><br>Lets put it this way, in this world, every positive side will have a negative side of it, and this I believe can be interpreted in the way that all the positives and negatives are actually complementary, and in the first place, all belong to one source. If this is true, then maybe your theory of people believing in different god will not reach the same destiny may not be establish... think of the "yin" and "yang" of chinese teaching... maybe the extreme "yin" and extreme "yang" will in the end reach the same destiny to balance themselves?<br><br>I'm really trying my best to explain this in english... and if some kind soul who read my post feel that they can explain this better, plsssss, I beg you to help.<br><br>Terence... this is really the best I can do.

            <div class='col-md body'>umm.. bochup, i tink i know wat u trying to say... i too believe strongly in the yin-yang stuff. Good and evil are complementary. Dat's why in Hindu religion, i tink u got some god(Krishna or Shiva or Vishnu i tink) dat's sometimes called the Destroyer or the (Rebirther??) i read somewhere long long time ago lah... anyways, there are religions that acknowledge the good and evil aspects of man. i tink Terence saying dat if certain beliefs in a religion clash with another like Christians can eat meat coz its like gift from God while Buddhism forbids the killing of any live animals den they cannot lead to the same God... coz if u kill an animal, according to Christian religion, as long as u still luv god and stuff, u go to heaven... while buddhism says u cannot attain nirvana dat way...<br>But in the general sense, all these religions agree that God is good and being with him is good. Everybody wants to be with God... how they choose to be with him maybe different but their goal is da same... Being with God does not mean sitting down on a bunch of clouds and playing mahjong with God... If u want extreme case, compare Satanism and Christianity... Satanists waiting for Anti-Christ... Christian waiting for 2nd coming of Christ... ultimately, they both regard Anti-Christ/Christ as omnipotent beings and wat IF they are the same entity?  Wat if God is two-faced like some Hindu god i forgot da name again... Religions may have different beliefs, but that do not mean they have drastically different goals... so it IS possible dat they all lead to da same GOD or GODs...<br>i dunno wat da hell i'm toking abt but i'm bored and bear wit me... gimme feedback too k?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>u said -- "There is nothing wrong with Christianity but some of the people in it are definitely insensitive and selfish." yes, it's only SOME. not all christians are like tt. i believe, ne religion, b it catholic, christianity, muslim, or wateva, has its bunch of extremes. extremes meaning, people go overboard thinking that that is wat their god wants them to do. this does not mean that the whole population is. by the way, i'm not implying that u said so.....<br>u also said -- "Ever see a Christian preach to you when are already confirm belong to other religion?" well, i tink, they are just trying, n hoping, tt they will b able to touch u, to save u, (in their words). i believe, it ain't wrong to try n hope right??? "Ever attend a Christian wedding dinner where they pray on stage and assume everyone is one of them when in the first place, they ignore their parents who are not.  DonÂ’t they know respect for the elder?" they do not assume tt everyone present is one of them like u say. it's just a ceremony. n since it's a Christian wedding, it has to be done the christian way right? if not, how can it be called a christian wedding? it isn't tt they have no respect for the elders, but it's a custom. just like traditional chinese wedding, where u have to serve tea to ur parents on ur knees.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ponders&gt; I think thats cos Christianity must stay contemporary &amp; relate to people in todays cultural context while of course following true to the word of God.  many of the "traditional" hymns sung in todays churches are actually popular music during the 17th &amp; 18th centuries.<br><br>[This message has been edited by mateo (edited 27 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just a thought...<br><br>Why are Christians Christians?  One of the factors is the environment where they are brought up in.  One example, the reason why whites are mostly christians is mainly because the religion is very widely-spread there.  Bring up a white child in China...mostly likely they turn out to be Buddhist/Taoist.  So... can u condemn say..a non-christian African simply because the "One and Only God" did not reach him?<br>One interesting point on the bible:  Chinese are never mentioned in it.  How do u think most whites will feel...if u tell them the coming messiah will be dark-skinned?<br><br>As the saying goes "Those who profess to worship Christ shall be the first to deny him when he returns".  This applies to many worshippers of other religions where God is what they made up to be.  They believe so much in what they believe, that sometimes... they simply cant see the simple truth  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey man...just to say something to all of u out there...esp ngkaiho..<br><br>You see, you're a very smart person you<br>read the Bible, show off ur knowledge.<br>Impress people, good way. You weigh the<br>facts, your own ideologies, and come to<br>the conclusion, that Christianity is a<br>social ill. Well then, i'm a very young<br>person, and i can't compare to someone<br>who's obviously terrible good at debating.<br>But then again, i must say this, incase u haven't read the book of Romans : " Professing themselves to be wise,<br>they became fools."  I shan't say that<br>you've been blinded by the world, since<br>your reply would, and will be very obvious.<br>Concluding with, Christianity is a social ill.<br>Well then, what i'm trying to say is that,<br>sometimes when you think you're too smart,<br>you slap Christians with your good language<br>and philosopies, you feel good. You end off saying " Hah, bunch o' losers. Damn, I'm good". Sure you are.<br>What i'm trying to say here is that, don't insult Christianity directly or indirectly coz it isn't very nice. Biasness and stereotypical comments aren't so good sometimes.  And then you would probably say<br>that i should take a look at myself, since<br>you can by now conclude that i myself, must<br>and should be a Christian.<br>You can't blame me for protecting my own<br>belief, since everyone feels the<br>responsibilty to protect something so close<br>to oneself.  You'd probably say that<br>Christians dun have their own backbones,<br>whatever they do they pray to God. Giving<br>a lot of people the impression that they're<br>practically useless by themselves. You're<br>looking at too many Christians who are they<br>same amongst themselves. There are others<br>like me who aren't like that. You can say that i am in a way contradicting myself and<br>that Christianity has lotsa loopholes and is<br>full o' crap. But never say that its a<br>social ill. If you think you're so smart,<br>and that you are so damn sure of where you're<br>going, till then, don't blaspheme or be a smartass and talk so much.<br><br></div>

But rather feel that the msg is saying that the way to God is through the teachings of Jesus, ie Love for everyone, and not exactly by simply believing that he is the son of God.<br><br>Just a personal view:<br>Jesus said he is the son of God.  However, we are also the children of God.  The significant difference is that Jesus is so full of love.   If we are able to achieve that, we are probably as great as he is.  Perhaps... just perhaps, Jesus chose to die (in the name of God) because if he does not, there may be even more chaos and bloodshed if his believers fight against his "enemies"( whom he loves too).  Rather, if he dies and lives within the heart of many, his intended msgs of love shall be widely spread.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Asure (edited 27 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes Asure, it is true that people are brought up in a culture where Christianity forms a major part of their upbringing. But Chrisitianity is not just for the caucasians nor is it particularly tailor-made for any race. When Jesus comes back, He would not appear in any paricular race; He wouldn't be Chinese, He wouldn't be African, nor any other skin colour. The mortal body we possess now is just a vessel. It is not the physical body that is important to us. When we believed in Him, our spiritual side is made alive. It was dead when when Adam committed the first Sin and death came to us all.<br><br>So if you really want to call yourself a Christian. It's not whether your parents brought you up that way, nor is purely on doing good deeds. It's your believe iin Christ's death on the cross, ie you are forgiven of your sins, and His resurrection, that you have a new beginning with Him. Once you accepted that, you "die" and will be made alive spiritually in Him.<br><br>Ponders,<br>I do believe that we need to be constantly changing to remain relevant to remain relevant to the world. But I quite disapprove to the examples you quoted. It is true that the decision to follow Christ is your decision. However, I do not suggest that they become loggerheads withtheir parents because of their parents. We read in the bible to honour your parents, and that is what we should do. If they really want to follow Christ, then I suggest that they pray about it. Let their parents see that Christianity has more benefits than "betrayal" of roots. If they handle the situation in a Christlike manner, I'm Christ "will sort out their beliefs".<br><br>I came from a family of buddhust background. It was through my secondary school and my ECA that introduced me to Christianity. I wanted to go church but I asked for permission. I was told to do whatever I like but do not preach at home and not to get baptised. Well, I kept my promise for almost 12 years already. I did not directly preached to anyone at home, nor did I put down their religion. 4 years into my faith, I wanted very much to get baptised. I prayed about it and asked patiently for my mum's permission. Year after year, she said no. It was 4 years of patience that my mother consented. She understooded that my belief in Christianity was not a flash in the pan and my respect for her was the same before and after I took to Christianity. What I'm saying to all the Christians out there is: be faithful and fruitful; do not take things into your own hands, trust Him; honour Him and He'll definitely honour you.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by iamsilly (edited 27 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Asure:<br>Just a personal view:<br>Jesus said he is the son of God.  However, we are also the children of God.  The significant difference is that Jesus is so full of love.   If we are able to achieve that, we are probably as great as he is.  Perhaps... just perhaps, Jesus chose to die (in the name of God) because if he does not, there may be even more chaos and bloodshed if his believers fight against his "enemies"( whom he loves too).  Rather, if he dies and lives within the heart of many, his intended msgs of love shall be widely spread.</blockquote>Just to back up what you said:<br>'Jesus replied, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of wheat falls to ground and deis, it remins only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds..." John 12:23-24'    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by iamsilly (edited 27 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hello to all of you....<br>just to make it clear, i am a christian and i believe in sharing god with everybody, even if they do not want to hear about it.<br><br>okay.. from what i haf seen so far, most non-christians are mainly against the way christians try to "force" christianity on them, reason being that you dont think that you need to be saved through christianity. some even say that you havent sinned (as in done anythign wrong). i mean, what can i say? obviously you have done wrong things in your life that you regret, or should be regretting. i do not think this is a valid reason and i think that many atheist would also agree with me. as such, you do not see the need for a god to save you. and as such, you dislike the christians who share god with you because you think that you dont need it and that they are just being a busybody.<br>this is what you have against most christians, as it would appear.<br>the next greatest commandment is love thy neighbour as thyself. now, it is through love that people evangelise, and share the word of God. the wrong way of doing this is that they think "oh i haf to do good, so i must save them". no. this is not how it works. having said that, this does not mean that people do not evangelise for this reason. sometimes it happens. no one is perfect. what happens sometimes is that they become desperate to "save" someone that they may become fanatical in a sense. i do agree that sometimes people will go too far to accomplish this. one must realise that god doesnt want fanatics to drive away his people.<br>to those non-christians, this is just a reason, not an excuse. evangelism is part of being a christian and one shouldnt hate us becuase we do. one must stick to his beliefs, athiests included. it is part of christianity. you dont believe in our god. we dont dislike you for that. we believe in evangelism. you dislike us. why? please think about this.<br><br>i have tried to include as much people in my thoughts but it is not possible to cover what has been said in this discussion. i hope this has helped somebody in someway.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Got this concept from Tom Robbins =)<br><br>Jesus, Buddha and others are great thinkers.  They have actually figured out the thing about life, etc, the things we want to achieve.  But when, say, Jesus' message was passed on to the first generation prophets, they didn't get it fully because they're nowhere as perfect as Jesus.  In fact, they might get some things wrong.  And so the prophets passed on what they know and we're thousands of years away from them, so imagine what kind of things we have to rummage through?<br><br>I'd say be wary.  I know Catholicism entails my devotion to church but the church can be wrong, it's run by people and despite what anyone might say I don't believe God talks daily with anyone.  Why are you lashing against Christianity?  Have you ever bothered really studying the religion, not the people, not the rules, just what it says?<br><br>Love God and love your neighbour as much as you love yourself, if not lofty, is not such a nutty teaching.  And that's it, it's supposed to make living with so many people more bearable. Or if you're optimistic it may help us achieve global happiness.<br><br>On the other hand, certain things bother me:<br><br>Why is Christianity so patriarchal?  The father, the son?  I don't understand why women cannot be priests when I've been assured that it's not because men are more infallible than women.<br><br>Some "reported" words of Jesus..dunno if the gospel lies, it's after all written by human.  He said that he is the only way to reach god.  In other instances, I haven't come across other parts where he sounds this egoistical.<br><br>The concept that we're here for a test, good goes to heaven, evil goes to hell.  Supposedly God wants his devoted to sing him praises and "glorify his name".  Even Jesus made a parable about the farmer and his three employees.  He left them with money and the one who kept it safe without giving him any profit was given the boot.  The moral of the story is that we should make use of what has been given to us to gain more, and eventually return it all back to him.  Why would he want these things?  If it's some sort of test why should he bother knowing full well that we're under his mercy?<br><br>Truthfully, I don't think He'd bother with such petty things, it sounds too human altogether.<br><br>Finally,<br><br>Christianity:  If ever people look at me and wonder where do I got this serenity from, and they may learn that it's because I've been succesful in practicing the true Christianity, love.<br><br>Christianity:  Jesus telling the crowds who's anxious to prosecute an adultress (or a whore?) that the one without sin may cast the first stone.<br><br>Christianity:  I am feeling less lonely at night even though no one is around.<br><br>PS:  No, I'm not serene at all and though I find faults with the Church, I know that it has its good points.  Don't over stereotype it like what Stigmata has done, such a cheap shot.</div>
