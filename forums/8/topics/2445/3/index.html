            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly speaking, I also AVOID PEOPLE who come preaching to me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I would tell them, "But I am a Christian!" And they would say, much to my dismay: "Great! So let's discuss the Bible!"<br><br>So you see, even Christians get "preyed".<br><br>While I think that spreading the gospel is a part of Christianity that should not be ignored, I think it's an area where every Christian should approach with caution, at the risk of coming across as nothing more than an unscrupulous salesperson.<br><br>And seriously if you happen to be approached by these Christian crusaders again sometime, tell them, if you care, that they'd be better serving God and Jesus if they went around selling flags and doing community work for charity instead. From the looks of it, this fanatical evangelism is causing more against the religion than for it.<br><br>If they happen to think Buddhism and Taoism are all idolatrous religions, tell them also that the Catholics have statues too. And hardly anyone from the major religions pray to statues and idols as if all power came from them. They're just points of focus.<br><br>In NUS, there's this Campus Crusade thingy which I found to be very evangelistic, but I'm glad they're always willing to accept new ideas that may or may not undermine the authority, or even the authenticity of several laid down biblical foundations -- concepts that the more conservative ones would classify as 'New Age' and therefore occultic.<br><br>Somehow, charismatic churches have grown increasingly popular and many of them are, you know, doing the preaching and stuff on the streets.<br><br>The Catholic church that I used to attend is very universal. Some of the more devout Christians would say that they shouldn't consume offerings made to Taoist gods, that they shouldn't hold joss sticks, etc. My Catholic church taught me differently. If you eat the offering and believe it to be honouring God (note: no differentiation is made between this Christian figure and the Taoist deity), then there's nothing wrong with that. Also, if you hold joss sticks, look into the idol of Tua Peh Kong, Ah Neo, Nezha or GuangGong and believe that you're praying to God, there's also nothing wrong with that (which is really why Catholics have statues). The celebration of Chinese new year is also totally legitimate, and the belief in the Chinese zodiac, while not encouraged, is totally fine if it's in line with custom.<br><br>Controversial, but when you come to the bottom of it, outwardly appearances are merely superficial. Even a prostitute can be holier than a priest, as the biblical stories of Mary Magdalene and the Pharisees would've illustrated.<br><br>And the thing about rivalry between the Protestants and the Catholics in N. Ireland, you should note that the dispute is politically-induced and is almost historical. It is something uniquely Irish -- Irish separatists (who happen to be Catholics) and British loyalists (who happen to be Anglicans/Protestants). So you see, nationalism is really the cause of bloodshed, not religion.<br><br>But of course, rivalry between Christian denominations were common back in the Middle Ages.<br><br>It was believed that Christianity would've had a larger following in China had it not been the bitter rivalry between the Jesuits and the Dominicans back in the 15th-16th century. The former adopted a 'fit-in' policy -- converted Chinese Christians are permitted to carry out their customs (including the pasting of images of door gods). And they also learned to appreciate Confucianism, which in reality reflects many Christian virtues. As such the Jesuits converted thousands of Chinese, some of whom were ministers in the Qing court. The Dominican friars, driven by envy, wrote to the Pope and insisted that the Jesuit policy was wrong and the tolerance of any pagan customs was heretical. And that was the time of the madness known as the Inquisition, when heresy was deemed more dreadful than the plague. The Pope ordered the Jesuits to stop, not once, but twice. And they did in the end, sadly -- 'cos the Jesuits, although were more liberal than the other Catholic factions, were very, very loyal to the Pope -- the founder of the sect swore allegiance to the Pope when he failed to reach Bethlehem to fulfil some duties.<br><br>As such, the Jesuit mission failed and Christianity in China went back to square one. A classic example of tolerance and understanding that perpetuated an advancement. And intolerance, jealousy and blind faith that brought about a decline.<br><br>So shall we all be tolerant and work together? The recent news about various religious leaders attending the Hindu body-piercing event was really, really inspiring. And so was the news on how a Buddhist temple donated money to a Muslim home for the aged/disabled, transcending racial, cultural and religious barriers. Such is the essence of divine love, as someone has previously spoken about, which is the most crucial thing to learn, adopt and advocate for anyone who believes in a religion.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Asure,<br>It doesn't matter if the multipicity of religions nowadays historically originate from one source or that there are many sources of origination. The undeniable fact is, given the multipilicity of religions, there exists conflicting and contradictory beliefs from one religion to another. For example, lets take the two most popular mono-theisms - Islam and Christianity. Both accept that the historical figure of Jesus existed. However, Islam considers him a mere teacher and prophet who is NOT to be worshipped while Christianity considers him the Messiah who obviously deserves worship. Both Islam and Christianity preach Divine Love but what is the nature of this divinity? Allah or Jehovah? This is very important because they have further beliefs that contradict each other. Both religions believe in the notion of Judgement Day. The Christians believe that Jesus comes down to judge while the muslims believe His second coming is symbolic of the anti-christ after which Allah will render judgement. Clearly there is a gulf of distinction where belief in either MUST contradict the other.<br><br>Also, if Love is all that is needed for access to God then the atheist who is kind and loving will also go to heaven. But heaven doesn't exist for him!!!<br><br>Sorry but I still think this idea is utter bullshit.<br></div>

The decision is really up to you to make, whether it beneficial or whether it's a social ill as Kaihoe put it. Christianity to me, is a process of knowing God.<br><br>I just wish everyone all the best in choosing how you should live your lives.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey ppl,<br><br>Wat i feel is that no god, heaven, hell or watsoever exist.<br><br>In this modern time, religions are juz things of the past. Science and technology will be there to erradicate any fear and uncertainties of the myterious with true facts and evidents.<br><br>Of cos it can still remain in ppl's heart, juz like any other festivals.<br><br>So let's open up our mind to the world, or universe! dun let it be narrowed down by religious beliefs. Let's move towards the new era, the 21st century! or the space age.... !! perhaps?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Terence, this post is for you.<br><br>Hi guys(everyone included)... I've never ever dared to start such a topic becos I forsee people getting into fights out of this topic. So far so good though, I see Jassonex smiling, I see kaihoe still joking, and iamsilly still tries very hard to sound neutral...<br><br>I'm not about to post anything pros or cons about christianity... I've discussed too much about these, and get tired of it. FYI, I came in touch with Christianity since age 9, and till today I've not converted, cos they are some teachings in christianity that does not goes with my beliefs. Most of my bestfrens are christians, and I always joke about their religion... hee hee... for fun lah... no insults intended... like "xie zu long en"....   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>ok terence, heres my part for you. Just something for you to think about, not trying to denounce what you've written previously. I'm thinking of what you've written also... While what you've written about X, Y, Z and -X, -Y, -Z makes common sense, I can't help but doubt whether the world is really so simple. Maybe... just maybe, totally opposite beliefs can lead to the same god...<br><br>Think of the chinese's "yin" and "yang", that they complement each other, and reach a balance, and Einstein's "xiang dui lun"... dunno what you call it in english... me angmoh not very good, almost the whole forum know...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>And I also think that maybe... just maybe... people may attain eternal life thru' extreme evil... the evil in reference here is not the layman's evil... its an alignment to the dark side of the world... dark thinking really hv nothing wrong about them... just that they may believe all men are evil, etc.<br><br>This is just too difficult to explain(esp. in English), but I believe your intelligence is enuf to make you know what I'm trying to say... I will only be able to explain better in chinese, and face to face...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>If you're ever interested in reading any chinese book, I suggest reading "Lao Zi"'s "Dao De Jing"... and maybe you can explain to me what its trying to say... after reading the first 2 pages of the book, I gave up(temporarily)... so that I can take a rest... believe me... it drained me out totally... like having sex with a ghost... ha ha ha.... me disorganise again... bye!<br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming? Like asif I care.....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is truly hopeless for anyone to argue with a hardcore christian because he will always think he right, just because "the BIBLE SAYS SO"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>However, there are many contradictions in the bible which you will have to figure out.<br><br>Christians always say you have a choice between going to heaven or going to hell just by converting to christianity.<br><br>But what about a newly born child who dies before the word christianity can be told to him? What about the countless tribes in the Amazon forests or wherenots who do not even speak English, have never heard of Christianity? What CHOICE did they have?!  Do they go straight to hell then? If thats the case, then that is truly fucked up.<br><br>If god is truly omnipotent, that would mean he would know all and see all, every little process of man, molecule, atom has all been planned by him, he would then have known Adam and Eve would have eaten the apple, he would have known Lucifer would betray him. Then why did he even bother???<br><br>Another logic is the Teodice Theorem<br><br>1. Assumption - god exists<br>2. Assumption - god is good<br>3. Assumption - god is almighty<br>4. There is evil in the world<br><br>Assumption: The Universe in imperfect. Bad things can happen to good people and good things can happen to bad people.<br><br>If god exists, as described above, then he has the knowledge that the universe is not a perfect place.<br>Conclusion based on assumption and the definition of God as all knowing.<br>If god exists, as described above, then he has the ability to make it a perfect place.<br>Conclusion based on god as all powerful being<br><br>Assumption: Allowing someone to suffer, when you have the ability to easily prevent the suffering is not good.<br>If god exists, as described above, then he would make the universe a perfect place.<br>Conclusion based on god as all good and assumption that allowing suffering is not good.<br><br>So, if god exists, the universe is a perfect place. This contradicts an assumption. Therefore, one of the assumptions is incorrect. Either the universe is perfect, allowing suffering is good, or god does not exist. The one that makes the most sense to me is that god does not exist.<br><br>Can you really trust the bible all the way? What makes you think it wasn't just written by another William Shakespeare? Could it not be just another story like Julius Caesar or Romeo and Juliet?<br><br>Most christians are just people who are so weak mentally that they cannot accept the hard facts of existence and so have to invent a reason behind everything and a good way to justify anything they see as potentially unpleasant. This is true for most christians, and I will probably piss off most of them.<br><br>Christianity should definitely be more of a way of life as in it teaches you many good things, but if you're gonna take it in as a follower or just so that you won't go to 'hell', trust me.... you have no CHOICE.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting topic. Christianity is supposed to be so simple that even a child can accept Christ. Is it possible to take Christianity at it's most basic level? That is to say that God loved mankind so much that He sacrificed His Son? If it is so, should we love God in return? Is it necessary to prove Christianity? Maybe it can never be proven. Much of believing whether the bible is true or not stems in faith which is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this is a reply to what turtle said on 22 January well....u said that if you've got your facts right about the part where Jesus was sent down to spread the word of God and that why should we believe in him when the main point should be God?(im rephrasing the question)well, you didnt get your facts right! In the bibles its states that:-<br>Jesus said "I am the way, the truth and the life.No one come to the Father BUT through me."<br>well..we believe in Jesus for it is thru him that we can go to our Father.It is God,our father, would sent his son down Jesus to died on the cross for our sins.<br>Just think..how would u feel if someone died for you?jus think about it.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>I don't really want to comment but it irks me at time.  There is nothing wrong with Christianity but some of the people in it are definitely insensitive and selfish.<br><br>Ever see a Christian preach to you when are already confirm belong to other religion?  Make me wonder is it their doing that they are constantly clashing with Muslim in Indonesia.  Ever attend a Christian wedding dinner where they pray on stage and assume everyone is one of them when in the first place, they ignore their parents who are not.  DonÂ’t they know respect for the elder?<br></div>
