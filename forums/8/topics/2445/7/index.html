            <div class='col-md body'>Er, I hate to say this 77, but Jews do not believe in the Book of Revelations. I don't know whether you are aware of how the Christian's Bible came about, but here's a synopsis.<br><br>The Holy Bible is divided into 2 parts; the Old Testament and the New Testament. The Old Testament is essentially the Hebrew (or Jewish) scriptures. I say "essentially" because the Jewish scriptures today is not exactly the same as the Old Testament in a Christian's Bible. Until the 100A.D, early Christians never saw a need to have a New Testament. It was only later that Church fathers recognised the importance of having a Bible specifically tailored for Christians. After all, unlike the Jews following the Old Testament, Christians did not have to eat "kosher" food or circumcise themselves. The new belief was that grace can only be obtained through faith in Jesus Christ, and not through acts. So the early Church fathers sourced around for writings about Christ. They came upon many, many gospels, but found four that was consistent with each other. These four are the gospels written bu John, Luke, Mark and Mathhew. After the gospels came the epistles of Paul, which are really letters written to the early churches. The last book, Revelations, was put into the New Testemant at a much later date.<br><br>Today, there are three different versions of the Bible. The most common one is the Protestant's Bible. The second version is the Catholic's Bible which has 7 extra books or chapters in it, and the third version is the Eastern Orthodox Bible which has 5 extra books or chapters in it.<br><br>Hope I helped.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
