            <div class='col-md body'>It is true that there are some Christians that go to the extreme to convert people they know. There will always be black sheeps, in any other religions or culture. For example,Thai monks falling to corruption, Muslim religious teachers to sexual sins.<br><br>In the same way, certain Christians becomes overzealous in what they believe. Over-excited about their eternal life to share. i cannot justify their actions, but I do know they love the One above a lot and they just want to bless you with something they really believe in.<br><br>We do not for one fantasise about our faith. It's a real and ongoing experience. History has proven certain things about Christianity, it's no fiction. We do not fantasise about us being sinners. Who wants to be known as a sinner? Who wants to convince themselves that they are creeps and unrighteous? The truth is that ALL of us are sinners. Who has been a saint all his life? I'm not for sure. But I know I have been forgiven, and I have claim the right to this gift of mercy that He freely gives.<br><br>So what is a Christian? The word Christian only came about after Jesus, during the widespread followers of Christ. Christian, simply means little Christs. It simply means following His footsteps He left. So what did He do when He was here? He loved God, He trusted Him, He obeyed Him. He made the way, He showed, now it's up to you to walk it.</div>

I mean, what other religions do that? Of course they do not encourage other religions, but they do not condemn them all the way.<br><br>Also, if I got my facts right, Jesus came spreading the word of GOD, thus, the real belief should be in GOD, and not Jesus right?<br><br>Next, let's say I am a free-thinker, and I believe in all gods. The thing is that why do all Christians condemn me? I mean, I believe in GOD and I trust in Him, though I do feel my way of worship is not the Christian way. Why are Christians so set tht their ways of worship are what the Creator wants??<br><br>Just my thoughts....hope someone can help me clear up my doubts.......not meant to offend in any way.

            <div class='col-md body'>Christianity is a concept that has been interpreted multifariously by people through the ages. It has been the different facets of interpretation which have given Christianity (in the same way poor interpretations of other religions, philosophies, peoples and cultures) a bad name. The raison d'etre of Christianity does not promote evil nor seeks to cause harm. Like any ideology it has been applied as an apparatus by men with less than pure intentions.<br><br>cheers<br><br>[This message has been edited by Terence (edited 22 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i used to hate christianity, and despise all christians because of their holier-than-thou attitude, and my friends constantly lording over me that they'll go to heaven while i'll rot in hell... why? simply because they're christians. most christians aren't as 'hardcore' as that, but many do attempt to 'convert' their 'loved ones' and friends around them, claiming that christianity was the TRUE religion and all the other religions were... well, evil. i used to get extremely agitated when i heard this, but now... i guess i've mellowed out. i realise that it's pointless to argue head-on with someone who's so convicted and convinced of her beliefs that nothing you say would ever change her mind. my friend once confided in me about how hurt she felt when she attempted to convert another classmate of hers and was chewed out. it was only after that conversation with her, that i realised that sometimes, christians do this with your best interests at heart. they sincerely believe that you need to be 'saved' and they want to 'help' you. perhaps bearing that in mind when a christian friend attempts to convert you again will make the 'conversion' a little easier to bear.<br><br>personally, i believe in a God. and that all religions are actually just different routes to Him, to reach Him... whatever that entails. afterall, in my humble opinion  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">, as long as you're essentially good, what does it matter? being good doesn't mean going to church every sunday, how many hours you dedicate to prayer each day, or even how many people you manage to 'save'... even if a person does all this, if it's only because she's thinking of the 'reward' (ie going to heaven) and to lord over everyone else how holy she is, then i think God would be even more displeased with her than say... a man who doesn't believe in God but is still essentially good. i always felt that God can read your intentions, He alone knows what's in your heart other than you. he doesn't judge you, but... he sees. but it doesn't mean that you just have to think good thoughts and you're 'holy'... this is where religion comes in. religion is like a textbook, a certain set of things to follow so you can feel that little bit more secure in your faith. afterall, if i do this this this and this, it proves i'm good! i believe! however, my main point is, that it isn't what you do, but why you do it.<br><br>i really have no idea which religion i fit into by saying all this.. hmm, can anyone help clear my doubts??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've been away for so long and now when I come back this thing pops up...<br><br>All I can say is that a lot of you, KaiHoe, Lex and Firewire have totally... I mean TOTALLY miscontrued Christianity.<br><br>Just because there are Christians coming up to you and labelling you as a sinner and offering you an option to be saved doesn't mean that that's what is all about. Certainly salvation through Jesus is the core of Christian doctrine. But Christianity as a whole encompasses this.<br><br>What all of you are dissing is perhaps the PREACHING. That's about it. You really have nothing against Christianity but any ill feelings you have acquired against it stem from the way fundamentalist and evangelical Christians have spoken against you.<br><br>Just as Christians have grown to accept new ideas, why don't you people accept the Christian point-of-view? Acceptance doesn't mean belief. It's more of an understanding. And if you'd ask me, adhering to dogmas alone doesn't make you better, or more religious than someone who's atheistic.<br><br>Thing is, being a true Christian means you adopt the long-standing virtues of Christianity, of love, compassion and non-judgement between fellow mortals. Likewise, true Buddhists adhere to Buddhist principles and true Muslims stick to the Muslim way of life.<br><br>You don't cast Buddhists aside, just cos one sect may be utterly fanatical over leadership and hierarchy (eg Lama Buddhism). Likewise Islam isn't about terrorism, just because you heard of Muslim terrorists and the strict Islamic penal code that stems from the Mosaic Law. Similarly you shouldn't label Christianity as something psychological or evil just 'cos you have some of its members coming up to you and calling you sinner.<br><br>Almost certainly, science shouldn't be cast aside just because it is through science that Man has given birth to the atomic bomb, to biochemical weapons, to unscrupulous genetic cloning... I mean if it's because of these reasons that science should be eradicated I think it's totally tragic.<br><br>Equally stupifying therefore is the total disregard of any religion just because you don't agree with some of its doctrine.<br><br>You may argue that the foundings of Christianity isn't exactly "holy". Indeed  Christian history after all is one of constant strife and bloodshed, right down to the holiest pyres. But isn't history anywhere else the same?!<br><br>Thing is, you can say you're advocating your religion, you can say you're extending a field in science, but notice even when that is done through your own selfish purpose of world domination as long as you're doing it with the help of religion or science, you're remembered in history to have done evil through religion or science, when in actual fact religion and science wants nothing to do with you?<br><br>Loving your neighbour, loving your enemies, judge not if you are yourself prone to judgement, do things because you wanna do them and not because you want to show people that you're doing them... While these are considered Christian virtues because Jesus taught them, they are also moral values shared by many other religions...<br><br>So why can't you all accept that Christianity is THAT... and is not seeking instead to first degrade you, then save you and if not attempt to punish you? Maybe in olden days when Christianity is more like an organisation centred around a few mortals who aren't exactly glorious. And principles of Obedience to the Church, of adherence to doctrine, dogma and tradition were essential parts of the faith. But if you ask a true Christian today, they're not gonna tell you all these. Unless of 'cos you've had one of those really radical Christians speaking to you, which is not unlike having a Ptolemist coming up to you and insist that the universe is geocentric.<br><br>Mother Theresa, whom I consider a great and exemplary Christian didn't go round Calcutta and get the Hindus to come to Christ, at least not by word of mouth. I have Christian friends who don't go around calling people sinners.. instead, we tell others who Jesus is, what He teaches and what He promises... Who are we to call people sinners when God Himself loves us all? It's like calling your brother a bastard, and your father's not gonna like that.<br><br>That is now the prevailing thought -- that compassion and charity rules the day over everything else. Because a Christian (in this context), becomes a Christian not because he goes to Church, sings hymns or donates money to the Church.. instead he is a Christian when he does what Christ does. Self-profession doesn't count. That is certainly, absolutely the trend these days among the Christian denominations.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Among the more enigmatic verses of the Bible, the conversation between Peter and Jesus.. oh I don't have a Bible with me now.. but you check it out.<br><br>Jesus chooses Peter the "Rock" upon which he shall build his church. And Jesus says that the gates of hell shall not prevail over it.<br>Peter, as it was believed, went on to create the first Church which eventually became the Catholic Church. By right, everything that comes from this Church should be nothing less than divine, since the gates of hell should never prevail over it.<br><br>The Inquisition, among others, stand as the greatest contradiction to that statement. Many academics believe it to be Devil-induced. Theologists carefully call that the period in which the Church has turned away from God.<br><br>But a few lines down in that same conversation, when Jesus prophesized his own death, Peter said something like, "No that will not happen unto you."... And Jesus turned to Peter and said, "Get behind me Satan you speak not of God but that of Man.." Satan has gotten hold of Peter then, even though it was mentioned before that that the gates of hell shall not prevail over the Church which was to be built over Peter!<br><br>What does that mean? Christianity -- the core fundamentals of Christianity, the love the compassion etc -- is divine. But that certainly doesn't abstain the Christian from sin, from temptation, from Satan. You see, Peter might think he was saying the right thing when he said passionately, "No Jesus you would not die!!!" Similarly Christians<br>who preached to people calling them sinners and getting them to join their conversion sessions might think they're right too. When you see, the rightness and wrongness of it is in question. When even human logic and compassion isn't divine. And what isn't divine is WRONG.<br><br>For more than a thousand years, human logic (and observation) maintained that the earth was at the centre of the universe since 140 AD when it was WRONG. And when even the Catholic Church defended it, it was still WRONG.<br><br>Thing is Christians are still mortals, flesh and blood. Spiritual rejuvenation doesn't immunise the soul from further sin or from errant judgements. But it helps to instill a fresh new start if you've doused too much unwanted complications in your life.<br><br>Then again, why is it that Christian couples separate? Why is it that a good, "reborn" Christian marries another Christian only to eventually get divorced? Doesn't Christianity guarantee happiness?<br><br>Precisely, it doesn't. Sometimes people expect too much. Christianity is a lifelong process -- what it doesn't give you it makes up to you in other ways.<br><br>People used to have high expectations for science too. Some even thought that by the year 2001 we would've moving sidewalks and that cars that run on carbon dioxide would be everywhere... looking at the state of things, we may not even reach that goal by 2010.<br><br>And sometimes when you see those poor, starving Christians on TV you pity them. But do you really think they want to be pitied? Not always. Life may be hard and harsh for them but at least spiritual fulfillment cancels out their physical hunger. Then you wonder maybe it is you, who has all the material needs but, perhaps, lacking in others, who needs to be pitied instead.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, i share the view that "all roads lead to rome".  Different ppl have diff way of practice.  You do not have to belong to a particular sect/religion to reach God, as long as the essence of love is within you. Who knows, all the so called established religions are all worshipping the same God, just in a different way.<br>Its all in your heart, in your mind.  Search within yourself, and he will be there".<br><br>As below:<br>The teachings of a Master appear different in different times. The needs of the time and the place vary. Few would have said the words of Buddha matched those of Krishna or Jesus. But in essence they all said the same thing - that there is one God and that we are all part of him. That it is important to realize this great truth while we are on Earth. But over time the message becomes distorted. People take God out of man and put him up in an imaginary heaven, where he is of no use to anyone. Or else they found a religion based on worship of a particular Master. Yet Buddha never founded Buddhism. Christ never founded Christianity. Krishna hardly spoke about religion at all.<br><br>However, religion is not necessarily bad. Where it turns men and women inward and helps them realize that they are as great as the creator who created them, that there is an ocean of love and silence deep within the heart, then it is useful. But where it divides people against one another, where one person is led to believe he is saved and another is damned, or where it leads a person to think that true happiness will be found only in an afterlife, then it is harmful. One religion is not better than the other. Where religion awakens divine love, it is useful. Where it narrows the mind with dogma, it is harmful.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Asure (edited 22 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting topic... just hope to clarify some doubts I have about Christianity...<br>Is there really such a thing as the " Lost part of the Gospel " ???  For your information, it was mentioned in the movie " Stigmata ". Does the supposedly lost part really quote God as indirectly saying that we do NOT need churches to reach HIM, instead " Split a rod, you'll find me there; Lift a rock, you'll find me there too ". What was more or less quoted essentially means that God is trying to say that He is everywhere, and the church is nothing but a mere building. Anyway, for those who did not catch the movie, it was suggested that this supposed version of the lost Gospel was dismissed by the church, presumably because certain individuals in power fear the loss of it. Anyway, I'm not a Christian, but I do hold the religion in great respect. Just wanna clarify some doubts as the supposed Lost Gospel does make some sense to me. Any takers?</div>
