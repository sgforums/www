And you must be sinless, where then Him can find you.<br>Thus, religion is born.<br><br>It is somethinng where man even now will put their heart into it. Knowing that an eternal life awaits them. Knowing that they must do good in their life time or be punished.<br><br>Where they have a spritual comfort, just as in the darkest of the night and coldest of the winter, they know they are not alone.<br>They WILL be someone to guide them if they are lost.

            <div class='col-md body'>Bboss2, unlike our human minds, our bodily cells cannot think for themselves. The human body is a system and functions as one. Your blood cannot choose it's path. We can. Comparing our relationship with God to our cells' relationship to us would seem illogical. You would be leaving out the element of choice.<br><br>Let's for a moment assume that our cells can think. If you do not love your cells, that doesn't neceassrily mean that God does not love you. You're putting God in a box to assume that what you think is what He thinks.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think Christianity is a very "established" religion in Singapore. Although it may seem that many teenagers are going into Christianity, but I don't think they really know the true meaning to it. They're merely following what their friends are doing. Some are just being "forced" into it in the sense that they're being dragged to the church by their Christian friends. All those sense of Christianity is only on the surface. Deep down their hearts, they don't really know what they're following. They may say that they have sinned and asked God for forgiveness, but all those forgiving and sinning are just a reason for them to have a reason to escape. To escape the facts of reality. If they know they're going to sin by doing such a thing, they shouldn't have done it in the first place. It may seems that it's common for human to make errors, but the true meaning of Christianity is to be Godlike. So, for my own opinion, and I repeat, MY OWN OPINION, is that Christianity is just like any fashionable accessories and happens to be the "in" thing now in Singaporean.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another interesting thread. poopooMoon..you are very 'hardworking' disciple of your God..father of Jesus (no pun intend). Many many questions for you..care to answer?<br><br>If Christianity is not a religion, as stated by you...but a relationship, where did that relationship started? Like you said..son to a father..we knew where that relationship started. Does your ancestors have a root to 'HIM"? If not...are they in hell? No offence. What, then is a religion?<br><br>From what I've read...your 'GOD' did destroyed Mankind once. Noah's Ark! Why, did Man made the same mistakes again? Those 'good' men, women, children and the rest of the animals (two of each species - different sex) that boarded Noah's Ark were supposed to be hand-picked by 'HIM', before 'HE' flooded the Earth with 40 days and 40 nights of rain. Tell me..what went wrong? Seems to me like "God Made, God Destroyed"<br><br>Jesus Christ, son of 'GOD'. He was send to Earth once to save mankind of all suffering. Well..he did died for mankind. 'Good Friday'...I know that day too. He was nailed on a 'cross' with two others. Now, I'm hearing the second coming of 'Christ'. But, why send him the second time to suffer? Is he expendable?<br><br>That will be it for now. You want to do some hard selling..you need to tolerate fussy 'customers'<br><br>[This message has been edited by Tommy (edited 19 May 2000).]</div>

I used to pass by there quite often. I tried the stall opposite Paramount Shopping Center..and I thought it was the best I tasted so far. Wouldn't mind to try yours for a change.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Christianity is a RELIGION.<br>With all these remarks about Christianity going on I cant resist to comment.<br>Frankly would anyone be able to understand how sweet an orange tastes unless he eats it? Therefore all the passions and the feelings that a Christian potrays is a reflection of what he receives out of his believe. Thus for one to really understand, I suggest, go right in and taste it... tongue first.<br>Without that you will never understand.<br><br>Ps: Who are we to judge anyone's believe and his religion? I suddenly feel as if we are no longer living in the same free society, with all that tolerence of each's religion thing anymore. Peace is just too fragile...<br><br></div>
