            <div class='col-md body'>Poopoomoon,<br>y u everytime quote wat u learn in the Bible in ur argument b/w Tommy? don't wan say whether wat Tommy is correct or not, but at least he's stating the facts. wat christians learn in the Bible, abt  "It started ever since the creation of the first man, adam &amp; eve.", "From the bible, it seems "King of the West" are alliance of countries, not the Anti-Christ himself." ...etc may not be true. for other things like God teach u to be kind, luv others... r obvious rite. christians have very strong faith in their religion, believe everything in the Bible, its ok, no harm if u all don't always mention these things to non-christians, as not relevant them. basically ppl with scientific set of mind or by logic, those supernatural things stated in Bible, noe are not true. As stated by Stephen Hawking in his bk "brief history of time": if God created Earth, who create God?</div>
