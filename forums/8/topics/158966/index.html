            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Bought the CD yesterday<br><br>well... i have to sheepishly admit that i never listened to "warriors of heaven and earth" soundtrack .<br>all this time. i always wondered the true nature of ARR a genius. but this album seems to elevate him far beyond that "genius" status as well... i dont know.. i m just speechless. For an Indian , to have been able to compose this kind of music that is so much intune with native chinese musical traditions... that really gives us an image of china and mongolia... is above brilliance, intelligence and genius... i dont know what to call him now...<br><br>an "elementary" reproduction of feelings that i had when listening to the album....<br><br>"blue light" - ethereal as the name suggests... same chorus towards the end as that of "horses"<br>"buddhas remains" -- it makes you feel a great awakening inside you.. fills you with a feeling like the soul being stirred... maybe fill with buddha's spirit!<br>"horses" - awesome chorus, i just kept on listening to it on a forever loop<br>"lai chi theme" gives a huge power surge deep inside..<br>"monk" - close ur eyes... and u would really see monks sitting atop rocky ledges and meditating in the thin mountain air.. reminds me of a  program about Monastries of Wudang Mountain....you will fully agree how well the song picturises monks meditating upon various truths of life.<br>"escape" -- makes you imagine people really running away, hiding from prying eyes, just managing things in the nick of time..  &amp; now..  one of these was the theme song? ..<br><br>i kinda  really appreciate that jolin tsai's song. considering the above, this pop song was the best .... and so was that "lords..." song.<br><br><strong>Add on  more about ARR</strong><br><br>I have listened to Yanni and recently ARR.Since both Yanni and Rahman are heavily into ambient, new age music.<br><br>There was something different about ARR....improves his instruments , sound effects , SYNTH usage, recording and sound engineering and ... instruments of AR Rahman ..he uses heavy sound effects...space age effects.s that of the digital age....His compositions are an intriguing cocktail of musical pieces that literally blow your mind. His music is unique in its offbeat instrumental interludes, unconventional harmonies, and use of distinct perfect voices and thumping rhythms<br><br>It (sound engineering) is certainly a science. ARR is a good technician behind it who determines the right variables for a particular effect. (I say this not becos I am a sound engineer, but I attended some recording sessions in my friends studio). If it were some science with fixed formulae, u and I can learn them and use it all the time,ARR's strength lies not only in his perfect sense of melody and rhythm but also in his immaculate sound engineering...Very intelligent, smart and creative...<br><br>For research purposes i bought his old CDs from Serangoon at discount prices<br><br>TAAL -<br>Rangeela -<br>Daud<br>Bombay Dreams<br>Vande Mataram<br>Warrir of heaven and earth<br><br>I think he is an all rounder, I mean his grounding is very very solid. He knows Indian classical music, he is in touch with Indian folk music, he knows about western music and he has really studied western classical also. He knows about Middle Eastern music. And electonic types of pop and techno So there is no wonder you see different colours in his songs.... His range of imagination is expansive.<br><br></div>

The last time ARR pulled off such a stunt was in 1997 with a little known experimental soundtrack called "daud", a fully synthesised music with lot of space age effects....But it was poorly received as it was deemd too advanced for its time...As ARR described it that it was purely experimental to test if his listeners were ready for the kind of music....U can catch parts of it music in vasantham central promo of Deepacali movies...The fast bangra type of music featured in the promo...<br><br>my review it is here :<br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=155752" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=155752</a></div>

ARR had brought synthesiser music to a new level previously unknown to me. In fact long tme back, I was in Serangoon when i heard some piece of techno music and was wondering who did it. Now i knew it was ARR.<br><br>He does music in "layers". Which means he does a basic draft and beat then systematically adds effects to enhance it. Then repeats the procedure: a tedious work which needs a lot of concentration and technolgical know how.I admit e's brilliant as I could not find any shortcomings in the recording timings. Everything seems smooth and perfect. The mark of a good sound technologist. It is a priviledge to listen to his technological concept and a boon to understand what he's trying to convey.<br><br>The part of ARR which grabs me is the intense creativity in his works. At times he does a Kenny G, another is a John Williams or a futuristic Matrix music</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I fact i chanced upoun Arr's music by accident  in 1992 at the time of my O'levels....Found a new casette lying on a hot weekday afternoon around and it had an interesting modern cover design and lettering.<br>Initially i was not expecting anything special but when i played it on my walkman, first  struck me as slow moving love songs ( for the info , this was before arr became a pop composer and  gone commercial)..Now it didn seem like any average tamil songs ... It was a new expereince, high tech, interesting sounds flowing flawlessly..the song stanzas and raaga structures used were utterly unique, in the sense it slowly grows on yr ear after some listenings..I was learning classical Indian music in '92 and my mentor ( well known teacher and many years experience)  commented on arr on that day<br><span style="font-style: italic;"> " Hmm.interesting i never came across this level of complexity, he has not totally deviated from traditional basics, he had brought it to a different level, so who is this person?"</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"I told him i did not know who this stranger is but he did something interesting with this stuff"</span>  ...<br>His reply was <span style="font-style: italic;">" whoever this person may be, he's in a deep emotional state and his music is coming straight from his heart"</span><br><br>then we went on to   discuss to see how the overall texture of the songs was enhanced by clever use of sound vs mood<br><br>The cassette seems like a lot of tech been used...a new concept in its heyday in the Indian music movie world....As expected, it took everyone by surprise that Indian  music had jumped light years forward to this new trend..Interestingly it was a huge leap everyone agrees...Then overnight, arr became a household name.a few months later, others  were released and at the same time i still havent noted that the music was indeed composed by Arr<br>one year passed, and then a half when the pop types were coming in   it was during this time i was probably  and more aware of this new breed of music  that i checked that casette<br>tapes for the credits.It wrote <span style="font-style: italic;">"AR Rahman"</span> and as i traced back to releases before, i realised that it was this composer all the while been responsible for<br>all the great melodies  . In fact arr real name was <span style="font-style: italic;">Dileep kumar</span> b4 he converted from hindu to islam....It was credited  as <span style="font-style: italic;">Dileep kumar </span>in his first release.....Below attached is the pic of arr's first release in its original version casette cover art<br><br><img src="http://www.indiaplaza.com/productimages/video/images/roja_thumb.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its easy for any person to use a statement that Arr is commercial or another. I feel that ppl would say that not many  could have afford to pull all the styles of the renowned western composers so u just cant make baseless statements. It is sad that Arreven after doing so lot our own ppl try to degrade him. Would no other great composer on this earth does not create a wide range of creative imaginative music which is "in your face" and easy to comprehend<br>Arr has great music and was somebody famous like Andrew Webber so great to appreciate those master pieces, what was wrong with Bombay Dreams which did not work in India, these  were for western audience was based more on western art music and we have to be finding or making more research to pass a comment that he is not good.<br>Think of a simple thing almost all other musicians in the field  in India are inspired by Arr, they are trying to repeat what Arr did a decade back works which were very leap years forward...</div>
