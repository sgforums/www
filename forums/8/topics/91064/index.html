            <div class='col-md body'>Today super du-lan, had to pour out in this forum if not the frustration get clogged inside my veins...dun know if anyone here has encounter such friends before...<br><br>Well i had a poly friend long time ago, during those days we not close to each other one, but only recently he had contacted me saying that would like to meet up for coffee...he said he does has a prospective job to recommend me...(i was thinking what the heck, im not jobless)...nevertheless i asked abt his job, but he just wun reveal anything over the phone, too secretive or perhaps this job is something shameless...<br><br>Met him just now, and wasted 1 hour of my time...feel like scolding him becoz what he wanted to sell to me was a Magnetic cushion...This bed is supposed to boost your blood circulation and stuff like that...and it costed $1600!!!<br><br>i was not totally angry abt the money, but it was the selling mentality that was wrong...First a long-time no contact friend showed super concern over your recent life, next so secretive (if he told me whats the cushion like over the phone, i wun be that angry)...lastly, i denied him saying that i had no money to buy, but he cashed out $1000/- from his wallet and LEND to me...What the heck is this type of selling tactics...<br><br>Sometimes i think such MLM scheme in SIngapore should be totally banned...If that product is really worth that amount of money, for god sake do some advertising in media to promote it...i didnt even heard of its brand and he wanted to sell me that thin cushion at that price...come on lah...<br><br>Agree that MLM are popular overseas, and when marketed the right track it can generate a good residual income, but then it also depend on the usefulness and worthiness of that product...NUSKIN and Amway are very sucessful brands...<br><br>Anyone had similar frustating exp to explode out?</div>
