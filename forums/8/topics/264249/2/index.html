It is the yearning for Love that translate into their action of 'obsessed with "hooking up" guy'.<br><br>Sometime when you watch the news, they broadcast videos of puppie and kitten together. We, animals need love, and subconsciously wanted to experience the 'being love' state.<br><br>When I am young, I used to have this perception that Love is not as important as my studies. No! Love is definitely important! I have wasted more than 5 years pursuing reputation, power and respect. It's now then I realized that Love on the other hand is as important. My youth is wasted on these intangible assets, but nothing compares to missing countless chances of getting into a relationship.<br><br>Since you are in JC now, maybe you should turn on your sonar and look for your Mr. Right. Don't follow my footstep. Youth should be active, fun and dynamic. Getting Love when you're youth may be an experience which will only have one chance. There is no turning back the time when you feel regret next time when you're old.<br><br>Na! These are my 2 cent worth.
