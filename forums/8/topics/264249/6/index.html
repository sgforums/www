Sometimes we instead pity those who have gf/bf cos they have less freedom to go out as they wish.<br><br>Those who are in a rush to get attached do not know the true meaning of relationship. They are seeking more of a puppy love or lust or just wanting to try something new, not the real deal.<br><br>At the end of your jc life, perhaps you will look back at the friends you made, not only whether you were attached or not. If you were, then good for you, it's an added bonus. Not attached? I think it is no disadvantage. You are still young.  Most relationships (not all) do not pass the NS litmus test anyway.<br><br>Lol seems like the jc bunch here is quite huge. Same batch with greenblackwhite in rj. I have some friends who are attached and a lot who are not. What's the rush?<br><br>I believe when peer pressure starts getting into the equation, it becomes more of a fad rather than something that you hold dear to yourself.<br><br>Enjoy your jc life.
