And that is why in Hong Kong and New Zealand, the governments have already instituted a window for these parallel imports to come in."<br><br>In other countries, the sale of video discs is only allowed after the movie premiers in cinemas.<br><br>But parallel imports here bypass this window period, by bringing in video copies from regions that have earlier release dates.<br><br>Kenneth Tan, Managing Director of Golden Village, said: "Some people will be swayed to switch, and in time to come as attendance drop, as revenue and returns drop, <strong>the cinemas will not be able to afford to acquire these films anymore.</strong><br><br>"So in the medium-term and long-term, consumer choice is actually diminished."<br><br>Licensed video distributors will also not be spared, as parallel imports can be cheaper by as much as half.<br><br>Tan Poh Lam, CEO of Alliance Entertainment Asia, said: "Licensed distributors find it hard to survive, then they have to cut back on in many ways. That includes not being able to release some titles, which may not be commercially viable."<br><br>The industry is now appealing to the MDA to institute a window period of nine months before parallel imports are allowed in.<br><br>Industry players hope that there is a greater awareness among movie-goers that their decision to catch a movie at the theatre, or to buy licensed copies of the movies, as opposed to spending money on parallel imports, it is going to directly affect the survival of the industry. - CNA/de</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A 9 month blanket move is ludicrious to sales. Such a move will be deemed obvious unfair competition to the parallel importers. This is a classic case where the film industry has gone too far in thinking they can play god simply because they are not raking in enough sales from ticketing prices.<br><br>First they raise the price of tickets. Then they cry foul over the sale of imported DVDs. Do i see a loser-syndrome here? This is free competition. No one can have it both ways. Just because your marketing strategy is failing doesn't give you the right to lobby for legislation.<br><br>In the first place, why are shows like SIN CITY and IDENTITY being screened here so late (4 month gap)? Is there a problem getting past sensorship board? Are the bureaucrats making life too difficult to film producers in negotiating a fee for local screening? The DVD for some are already available on Amazon.com as a result. Are you now denying the right for consumers to choose so you can run your monopoly?<br><br>Delays such as the screening of SIN CITY 3-4 months after the official release in USA are a fault of the system's, not the competition. If the film industry in Singapore cannot work out a tidy arrangement, then perhaps the whole management needs a radical shake-up becoz the losers here are the patrons.<br><br>The fact that our sensorship board acts like they think they know what's best for locals is another issue here. By snipping critical scenes, you deny the right for movie goers to get their money's worth. Then you release an originally rated R(A) show as PG13 to get as much catchment from the viewership as possible. The obvious outcome is that disgusted patrons will turn to un-cut DVDs as a viable alternative. This in turn reduces the cinema catchment and ticket sales.<br><br>Some action should be done yes. But they should be directed to the inadequacies of the sensorship board and MDA and the inefficiencies in handling the screening of new movies. Applying the same option as NZ and HK are poor excuses for not offering viable solutions that maintain free competition.<br><br>The only result i can see from such a ban will be an even worse drop in viewership and a phenomenonal rise in DVD piracy. Back to square one?</div>
