              <p>Then in that case, go get some reinforcements in the form of a couple of male siblings/cousins/friends to accompany you.</p>
              <p>You come online also, you can't really learn anything. For goodness' sake, go and talk to a few of them; they can't do anything when you have reinforcements with you.</p>
              <p>In fact, just looking at the kinds of shops that are there and talking to the shopkeepers will already get you a lot of useful information.</p>
