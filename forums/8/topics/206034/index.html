            <div class='col-md body'><br>Hi all,<br><br>I'm new here so pls forgive me for my poor Eng and if i post this topic in the wrong forum.<br><br>I'm 25 and happened to know my colleague who is 21 when I join my new company 1+ mth ago this year. She is the 2nd girl that give me the feeling of "Yi Jian Zhong Qin" when I saw her on my first day of work. (the 1st girl was my ex-gf, break for almost 4 yrs)<br><br>In order to seek opportunities to get close to her, I will always alight the same place with her after work, making excuse to buy dinner or having dinner with her. And because of this, I got to know her that she is still single currently.<br><br>So dear all can tell me whether she can sense my "Signal" after these 2 events already occured...<br><br>Event 1:<br>On her birthday, I gave her a present (small crystal chain for hanging handphone) and told her a stupid reason that I got the crystal chain for free and asked her whether she want it or not. (Cause I afraid she might reject my gift) She smile and accepted my present and asked me : "You buy one is it? don't bluf me la..." That time I was so paiseh and quickly think of something to reply her : "Shiiiii... don't tell anyone want about this ok?". Then we both laugh.<br><br>Event 2:<br>Successfully got to ask her out on one wkend on my 1st try to go orchard. (Cause she won some vouchers during my Company's dinner. So I made an excuse that I want to go orchard to buy something and ask her whether she is interested to join me so that she can also see what to buy with the vouchers.) We do window shopping togather, chit chatting along the way, then had dinner. I want to treat her the dinner but she reject, even the drinks too. We shop around 10+ and we took MRT togather. Knowing that she will be alighting different station from me, I bluf her (I really don't want to, but this is a rare chance to be with her) that I later still meeting my "friend' for midnight movie and will alight same MRT with her cause I still have plenty of time to spent before I meeting my "friend". We got into the SBS bus and alight on the bus stop near her house. Just as we going to seperate at the bus stop, she said she will accompany me until the time when i meeting my "friend". Wow, so happy man, and we went to a coffee shop for drinks. This time round I brought mineral water for her, she insist to pay me back but I rejected. We sit there for around 1 hour chatting and when time almost there, I told her my "friend" last min msg me that the appointment cancelled. With this, I made an excuse to see her home (time around 12+ and the way to her home quite dark) before I going back.<br><br>About her:<br><br>Her character is like the S.H.E Ella (a bit boyish) but her apperance is very feminine. What I know some girls are very easy going, Going out alone with a guy doesn't mean that she is interested on the guy, she is just treating the guy as a normal friend only (This is what I worried about). And the way she talk to me is quite normal, like the same she talks to everyone else. Cause what I know if girls talking to a guy who she is interested with, her attitude will be a bit different. (Shy, talk softly, etc...)<br><br>One more thing is that she is planing to go for overseas studies (got a feeling that this is the reason why she is now still single and not having of bf/gf relationship). If we really being togather, I afraid that we might break off because of this...<br><br>Ok now, can she sense that I interested on her? Creating opportunities to get close to her or is it my acting too good that she really didn't realise it?<br><br>Also can advice me on the below options? Whether I shall<br><br>a) Confess to her when the time is ripe. (Planing on Christmas providing that time she is still unattach)<br>b) Confess to her immediately.<br>c) Remain as friend.<br><br>Thanks for all who spent their time reading this post, and any advice reply will be appreciated.<br><br>Thanks &amp; regards.<br></div>
