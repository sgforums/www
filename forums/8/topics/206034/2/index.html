She is the 2nd girl that give me the feeling of "Yi Jian Zhong Qin" when I saw her on my first day of work. (the 1st girl was my ex-gf, break for almost 4 yrs)<br><br>In order to seek opportunities to get close to her, I will always alight the same place with her after work, making excuse to buy dinner or having dinner with her. And because of this, I got to know her that she is still single currently.<br><br>So dear all can tell me whether she can sense my "Signal" after these 2 events already occured...<br><br>Event 1:<br>On her birthday, I gave her a present (small crystal chain for hanging handphone) and told her a stupid reason that I got the crystal chain for free and asked her whether she want it or not. (Cause I afraid she might reject my gift) She smile and accepted my present and asked me : "You buy one is it? don't bluf me la..." That time I was so paiseh and quickly think of something to reply her : "Shiiiii... don't tell anyone want about this ok?". Then we both laugh.<br><br>Event 2:<br>Successfully got to ask her out on one wkend on my 1st try to go orchard. (Cause she won some vouchers during my Company's dinner. So I made an excuse that I want to go orchard to buy something and ask her whether she is interested to join me so that she can also see what to buy with the vouchers.) We do window shopping togather, chit chatting along the way, then had dinner. I want to treat her the dinner but she reject, even the drinks too. We shop around 10+ and we took MRT togather. Knowing that she will be alighting different station from me, I bluf her (I really don't want to, but this is a rare chance to be with her) that I later still meeting my "friend' for midnight movie and will alight same MRT with her cause I still have plenty of time to spent before I meeting my "friend". We got into the SBS bus and alight on the bus stop near her house. Just as we going to seperate at the bus stop, she said she will accompany me until the time when i meeting my "friend". Wow, so happy man, and we went to a coffee shop for drinks. This time round I brought mineral water for her, she insist to pay me back but I rejected. We sit there for around 1 hour chatting and when time almost there, I told her my "friend" last min msg me that the appointment cancelled. With this, I made an excuse to see her home (time around 12+ and the way to her home quite dark) before I going back.<br><br>About her:<br><br>Her character is like the S.H.E Ella (a bit boyish) but her apperance is very feminine. What I know some girls are very easy going, Going out alone with a guy doesn't mean that she is interested on the guy, she is just treating the guy as a normal friend only (This is what I worried about). And the way she talk to me is quite normal, like the same she talks to everyone else. Cause what I know if girls talking to a guy who she is interested with, her attitude will be a bit different. (Shy, talk softly, etc...)<br><br>One more thing is that she is planing to go for overseas studies (got a feeling that this is the reason why she is now still single and not having of bf/gf relationship). If we really being togather, I afraid that we might break off because of this...<br><br>Ok now, can she sense that I interested on her? Creating opportunities to get close to her or is it my acting too good that she really didn't realise it?<br><br>Also can advice me on the below options? Whether I shall<br><br>a) Confess to her when the time is ripe. (Planing on Christmas providing that time she is still unattach)<br>b) Confess to her immediately.<br>c) Remain as friend.<br><br>Thanks for all who spent their time reading this post, and any advice reply will be appreciated.<br><br>Thanks &amp; regards.<br></div></blockquote>If I were you, I'd remain as friends.  Dating a co-worker is a big no-no.<br><br>Or, you could confess to her that you like her, see how she responds, and then remain as friends.<br><br></div>

So everything is well planned decide to tell her while sending her home. In the end got tongue tied and I told myself... "Heck all the stupid rehersals and just grab her hand and point to the sky and said:"Wah tonight the stars very bright ah...." she just kept quiet and smile....

Sms good night is ok, but suggest only at times when you are the last to see her, or see her home.<br><br>Also, I don't know about setting Christmas as a deadline. Affairs of the heart have no deadline. You should know when the time comes.<br><br>I, like you, planned to tell my wife then that I like her only 2 years later (when I graduate, and I know I have the ability to care for her). In the end, when she heard I will tell her something impt 2 years later, she told me that some things must act now and not later, else you will lose the chance. And so, there I was, professing my love for her... at a BUS STOP. So much for a romantic setting.<br><br>So I think, just continue to be with her. If she goes out with you regularly 1-1, then I think you stand a high chance. However, if she is the type that goes out with many guys 1-1, then maybe that doesn't tell much.<br><br>One other gauge is when she starts accepting treats from you, that may be a sign that she is feeling closer to you.<br><br>Sometimes, maybe you can say some things in jest, like, "you always make me feel happy when I am around you", "I enjoy talking to you", etc. Compliment her dress when she comes out with you (if the dress is really nice), coz it shows you are very attentive to her.<br><br>But DON'T, DON'T pester. Don't every minute sms her, nothing to do, sms nothing to do, send emails. Coz you have your own life (gals like guys who have things in their life, and not one whose life revolves ard her (and at such an early stage))<br><br>good luck</div>

How to break the ice? How to ask her to be my gf??? So i planned to ask her on her birthday as i was celebrating with her since she say her family don have that practise. I even rehersal infront of the mirror like how to tell her my feelings. So everything is well planned decide to tell her while sending her home. In the end got tongue tied and I told myself... "Heck all the stupid rehersals and just grab her hand and point to the sky and said:"Wah tonight the stars very bright ah...." she just kept quiet and smile.... So now I'm happily married with 2 naughty kids... So the story is if u keep quiet u will never noe the ending. IIf u try, be it a success or failure, at least u can tell yourself, "I DID IT" without living with regret..... </div></blockquote>R u a CHEF</div>
