              <p>I was thinking about what topic to post here, then I think about country. </p>
              <p>What's your first impression of Taiwan and why? If you been to Taiwan before, what marked your trip memorable? If you never visited Taiwan, do you want to visit and why?</p>
              <p>so let me start with the impression of Singapore......</p>
              <p>My first impression of Singapore was when I was in primary school (like a LONG LONG LONG TIME AGO), my teacher told me that no chewing gums are allowed in Singapore and it is very clean in Singapore. When I visited SG last year, it was indeed the same as I expected, for years...--clean. Except I never learned that durian is common in SG.. and the only fruit that i don't eat is durian.  What made me remember of Singapore are Sentosa island, Clarke Quey, and Marina Bay Sands. Although i never had a chance to visit many other places such as Universal Studio, Botanic Garden, or other historical sites; I will visit SG again and make trips to the places that I never had a chance to visit. </p>
              <p>How about you? </p>

              <p>Since you shared your impression, now it's my turn!</p>
              <p>I have never been to taiwan before, and I heard many stuffs about taiwan. My friends who have been to taiwan says the food there is great! My impression of taiwan is like a place similar to singapore.. Girls from taiwan have great skin complexion and I think it's because of the fruits over there :-D</p>
              <p>You know, usually those television programmes like to feature taiwan food streets and always have the fried oyster and other road side food. It gives me the impression that taiwan people love food~! &lt;3 I am not too sure about the economy there... but based on the TV hosts, they comment that food there is cheap and good =D I am foodie if I have the opportunity to visit taiwan, I would like to try out the food!!!</p>
              <p>I heard that there is a fruit farm in taiwan, quite famous... and it's usually open to tourist. :-D I've never been to a fruit farm before, and wish I could go there some day. You know, it's kinda like a fruity heaven to me~</p>
              <p>I am not very sure why. but most of the popular asia singers are from taiwan o.O"""" Do taiwan people practice their singing everyday? I hope to find out what sorts of environment do they help nurture singing talents.... =D</p>

              <p>Taiwan = A way bigger Singapore.</p>
              <p>Similiar minus the Singlish.</p>
              <p>U got ur SPG's of taiwan also. Quite a lot of them. Dont know what u call them in Taiwan. lol</p>
              <p>Dirtier. More polution in å�°åŒ— unless you stay in ç”²æ¡‚æž—ç¤¾åŒº there or perhaps å�°å�—ã€‚</p>
              <p>More exotic foods due to Jap influence.</p>
              <p>Sg is definately safer, u can walk around drunk off yours nuts and dont worry about being robbed.</p>
              <p>While you can literally pick up drunk girls outside of the clubs in Taiwan.</p>
              <p>MRT's , similiar. Just way more people. Like I said its bigger.</p>
              <p>If you are comparing girls and guys, there is not much difference. But the people in Taiwan are generally more friendly I suppose. But they also have more gangsterism there.</p>
              <p>Hard to say la. Taiwan cheaper.  But honestly, å�„æœ‰å�ƒç§‹.</p>
              <p>Will I visit and stay there ? Yup. Long term ? No. Same as Sg. Both countries are "small"</p>
              <p>More comparisons to add but enough of the comparisons. lol</p>

              <p>the best in taiwan is that you dun get to see so much bangalas, indians, PRC and other nationals, singapore is like a rojak now a day, in taiwan, as in korea and jap, we are more homogenous, we know that what we do to help this country is mainly for ourselves and our decendents, not for others, you may said we are abit selfish, but that is how living thing evolve. As a taiwanese, I feel the sense of belonging, in Singapore, I am not so sure. Furthermore, in term of public relationship, we taiwanese are more sociable and understanding, singaporeans are abit stuck up, tho some are still good. And that is why forumers here feel that why a gal like me can come here and talk like an adult and dare to challenge the guy openly, cos we are cultured to be sociable.</p>
              <p>Of course taiwan foods are nicer and places are more beautiful, but we got tyhoon and big storm to take care of, and yet we are able to whether the storm, so if you are going to taiwan, take a look at their houses, built to withstand all these strong winds, and hopefully, you dun go on a stormy season.</p>

              <p>Thread replier is also from Taiwan like thread starter?</p>
              <p>I perceive Taiwan and Singapore as the have and have nots.</p>
              <p>Taiwan has all the internet chat rooms with webcams, they do big charitable institutions like Tzuchi and also, they do bubble tea and chicken chop. They basically, "feel" as a modern race.</p>
              <p>Singapore has all the rules and regulations that restricts internet chatting and bars webcams, the government is the biggest godfather and the greatest good, and we buy bubble tea and chicken chop ideas from Taiwan. We basically, "learn" as a modern race. No, not "learn".. i think.. the right word is "touch"... no. We "Ping".</p>
              <p>When we no more idea, we ping the others for ideas. then we submit to government, once approved, we establish, then every year pay tax punctually.</p>

              strokes...so u should show him that u r not one of them..</p>
              <p>if u want to put your guy at ease....be sure to dress in line
              with him....follow but with your own styles ....this makes him
              comfortable....very light &amp; natural make up...crystal nails
              should be avoided....clean, classy-casual and neat is best to
              establish good first impression from where you come from....</p>
              <p>i do not know the type u r after....but there are some guys that
              are equally brand conscious ....and in hokkien we call them "Ah Sia
              kid"...if u like this type...then its another story again</p>
