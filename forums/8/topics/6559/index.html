            <div class='col-md body'>ok, some of us here, are born christians. what do you think about that? personally, i think they should be given a chance to chose when they are older, and not be "forced" into christianity once they are born. it's like, sure, as christians, we want our love ones to be save, but i still think they should have a choice......it's like committing them to something, when they can't even decide for themselves....extra burden i think..........so, what do you think? please give your comments.</div>

He says tat many people KNOWS tat Christianity is the one TRUE relationship with GOD, but its cos of them fearing conviction frm the Holy Spirit when they accept Christ.

            <div class='col-md body'>i don't really have comments about being born christian, but...if a person is borned a christian, I'm sure they would have gone for church or Sunday school every week. So when they grow up, if pple were to tell them that God does not exist, doubt they will believe since they have been told that God exist for sooo many years. They will most likely continue to be a christian, and will not like become non-christian.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Siaobell (edited 14 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>xiaobell:<br><br>not being a christian is not the same as not believing in god.  one can always want to convert.  as for lifetime exposure to christian teachings, i disagree with you that it means the person will be more stronger in his faith.  Have you ever heard of a person who's been atheis almost all of his life and then a personal experience converts him to believe God?  Hasn't his lifetime exposure to atheism / non christianity guaranteed his faith in a godless existence?<br><br>And then, a baptized child does not necessarily go to church every week.  I've been in catholic schools all my life and a significant number of catholic classmates do not frequent church, except for easter and christmas.<br><br>rulakir:  catechism is the religious lessons one has to attend before being baptized.  These lessons will prepare one to be able to fully appreciate the meaning of the rituals done in the church and also to teach one the way to receive the bread, what are christian obligations, etc.<br><br>[This message has been edited by MayaJade (edited 14 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry, but I think strictly speaking there's no such thing as being born a Christian. However, you can be born to a Christian family, it's not the same thing.<br><br>Becoming a Christian is a personal decision. It's also an active action on your behalf. When you make the decision of becoming a Christian, it would mean that you have submitted your life into His hands and allow Him to actively change you.<br><br>So I guess if you are born into a Christian family, it's really up to you to decide whether you are indeed a child of God. It's really a deep, rich and personal relationship. And if your are, God bless you!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>T|red,<br>That's why I said, you cannot be a Christian at birth. Infant baptism is an issue which has been debated since don't know when. An infant is not in the state to choose what he wants. True that parents wants to best for them, but taking up a faith has to be something of personal decision. Ultimately, you have to tell yourself and God that you want Him to be your Lord and Saviour  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">.<br><br>Atrieu,<br>I'm not putting you down as a Christian, I believe you have made the decision to follow Christ. It doesn't have to be what your parents decided for you when you were baptised then. It's doesn't have to be "I was baptised, that's why I am" kind of thing. It is a "I believe and I accept" kind of thing  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">.</div>
