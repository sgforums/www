            <div class='col-md body'>not sure if i told some of u any of the incidents before or not. anyway some are just stupid, just say say only. honestly some of them it;s hard to get the joke because u have to be there to get it...<br>anyway<br><br>once friday, the lecturers from the chem process dept invited us to go to the sch's pub for beer since it is a culture to drink on a friday night, esp in the summer. so we went and some of us sat indoors because the chairs were dirty and this lecturer asked my class rep( they were outdoors)<br><br>"so, u guys are from singapore?"<br><br>"yes"<br><br>"so which part of singapore do u come from?"<br><br>" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> ..err ( actually i come from bedok)"<br><br>then another lecturer beside the first lecturer tat singapore is a city state. and so he went<br>" oh i see"<br><br>my friend also said" i come frm bedok" but he was beaten to it by the 2nd lecturer. when he told us later, we couldnt stop laughing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>then during the second week, we were attached to the genetics department and the lecturer told us that 1 of the prac we are going to do is also called the 'wow' factor.  and so we thought it would be something really exciting.<br>only when we read the prac book then we realised it was a prac that we did earlier on. so we decided to gang up and when the prac was completed, we placed the agar plates under UV light and the bacterial colonies glowed and we "wow" especially loudly, sort of make her happy only.<br>.oh god...<br><br>for a week we were attached to this biochemistry department and there was this pretty undergrad student helping things out. then there was this tv commercial where a woman was walking in her undies and a couple on tv said " nice bra.....great tits"<br>when my class rep told us when he first saw her, he liked her blue eyes.<br>another girl then said " zhun bo, must have been looking at her chests"<br>so i just said " he must have been thinking, nice eyes....great tits" and we burst into laughter.<br><br>when we eat dinner, most of the time we eat or buy in a grp of 7 guys and girls. then almost everytime we wanted to buy meat from the supermarket we are in a dilemma (sp?) because there is a girl who cant eat beef because of her religion and another 2 girls are sharing rooms and the pots that came with the room with a malay girl.<br>so we either have to choose between beef or pork, then once the 'cook' held a tray of beef and pork and said " girl 1 or girl 2?" and acted like he was in such a headache over who to "pacify", in the end he chose pork<br><br>another incident happened in the room of the 2 chinese girls and the malay girl. almost everything the 2 girls bought, be it apples, drinks, chips, the malay girl would take w/o asking and finish it up very quickly and the malay girl has a bad temper to boot.<br>then the 2 girls claim that the malay girl would wake up early to use the toilet and stay there for a loooong time, often causing the 2 girls to be late in the morning...<br><br>once the 2 girls said they frequently found urine on the seat and guessed that she always squatted instead of sitting and didnt bother to clear it up. they even found blood once.oops....<br></div>
