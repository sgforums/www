            <div class='col-md body'>[quote]Originally posted by Meat Pao:<br>[b]Hi,<br><br>No it is wrong.....Indonesia's Christians are mostly not Malays.<br><br>They are actually from other ethnic groups.....Batak....Minahasa....several others.<br><br>A lot of confusion on this term 'Malay'.<br><br>In Indonesia, there are ethnic Malays, but they are mostly on parts of Sumatra, and they are only 1 ethnic group among the dozens or hundreds of different ethnic groups in Indonesia.<br><br>Indigenous people in Indonesia are very diverse. Malays are in relatively small numbers and only in some regions of Sumatra. The majority of them are Muslims. Other indigenous ethnic groups who are majority Christians, or have significant Christian population, are of different groups altogether.<br><br>This term 'Malay' is name of an ethnic group only, it should not be used as a broad 'race' or 'sub-race' for the whole indigenous people in South-East Asia. For instance, you cannot call the indigenous Filipino Catholics as 'Malays', although in the southern part of Phillipines there is indeed a Malay ethnic group who are Muslims, but the northern part of Phillipines are not ethnic Malays.<br><br>This 'Malay' term is only referring to ethnicity, dont keep getting it wrong.<br><br>I see this again and again.<br><br>From an anthropological point of view the Malay Race is even much bigger than what you thought. Even the Dayaks,Dusun.....orang asli of Malayisa should be included but only because they are predominantly animists,Christians or others that the Malaysian Government does not recognize these people as Malays.The Malay Race were the first settlers in South East Asia although we dont really know where these people really originated ffrom.The orang Melayu is bangsa Melayu and no different from the other Malays.If you ask someone from Sulawesi about his race he might say that he is a Bugis and bangsa Melayu (ethnic Malay).The Term Melayu in Indonesia is more associated with the Malay Dialect Most people in Indonesia would claim to be a Malay..even for a Javanese not sure about the Balinese though because of their Indian/Hindu Ancestry.<br><br></div>
