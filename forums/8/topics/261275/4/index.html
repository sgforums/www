            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmmm, well, sorry, yesterday my internet got problem. been having net problems.<br><br>I'm a new convert. I converted in April. The story behind my conversion is that there is on dark period in my life during that month of April.<br><br>I argue with my mum alot until she said she don't care where I go anymore and stuff. At the same time, I caught my ex kissing another guy when I went to surprise her. I was really really down at that point of time and even contemplate suicide.<br><br>So, as a last resort, I tried to ask my friends for help. I don't know what happen then but it seems I'm attracted to only 2 of my friends name both of whom are Christian.<br><br>After telling my problems to them, I felt much better and they told me to just persevere. That Saturday on the same week, one of the 2 invited me to her church and since I got nothing better to do, I went. She had previously invited me 3 other times but I declined because I got things on.<br><br>After that first visit to her church, I never looked back ever since. I never failed to go to church for 3 weeks. I then challenged God and Jesus to show me a miracle to which He really did show me something and I converted one week before my 20th birthday.<br><br>Been a Christian ever since and I'm proud of it.<br><br>I realize that there will be some backlash from my family members but I also hope that they understand my decision. Jesus help me improve my relationsip with my mother and also He turn me into a less angry young man.<br><br>I used to just be angry at everyone or the slightest things will just irritate me but my friend intro me an online Sermon where I learnt this:<br><br>Be angry yet do not sin; Do not let the sun go down with your anger.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok firstly I want to decleare and clearify that I am in no way against any other religion. Or in this case muslim. And my speech are in no way towards them.<br><br>Read the following website stories. You'll feel the courage. There are numerous case of many brave people who against all odds in a background from a totally muslim country decided to convert. I guess it takes quite a number of conviction to do so. I'm a Christian and not here pulling all other muslim into Christianity. But I believe they should be given a choice too choose. Freedom to decide.<br><br>Aren't Indonesians and Malaysians buddhist long before? Only then Muslim came and converted them? So just keep a open mind <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I did heard of a Muslim was once wanted to convert who although the parents did something rather forcible to convert him back and was quite tramatic for the person who bring him to church. Even I had iranis came to our church before. If you decided to convert then I'm sure God and many will be there behind you. The option is yours.<br><br><a href="http://www.answering-islam.de/Main/Testimonies/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.answering-islam.de/Main/Testimonies/index.html</a><br><br><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6703155.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6703155.stm</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As far as I know... alot of Chinese too whoa re from very traditional families had very great opposition when converted. The parents even resolved to lock them up during sundays... God will intervene when the time is right.<br><br>In fact I'm rather proud of you people who does this. Also people who are in the underground churches in China during communist. They are brave. I had little opposition when I was born again.
