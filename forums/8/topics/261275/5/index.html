            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>In practical terms, it is wrong and silly, for instance to refer to a native man on a Jakarta street as a 'Malay', because for all likelihood, he is actually a 'Javanese' and not a 'Malay'.<br><br>Simple right?<br><br>In practical sense, 'Javanese' and 'Malay' have the same position.<br><br>'Javanese' is not under 'Malay'.<br><br>Basically they are a separate ethnic group, thats why there is a name called Javanese. And so on so forth with the other ethnic groups.<br><br>Sorry Mr Meat pao (not charsiew I hope) I find it all too contradicting<br><br>My Malay grandmother is from Southern Thailand.In her Singapore IC it states that her race is Thai but it should be Malay.If I am not mistaken, for some of us if we look at our Singapore Birth Certificate under race it wil say something like ie.Cantonese,Hokkien,Hainanese,Hakka.....etc but all that is gone by the 70s after all we are Chinese by race.Same with the Singaporean Malays on paper they were known as Javanese ,Bugis,Batak but today your friends and neighbors are all classified as Malays.<br>This is not off topic as we are trying to find out why the Malays in our region of Sumatra,Riau,Singapore and Malaysia feel that they are more Malay than the others and also to find out why these people would feel less a Malay the moment they changed religion.<br><br></div>

But i hope we could learn from one another instead shooting arrows. First and foremost, to each his own and we should show respect to all religions.<br><br>To TS: I am a malay muslim guy. i am an open minded guy and i believe in free will and studying other religions is one of my interest. When i was in poly, during my holidays i did have a good discussion dialog with my christian classmate in the library. We spend the whole day sharing both our sides of the story. we dont argue, we listen. Glad to know that you are at peace with your faith and that is what that matters. I am no expert in religion myself, for i know that there are many knowledge that i have yet to learn but i i do hope to have a chat with you to get to know your side of the story.<br><br>To mhcampboy: I agree with you and only God can give guidance to whom and who that HE wishes. Muhammad was sent as a messenger and to revealed to all the people of the worlds in  the existance of Oneness in God. Muhammad is not the only messengers in Islam. Many messengers had passed before him and all the above names that you mention: Jesus. Moses, Abraham and Jacob, they are messengers of God mention in the Quran and we respect each and everyone of them.<br><br>To all: Hope that this thread could continue to flurish in good terms and no ill feeling towards anybody.</div>
