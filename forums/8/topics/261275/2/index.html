            <div class='col-md body'>my personal take is that the culture of Singapore is very much aligned to malay= muslim kinda mentality and social culture.<br><br>I'm supposing that this is due to our historical and geographical connections to nearby muslim nations, and muslim dominated states. As such, culturely many malays adopt Islam as their birth religion.<br><br>To be a Malay and not a Muslim must be quite tough. society is still not very open to such a concept. But, in my opinion, this societal perspective could change, given time.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am a Malay Muslim myself and yes, I understand why my fellow Malays who have converted to Christianity or were born Christians would tend not to be open about it. Especially for converts, where they might face ostracism from even their own family members.<br><br>Frankly speaking, it has to be said that being Muslim is part of the Malay cultural identity. The festivals we celebrate, the customs we practice ; many have a religious background to it. You can't really celebrate Aidilfitri if you are not Muslim, can you?<br><br>I, for one, disapprove of such ostracism nonetheless.<br><br>Personally, I believe that religion is about having the free will to choose the right paths in life. I believe in freedom of worship and it irks me that one might be discriminated for his choice of religion.<br><br>My father was a Catholic before he converted to Islam and I would hate the thought of him being outcast from his own family for changing his religion.</div>

That is wrong, because in India, there are many different ethnic groups, and Tamils in India dont wear the Turban, it is actually the Sikh ethnic group, a completely different ethnic group in India. Tamil is an ethnic group, and Sikh is an ethnic group. They are both in India.<br><br>Same with this term 'Malay'. Many people are abit confused and just use this term wrongly.

He whom many called God is good in blessing HIs evil children to prosper.  So many evil christians are doing so well, prospering and some good sincere christians are suffering under these evil christians.  He chooses who he wants to bless, so christians must be evil in order to receive blessings from God!  Ha ha ha!!  God god god, got or not!!! ha ha ha!!! What a good laugh!!!<br><br>Always say leave it to God who will judge on judgement day, but christians never realise and admit that there are many things/events that cannot wait until the judgement day.   Be pragmatic lah!!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

It is a broad term. We can say Tibetans are Chinese, Yunnan tribe people are Chinese. But 'Malay' is not a broad general term. The position is smaller and more specific, just like Yunnan tribal people or Tibetans in the example above.<br><br>Just like in India, there are Tamils, Sikhs, and dozens more ethnic groups. We can call them all as Indians as a broad general term. But if someone use Tamil in that sense of broad general term, then it is wrong and silly, because Tamil is only 1 ethnic group in India, and they are not even the majority.<br><br>In Indonesia, the biggest indigenous ethnic group is Javanese. They are not Malays. The Malays are not the majority, in fact they are a small minority.<br><br>If you go to Jakarta and pluck a native-looking man from the street and ask him what his ethnicity is, his answer will be either 1. Javanese, or 2. Sundanese, and a small chance of other ethnic groups.<br><br>Malays in Indonesia are mainly in some regions of Sumatra and parts of Kalimantan.<br><br>So......that is the confusion about the use of this term 'Malays'. If people want to refer to native peoples in Indonesia in the broad general sense, just say 'Indonesians' or 'Native Indonesians' or something like that, but not 'Malays'.<br><br>Meat Pao.</div>
