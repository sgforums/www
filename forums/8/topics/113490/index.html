            <div class='col-md body'>I think it was 12 yrs ago, there was a young man, he was then sixteen or seventeen years old and worked in a company that organised events and seminars. He liked his job and was very excited about it.<br><br>One year before the incident happened, he got to know a girl called Mimi (not her real name) who just graduated from polytechnic and help out in his company. This young man doesnÂ’t really know Mimi but she treated everybody very nice. She was soft-spoken, very caring and attentiveÂ… all the characteristic a man wants for as a wife. As times passed they became friends and get along well.<br><br>One day this young man had to be at an event. He and his team were getting the event ready and had not eat since early morning. He gave his best to the job to make sure everything run smoothly. Evening came and he met Mimi at the event. Mimi saw how the team was tired and had not eaten and offered to buy food for them before taking down their order.<br><br>Mimi asked the young man for his order but the young man donÂ’t want to eat anything until the event ended. Mimi insisted that he should eat something and take the initiative to buy for him. After half an hour, Mimi came back with the food and distributed it.<br><br>She passed a packet of fried rice to the young man. However, the young man did not appreciate it and rejected the fried rice. Mimi being a kindhearted soul, persuaded him to eat. After some conversations, the talk heated up and he scolded Mimi, until she cried, for pestering him to eat. Everybody near by took notice of the amplified talk and saw the caring Mimi cried.<br><br>The young man was angry but embarrassed and took the fried rice from Mimi. He quickly opened up and ate the fried rice to pacify her. Mimi saw that and stop crying.<br><br>The event ended and the young man went home to rest for the day. He took a long bath and thought about Mimi. Then he lied on the bed and pondered again. He could not sleep. He was disturbed. Tossing here and there, he felt guilty. He know that he had to apologise to Mimi.<br><br>The next day, he quickly went to the office and look for Mimi but could not find her. His guiltiness made him feel very uncomfortable and could not work. He waited and waited and realized that she did not came to work that day. The young man was down and feeling very remorse. Finally, he prompt around for her absence.<br><br>Â“Mimi, with her family, was on a holiday to Malaysia to visit her relatives.Â” her best friend said. Â“She will be back next week.Â” The young man was very disheartened. He said to himself Â“never mind, she will be back soon, afterall, it was just a couple of days.Â” But that night, he couldnÂ’t sleep again. He was very bothered by his guiltiness.<br><br>Next day, he went back to work, feeling bad and emotionally weary. The feeling is like a heavy big stone resting on his chest, breathlessly breathing.  He comforted himself saying Â“sheÂ’ll be back soon.Â” It was one oÂ’clock, time for lunch.<br><br>He was about to go for lunch when the office secretary answered a phone call with a shocking look. The secretary hanged up the phone and announced that Mimi will not be coming to work anymore. No reason was given.<br><br>Everybody in the office was puzzled. The young man did not go for lunch but waited for an answer. An answer that nobody knows. Perhaps he was not really keen for an answer but how to apologise to Mimi to clear his guilt.<br><br>The secretary answered another phone call. The conversation was something like Â“Are you sure?Â”Â… Â“You sure?Â”Â… Â“Serious! You are not jokingÂ”Â… Â“OK!Â”Â… The secretary hanged up the phone and went into the boss room. After a while she came out and announced that Mimi and her whole family, except her little brother, died in a car accident in Malaysia.<br><br>The young man was shocked. He was devastated, and could not believe what he heard. He told himself that such a scene happened only on TV. Â“It is not real! It is not real!Â” he wrestle his mind with many logical explanations. After sometimes he calmed down and accepted the fact. Then one drop, another drop of tears slowly formed and slided down from his eyes, passed his mouth, to his chin and drop off. He cried silently and suddenly guilt slipped in and it was like a two-edged knife stabbed right through his heart and pushed in slowly.<br><br>The pain, the agony, was unbearable. He just wished he had the power to turn back the clock. He could only cry and looked into the coffin to see her one last time. He cried,and cried and cried. That was all he could do.<br><br>He looked at her, looking at her sleeping face. Â“Mimi, I am sorry! I donÂ’t mean to make you cry the other day.Â” His tears were like flowing river and he was trying to speak properly, Â“ WillÂ… you forÂ…give me?Â” Â“IÂ’m here to say sorÂ…ryÂ”. Â“Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!Â” He was expecting a miracle that she would wake up and forgive him.<br><br>He whispered to her, like a pair of lovers in a cinema, Â“Who's gonna buy fried rice for me when IÂ’m hungry?Â” His good friend came over and hugged him and walked him to a seat.<br><br>Twelve years had passed,  and till this day he cannot forgive himself for not saying sorry to her. Every time he eat fried rice he will cry. He will quickly think of whom he have hurt today and forget to say sorry, and he will quickly patch up with them.<br><br>Life is short and full of unexpectation. If you hurt someone in the day you should say sorry to him before sunset. If you have a conflict in the evening you should sort it out before its too late...<br></div>
