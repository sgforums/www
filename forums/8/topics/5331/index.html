            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, first of all, i apologize that this is gonna be a long posting. Pls bear with me, but im really in a dilemna.<br><br>I'll be going to the states to study computer engineering next yr, and i applied to Santa Clara Univ (SCU), University of Southern California (USC), and George Washington Univ (GWU).<br><br>As my friend said, once u've been to California before, you wouldnt wanna go to other states.  And i really love california.<br><br>Initially, i was thinking of only SCU and USC.  SCU although not well known, has the advantage that it is located within Silicon Valley, and all the job attachments for practical training will be done there.<br><br>USC has a better reputation than SCU, and is actually ranked (although i wouldnt say the rankings are really accurate, but serves as a guideline) tops among the 3 i applied. I wanted to go there initially.  However, USC's reputation seems to be very bad now, esp. in Singapore.  Other than having only a BIG name, its mostly associated as a party sch, with lots of super-rich brats who do not really want to study, but rather to just party.  I've been there before and i can say it holds a some truth in that.  Many Asians there spend $$ like nobody's business and drive those ultra-expensive sports car.  And of cos being in Singapore, u know how SG cares so much abt reputation and name which many times clouded the quality of education.<br><br>George Washington Univ is well, of cos located in Washington.  But then, i prefer california... sigh...  and my advisor is psychoing my to study there instead, cos he knows this USC grad who couldnt find a job in sg for more than a yr, and is now going door to door selling diskettes.  I feel that GWU is a pretty good sch... but the main reason for my dilemna = 1) all my friends in Calif... 2) the east is too cold for me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> (yeah i know, stupid reason)  3) i think i'll get bullied there... too few asians.<br><br>So how? Can i get some advice pls?<br><br>anyway, i went to the GWU website and was pretty impressed by some of the things which i shall quote here (sorry again for the long msg):<br><br>Students in the School of Engineering and Applied Science pursue challenges both in and out of the classroom. Students have designed and constructed a regional competition-winning steel bridge that can be assembled in under six minutes reflecting the regulations governing full-scale bridges. They also have flown aboard NASA's weightless training laboratory-in micro-gravity flight and tested unique fastening tools to be used by builders of a future space station.<br><br>A Cooperation Education program allow you to work full time or part time while earning top pay with employers such as TRW, Contel, American Management Systems, NASA, IBM, and BDM while carrying out your engineering studies.<br><br>SEAS has responded by establishing a caring and innovative program to support its engineering and computer science students. We offer you an almost-free fifth year of studies, if you should need it, to earn your degree. (talk abt $$$, heh heh heh)<br><br>Well, obviously, all schools will always say how good their school is blah blah blah...  so i really need some 3rd party comments..<br><br>Thanks in advance! any advice will be appreciated, but pls refrain from asking me to apply for OTHER univs?...already confused as it is <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by shinshin (edited 26-11-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Shinshin,<br><br>I would suggest going to Santa Clara...First of all, it's laid back..and life is pretty much easier than USC and probably Washington...and like u stated, it's right next to silicon Valley...Please believe that even doing an attachment there will get u into almost any job afterwards...and that's an advantage that u can't get rom anywhere else...also u like Cali...I also love it...:-)  Life is so laid back and unstressed...My brother is working in Silicon Valley...my guess that if he decided to go work anywhere else, he would have no problems at all...and yes, schools will jack up their reputations so that people think that it's really such a great place to attend...<br><br>But in California, it's so laid back u caould forget that ur in uni...ha ha...so take care:-)</div>
