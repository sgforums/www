            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Tired,<br><br>The motion speaks that the "Teens of To-Day Have Lost Their Idealism". So, first of all, you have to see what kind of definition which the proposition would take. First, confine your definition of teens, which you would take the age group from 13 to 21 and take the today as of last decade. Then what do you mean by losing your idealism? Idealism would be thought of the set of values which may or may not be achievable but nevertheless we could set ourselves a goal to the future.<br><br>The proposition is likely to use the case where the teenagers in US has digressed themselves into the violence, and the best example is the Colorado shooting case. You can argue on this based on two points :<br><br>1)The Pop Culture :<br><br>Pop culture or popular culture would be one of the good indicators to looking into the teens of today, since the teenagers contributed a significant proportion to what is pop culture : for example, drinking coke, wearing swatch watches, the kind of music they listen, the food they eat and up to other things which you name it they have it. Be more specific go to the songs, demostrate the one would see that in the early 80s, the songs in that era are pretty pessimistic and it reflected the mood of that time, but now it featured on songs which are more optimistic, which indicate teenagers have preferred to seek happiness. This argument is used in a debate on idealism, and it turned out to be a good point to shoot down the proposition.<br><br>2)Values of teenagers today<br><br>This point is more subtle. You have to quote examples of teens doing social work, community services and getting involved with adventure groups and stuff like that. You may quote examples of teenagers (go to the nearest newspaper) who have used their time well to do all sort of things.<br><br>This is what I can offer.. It seems to be quite a good motion to play. If you are debating in the British kind of system which I am presently doing, you can always twist this motion into something else to debate, or confine the teens of today to just British teenagers, so that you can confine the scope fo the debate. Not to mention the best part, where your opponent can stand up in between your speech between the 1st and 4th minute and raise a point of infammation, and you can choose to answer it or not...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey callan and prodigal, thnx for replying and giving your comments on the debate topic. =) i really appreciate it.<br><br>to prodigal: maybe we could give some examples of British teens, but it's like we are doing this debate on home ground, that is in singapore, so don't you think we should focus more on singaporean teens??? i mean, if we were to keep taking foreign examples, wouldn't that show to our teachers that we have not done much research on singaporean teens, and we ourselves are singaporean teens.....anyway, i will definitely suggest to my teacher bout that. =) thnx.<br><br>by the way, my friend once brought this up. wonder what are your comments on it. =) he said, if the teens do not have any ideals, what do they have to lose? it's something like i haven't given anyone any hope, so where does the disappointment come from? ok, mayb this is a bad example, but hope you get my point. =)<br><br>anyway, really appreciate your comments. =)<br><br>to other forumites: please tell me your view on this topic. be it the opposition or proposition point of view. i welcome both. =) thanks for all your help!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tired<br>Hmm...well since u are in the opposition tean ...I can bring out some of the points that the proposition will bring out<br><br>1. Ideals and dreams are part of growing up but how many really abide and put into action what they really want to be?<br>It is like asking a teenager after getting his O level results which course he is going and what he wants to be when he grow up...A lot of times they are more comformed to the society rather to pursue what they are relaly good in or wanted. A very good example is  parents sculpting their kids on what they want and what is good for them in their future.<br><br>2. Because we live in Singapore and we are repressed by the society of getting what we want...and we are brought up in an environment where we have to imitate others who is the cream of the crop in the society to remain competitive but the ideals of one person is not determined by how smart or how powerful he is....Rather the kinds of ideals a person has instead of what ideals a society have for its ppl. Because ppl are too preoccupied that ideals meaning being powerful or famous but morals and values plays a part too<br><br>3. Last but not least..we are shaped by the society of how we should be and it is a sad story..even in the midst of us where all of us are sitting I believe that we are here not because of our ideals but because of the cruel world we are living in to be someone that others wants us to be<br><br>If u want to know what are the rebuttal..Prodigal might be able to help.<br><br>------------------<br>Writing is a weapon that is more powerful than a man's fist.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Prodigal<br>I think ur first point in pop culture can only relate to the audience that now teenagers have become more optimistic but still if you were to listen all the songs today they represent a wide array of genres and they have santanism and as such.<br><br>Frankly, this motion is quite one sided in the Singapore teenagers perspective.You can emphasize that now there is more creative and interactive classes for ppl to maximise their potential in EQ, but still it is the society constraint that enable them to be what they want to be..it is not they din try just that they feel it is pointless to be idealistic cos they see no future in it if they were to pursue something they want but not encourage by the peers on society. So they gave up in the midst.<br><br>But based on all the awards for young entrepaneurs ...U can empahsixe and get some news paper cuttings of their hopes and their contribution for the future Singapore</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi t|rEd:<br><br>I apologize for the delay in replying, because my attention is diverted to several posts which I totally lost track what is happening here.<br><br>Well, on the point of restricting the boundary, I am just suggesting about confining the teens to teens of a certain country. Of course, in Britain, you talk about British teens, and it carries to Singapore when it is reasonable to talk about Singaporean teens.<br><br>You see, every teenager have their own set of ideals, and this is manifested thru their actions. I remember that I was once talking to the Porter in my college, as he was a man of wisdom. He put up a point that every generation have the right to choose what they think about the way they lived, and there is no point making comparisons. We can all talk about how idealistic we are in our times, and say that the ideals are now gone, but this is a matter of choice for today's teens.  The good thing about being the opposition, you don't have to argue that all the teens have lost their idealism, you just have to convince them that there is still idealism which students can draw from their education and their family and friends.<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Rinoa Heartilly:<br><br>To rebutt all your points, yes, I agree that not many people are putting their dreams or ideals to reality, but the case for the proposition is that they have to show all the teens have lost their idealism, i.e. there is no more idealism for them to harness on. That is not the case, because on my side of the house, we purported that the role of the educators to instill proper values and ideas to the students. Well, I can easily deal with Rinoa's argument by saying that on a large perspective, no doubt that the individual's ideals and dreams are outdone by what the society wants as an ideal. There is still idealism in the teenagers, because the society is instilling in them certain beliefs and ideals (which is a form of idealism in that perspective) like "making money is the way to life" and those become their ideals and they move with it. I don't see a contradiction with that.<br><br></div>

What prodigal is saying in this part allows opportunity to ask WHEN does it become their ideals? And can it still be called ideals and not influences? To say the above high;ights the point that teenagers are lost sheep till society 'herds' them to the right direction. Doesn't it imply that teens have indeed no idealism? Also does societal imparting of it's ideals to them mean it's the teen's ideals as well? I'd use the terms "parental pressure" and "peer pressure" than "ideal".<br><br>My 2 cents worth....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, t|rEd,<br><br>Of course, it also depends on the proposition whether they would want to restrict the teens to how much of the population. But if they restrict to certain groups of teens, you can pick up the thread and give counter-examples, hence you are somehow forcing them to adapt to all, so that you can show that there are always counterexamples... Just a way of debating, rather than to do with the motion itself...</div>
