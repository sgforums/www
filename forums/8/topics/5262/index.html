If bf, can compromise....so I think it is fair...<br><br>But I can't stand guys who splurge their gfs money...most of the time the gf pay instead of the guy. One of my gfs bf even want to save face, try to ask my gf to put the money under the table and pass it to him to look as though he is paying...So cheap!! Dun want to pay, still want to save face. Really can't stand guys like that!<br><br>In all cases, guys offering to pay show his gentleman attitiude, which I think most girls will appreciate...<br><br>The above I mean meals, and I think the stuffs that girls buy, the girl should pay, cos it will be too heavy a financial for the guy<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 04-12-1999).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 04-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway I feel that the guy should pay for the expenses for the first few times for formality sake. However after a few times of meeting, they should be quite familiar with each other and should pay for their own expenses. I'm only 16 this yr, studying and thus not financially sound enough to pay for the gal that often. We can try emulating the example of our ex-president and her late wife and go on dutch.</div>
