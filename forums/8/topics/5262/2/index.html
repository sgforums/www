            <div class='col-md body'>IMHO, the deciding factor would be the relationship of the guy and girl. if the guy's wooing her, it'll definitely help your case if you treat her to everything, but on the other hand, if you're "together", i think it'll be fair if you go dutch, with him treating you occasionally. but somehow, most of my guy friends treat their gfs ALL THE TIME. for meals, movies, bowling... even for their magazines!!! always wondered how i can get a guy like that...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> but i find girls who openly hint that they want the guy to buy them something are pretty.. cheap. if you want that thing so much, go buy it yourself!<br><br>however, for friends, most of the time we go dutch. unless my friends are working, or suddenly come into a lot of money... then i'll get a treat!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> either that, or we'll bully the guy who's super rich, and make him treat us for coffee or a meal. haha.. yeah. very very mean. but for guy friends who treat me one on one, i'll usually find a way to "repay" them. ie, if say they treat me for a movie, then i'll pay for the popcorn. which helps train my reflexes 'cos there'll always be a race to see who takes out the cash first!<br><br>my pt is? guys treating girls are usually counted as sweet... but, an important thing is your attitude! i hate it when guys seem as if they're doing a favour for me... i'm definitely not some poor lil girl who cant pay for herself, and if i was really broke, i think i'll be smart enough NOT to go to some really expensive place? but, i dont think it's a necessity for guys to treat girls.... so "poor" guys like jasonnex can relax!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Independent gals usually pay for their own expenditure. We dun want to be regarded as relying on guys to survive.<br>For me and my frens, we take turns to pay... If I zap notes for my fren, he may help me to pay for my drinks... or we just accumulate and treat the other some other time. And if my frens are working adults, I just let them pay unless otherwise stated =)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's not true that all girls expect guys to pay for them.<br>In fact with my ex bf he pays for everything from dinner to taxi fares to things I buy for myself. When I wanted to pay he insisted he will pay. Even when I insist on paying he doesn't let me and give the money back to me.<br>Most girls will take advantage of this kind of situation but I never did. He keeps paying for me until he's broke. Even that he refused to let me know but I knew anyway.<br>I gave him money and he was kind of shy to take it but I insisted then he took it but after saying he will pay me back.<br>Of course when he wanted to pay me back I didn't take it. Then he will pay for me each time we go out. Since he doesn't want me to pay, I decide that I have to compensate him in other ways. I bought for him a gift and a cake to show how much I appreciate him and his efforts.<br>We both live on the oppsite ends of S'pore but he still bother to send me home after I finished work and then take a cab home.<br>But sad to say the relationship didn't work out. However I still remember him as the guy I really loved for showing he cares for me and loving me.<br><br>So guys out there, dun be stubborn if a girl offers to pay. U may be trying to impressed them but it doesn't help if u're going to be broke. But if u want to treat the girl then make sure u have money with u.<br><br>------------------<br>~If it's wrong to love you, then I dun wanna be right~</div>

And if the gal doesn't try to pay for her share during the dates, then might as well ditch her (she's after your money or just enjoying the attention!).<br>Once you're a couple, then it's up to the both of you to decide who pays what and when.<br><br>CryoGenic: Holding the doors for girls doesn't constitute to one being old-fashioned  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

I feel that all that matters is who you are going to live your life with.. she might not have appear in your life now, but at one stage in life, she will.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>heh heh sorry, i know u guys are already on the 2nd qn, but regarding who pays, its basic etiquette that the person who invites/asks has to pay. Its like inviting someone over for dinner, you prepare the food, you don't ask them over then say "oh yeah, the kitchen is all yours, please feel free to cook what you want, and cook a little extra for me too!". Sooo yeah, if the guy asks the girl out, then he shld pay, if he has a budget, go somewhere inexpensive, same goes if the girl asks the guy out. However, its polite to offer to pick up the bill, so both sides should bring $ just in case anything happens... Hmmm this usually applies to dates though, with friends, you usually tell them in advance "MY TREAT" if you're gonna treat them, if not they shld know that u're all goin dutch.</div>
