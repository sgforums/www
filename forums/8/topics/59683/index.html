            <div class='col-md body'>i do agree with you that there are some loopholes in SG edu system, and most of them are based on memory work coz as required by exams and exams questions are set such a way that u need to know yr stuff in yr textbooks and lecture notes. sometimes regurgitating whatever is in the textbooks score better marks than those that try to phrase it in their own words (coz they nber memorise.(?))However, to memorise u also need to understand the matter well, if u dun understand memorise liao also cannot remember. so somehow little bit of the essense still gets into yr head.<br><br>our govt realise that and that spurs up the whole idea of <strong>creative learning </strong>, a bottom up aprroach to learning... but sad to say.. we, generally are traditionalist.<br><br>Those that try and fail will go far.</div>
