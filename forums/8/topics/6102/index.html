            <div class='col-md body'>IÂ’m curious as to the grounds on which a thread is closed. Since we have a moderator (who has been very liberal thus far) it is ultimately an arbitrary decision. Now, I realise there will be instances when a thread should be closed eg. unrelenting vulgarity or vile racism. The Â‘BigotryÂ’ thread however highlighted issues of free exchange and prejudices, albeit a one-sided exchange, but important nonetheless for challenging archaic views. I do not see anything wrong in letting the thread continue and die a natural death as it wasnÂ’t vulgar (well, most of us werenÂ’t) and the issues discussed would have clarified the paradigms for forum-exchange.<br><br>So, how do you decide a thread should be closed?<br><br>cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chief,<br><br>I see. So, what were your reasons for closing the 'Bigotry' thread? It can't be for obscenity because we have "Best Sexual Positions" running, nor can it be for ill-feelings since the ngkaikoe-flaming thread went on for ages. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I agree its a hard job being a moderator which is why the sooner a set of general guidelines laid in B&amp;W will prevent calling arbitrary decisions into question.<br><br>For example, vulgarity is not bad in itself. If its used to prove a point or used in embellishment of constructive criticism then I don't see why the odd F**k shouldn't be allowed. However, if its repetitive and without intending other than to insult then we should examine its place here.<br><br>cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear almighty Chief,<br><br><strong>"The best form of government is a benevolent dictatorship"</strong><br><br>How far do you agree with this statement?<br><br>Actually, I do agree with the statement only to a certain extent. What I object is that, when there is no transparency to how the government is run, then it would be a disaster. Singapore is one of the examples, which some people would term as the above : benevolent dictatorship. However, the question is the consequence to such a kind of government, is that people become apathetic to the issues of the government.<br><br>A quick look at the Singapore government scene, any moment where people spoke up against the government, is either get sued or get cracked down instantly. The worst thing is that the opposition other than one or two good ones somehow got themselves burnt because they had loopholes in their lives. The problem with present Singapore is that it does not consult the people when there is a certain issue is at hand.<br><br>For a hypothetical example, using the NS - 3 years, suppose tomorrow we declare that NS is going to be 3 years, do you think anyone would speak up? I don't think so. They may be objections but it is not going to affect the next election at all. The sad thing about benevolent dictatorship is that the firswt slightest criticism to the system is that it get curbed instantly.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To bishamon:<br><br>You see, the situation is very unbalanced now. The thing is that people are getting more and more apathetic about the political situation. The thing is that nobody is complaining or making a fuss as long as the government maintains economic stability. I don't subscribe to the freedom of speech purported by some people here that you can say anything you want, and be it vulgarities and obscenities. What I am more inclined to say is that we should be more involved with the issues concerned, because we elect the government, because we have a constitution that allows us to comment on the issues which concern us.<br><br>I think that people in our country must learn to handle discussion properly, not like the way Taiwanese politicians does, beating each other up in parliament. Even from a forum like this, people cannot even argue on an issue without raising a flame or personal insult on that person because of a past feud.  One of the things I liked people of where I studied. We can fire each other over discussions, but at the end of the day, no hard feelings, because we focus on the issue not personal insults which affect our friendship. This is something which I cannot find in the Singapore culture. People in Singapore are mostly very close-minded and refuse to adhere to criticism.<br><br>I disagree with you on the issue of questioning the basis on how a thread is decided to be close. I think that it is very relevant because it allows us to examine what the objectives of this forum is all about and whether we should condone threads like "what is the best way of having sex?" or other forms of perverted or controversial issues which concerned ethical or religious aspect in our modern world.<br><br>I share your sentiments that the job of a moderator is difficult, but that does not mean we cannot make such query. This kind of reasoning that because the job is difficult and hence we should not criticise, is very typical of our Singapore government.<br><br>Have a good day, live well and prosper...</div>
