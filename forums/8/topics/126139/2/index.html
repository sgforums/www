Both want a win win situation. But are they working towards it? One refusing to admit the mistakes of its past, and another which refuse to let go of its past.Perhaps the word forgive and forget can't be used when in comes to country vs country relationships. But i would really wish that both sides will come clean one day. Is the words "sorry' and "i forgive' that difficult?
