It has been brought up so many times before.<br><br>Because we recognize that this is the Japan's government attempt to cause internal conflict in China and Korea.<br><br>Because a sense of pragmatism has been deeply ingrained into the Singaporeans. To undestand that, let's take a look at the actions of our forefathers. While the rest of South-East Asia took on an anti-colonial stance, we didn't. We realised that unlike other SEA countries, we are a small nation and we need their help in order to survive. We encouraged foreign MNCs including Japanese ones to set up in Singapore and thereby replacing local small companies. If there was to a huge uproar, it should be then. Afterall, our local companies are under direct threat from Japanese ones. But again, this sense of pragmatism prevailed.<br><br></div>

It has been brought up so many times before.<br><br>Because we recognize that this is the Japan's government attempt to cause internal conflict in China and Korea.<br><br>Because a sense of pragmatism has been deeply ingrained into the Singaporeans. To undestand that, let's take a look at the actions of our forefathers. While the rest of South-East Asia took on an anti-colonial stance, we didn't. We realised that unlike other SEA countries, we are a small nation and we need their help in order to survive. We encouraged foreign MNCs including Japanese ones to set up in Singapore and thereby replacing local small companies. If there was to a huge uproar, it should be then. Afterall, our local companies are under direct threat from Japanese ones. But again, this sense of pragmatism prevailed.<br><br></div></blockquote>but are we the only pragmatic ones?  are we the only one that has japanese investments?  japan has investments in all the countries that they invaded, even china and korea.</div>
