By not attempting to whitewash their history, they've managed to avoid a lot of problems, which is what the Japanese government should have done in the first place.</div>

I'm not discounting the fact that Lee Teng Hui may be one of those.<br><br>IMO, the biggest mistake is allowing the royal family of Japan to continue as titular heads of state. The associations between the royals, militarists and the old conglomerates was certainly too close for comfort in the decade from 1939 onwards.<br><br>If those above-mentioned governments had a choice, I doubt they'd even choose a Japanese investor if the company was even indirectly responsible for war crimes. There had been allegations in the past that VW made use of slave labour during WW2, but as to whether these were later found to be unfounded or the case was settled out of court, I am not so sure.<br><br>Here, we are talking about accepting responsibility for wrongdoing, instead of glossing over it and claiming such actions were justified.</div>

But at that time, communism was sweeping half the world and the Americans didn't want too radical a change in Japan (compare this with the forced abdication of Italy's Victor Immanuel). They let Hirohito stay on as figurehead, cementing the righties' place in Japanese politics. But then again, the US has shown it is capable of mega-blunders. Remember the "other" 9/11 tragedy in Chile? The dictator Augusto Pinochet had the backing of the US to seize power in a bloodbath.<br><br>As for the kamikaze philosophy, I can only remark that the Palestinians and recently, Al-Qaeda, have adapted it very well to suit their purposes.</div>
