            <div class='col-md body'>Started sneezing this afternoon, on Orchard Rd, after I came out of the station to take a bus.<br><br>I didnt sneeze in the bus, but once I got off the bus, I started sneezing again.<br><br>A few later hours later the yellow mucus came about. Mum said I had eaten too much heaty stuff, and she is probably right.<br><br>My face feels achy, my right nostril is blocked. At times when I blow too hard, my right ear gets affected, and I cant hear very well.<br><br>I am not having a fever, but a headache on the right side of my head keeps throbbing.<br><br>This continued into the night. I tried getting some sleep, but couldnt. My face was aching, my nose was blocked, and then, when i sneezed again, it felt as though my whole body was trying to get rid of needles hiding in my body. It was painful to sneeze.<br><br>I am close to finishing my box of tissues. If I need more, I have to get it from my parents' room, who are asleep, and I dont want to wake them up.<br><br>I drank more water than usual, but that only meant more toilet visits.<br><br>Now I am awake only because I cannot sleep, or I had tried to sleep but couldn't. Normally when I read a bok by bedside I could sleep pretty quick, but this didnt work this time round.<br><br>My TV screen was now showing the MTV awards, and on Channel 8 there is Xiang Yun and Huang Wenyong hosting the Huang Jin Nian Hua Show, definately not for me. So I switched it off.<br><br>I tried switching off the air conditioning, to see if the nose will stop drooling the mucus. It did, but my nose gets blocked, and then i have to blow hard. When I switch on the air conditioning, my nose started to drool again.<br><br>I am going to get an MC tomorrow.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Thanks for reading my sick diary.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I just got back home 1/2 an hour ago. Got an MC for today.<br><br>Overall, it took me 2 hours from registration to see a doctor, and another 1/2 hour to get the medication.<br><br>To me that was just too long. I dont think even Polyclinics need to wait that long. I was unlucky to be in the clinic on a monday, and on a day when there were only 2 doctors. Even the doctor who attended to me was apologetic as well for the long wait, as she said that it would not be normally like this.<br><br>Other than waiting times aside, I would really think that service is quite excellent. Everyone was quite courteous, from the receptionist who handed me my clinic with both hands, to the doctor who handed me the folder (with the MC inside) with both hands, and explained and apologised for the long wait.<br><br>Well that's then end of my clinic report.
