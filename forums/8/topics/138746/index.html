            <div class='col-md body'>His annoying blog once again...<br><br>I just read a terrible news a few days ago and the news keep me following up. A female severed naked Chinese National's body was found.  Body parts were thrown at different areas.  With the efficiency of the police force, the body was identified and the suspect was caught just within 10 hrs.  The intriguing part is that it was her supervisor in a factory where she worked as an operator.  Girl was 22, n the guy is 50.  He is married n it is a hearsay that they are together.  She was perhaps murdered n chopped to 7 pieces.  Clean dedicated chops of a like-wise butcher left no blood on the body parts.  Wat said above does not really excite me, wat caught me is the man was a very loving husband, father whom everyone respects?!  Can you believe it?  A responsible father gone a strayed with another woman, and killed her.  I cannot believe it too.  His wife also cannot believe it, keeps crying and crying.  Really poor thing.. Pls dun be too sad already, Madam.  (Steven thoughtfully offered her two pieces of Watson's tissue.  One for her red teary eyes, another for her red nose )  She trusted him so much.  The point is  human sux.. Humans are greedy in a way.  One is always not enuff n prone to controlled by greed, lust and emotion.  <span style="color: red;">Remember the time you still want one more scoop of ice-cream?  Tat is greed!!!!!  You have sinned!!  You sux! </span> My male friend lost his fiancÃ©e for 7 years to a total stranger just like that..  The thought of getting married frightens me.  Now you know why I m still an eligible bachelor.  Ask yourself this question for those who are attached or married. "Have you given your partner 100% of devotion?"  Meaning for eg., you got one bed at home.  One day, you went to a furniture shop, and saw a new bed.  It seems very comfortable, and you think," hmm...how will it feels if I slept on it for a while?"  You see, the thought already jeopardize the fate of your bed at home. 100% devotion?  Steven shakes his head sadly.  An evil thought already dismissed the 100.  Sometimes, I think to myself. <span style="color: red;"> A girl will be so lucky if she is my girlfriend.  I m pure, angelic n will stay 100% devoted to my gf.  I wun even look at another other girls beside her.  Hard to get - True hunk + 100% devotion = Steven Lim</span><br><br>1. wt.f mr steven lim , you want fame and glory,  isn't that worser?<br><br>2. many times i have walked pass CK tang and caught you looking at other girls<br><br><span style="color: #444444;"></span></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Recently, I read about an article about better looks linking to better future.  After reading the interesting article, I pondered to myself.  Does looks really matter so much?  <span style="color: red;">Firstly, I cannot deny is when looking for a girlfriend, I tend to go for looks first.  She needs not be as pretty as Japanese Actress Sora Aoi, but must be at least somewhere near her range</span>[/color].  N i m not talking about a pretty face only.. Figure must be good too.. then complement with her jovial n spirited nature..  u may be lucky to get 8/10 points girlfriend.  But tell me, how many times we can be so lucky to get a babe as girlfriend, answers is yes u can....wait long long...  From my records, it is really a mixture of either good character or just plain good lookers.  You cannot have your cake and eat it too...sigh...Some of them were super ultra good figure but they will look good if their faces were covered.. Till now, I m still trying to find a place on her face I can really flatter.  But i failed!!!!  <span style="color: red;">When they asked me," Darling, which part of my face do u like best?"  I will try to divert attention,"Wow! Nice hairclip!" or "er..er..er....I like your..  er...."   Then, cold sweats breaks out... Then, she will be angry if there is no answer... sigh...being a nice boyfriend is tough nowadays</span>.. <span style="color: green;">My country's Prime Minister, Mr. Lee Hsien Loong for example is a very handsome and charming guy.  Seldom u see a guy still remain so powerful at 50 years old.  Plus Plus is he speaks well too.  When he speaks, people lights up and listen.  He is definitely a chip off the old block from Singapore's Father, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew which built Modern Singapore.  I really cannot imagine a nation's head who speak well but look hideous!  It is useless!  Even our previous Prime Minister, Mr. Goh Chok Tong looks cute with his spects</span>.  I can even make a oath that someone even call him sexy during one National Day Rally Speech..  That one....er.....really no comments... Bottom line, looks n quality are really important.  You can never lose any of these....Phew..!  .Luckily, <strong>God </strong>had been very kind to me.  <span style="color: blue;">I have good looks + talents!     hee......... = P</span><br><br>1. look at your own face first<br><br>2. as if you got a nice face..if you were to ask the girl the same question , i bet she would be stumped.<br><br>3. good liar ^.^<br><br>4. Misleading the public once again..<br><br>5. Don't bring religion into your blasphemy...<br><br>(Neither do i see someone being kicked out of the beginning stages for superstar and singapore idol as having talent)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You may not believe it, my friend...I have many girlfriends before.  Too many before n some relationships too short and too unmemorable, that I lost count of the exact number.  But it will still range between 13 to 15.  Wow right when you know that i even have to use my toes to count??  I sometimes also ask myself what have I achieve from each relationship.  Me becoming a better lover or listener..? Ok Ok..i admit it...I do look gay...but I am 100% as straight as an arrow.  My character is even tougher..I m a very competitive person.  As I said just now, 13 -15 relationships right?  5 of them are really serious with the longest being 2 yrs..  The rest of the girls some of them virtually throw themselves to me.. Eg.  First date..  The 16 years old cute girl was really acting weird, pulling my bag's straps wherever I go, n getting really close to me, like those adorable puppies you see in pet's shop wanting your love n attention.   Well, I am of cos a person full of love.  Some of them r fat, some thin, tall, well endowed.. Some relationships are like plain water with extreme quiet girls, some of them r like red hot chilli pepper. <span style="color: red;"> My observation is humans acted differently under influence of basic instinct.  Girls r also human.  When they are really thirsty, they simply want it.  No matter how beautiful n how pure a girl appears to be, she lost it behind closed doors.  </span>Little kids are real, they dig their nose infront of people..Do you still tell people now when was your last time u dig it?  We r masked. sigh...  Sometimes when u r doing nothing, the images of the 5 exes will pop up one by one..Wat r they doing now?  Hope that their current bfs treat them right..wish them happiness.Wat if we are still together?..If you are in a relationship right now, is it wrong or right to still miss them again?  The times I spent with each and everyone of them in my favorite Suntec shopping mall..Hugging them tightly n doing French kisses.  I started from complete kiss idiot to supreme Jedi Master..  My cupboard was filled with plentiful of self-made love cards and poems...All I know was once love and dedications to Mr. Steven Lim..<br><br>This just says as much about your pitiful character.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Saturday, July 03, 2004<br>The SUPERHERO..<br><br>Let's get into serious business..<br><br>I was checking my e-mail a few minutes ago when I discovered something REALLY interesting with one of my mails. I read it and felt .... I'll tell you at the very end of the entry.<br><br>I've come across ANOTHER SUPERHERO! How astounding is that? He's our VERY own SINGAPORE SUPERHERO!<br><br>Acknowledge him or not? - It's totally up to you. *Grins*<br><br>Let me tell you more about him...<br><br>He's 28 this year - too old to be a SUPERHERO, don't you think so?<br><br>He's height 1.80M. Pretty tall huh? i'm just 1.73M. DAMN IT! He's weight, 78KG.<br><br>He likes to play basketball with small kids. Hey, you're a big-bully! He always pushed them down if they tried to get into his way.<br><br>He likes to sing; it's his passion. Oh, forgot to add a very crucial information about him. Recently, he auditioned for SINGAPORE IDOL. I bet he made it through the second round. I mean...He's a superhero, the judges have to bow to him!<br><br>And OF COURSE, he likes to watch movies with grannies. Preferably, comedies; he wants those grannies to die from laughter so that he can inherit their family fortunes.<br><br>Let's move on...<br><br>He wants you to print his pictures and make it into posters, glue them to the walls or your wardrobe!<br><br>Conclusion: He wants you to have NIGHTMARES or he wants you to FANTASISE HIM when you masturbate.<br><br>This is what he claims...<br><br>He's HANDSOME!<br><br>.....FEARLESS!<br><br>HE IS THE PROTECTOR OF LOCAL VILLIANS..<br><br>Pssh...He has a girlfriend. So there won't be any opportunity for you girls out there. Hey c`mon....Spiderman has Mary Jane. Batman has catwoman. So why can't he have one?<br><br>Okay enough said.<br><br>You must be dying to know who he is..<br><br>Alright...I shall reveal..<br><br>He's none other than...<br><br>STEVEN LIM!<br><br>Ah`huh! I'm not lying. That's him, your SUPERHERO!<br><br>When he's not a SUPERHERO, he's a STREET EYEBROW PLUCKER.<br><br>Isn't he handsome?<br><br>GRANNY: *Shakes head and peed*<br><br>8 Year Old Girl: I want my mummy!! *cry*<br><br>Pierre Png: Absolutely SHAMELESS!<br><br>Phua Chu Kang: Wha say... SG Superhero leh...Don't pray pray ah!...<br><br>Rosy: Oi! Interested in him issit..? Go la... Be with him..<br><br>Trista: Thank god he didn't auditioned for being one of the twenty-five bachelors! *Sigh in relieve*<br><br>Undertaker: *Choke slam him*<br><br></div>
