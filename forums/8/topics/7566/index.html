Maybe once in a while, the guy can do some pampering and give in to the lady, or sometimes the lady can give the guy the ego boost by giving in to him...... but to strictly say that one party has to give in to the other, I think it would be dangerous for a relationship to be balanced this way.....<br><br>------------------<br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In a relationship...both parties should take a little and give a little.  It's not abt who gives it more or who gives in less, it's the attempt to work things out for the better of the relationship.  It's abt keeping the relationship in tact and improving it.<br><br>To compromise is a big thing one has to learn to maintain a relationship.  It's not a one-way street.  For love to happen both parties must compromise at times.<br><br>Pride is very dangerous, as mentioned before.  Why?  Cuz you will not be able to think straight when pride is in your way.  It's not a matter of whether being able to apologize or not, cuz if it is really hard for you to apologize you can always make it up in another way, do little things for her/him or show a bit more attention.  Pride can ruin a relationship when you feel that your pride is more important then your love/feelings for your partner.  If this is the case the relationship won't work out, you might as well spend some time doing some self-reflection.  When you are in love, you tend to think with your heart and not with your brain.<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...Sting like a bee...<br><br>[This message has been edited by NaiveGirl (edited 28 May 2000).]</div>
