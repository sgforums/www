I once read b4 that word are very difficult to express one true feelings and thoughts, that is why there are so many misunderstanding and fighting going on around. word can only express things we know, and to a certain level... beyond that, it is quite difficult to express it... for e.g. nirvana-who can tell the actual feeling and state of mind, love-so many different degree and ways to express it.<br><br>Doom, i agreed with you that all religion is base on good teachings and for ppl to live a more better, meaningful life. It doesn't matter from where you are from, be it black, white, yellow, believers, no-believers, catholic, buddhists...anything...all this is just a category, the human heart, thinking is the evil and good one. it is the mind and heart which is poisioned, it is not the fault of the religion. look into the prison, every tom, dick, harry is inside and there are from everywhere, every religion.<br><br>Rapture, ok you are right, i am wrong...you was never stuck up.

So he brought with him a group of ppl and form Modern Christianity, and if I am not wrong.
