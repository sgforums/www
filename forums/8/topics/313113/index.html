              <p>I think its dumb becos quite many people dun like to spend these money on wedding dinners. Some of them will complain, and some will keep quiet and complain quietly inside themselves becos no choice have to go becos they will be inviting them in the future or have asked people to go last time for their own wedding.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I dun blame restaurants at all. They are just manking money, which is alright to me. Personally, I just try to avoid going for such dinners.</p>

              <p>In a sense, the marriage causes money of friends, relatives and colleagues to be passed into the hands of restaurants.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To tell you the truth, i believe that there is a market for low cost marriage which have not be opened fully yet. Currently, the cheaper mode for wedding are those held at community centers, which proves that some entrepreneurs are already creating this market supply for consumers.</p>

              <p><br>Go tour spend more lor, actually if u can know how to make profit, wedding can earn money also. Choose the lousiest menu of dishes at a grand hotel, then invite relatives and pples, if per table of $700, u can receive $800, u make $100 per table lor, so invite 60 tables, u get 6k profit,...can go korea and japan liao.</p>

              <p><br>Go tour spend more lor, actually if u can know how to make profit, wedding can earn money also. Choose the lousiest menu of dishes at a grand hotel, then invite relatives and pples, if per table of $700, u can receive $800, u make $100 per table lor, so invite 60 tables, u get 6k profit,...can go korea and japan liao.</p>

              <p>Aiya actually for my wedding we just wanted to ROM -_-"</p>
              <p>My parents were ok, his parents were ok but my Grandma kpkb so much bo pian in the end to accomodate her</p>
              <p>Didn't want a dinner because it is a pain in the ass to arrange one</p>
              <p>So in the end we did it Buffet Style at Mauritius Mandarin and made it free sitting so if you don't like someone, you don't sit beside them.</p>
              <p>Of course we get the usual how come so messy etc but we also heck care the comments because we didn't even want to invite anyone in the first place <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Anyway my husband and I say that we just treat this as a treat to the relatives lor. Just throw a dinner and get over with it. Whole affair cost us 12k. No we didn't earn from ang baos.</p>
              <p>There was no debt either because we paid the hotel in cash.</p>
              <p>Btw just for your info, that is the dinner after ROM hor. Not the actual wedding dinner. My grandma asked if there is going to be a wedding dinner but I asked my mum to put it nicely to her that we complied with a dinner after ROM and no there won't be another typical Chinese wedding dinner.</p>
