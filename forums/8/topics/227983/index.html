            <div class='col-md body'>First off this is not just about "lol the Black Ranger is black". There is much more underlying meaning to the roles that were assigned to each specific ranger.<br><br>So lets start off with the most obvious. Yes the Black Ranger is black, but have you also noticed something else about the black ranger? His Zord is the mastadon, an animal with a gigantic trunk, further emphasizing the stereotype of the black male's genitalia being the biggest.<br><br>Next there is the Yellow Ranger. Not only is the yellow ranger asian but her Zord is the Sabre-tooth tiger, the tiger being a native of Asia. Her weapons were daggers but they also represent spades of the labor that rural asians must toil to make a living.<br><br>On to the Blue Ranger who was assigned to a nerdish guy because blue is the color of boys in our society. Also the Blue Rangers Zord was the Triceretops which is symbolic of having the third eye which is closely related to knowledge.<br><br>Then there is the Pink Ranger. Honestly all I've got to say is that Pink=girls and that her Zord formed the large chest of the MegaZord.<br><br>The Red Ranger was the leader of the pack. That was until it his job was taken by the White Ranger which is symbolic of the White Man taking away the Native's land.<br><br>Finally there is the Green Ranger which was chosen to represent the struggle of the Irish in America. When they first came to America they were though of as evil and then through hard work and determination they became one of the most badass cultures know to America that they even got their own holiday. The Irish were then accepted and were thought to be one with the White man in america. Later because everyone had lived there so long they were now the new natives. This brief history less goes through the origin of the Green Ranger through his transformation into the white ranger and then into the red ranger.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, let's do more with the weapons theme. The yellow ranger has already been covered, so I won't focus on her.<br><br>The black ranger had an axe, which is seen as a primitive tool. This is symbolic of negative stereotypes that Africans are stupid and unsophisticated.<br><br>The blue ranger had a staff, and the red ranger had a sword. Jason was a ladies man, but Billy was a total loser. This is represented by the fact that Jason uses a sharp weapon, whereas Billy uses a blunt one; sharpness here represents virility. Interestingly, Billy's weapon is actually larger, but he loses to Jason, who knows how to use his.<br><br>The pink ranger has a bow and arrows. The arrows, like the sword and staff, are phallic. However, the red and blue ranger have only one of their respective weapons, signifying that it is theirs; that is, the sword actually represents Jason's wang, and the staff represents Billy's. However, the pink ranger just goes through arrows without any regard, showing that she is willing to use as many men as she needs to in order to achieve her purposes. Thus, the stereotype of the manipulative female is reinforced.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Billy trident is only sharp at the tips, whereas Jason's sword is sharp all around. This is representative of the fact that Billy is a one trick pony (all he has is his intelligence), whereas Jason is a complete person, and that's why Jason gets the ladies. Jason's weapon allows him to kill many putties at once, whereas Billy is left to resort to clumsy thrusts at single targets.<br><br>Oh, I forgot about Tommy. His weapon was a single dagger, which was the smallest of all the guys' weapons, but he used it as a flute. And he was the one who got the girl.<br><br>Just goes to show you that girls go for effeminate artsy types.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I'd like to point that megazord, while in humanoid form, seems to point to a "pyramid" of economy. Notice how the triceratops and the sabretooth form the legs (bottom), as the foundation. They represent the opressed people at the offices, typing and writing day and night. Billy is the nerd of group, and Trinny is also of asian ancestry, which is in most cases, highly intelligent.<br><br>Mastodon forms the arms. This clearly points to the black man doing all sorts of manual labors.<br><br>Pterodactyl forms the chest, in the other words, the stereotype secretary that sleeps with her boss for a "higher position". This is further shown when T-rex (or the boss) folds under the pink zord.<br><br>The T-rex forms the "head" of the organization. Notice how the humanoid head shows a very wealthy face with a pair of expensive yellow shades.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>The creators thought they'd be even more clever when they brought out Power Rangers Zeo. Unlike before where the color symbolizes a deeper meaning, this time it has to do with the shapes that are portrayed on each Ranger.<br><br>First there was the Yellow Ranger who was a black female. Her symbol was the equal sign which represents the equality that both her race and gender are searching for.<br><br>The Red Ranger was gifted with the star. This just emphasizes the previous metaphors in that he is the badass leader and star of the show.<br><br>The Green Ranger was an asian. His symbol was the square/rectangle. This is to show the straight-edged ness of the Asian race and how they have a strong work ethic.<br><br>The Blue Ranger was represented with A triangle. In memory of the previous blue ranger they decided to give him an homage by symbolizing the eye of province. However they skrewed up when they gave the suit to the dumb jock stereotype of the show. After realizing this mistake they tried to cover it up by reversing the triangle and giving the more powerful Gold Ranger a Pyramid as a Zord.<br><br>Finally there is the pink ranger who had an oval shape for her ranger. This is to represent the shape of the pill she had to take everytime her and the red ranger were together after vanquishing evil.<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>The stereotyping also continues into Turbo, especially the second half.<br><br>First, there was TJ, the red ranger. He was african-american. He was the leader of the group. You could say that the Power Rangers are a gang, and TJ is the leader of the gang, showing how blacks are usually gangsters. Also, in a way, he overthrew the old leader of the rangers, showing how african-americans tend to be violent.<br><br>Second was Carlos, the Green Ranger. He was hispanic. His zord was a dumptruck, which often times carries around dirt, which represents how hispanics are often seen working in dirt areas such as farms.<br><br>Next, there's the Korean-American pink ranger: Cassie. This is a little less obvious. We all know about how North Korea is communist, right? Who else used to be Communist? Russia. Russians are red. In a way, Cassie is almost red, but she lives in America, a mainly white society, so her red background blends in the white society she lives in and creates pink.<br><br>Ashley was the yellow ranger. She was caucasian. Her rescue zord was the Star Racer Rescuezord. The name alone represents a stereotype of how many young caucasian girls see themselves as the brightest things in everyone's life, much like stars.<br><br>Finally, we have Justin, the blue ranger and the youngest of the group. He is also caucasian. His blue suit represents many things. First of all, he is seen as a copy of Billy, a former blue ranger. Also, blue = boy. Also, blue tends to be a symbol of peace. Justin is the most childish ranger. So, in a way, he could be seen as the least violent.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Err... That's no need to think so much about Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Simply because this show is created from stock footage from the original show which is a Japanese cartoon show titled Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger which is part of a long running series named SuperSentai just like Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is part of the Power Rangers series. So all the Zords and weapons and stuff were the Japanese's ideas. I doubt the American producers could have any influence on the Japanese producers and i do not think that they would deliberately portray the things you have described.</div>
