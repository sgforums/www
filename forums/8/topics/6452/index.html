            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>I just offer what my thoughts are watching the movie American Beauty three weeks back. Frankly, the movie is interesting for the underlying themes which it tried to bring people into attention, and the other thing is to probe into the present American culture. Almost all the Americans which I have encountered in my university said that the movie is the best movie because of the issues of modern day US are brought in by a dysfunctional family with Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening as the lead characters.<br><br>There are 2 themes which I find appealing to : the first, things are not as they seem to be. Communication between people in the modern world has more or less blurred despite there are many tools of communication from the internet to the phone yet they do not achieved proper interaction, because of the very human fallacies like shileding of truths, scheming against one another, and the inability to confront the other party when in doubt. Sometimes if we assumed a certain frame of reality where there is something which is happening but we just convince ourselves to see our mode of reality. This is demostrated by the Colonel who saw things in a different light, where the truth was not what it turned out to be. Moderation and not pushing things to extremes as to kill, seem to show us how we tackle issues these days. Perhaps, we are a civilization under the guise of brutal savagery living inside us.<br><br>The second theme is that we could still find the moment to appreciate small things in our lives, in the midst of the chaos and problems of modern society. The example of the fluttering plastic bag outside a garage filmed in the movie wasa very good example. Our lives are so busy now that we could hardly find the time to smell the roses and appreciate the small things which we have.<br><br>Lastly, I felt that the fate of Kevin Spacey a comical tragedy. Perhaps, it is not good for me to disclose what happened in the end. Well, I would say that this movie is not about American culture alone, but seeks to send the messages about how the modern society has changed in terms of the face of technology and domestic affairs, but not in the good and bad traits of Man.<br><br>Being a movie critic, I give 8/10...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just caught the 9.15pm at lido. i really enjoyed the movie. what i have to say abt it tho might strike a chord more with those who have already watched it.<br><br>if you haven't watched the movie, DO NOT read this cos i'd prob reveal parts of the plot.<br><br>firstly, something frivolous. i thot the two nude scenes were important to the plot. the first one because it showed that jane had come to trust ricky. she had come to accept what he did (the filming) and wanted to be a part of it. it wasn't meant to be exhibitionist (tho i'm not complaining either way!).<br><br>the significance (not to mention the flow) of the second scene would have been lost if it had not been shown in its entirety. it showed the fragility of angela in her masquerade and pretence that she was a highly popular and liberated woman and revealed her vulnerability as well. if i hadn't been staring at her breasts so much, i'd also have realised that her nakedness was symbolic of her complete openness and honesty in admitting to lester that it was her first time. she was, so to speak, laying herself bare. and it added to the element of the heroic in lester for turning away what he had long coveted.<br><br>two parts of the movie spoke to me the most (at least for now). the first involves the plastic bag flapping in the breeze. and here is what i think it represents.<br><br>i think it was a commentary on beauty in life. the simple things in life i guess. or maybe abt the beauty of life itself. i see it as a reminder that going with the flow of life with all its ups and downs, not letting things upset you too easily and not trying to control things too much, are what one should do when confronted with life. "just enjoy the ride," seems to be what it's saying. lose yourself in living, in life, but don't let it overwhelm you. life should be as playful, as joyous as the bag in the breeze. and this much ricky believed, that the bag was calling out to him as if in an invitation to play along. because behind it all, behind all the turmoil and all the pain, as well as the joy and happiness, we should remember one thing: that everything will be alright. we'll all be okay. it's only life after all. and this is why ricky could stare death in the face and still find beauty. because everything will be alright with all of us, no matter what. there is something larger than us all taking good care of us. there is only life and yet there is more than life (and more to life).<br><br>the second thing that spoke to me most was the comment by angela: that it's terrible to be ordinary.<br><br>in her case, she wanted to stand out from the crowd and be popular and noticed. and i think there's an impt lesson to be learnt here. not that we should try to be extraordinary. not that it's futile to try. but that in being what lester became (at the end), he was being extraordinary in an ordinary way. cos being ordinary, like the rest of us, means to let things bother you<br>and to get too caught up with the daily worries of life (like not spilling champagne on the couch), to not live life and to take it too seriously .....like most of us. being ordinary in this way is a terrible thing.<br><br>ricky (like lester in the end) is the embodiment of what it means to live the enlightened life, the reflective life, to take a step back and to laugh at it all. he also embodies a certain measure of "structure" instilled into him by his disciplinarian father. a mixture of the dionysian and the appollonian, of immersion in life while maintaining a sense of calm and peace and distance and order.<br><br>the message behind american beauty is relevant to us all. not just to americans. we should learn to see things in perspective and to realise, as lester says in the closing scene, that it's only our own silly little lives we are talking abt. if we don't understand him, he assures us that some day we will. and hopefully when we come to understand him, it'd truly be the very first day of the rest of our lives....   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by ray (edited 09 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's remarkable that any movie that's so ambitious and angry -- and that treats ordinary American life so seriously -- made it through the mainstream production channels in the first place. Plenty of "independent" films aren't half this daring. For all its flaws, "American Beauty" offers one of the best ensemble casts you'll see in any American movie this year. Side by side with its false notes and awkward missteps, it has moments of startling pathos and piercing, painful hilarity.<br><br>"American Beauty" is a comedy because we laugh at the absurdity of the hero's problems. And a tragedy because we can identify with his failure--not the specific details, but the general outline.<br><br>At certain moments, when Ricky is explaining to Jane why he videotaped a plastic bag blowing in the wind, the beauty of his poetic description merges with the visual beauty he's caught in the bag, and the film transcends itself. At other moments, when Mendes juxtaposes simpy Musak dinner music with a horrific, gut-wrenching fight at the dinner table, the effect is sharply tonic.<br><br>Though when I came out of the theatre none of my friends agreed that it is a good movie...but I give a thumbs up for this show for showing the reality of a typical American screwed-up family<br><br>------------------<br>Writing is a weapon that is more powerful than a man's fist.</div>

What do you think ?<br><br>I love the show, Lester is a wonderful actor. I watched it twice even.<br><br>Btw, has anyone watched Magnolia ? It is out in Singapore ? I think it is better than American Beauty.</div>
