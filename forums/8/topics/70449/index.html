            <div class='col-md body'>The means by which we choose to how we end our lives is very much dependent on the circumstances in which we were forced to make such a choice.<br><br>Is there a difference btw, mercy killing and suicice?<br><br>Euthanasia, is legalised in some countries in Europe, as much as it is supported, there are similar groups of activitists trying to make it illegal..<br><br>When we talk about human rights, does that include the right to end one's life? I believe a complete coverage of that should allow it to be so. Provided that the person seeking to end his life is of a SOUND mind. With a sound mind, no one will seek to terminate life as quickly if he/she weren't forced to such a choice.. i.e. (being in the final stages of a terminal disease that has no cure) In these situations, you will feel the pain in living more than the pain in dying. Because living on will just be pro-longing the pain which will inevitably lead to death. In such and such a case only, I feel mervy killing is justified.</div>
