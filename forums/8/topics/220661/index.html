            <div class='col-md body'>This is why government likes FTs.<br><br>They study and they also solve their own problems. FTs are self-reliant...<br><br><blockquote>Campus jealousy: Two fined $1,000 for beating up fellow student<br>The two bosom buddies thought victim was eyeing girlfriend of one<br>By Chong Chee Kin<br><br>A CASE of campus jealousy that spilled over into violence saw two young National University of Singapore (NUS) graduates fined the maximum $1,000 yesterday for beating up a fellow student in April last year.<br><br>Singapore permanent residents Jiao Guanxiong, 24, and Tao Lei, 23, were both studying at NUS on Ministry of Education (MOE) scholarships. Both are Chinese nationals.<br><br>Jiao, an engineer, was an active student leader in NUS, while Tao, who studied computing, is now a budding entrepreneur who recently snagged a $1.6 million investment deal for his Internet technology company. Both graduated this year.<br><br>Yesterday, the two bosom buddies were each fined $1,000 for beating up 23-year-old campus mate Zhang Liang, who they believed was trying to move in on Jiao's then-girlfriend, also an NUS undergraduate.<br><br>The court heard that Jiao and Tao had turned up at West Coast Park at around 11pm on April 22 last year to meet Mr Zhang.<br><br>Both Jiao and Tao had been unhappy with Mr Zhang for some time.<br><br>Jiao felt he had been pestering his 22-year-old girlfriend, while Tao believed that Mr Zhang had been bad-mouthing him.<br><br>When the three met at the park, a dispute soon broke out and the two fell upon Mr Zhang, raining punches on him and kicking him.<br><br>The youth was taken to the National University Hospital, where he was given outpatient treatment for cuts and bruises. Tao had a cut on his head.<br><br>Yesterday, their lawyers, Mr Subhas Anandan and Mr Sunil Sudheesan, blamed Mr Zhang for provoking the fight.<br><br>They claimed Mr Zhang hurled insults at them, laughed off their accusations and tried to intimidate them by making a telephone call summoning more people to come to the park to help him.<br><br>After the call, they claimed Mr Zhang pushed Tao, sparking a scuffle. Jiao said he leapt in only when Tao was hit in the head.<br><br>Mr Anandan said that after the fight, his clients helped their victim and even offered to take him to hospital.<br><br>However, Mr Zhang 'continued to posture aggressively and even challenged our clients to stay where they were if they were brave enough', the lawyer said.<br><br>Both young men, who received their permanent resident status only this year, were active in NUS activities and held leadership positions in university clubs, the lawyer said.<br><br>They declined to comment after their sentencing.<br><br>Each could have been jailed for up to a year. </blockquote></div>
