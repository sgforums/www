            <div class='col-md body'>Dear aunt agony,<br><br>I used to visit this particular forum where I made a lot of friends.. However, due to my straight-forward character and blunt ways of talking, I've offended numerous forumers.. I would love to meet them up but I guessed its not possible now as I've received feedbacks from some of them that they will not hesitate to bash and whack me up if they are presented a chance..<br><br>At times, I pondered over the freedom of speech that forums usually offers.. its irony that certain topic is considered taboo and being the person that I am, I was always at the receiving end.. I could be tactful and selective with my topics but then again it defeats the purpose of participating in a forum whereby you can have discussion of anything under the sun..<br><br>And sure enough I was asked to leave from that particular forum.. Not that I mind though, I enjoyed the solitude and quiet reflection being free from forum has given me.. but I can't help but feel sad that freedom of speech remains a myth even in the forums..<br><br>Other than that, there will be times when a seemingly harmless discussion will turn into an ugly battlefield.. I jolly well know that different people from different walks of life offers different opinon in life.. but to turn it into senseless onslaught, bringing parents and personal attacks on the particular forumite is plain downright despicable and shallow.. Its funny why some  degenerate forumers claim to be so well educated when the direction of their characters suggested otherwise..<br><br>I appeal to forumers in this forum, as I am new here, is it the same with sgforums as well? Is that the reason why more people are turning to blogs rather than forums?</div>
