            <div class='col-md body'>I do have a question for any Muslim reader here.....<br><br><strong>Mohammed</strong> is one of the most common Muslim name in the world...... If I could gather 100 Muslim in a room, chances are that 20-30% will be named <strong>Mohammed</strong>. If that is the case, why is it so wrong to name a toy bear <strong>Mohammed</strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> I believed the teacher didn't said that the toy bear is named after the <span style="color: blue;"><strong>Prophet of Islam</strong></span>.... <span style="color: red;"><strong>if she did, then it would indeed be wrong</strong></span>. But if countless millions Muslim Boy could be named <strong>Mohammed</strong>..... why not a Toy Bear <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br><strong>I don't mean to offends any Muslim here..... just like to know better the reason.
