It really ain't about the Jews nor do all latter revelations regarding Jews spoke bad of them.<br><br>The allusion for the deceitful conversion of the Jews has no bearing lah, especially when it has been said to let the People of the Book judge in accordance to their own books and more. Muhammad made the migration to Medina not because of the Jews but because of the persecution of the pagan Quraish tribe.<br><br>Now, if you accept the premise that Muhammad is a messenger from God, one of his purpose was to address the former monotheists to revisit their own theological histories and their relationship with God. <span style="font-style: italic;">I should add that his addresses are only meant for those who lived in his time and place because they are very circumstantial.</span> And it appears that some Jews didn't observe the Sabbath, or even worshipped somebody(?) called Ezra, etc.<br><br>Thats about it. Context.<br><br>Accusation of corrupting God's word is nothing new.<br>"for ye have perverted the words of the living God" - Jeremiah.<br><br>Why must hate Jews? *Shrugs* As another muslim, I've got no problem with the Jews. Why must hate Israel? Sometimes, the politics in the middle east are somehow exported through my religion.<br><br>I see Ibn Kathir's tasfir is quoted.

Moderates understand the historical context in which they were written in and seek to mould and apply the teachings into the modern context. Extremists or some say fundamentalists choose to interpret the holy texts literally as they are without consideration for contexts etc.<br><br>It is just like how 2 different groups of people can choose to use a knife. One group decides to make it useful and cook stuffs. The other chooses to use it as a weapon. Get the idea?<br><br>There's no point being confrontational here as nothing will occur and everyone will just feel pissed with a sour taste in their mouths.<br><br>Let's face it, religion was never an easy issue to being with. Let's not make a discussion about a potentially thorny quagmire degenerate into chaos. Let's maintain our sanity and try to navigate discussion out of harm's way.<br><br>We need to have a basic concensus that we are discussing about religions and not in anyway attacking any particular religion. People with questions phrase them in a rational way and not resort to sweeping generalisations. People with answers can choose to address the questions one by one. We are trying to have constructive intellectual debate here, not trying to destroy or defend one's religion.<br><br>People who are out to attack a religion or out to dismiss any semblance of debate, sorry I think your place is either in the Salafi/Wahabi schools in Saudi Arabia or the Christian fundamentalist groups in USA. Please know that many people hold religion very very dear to themselves and any unqualified attack on any religion is likely to rile even the most peaceful and moderate worshipper, regardless of religion.<br><br>That's why above all: Peace to all religions! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Political agendas are what fuels fundamental Islam.  We cannot just look at the powerful one-liners form the Quran and ignore the people manipulating it.  Without the political agenda's, they are mere contradictions.  It is people who use them to manipulate the faith of believers to commit atrocious acts.<br><br>Ideas on their own, aren't dangerous.  Its the people with the ideas that are.<br><br>Recorded history of military conflicts tells of how armies who believe they have a divine appointment to crush kill and destroy in the name of their faiths often managed to do so.  "If God is for us, who the hell can be against us?"<br><br>The mind is a powerful thing.  Yet easily perverted and warped. It sees the world through a straw, you change the shape of the straw, you will change the shape of the mind.<br><br>The media often says that the War on terror, on radical Islam is a clash of Ideology.   Personally I don't buy that.   It is a clash of political agenda, of interests fueled by the lust for power.<br><br>Radical Islam is but a tool, an asymmetric counter balance to the Regiments, Divisions and Battalions of the West. Find someone who has nothing, tell him his has nothing to live for, but divine purpose to die for.  Strap him with a bomb, and he becomes a force multiplier of deadly proportions.</div>

Not everything in the Internet are lies and not everything in the Holy-books are true. To know the truth, you must know the very beginning of events ... and that is history.  Unless you are part of the event or witness to that event it is a fallacy to claim that you know the truth or otherwise.<br>Allah is a diety, that's what the Muslim texts said. But to Muslims and non-Muslims - Allah is God.  Same thing when you ask the fishermen - the diety they make offerings to each time before they go out to seas is also god to them. The Buddhists, Christians, Hindus - all have and believed in dieties - though they are called by different names!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I grew up in a kampong, get along very well with anyone of any faith. Even Muslims. There were Malays, and Indian Muslims. We get along well with the latter more  than the Malays.<br>My first encounter with Muslim hypocrisy was when I started working. Muslim colleagues, I noticed would make jokes about other's religious practices, but would be extremely offended when another joke about Islam. They would tout the Quran as the most accurate book, and the Bible as corrupted. But I come to a conclusion otherwise, from their behaviour, (adultery was lauded, and Golok to legalise it), from events in Iran, (the acts of the Ayatollah and clerics there, the fatwa of Salman Rushdie).<br>The current state of affairs, only reinstate my belief that Islam is not from a divine source. Islamic killings in Algeria and Egypt, 911, Pakistan mob actions, beheadings,  events in Malaysia, all only confirm my belief. Not influence me.<br>Islam is a cult of violence, with a promise of peace, if... and only if one capitulates to the Muslims.<br>Here is one verse, which bring to my mind what the Taliban did recently.<br><span style="color: green;">047.004<br>YUSUFALI: Therefore, when ye meet the Unbelievers (in fight), smite at their necks; At length, when ye have thoroughly subdued them, bind a bond firmly (on them): thereafter (is the time for) either generosity or ransom: Until the war lays down its burdens. Thus (are ye commanded): but if it had been Allah's Will, He could certainly have exacted retribution from them (Himself); but (He lets you fight) in order to test you, some with others. But those who are slain in the Way of Allah,- He will never let their deeds be lost.<br>PICKTHAL: Now when ye meet in battle those who disbelieve, then it is smiting of the necks until, when ye have routed them, then making fast of bonds; and afterward either grace or ransom till the war lay down its burdens. That (is the ordinance). And if Allah willed He could have punished them (without you) but (thus it is ordained) that He may try some of you by means of others. And those who are slain in the way of Allah, He rendereth not their actions vain.<br>SHAKIR: So when you meet in battle those who disbelieve, then smite the necks until when you have overcome them, then make (them) prisoners, and afterwards either set them free as a favor or let them ransom (themselves) until the war terminates. That (shall be so); and if Allah had pleased He would certainly have exacted what is due from them, but that He may try some of you by means of others; and (as for) those who are slain in the way of Allah, He will by no means allow their deeds to perish.</span><br><br>As I have said earlier, what I post is my own formulation from over the years.<br>And I have only said one aspect of my opinion, I have not brought out some hadith and comment on it.<br>I do not believe the Quran has divine origins or inspirations.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok... Simple question... If Islam is the violent religion you said it to be, why is Lee Hsien Loong letting muslims handle SAR-21 and Tarus 85?<br><br>If you walk down the street and see a muslim NPCO or CISCO, do you fear that he has 10 bullets, 5 loaded and 5 in speed loader?<br><br>Come on man, you your brain. All the violence that happened in the world is because of some political agenda. And when muslims are involved, the fact that they are muslim are magnified way more than their political agenda.<br><br>And if you read closely and the line you copied and paste, it has there the word, "IN BATTLE". The thing that made Islam sound like a violent religion is because it has rules of engagement unlike other religions. It gives us the go ahead if we are attacked. Ya know, like a police is authorized to shoot down a suspect when there's a deadly threat.<br><br>ANd terrorist around the world are twisting this rule to attack instead of defend. And people are believing the terrorist are really basing their action on the Quran when its actually their twisted interpretations.<br><br>Singapore is a land of Racial and Religious harmony.

            <div class='col-md body'>Politics and Religion have always been used for and against each other.  There is no doubt that events that happened in Middle-East have its root in ancient history - like chosen people, promised land, etc. My point has always been this: THINK and do not BELIEVE blindly. The 'holy' books were written by humans, definitely not words of god!  All the claims of prophets, messiahs, popes, charlatans, clergies, imans, moonies, healers, etc. can only be taken with a pinch of salt.  They are all humans and humans are the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">least reliable</span></strong> creatures on earth!  I would rather place my trust on a cat, parrot, mouse, dog than to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">totally</span> placed my trust on human. Only the naive and the world is full of them believed so.<br>It all boils down to our EGO and SELFISHNESS.  That desire to be superior, to control, to lord over - MY god is greater than your god, MY race is more superior, MY language is the language, MY one is the ONE.<br>Like I said before, morality has been thrown out of churches, temples and mosques. All they are interested is to increase their membership so that they can claim to have the LARGEST following, the LARGEST church, temple, mosque, etc. You see all of these, yet you are blind and deny the very existence of this hypocrisy. There will be no end to this because a sucker is born every minute who will eventually pepertuate and cycle the same old story.</div>
