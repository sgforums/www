            <div class='col-md body'>I suggest all of you watch The History Channel (on SCV) documentary on Prophet Muhammad to get a clearer and accurate views of Islam and Prophet Muhammad. There's also a good explanation on what Jihad is all about. They also explained why Osama Bin Laden is the worst Muslim alive. The panelist consists of a team of Researchers and Professors (both Muslims and Non-Muslims).<br><br>The documentary just ended at 11.50am just now. I'm sure there's a repeat.<br><br>And to Muslims watching, don't worry. There's no image or picture or graphical representation of our Prophet.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
