Then they established their own country there.<br><br>Because of this land grab, until today there are millions of Palestinian refugees in the neighbouring countries such as Jordan and Syria, and the many Arabs who still stay in that area become second-class citizens in Israel.<br><br>Among the rules practiced in Isreal, is that no inter-racial marriage between a Jew and an Arab is allowed. Meanwhile, Jews from all over the world are automatically invited and can become citizens in Israel.<br><br>Because of this territorial/ political upheaval, many Arabs feel deep resentment towards Israel and Jews. For Palestinians and many other Arabs, they see themselves as being opressed, and their cause, as a liberation cause.<br><br>The world has watched all this with open eyes and has repeatedly issued UN Resolutions, only to have them vetoed again and again by USA.<br><br>The main reasoning for the Jews, is that they want to have their own country, they were traumatized after racial targetting by Nazi Europe during WW2, and they bring up their scriptures to pinpoint Israel as their ancestral homeland.<br><br>So, after WW2, they go about doing this project. But, the local Arabs have to be the unfortunate victims to fulfill this project for them.<br><br>Because of this, I myself personally have negative impression towards Israel.<br><br>Even though I am a Catholic, and as a child I read about Jews being 'the chosen race' in my Bible and having positive impression towards Israel, the current modern behaviour of Israel has left me with an ever increasing negative impression.<br><br>Meat Pao. </div></blockquote>Meat pao is a Catholic?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

Sometimes through translation, some of the meanings have being altered. Anyway, regardless of whether the Qu'ran has this ideology or not, ultimately it is up to the Muslims to interprete and think for themselves.<br>I still feel the ideology "there should be only one religion in the world - Islam" disturbing.</div>

Plus the USA and other nations have named many Islamic militant organisations who are fighting for independent Islamic states around the world as terrorists organisation.<br><br>Eg included Islamic militant groups in southern Philipines, Aceh Indonesia, Chechenya in Russia, western XiangJiang province in China.

            <div class='col-md body'>The UN thing.....first we must understand, the workings behind the doors.....USA and Britain pushed the UN to issue the decision to 'give' Israel to the Jews. The UN is not an 'equal' representation of the world community. Even until today USA and Britain can push their own interests, such as condeming Iran, or continously vetoing resolutions deemed negative towards Israel.<br><br>When a country make a nuisance, supposedly the UN can scold that country. But what if the culprit is a veto-wielding Big 5? Who can scold? What to do?<br><br>When resolutions condemning Israel is always vetoed by USA, what to do? Can you make a second UN?<br><br>For me, one thing I dont really understand is this......<br><br>Supposedly Europe in the past was anti Jewish...and even had Nazism which targetted Jews....<br><br>If this is true, Caucasians dislike Jews....then how come starting from that period onwards, until today, USA and Britain always protect Israel.....why..? This is one thing I dont understand.<br><br>What is the benefit for USA and Britain....to keep protecting Israel, getting involved in Middle-East.....<br><br>Most of the Americans/ Brits descended from Anglo-Saxon and Germanic peoples and mixed pan-European ancestry....the same peoples that supposedly oppressed Jews in Europe.<br><br>So......I dont understand....how can ur grandparents hated one race, but now u love that race.<br><br>I have a feeling this has to do with guilt....but I dont know how true this is. One of Israel's closest ally now apart from USA/ Britain is Germany.<br><br>Nevertheless........<br><br>It is not right to correct a past mistake by passing the buck to the Arabs and making them the next oppressed people.<br><br>Meat Pao.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why I keep talking from political angle....because I believe, at the heart of the issue, is political/ territorial/ nationalistic problem.....that is the reason, not religious reason.<br><br>Nowadays we live in 21st century. Who is so religious anymore? Who spend many hours praying and studying the scriptures everyday? Who launch wars because of theological disagreements?<br><br>Do you think, that the wars are because of theological disagreement? Religious reasons? To convert people...? Any of such reasons?<br><br>Southern Thai....Southern Philliphines......are these really religious rebellion? Or rather territorial/ ethno-centric/ nationalistic/ political? Which one is more apt?<br><br>What do say about Acehnese fighting fellow Muslims?<br><br>In parts of India, rebels fighting fellow Hindus?<br><br>Even in Europe...such as ETA.....fighting fellow Christians?<br><br>When we look at the rebellions....wars....conflicts....in the world...they are all territorial/ political/ ethno-centric/ nationalistic. A feeling of injustice or resentment make them happen. A difference in religion between the 2 warring parties may or may not exist. It can be an extra factor which add to the feeling of ill-will, but not the main reason, and not in the sense, it is a scripture-based/ theological based war. So therefore there is no 'religious' war.<br><br>Meat Pao.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i was actually offended by some of the comments being made here, though i cant provide actual evidence here. it is up to individual whether he or she wants to assume or get the facts right.<br><br>I'm a moderate muslim. I myself have questions about my own religion. but one thing that i will never question is my own faith. faith and teachings and impressions are totally diferent meanings. the verse, Islam should be the only religion in the world, is totally incomplete. forumers here should read more in depth what it means rather than jump to conclusions in just a verse.<br><br>if you all must know, Muhammad PBUH has always been patient eventhough being provoked. He hid in a mountain when the Quraisy pple are looking to kill him. never in his life he wanted to kill anyone. he will pray for those even who disliked him so that they will be granted heaven.<br><br>we don't hate jews, we just dislike the way things are carried out by them. hate and dislike are 2 different meanings. do you think by killing them is a better option? read the Quran properly before you pose a question. In Islam, you are not even allowed to kill an ant without a valid reason! they are God's creature.<br><br>Why do Muslims back then killed pple? it is because pple criticized Allah and his religion. They don't mean to kill but only to defend. and if you must know, there is a story about this. Moreover, if a Muslim happened to slay a person, he must bear all responsiblites that the person left. the person might have a family, he must educate, provide necessaties to them.<br><br>in Islam, you have the right to choose the path in which you want to be. be a non-muslim if you want, but still you have to respect Islam and other religions you chose to be in faith with.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The current situation about religious conflict is in a sense, politcal struggles packaged and jumbled up with religious wrapping paper.<br><br>As to why USA supports Israel time and time again? The Jewish lobby in US is very very powerful. If they dislike a president, he can kiss the White House goodbye.<br><br>In fact, distilling all the factors and situation, you will realise that actually Osama and his Al-Qaeda Inc. has a political motive, that is to topple the Al-Saud regime ruling Saudi Arabia. He views them as corrupt and inept, unworthy Muslim rulers of the land of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.<br><br>Why does he hate the USA so much? It does not take an idiot to figure out that one of the biggest supporter of the Al-Saud family in Saudi Arabia is the USA because of oil interests. In fact, declassified documents showed that Osama offered the Saudi government the help of his mujahideen warriors to fight back Saddam's army in Gulf War 1. However, history showed that Cheney beat him to the offer (yes the very same D1ck in White House today). Feeling aggrieved that D1ck Cheney didn't abide by the agreement to pull US troops out of Saudi Arabia after Gulf War 1, Osama felt that only by attaacking the USA, the real supporter of the Al-Saud regime, will he be able to topple the regime, which is really what he wants.<br><br>Politcal or religious? Of course, Bush Jr has been, inadvertently or delibrate, helping the cause of Osama and Co. by going in guns blazing into Iraq.<br><br>It's all political. Religion is merely the wrapping paper.<br><br>And before you criticise or make any allegations about any religion, please do know the implication of what you are saying. On the Internet, there are various anti-Islam sites, videos and texts but view them with a critical and discerning eye. That day I was viewing videos by this user on YouTube called OneLessMuslim. On the surface, the videos are seemingly trying to uncover the 'injustices' of Islam. On further scrutiny, I realised that it was just an overelaborate PR package by evangelical Christian groups in trying to convince Muslims to convert to Christianity.<br><br>The Internet is a scary place, eh? Never trust your sources blindly.<br><br>FYI, I am not a Muslim, but I feel that they have been unfairly victimised in the past few years, especially the moderates. These are the people whom we must not lose in the battle for minds, hearts and souls.</div>

Oh, maybe it is time to give Singapore back to its original settlers too.<br><br>By the way, when the Hebrews went to the promised land given to them by God, there were already settlers there...so the Jews were not original settlers.  After they have established their land, they were then conquered by the Babylonians, the Persians, and finally conquered and  crushed by the Romans and the people were disperse all over the world.  The nation of Israel was no more.  Other inhabitants moved in and they were there for hundreds of years, then the weak United Nations, under the influence of USA and UK, created a nation for the Jews, taking away the lands of the Palestinians who have been there for generations, and drove them out.<br>Wonder how you would feel if you were ordered by government to give up your home so that the former tenants can come back to stay in your house.</div>
