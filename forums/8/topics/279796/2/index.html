Mainly because whenever there are terrorists attacks or Muslims riots, the news used the term 'jihad'.

God does not love the transgressors. Kill them wherever you find them and drive them out [of the place] from which they drove you out and [remember] persecution is worse than carnage. But do not initiate war with them near the Holy Kabah unless they attack you there. But if they attack you, put them to the sword [without any hesitation]. Thus shall such disbelievers be rewarded. However, if they desist [from this disbelief], Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. Keep fighting against them, until persecution does not remain and AllahÂ’s religion reigns supreme. But if they mend their ways, then [you should know that] an offensive is only allowed against the evil-doers. A sacred month for a sacred month; [similarly] other sacred things too are subject to retaliation. So if any one transgresses against you, you should also pay back in equal coins. Have fear of Allah and [keep in mind that] Allah is with those who remain within the bounds [stipulated by religion].<br><br>i got this off wiki.</div></blockquote>I always knew one day something like this will reach Singapore...<br><br>Well, 1st things 1st...<br><a href="http://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/noframes/ch6.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/noframes/ch6.html</a><br>This is Surah 6 from The Quran...<br><br>you try ctrl+f the word "war" or "fight" and see if you can find them...<br><br>2nd, Don't get quotation of the quran from wiki or any other site without refering to the Quran itself 1st.
