What I post, is my own personal convictions, from various sources, mostly from newspapers, TV news, internet, magazines, books and my own eyes.<br>Basically they are my own observation, and I am expressing my dissapointment with Islam more than anything else.<br>Separating it from divinity will make sense to me of the actions of Muslims around the world.<br><br>Arabic is an ambigious language. Even native Arabic speakers are confounded sometimes.<br><br>The term Allah derived from a pagan term refering to the moon god in days before Islam.<br><br>I distinctly remember seeing the verse to kill Jews and Christians, but I can't locate it now.<br><br>Here are some verses from the Quran which I found. These are of course, selective, but together with other verses in the entire book, they could become potent, to someone indoctrinated and stripped of his humanity.<br>Bear in mind these are translation by scholars who are known to tone down the expressions used.<br><br>009.005<br>YUSUFALI: But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, an seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war); but if they repent, and establish regular prayers and practise regular charity, then open the way for them: for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.<br>PICKTHAL: Then, when the sacred months have passed, slay the idolaters wherever ye find them, and take them (captive), and besiege them, and prepare for them each ambush. But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then leave their way free. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.<br>SHAKIR: So when the sacred months have passed away, then slay the idolaters wherever you find them, and take them captives and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush, then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, leave their way free to them; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.<br><br>047.004<br>YUSUFALI: Therefore, when ye meet the Unbelievers (in fight), smite at their necks; At length, when ye have thoroughly subdued them, bind a bond firmly (on them): thereafter (is the time for) either generosity or ransom: Until the war lays down its burdens. Thus (are ye commanded): but if it had been Allah's Will, He could certainly have exacted retribution from them (Himself); but (He lets you fight) in order to test you, some with others. But those who are slain in the Way of Allah,- He will never let their deeds be lost.<br>PICKTHAL: Now when ye meet in battle those who disbelieve, then it is smiting of the necks until, when ye have routed them, then making fast of bonds; and afterward either grace or ransom till the war lay down its burdens. That (is the ordinance). And if Allah willed He could have punished them (without you) but (thus it is ordained) that He may try some of you by means of others. And those who are slain in the way of Allah, He rendereth not their actions vain.<br>SHAKIR: So when you meet in battle those who disbelieve, then smite the necks until when you have overcome them, then make (them) prisoners, and afterwards either set them free as a favor or let them ransom (themselves) until the war terminates. That (shall be so); and if Allah had pleased He would certainly have exacted what is due from them, but that He may try some of you by means of others; and (as for) those who are slain in the way of Allah, He will by no means allow their deeds to perish.<br><br>004.081<br>YUSUFALI: They have "Obedience" on their lips; but when they leave thee, a section of them Meditate all night on things very different from what thou tellest them. But Allah records their nightly (plots): So keep clear of them, and put thy trust in Allah, and enough is Allah as a disposer of affairs.<br>PICKTHAL: And they say: (It is) obedience; but when they have gone forth from thee a party of them spend the night in planning other than what thou sayest. Allah recordeth what they plan by night. So oppose them and put thy trust in Allah. Allah is sufficient as Trustee.<br>SHAKIR: And they say: Obedience. But when they go out from your presence, a party of them decide by night upon doing otherwise than what you say; and Allah writes down what they decide by night, therefore turn aside from them and trust in Allah, and Allah is sufficient as a protector.<br>004.082<br>YUSUFALI: Do they not consider the Qur'an (with care)? Had it been from other Than Allah, they would surely have found therein Much discrepancy.<br>PICKTHAL: Will they not then ponder on the Qur'an? If it had been from other than Allah they would have found therein much incongruity.<br>SHAKIR: Do they not then meditate on the Quran? And if it were from any other than Allah, they would have found in it many a discrepancy.<br><br>002.006<br>YUSUFALI: As to those who reject Faith, it is the same to them whether thou warn them or do not warn them; they will not believe.<br>PICKTHAL: As for the Disbelievers, Whether thou warn them or thou warn them not it is all one for them; they believe not.<br>SHAKIR: Surely those who disbelieve, it being alike to them whether you warn them, or do not warn them, will not believe.<br>__________________________________________<br><br>Rightly or wrong, what I say are my own sentiments.<br>No further discussion on it will be carried out by me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Although the bitter relationship has some scripture-based roots.....the current bad modern relationship is affected mainly by territorial/ political conflict.<br><br>Namely, Jews from around the world came to Palestine and warred against the native locals, chasing them out. Then they established their own country there.<br><br>Because of this land grab, until today there are millions of Palestinian refugees in the neighbouring countries such as Jordan and Syria, and the many Arabs who still stay in that area become second-class citizens in Israel.<br><br>Among the rules practiced in Isreal, is that no inter-racial marriage between a Jew and an Arab is allowed. Meanwhile, Jews from all over the world are automatically invited and can become citizens in Israel.<br><br>Because of this territorial/ political upheaval, many Arabs feel deep resentment towards Israel and Jews. For Palestinians and many other Arabs, they see themselves as being opressed, and their cause, as a liberation cause.<br><br>The world has watched all this with open eyes and has repeatedly issued UN Resolutions, only to have them vetoed again and again by USA.<br><br>The main reasoning for the Jews, is that they want to have their own country, they were traumatized after racial targetting by Nazi Europe during WW2, and they bring up their scriptures to pinpoint Israel as their ancestral homeland.<br><br>So, after WW2, they go about doing this project. But, the local Arabs have to be the unfortunate victims to fulfill this project for them.<br><br>Because of this, I myself personally have negative impression towards Israel.<br><br>Even though I am a Catholic, and as a child I read about Jews being 'the chosen race' in my Bible and having positive impression towards Israel, the current modern behaviour of Israel has left me with an ever increasing negative impression.<br><br>Meat Pao.</div>

The Jews were <strong>kicked out</strong> of the land even though they were the original inhabitants of it. The United Nations just gave them back a small portion of what they lost because Jews didn't have their own country, they were spread out over the Middle-East. Guess the Arabs didn't want to share though.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Before I give my stand, please be reminded that I believe in no religion and is purely a middle man. I still believe in "Blasphemy is a victim-less crime."<br><br>Anyway, this sort of situation always happen. A few blacksheeps of an organization/religion or whatsoever does something stupid and the blame is pushed to the organization/religion.<br><br>So far, I've only found one religion that agrees to chaos. But it's dead now. Most of the religion in Singapore promotes peace. Words from "holy" books (bible, Quran) can be interpreted from many ways, this explains why many can give the excuse "in the name of God".<br><br>Some truly believe that their own God wanted to kill those "unclean" people. Some are just abusing the religion as a shield or way to recruit more people into their terrorizing crime. Only the gullible will believe in their crap.<br><br>I personally don't like religions (Muslim as well) as at all, they serve man like blinders serve horses, but I hate it when people do not understand about the truth and spread false and DESTRUCTIVE rumors about it.<br><br>And to those who are trying to discredit religions because they don't believe what they teach to their followers, please stop your retarded and fcked up actions as others are viewing your religions in the same way.<br><br>Respect others and others will respect yours.</div>
