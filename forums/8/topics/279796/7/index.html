There is no doubt that events that happened in Middle-East have its root in ancient history - like chosen people, promised land, etc. My point has always been this: THINK and do not BELIEVE blindly. The 'holy' books were written by humans, definitely not words of god!  All the claims of prophets, messiahs, popes, charlatans, clergies, imans, moonies, healers, etc. can only be taken with a pinch of salt.  They are all humans and humans are the [b]<span style="text-decoration: underline;">least reliable</span></strong> creatures on earth!  I would rather place my trust on a cat, parrot, mouse, dog than to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">totally</span> placed my trust on human. Only the naive and the world is full of them believed so.<br>It all boils down to our EGO and SELFISHNESS.  That desire to be superior, to control, to lord over - MY god is greater than your god, MY race is more superior, MY language is the language, MY one is the ONE.<br>Like I said before, morality has been thrown out of churches, temples and mosques. All they are interested is to increase their membership so that they can claim to have the LARGEST following, the LARGEST church, temple, mosque, etc. You see all of these, yet you are blind and deny the very existence of this hypocrisy. There will be no end to this because a sucker is born every minute who will eventually pepertuate and cycle the same old story.[/b]</blockquote><img src="http://www.trickstutorials.com/forum/images/smilies/thumbsup.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This world will see Peace only when the notion of God, the One and only One, etc. is debunked. There is no God. Man created God.<br>If you are serious about religion, then you must read history, anthropology and sociology. Throw out theology - it is just crap. Open your mind, do a comparative study, explore, search, research.  Don't shut your mind, follow blindly a faith, go by family tradition, or subject to peer pressure. Most people who professed a religion actually know very little or if they do, simply learned by heart the bible, quran or sutra. These people can quote practically every word, verse and chapter of these 'holy' scriptures or books. But they all lacked one thing - common sense! When you put everything together, it seems that they all copy one another, twist them to suit their agenda or purpose and sell it to the masses like opium.<br>Remember this: if there is really a God, omnipotent and creator of all things - He will be greatly saddened by the madness of human, the atrocities and inhumanities that are worse than any beast. It will be one of His greatest regret and surely it is within His Power to end it! But alas, there is no God. Man created the God to serve its own selfish purpose.<br>Note: I am talking about God, not about the philosophies of Buddha, Jesus, Confuscius, Aristotle or Mohammed. While some of the afore-mentioned became the 'founder' of present day religions, they are all humans, not god, not angels, not son of god, not the messiah or prophet or messenger of god. They invoked god, so that what they taught or said have credence. Today, you can also hear or see people doing the same but without much success. They can only be successful if they resort to evangelism, colonisation and forced conversion, and terrorism!!!</div>

Man created God.<br>If you are serious about religion, then you must read history, anthropology and sociology. Throw out theology - it is just crap. Open your mind, do a comparative study, explore, search, research.  Don't shut your mind, follow blindly a faith, go by family tradition, or subject to peer pressure. Most people who professed a religion actually know very little or if they do, simply learned by heart the bible, quran or sutra. These people can quote practically every word, verse and chapter of these 'holy' scriptures or books. But they all lacked one thing - common sense! When you put everything together, it seems that they all copy one another, twist them to suit their agenda or purpose and sell it to the masses like opium.<br>Remember this: if there is really a God, omnipotent and creator of all things - He will be greatly saddened by the madness of human, the atrocities and inhumanities that are worse than any beast. It will be one of His greatest regret and surely it is within His Power to end it! But alas, there is no God. Man created the God to serve its own selfish purpose.<br><strong>Note: I am talking about God, not about the philosophies of Buddha, Jesus, Confuscius, Aristotle or Mohammed. While some of the afore-mentioned became the 'founder' of present day religions, they are all humans, not god, not angels, not son of god, not the messiah or prophet or messenger of god.</strong> They invoked god, so that what they taught or said have credence. Today, you can also hear or see people doing the same but without much success. They can only be successful if they resort to evangelism, colonisation and forced conversion, and terrorism!!!</blockquote>you speak of not to believe but you sure sound like a preacher..<br>becareful of what u preach though.. as a fellow human(yes you), you dun really have the right or the insight to say what is and what is not.. who is and who is not..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
