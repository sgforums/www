            <div class='col-md body'>I feel that it's just the evil in the people themselves, nothing to do with religion. They just need a good reason to be evil, so they claim it's for their gods....<br><br>I have many nice Muslim friends, really great people. They are very strong Muslims, and i believe that's what makes them wonderful people... Religion, if followed correctly, will always lead you on right path... So it's the people, not the religion lah...<br><br>Imagine you are a nice person, never do anything, then people start referring your religion as a total sh*t... Sure offended right? Just like I'm Christian, brought up to treat people with love, then see some people write 'Christians are hypocrites'... lol.. sure roll eyes.<br><br></div>

Why? the human race was 1st started by Adam and Eve. Eve gave birth and so on so forth. Along the way, few holy books were brought down from heaven to earth. Mind you, the Quran is not the only book we muslims are supposed to read. it is the Quran that is the last and final holy book to be brought down to earth.<br><br>If you believe in the Quran, you must believe in Bible and Torah, as most of Islamic history is there. what teachings are there in Quran are so called 'modifications' to our modern world. Do you know that back then Muslims had to pray almost about 1000 times? Muhammad PBUH is an avid businessman, prayed to Allah requesting that prayer times could be reduced. and the request was granted. Why? Allah seem it deemed fit because he can foresee that how Muslims around the world are going to survive without any form of business? Allah implement the 5 prayer times a day. and each prayer a Muslim prayed, he or she will get a reward for remembering him.<br><br>Anyway, not all pple embrace Islam, Some embrace Christianity and other religions. but it boils down to the same thing. Adam and Eve. We are brothers and sisters, but being brought up in different religious background.<br><br>Malaysia and Indonesia esp, they are alot more protective towards Islam because majority of them are Muslims. Only a small group actually believe in equality amongst the religions. must remember, most of them are still living in kampongs and their education system is a bit slow. yes some are working in KL so on and so forth, but it still boils down to education.<br><br></div>

Unfortunately selfishness and self-centredness are part of human nature, as long as we are so, there will always be conflicts.  I believe all the major religions in the world are peaceful and tolerant; it is some of the followers who use religions and misinterpret them for their own purpose.  They are following their own agenda, not God's agenda.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Islamic resurgence began after the 1967 debacle when a combined Muslim effort to drive Isreal into the sea failed miserably. This awoken the Muslim.<br><br>Firstly, hardliners became intollerant of moderates. In Algeria, Moroco there were throat slitting by Islamists, Egypt saw President Sadat being assinated, and tourist machined gunned in Cairo by militants. All these before the Soviets invaded Afganistan.<br>The Muslims want to restore their pride circa 14th century.<br><br>The US foreign policy, oppression of Muslims, war on terror, Iraq mess, etc etc are all moot points brought to the forefront by Osama Bin Laden.<br>Bin Laden (driven from Saudia Arabia to Afganistan) had the Islamic Caliphate in mind, stretching from Morocco to Iran, or Khazakstan. He saw no reason why the federation could not be the most powerful in the world. The moderate Muslims and the US of A make his dream unfeasible. He chose to tackle the US first.<br>The current Muslim situation are Islamic resurgence gone wry. Thanks to Bin Laden &amp; Co impatience.<br>The lable Al Qaeda btw is an invention of the Â“WestÂ”. The term is used by Islamic militants to refer to training camps in Afganistan. There is no Al Qaeda organization..<br><br>World domination is the Islamist goal, which I have to say is not in the agenda of the moderate Muslim. They are innocent. But they are passive supporters, albeit unwittingly, by denying that the militants, extremist are acting in accordance with the doctrines of the Quran.<br><br>Don't ask me for source, it is in the Quran, and in the various books about the Islam resurgence written by Muslims.<br>When we quote the verses and paragraphs, we are deemed to be out of context. Right.<br>It is these very verses and more, that are used 'out of context' to fuel the extremist 'jihad'.<br><br>The communist attempt at world dominance is over, now we have a new threat. We only have to look up north, to Malaysia, to see the slowly creeping resurgence, and what is going to happen when Muslims gain dominance.<br><br>These are my personal views, formulated all through the years, and remember this is the internet.<br>So don't hold my views as "correct".<br>You either agree or disagree, and in varying degrees of either.</div>

It really ain't about the Jews nor do all latter revelations regarding Jews spoke bad of them.<br><br>The allusion for the deceitful conversion of the Jews has no bearing lah, especially when it has been said to let the People of the Book judge in accordance to their own books and more. Muhammad made the migration to Medina not because of the Jews but because of the persecution of the pagan Quraish tribe.<br><br>Now, if you accept the premise that Muhammad is a messenger from God, one of his purpose was to address the former monotheists to revisit their own theological histories and their relationship with God. <span style="font-style: italic;">I should add that his addresses are only meant for those who lived in his time and place because they are very circumstantial.</span> And it appears that some Jews didn't observe the Sabbath, or even worshipped somebody(?) called Ezra, etc.<br><br>Thats about it. Context.<br><br>Accusation of corrupting God's word is nothing new.<br>"for ye have perverted the words of the living God" - Jeremiah.<br><br>Why must hate Jews? *Shrugs* As another muslim, I've got no problem with the Jews. Why must hate Israel? Sometimes, the politics in the middle east are somehow exported through my religion.<br><br>I see Ibn Kathir's tasfir is quoted. He sucks, lol.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Mohammedan conquest of India is probably the bloodiest story in history. The Islamic historians and scholars have recorded with great glee and pride of the slaughters of Hindus, forced conversions, abduction of Hindu women and children to slave markets and the destruction of temples carried out by the warriors of Islam during 800 AD to 1700 AD. Millions of Hindus were converted to Islam by sword during this period.<br><br>Peaceful ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If someone draws a cartoon depicting your mother as a dog and goes around calling her a bitch, I daresay many of you might well start a fistfight. Why do you need to resort to violence to resolve this? Afterall, it's just someone's opinion of your mother. It does not hurt her or you, does it?<br><br>But it does. To religious people of all persuasions, such an insult to their God, prophets or sacred books is just as painful and offensive. That is why in a multiracial and multi-religious society like Singapore, we must ban such affronts to religious sensitivities like the Danish or Swedish cartoons.</div>
