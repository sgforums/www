A typical blog combines text, images, and links to other blogs, web pages, and other media related to its topic. The ability for readers to leave comments in an interactive format is an important part of many blogs. Most blogs are primarily textual, although some focus on art (artlog), photographs (photoblog), sketchblog, videos (vlog), music (MP3 blog), audio (podcasting) or sexual topics (Adult blog), and are part of a wider network of social media.<br><br>Source : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog<br><br></div></blockquote>u're setting a bery bad example for an adult. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>she looks ugly oso. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think we're all making way too big a deal of something like this. A student hates a teacher which is very common and normal so she vents her anger through her blog which is meant to be read by her friends. It's the same as a student telling her friends during lunch about how the new teacher is such a bi<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>tch, etc. It's not as public as you think because who would read her blog besides those who know her?</div>
