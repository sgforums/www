            <div class='col-md body'>Errr.....I think Orlando is not Disneyland but DisneyWorld.  World is bigger than land mah.  Land is in Anaheim.<br><br>I've been there but on an itineraried (if there's such a word) package tour.  Check the website.  There are many hotels in the vicinity and I am sure they have shuttle buses.  Obviously, the closer the hotels are, the more ex.<br><br>How come you don't join a tour with a travel agency?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

But I think it is more worth it to get a Day Pass and then plan your day carefully so that you can get to tour all parts of Disneyworld.<br><br>The keyword here is planning.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>1) How much is the Air Fare, Ex SIN - orlando per adults?</strong><br>The typical round-trip air fare for SIN-ORL-SIN is between S$2,000 to S$3,000 per adult, depending on the time of travel. Check out <a href="http://zuji.com" rel="nofollow">zuji.com</a> for indicative fares.<br><br><strong>2) How do we go to Florida Disney Land from Orlando Airport? Is there a free transfer by the Walts Disney from the Airport to Disney or we have to take cab by ourselves.</strong><br>There is a free Disney's Magical Express service for guests of Disney resorts. Other visitors could rent a car or take a shuttle bus service. Taxi fares are too expensive to be considered a viable option.<br><br><strong>3) I plan to go there during the 1st week of Jan 06, is it good if i go during that period.</strong><br>It is not a bad time as most American kids would have gone back to school after Christmas, but the operating hours for the parks, parades and special events are shorter, as compared to summer hours.<br><br><strong>4) Is it safe if we book the hotel rooms through Intenet by credit card? Will there be a possibilitlty that their system does not have our particular when we reach there</strong><br>It is generally quite safe and reliable to book hotel rooms in U.S. through Internet. To stay on the safe side, book through a reputable online agency or with a reputable hotel.<br><br><strong>5) Please advise how much do you all spend for the air tickets and accomdation when any of you all go last time?</strong><br>It may be quite expensive if you travel by yourselves. Your total damages could go up to S$4,000 or more per person (the air fare could already take up more than half of that). Try to book through a travel agency which provides a "free and easy" itinerary at Walt Disney World. There are other theme parks such as Universal Studios and Seaworld in Orlando, too, so you might wish to visit them as well while you are there.<br><br>Have fun.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm from the USA so maybe I can help.  Disneyworld is NOTORIOUS for being expensive.<br><br>I agree with the previous poster's commment that it would be best if you stayed off of Disney's property because the Hotel will be much cheaper.  The only problem I see with this idea is that you're going to need to have some type of transportation between your hotel and Disney, so you might have to end up renting a car, which can also be expensive.<br><br>If you get the chanc you might also want to go exploring through Orlando itself.  I mean Disneyworld is fun and all, but I wouldn't travel half way around the world and not ever leave an amusement park.<br><br>Just my 2 cents.<br><br>All the best!<br><br>Chris</div>
