              <p>umm......u fools are not observant enough.</p>
              <p>every morning at MRT stations, people usually stand on the left.</p>
              <p>on the right, it's for people who are impatient / in a rush and these are the guys who basically run up the right side.</p>
              <p>so, in other words, those who want default speed, on left.</p>
              <p>those who want to chiong, go right.</p>
              <p>this is better than the scenario of <em>"everyone should STAND STATIONARY MOTIONLESS FROZEN on both sides of the escalators if we want to clear a crowd fast."</em></p>

              <p><br>Yes you are absolutely right if it is not crowded. But when it is crowded, those people who want "default speed", which is actually the majority, will "die die" wait for their turn to stand left and in turn choke up the escalator entrance. When this happens, those people who are running for their life will not be able to run.</p>

              <p>A lot of people support the idea of keeping to the left of the escalator so that people in a rush can run for their life on the right side.</p>
              <p>I would say that this only makes sense if it is not crowded. Afterall we must practise courtesy right? However if it is crowded, the main intention will be to move the crowd ASAP and not to slow down the crowd in order to make way for a few people who are running to meet their doom or something. </p>
              <p>Let me explain my claim. Imagine if everyone stands on both sides (left &amp; right) of the escalator. Assume that the escalator can transport 20 people per min this way. <span style="color: #ff0000;">This means that in 1 min, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">20</span> people at the bottom can reach the top.</span></p>
              <p>However, if everyone were to insist on keeping to the left, the transport rate is reduced by half. This means that the escalator can now only transport 10 people per min. Let's say we have 2 buggers running for life on the right side. <span style="color: #ff0000;">That means that in 1 min, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only 12</span> people at the bottom can reach the top.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Think about it people. This is simple math. In the morning peak hour, do we want to clog the bottom of the escalator just to let a few "impatient" ones run up or do we want everyone to reach the top ASAP?</span></p>

Maybe they will just say say and by the time they 'complain' finish, it's their turn to go on the escalator already. TS may have a good point and SMRT has done what it is necessary to make the lives of the commuter easier, so if there's any feedback, then tell them. If not, raising this issue here will just be a talking point because vast majority of people here stick to the good old mentality of keeping left that was incalcated right from the beginning.</p></div>

              <p>every morning at MRT stations, people usually stand on the left.</p>
              <p>on the right, it's for people who are impatient / in a rush and these are the guys who basically run up the right side.</p>
              <p>so, in other words, those who want default speed, on left.</p>
              <p>those who want to chiong, go right.</p>
              <p>this is better than the scenario of <em>"everyone should STAND STATIONARY MOTIONLESS FROZEN on both sides of the escalators if we want to clear a crowd fast."</em></p>

              <p><br>Logically there are no fault in the way you're looking at it.</p>
              <p>HOWEVER, that is assuming everyone wants the escalator cleared as fast as possible. Some people are not in a hurry and could afford to take their time while others are in a hurry and needs to run up.</p>
              <p>You're looking at it from a mathematical perspective, that it is on average faster for everyone if we take both side of the escalators.</p>
              <p>The whole idea of standing on the left is to allow those who are in a hurry to go first, not to clear the crowd as fast as possible.</p>
