              <p>If u played this game called Deus Ex before . It was released in 2000 by ION storm. IMO, this game showed us the world of a near future, i think the most convincing of all games out there becos it actually touched on real world technology and science subjects which are just starting to see the light today , such as augmentation, nanotechnology ect. The game featured it all 50 years down. The game received numerous positive reviews. It won a number of awards and received many nominations, including British Academy of Film and Television Arts Game of the year , IGN Game of the year, and many Best Story awards.<br><br>The game has appeared in a number of Greatest games of all times lists and hall of fame features. It maintains a hold in newly created greatest games lists.<br><br>Although the story of Deus Ex is based on real world themes and events, a few fictional elements of the game world have seemingly spilled over into reality since the game's release in 2000.<br><br>It is scary how certain things said in the game actually came true very soon 1 year later!<br><br><strong>Real world parallels:</strong><br><br>During sections of the game where the New York skyline is visible in the background, the two towers of the World Trade Center are noticeably missing. Harvey Smith, one of the game's designers, explains that due to texture memory limitations, the portion of the skyline with the twin towers had to be left out, and the other half mirrored in place of it. According to Smith, during the game's development, the developers justified the lack of the towers by stating that terrorists had destroyed the World Trade Center earlier in the game's storyline: "<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">We just said that the towers had been destroyed too. And this was way before 9-11. Years. That's kind of freaky."</span></strong> [9] It should be noted, however, that textures for the WTC do exist in the game's files, but are never used.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In the game, it is mentioned that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has assumed counter-terrorism responsibilities. Shortly after September 11th, it was announced that FEMA would be assuming counter-terrorism responsibilities, as part of the Department of Homeland Security.</span><br><br>Some fans have also noted similarities between the anti-terrorist movement in the game, spurred by the Statue of Liberty bombing, and the post-9/11 "war on terror" in the real world. The sequel actually shipped with the tagline "The future war on terror" on the box art front.<br><br><span style="color: #3366ff;">Other examples include rioting in Paris and the similarity of the Gray Death epidemic to the possible bird flu pandemic. Strangely also, there is a mention of 'Century Flu' within various newspapers in the game.</span><br><br>Several plot elements involve real-world conspiracy theories about ECHELON, Majestic-12 and the Roswell UFO incident. Popular conspiracy theory elements like Men in Black, Black helicopters, Greys, and the Illuminati are also featured throughout the game.</p>
