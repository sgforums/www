My theory supports the concept that our universe is created by an, or more, intelligent being(s). No longer is religion useful here. Instead, we must use science to find out why our universe is so perfect. Then, we realize that it is because we are living in a simulated reality created by humans who use it for leisure, or work. And it is likely that we are the product of this technological usage, that we are cyber-characters, representitives of our original forms in the real world.</div></blockquote>You are so wrong..there are no god..there's only dog</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It has been verified that what we Perceive as reality, isn't always reality. Sometimes the truth is more odder than fiction and what we see isn't what we always get. Take in example the new discoveries in Quantum Mechanics (QM); The atom was believed to act as a localized object meaning we could pin point it's exact location at any given time. Science has proven that this in fact, isn't the case. The double-slit experiment seems to defy what we consider reality. When an atom is given the option of more than one path it acts as a wave. It seems impossible, even after faced with the test results but it's one way to show that the reality is far different from the human perception. But it gets odder than this. When we put up a detector to try to catch the atom acting as a wave it acts as a localized particle, it's almost as if nature doesn't want us to catch her in the act. When the detector is turned off it again acts as a wave with interference patterns. Okay, by now you may be asking what does this have to do with the question asked but it has a lot to do with it. I could list numerous examples of scientific data that doesn't seem right, that doesn't seem to add up with common sense but in all truth, human common sense isn't always correct. The fact of the matter is there's still to many pieces of the puzzle missing to answer such a big question and we must continue putting pieces together before we can ask the ultimate question. So if reality defies common sense, then maybe the answer to this defies common sense. We are only able to Perceive with five senses, this may be where we are held captive to seeing the picture in a whole. We are bound to human experience. In order to answer this question we must think outside of the box and even if we ever do find the answer we won't be able to understand it fully.</div>
