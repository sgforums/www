            <div class='col-md body'>Are we digital characters living out our lives in a virtual reality created by our real bodies somewhere else, in the REAL world? Are we just avatars that our real bodies beyond this world known as VR use for leisure in a world of advanced technology? Even now we have the technology to create artificial limbs and hearts, and in the very near future, humans may create machines that interface directly with the human brain in this reality, allowing us to, for the first time, experience VR as a world so real it would be indistinguishable from reality. We would roam this VR world as characters that represent our actual selves in the real world. Are we, in THIS reality, being deceived, thinking that we are actually living real lives, when it is likely that we are in fact characters in a virtual world controlled by our real selves back in the REAL world?<br><br>Are we really living in a dream, that only death can allow us to wake up and realize our true existance? For thousands of years, our theories, logics, and thoughts have piled up, creating stacks of riddles and mysteries that are rarely solved, and thus adding together to form a vast, thick barrier of deception. Is death the only way we can go through this barrier, to see the true side of things, to wake up from what we call, a dream?</div>

AI would be given to the online character, who is stored in cyberspace and we may think we are actually a seperate entity from our real bodies beyond the VR world, but i believe we are being controlled by the real characters in the real world through our physical mind, and our subconsciousness is the ONLY TRUE MIND we have, our distinctive feature that seperates us from the person whos controlling us in this reality.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sammiegal, that, unfortunately is impossible because the characters in our computer games are a seperate entity, controlled by our mouse and keyboard. they lack even the simplest of AI. now, the real VRs of the future will be accessed by machines that interface with our brain, like wearing helmets that record brainwaves to move your character in the virtual reality, now that is an entity that is a representation of YOU. so u would never know u are actually in a game unless u find an exit or glitch that tells u, so that u can unplug yourself. but due to the advanced technology by the time true VR has been developed, glitches and errors would rarely exist...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Christians tell me that the world is created by god, who is all-mighty, all-powerful and all-knowing, and that the world is too perfect to be created by random chance or coincidence. My theory supports the concept that our universe is created by an, or more, intelligent being(s). No longer is religion useful here. Instead, we must use science to find out why our universe is so perfect. Then, we realize that it is because we are living in a simulated reality created by humans who use it for leisure, or work. And it is likely that we are the product of this technological usage, that we are cyber-characters, representitives of our original forms in the real world.</div>
