            <div class='col-md body'>HEALER<br>(Submissive Extrovert Concrete Feeler )<br><br>Like just 9% of the population you are a HEALER (SECF)-- caring, good with people, and patient. You are completely selfless and full of love. As a concrete feeler, you do well with your emotions, which are very strong. You understand and appreciate *why* you feel the way you do, and for the most part you're at peace with yourself.<br><br>Suffering in the world really pisses you off.<br><br>In relationships, it's easy for you to get hurt. Avoid all kinds of dominant (D***) people, *especially* in dating or marriage. You are a motherly figure, even if you're a guy. If you're a girl, make sure you're a mom some day. The world's children need people like you. If you're a guy, don't even think about it. Most pedophiles are HEALERS.<br><br>On the rare occasions when you try to assert yourself, you're cute and awkward, but highly effective.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br></div>

While being called an accountant isn't really that cool, neither are you. You aren't exactly the life of the party, but you do have fun, and the people close to you really do love you.<br><br>There are basically two kinds of accountants, and you most likely fit into one of the two categories:<br><br># male<br># female <strong> duhz...</strong><br><br>Seriously: accountants are good at whatever they do. They can always be trusted, especially by their friends. They almost never cheat or steal. (Some real-life accountants do, however, they are probably Judges (DICT)). You probably have a wonderful relationship with your family.<br><br></div>

You are strong-willed and extroverted, so you enjoy interacting with other people. You aggressively pursue your goals.<br><br>Your creative style of thinking allows you to come up with unusual arguments and original ideas that appeal to others, but behind it all is an analytical mind that never forgets the bottom line. While some might see you as manipulative, your close friends know you are a talented person who deserves the best in life.<br><br>Whatever. You *are* manipulative. Whether you use your power for "good" or "bad", it's up to you. If you're confused what good or bad means, ask a HEALER.
