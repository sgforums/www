              <p>Sometimes people use the excuse of "art" in order to get away with craziness!</p>
              <p><strong>Aliza Shvarts</strong>, a Yale art major, has done something different for her senior art project this year.</p>
              <p>The "artist" <a href="http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/24513">has documented</a> herself throughout a 9 month process where she artificially inseminated
                  herself and then periodically took abortifacient drugs in order to
                  induce miscarriages.</p>
              <p>The exhibit, which will begin next Tuesday, will include video recordings of the forced miscarriages.</p>
              <p>WTF?!?!?!  Ewwww!!!!!</p>
              <p>It will also include preserved samples of the blood during the process.</p>
              <p>According to Shvarts, her goal was to "spark conversation and debate on the relationship between art and the human body."</p>
              <p>Students have expressed shock upon hearing of the exhibit. Rightfully so!</p>
              <p>Shvarts insists that her art isn't for shock value. <em>Liar</em>.
                  She says, "I hope it inspires some sort of discourse. Sure, some people
                  will be upset with the message and will not agree with it, but it's not
                  the intention of the piece to scandalize anyone."</p>
              <p>As for the "donors", she claims they were not paid for their
                  "services". She also claims to have required them to periodically take
                  tests for STDs, though did not want to disclose the number of sperm
                  donors used.</p>
              <p>As for the medical risk related to multiple abortions, Shvarts says
                  she was not worried. She said the abortifacient drugs she took were
                  herbal and legal, and decided she didn't need to consult a doctor.</p>
              <p>IDIOT!!!!!</p>
              <p>What if she's caused herself serious and permanent damage????</p>
              <p>At least this "artist" has one fan. Juan Castillo, another senior
                  art major, said he was intrigued by the beauty of her project. He says,
                  "I really loved the idea of this project, but a lot other people
                  didn't. I think that most people were very resistant to thinking about
                  what the project was really about. [The senior-art-project forum]
                  stopped being a conversation on the work itself."</p>
              <p>As for the actual exhibit, Schvarts will feature a large cube
                  hanging from the ceiling. Wrapped around that cube will be hundreds of
                  feet of plastic sheeting which will be lined with her blood from the
                  miscarriages.</p>
              <p><em>Ewwww!!!!<br> </em><br> The old blood will be mixed with vaseline to prevent it from drying.</p>
              <p><em>Double EWWWWWW!!!<br> </em><br> She will also project the recorded videos of herself, showing the
                  miscarriages she had in her bathtub, onto the sides of the cube.</p>
              <p>Similar footage will also be projected onto the walls of the room.</p>
              <p>We're starting to get a bit queezy!</p>
              <p>This is TOO MUCH!!!!!!</p>
              <p>Shvarts adds, "It was a private and personal endeavor, but also a
                  transparent one for the most part. This isn't something I've been
                  hiding." Adding, that she believes "strongly that art should be a
                  medium for politics and ideologies, not just a commodity. I think that
                  I'm creating a project that lives up to the standard of what art is
                  supposed to be."</p>
              <p>We're all for a woman's right to choose, but this is abusing that right.</p>
              <p>We don't know what to think anymore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>*edit* "Ms. Shvarts is engaged in performance art," a Yale spokeswoman,
              Helaine Klasky, said. "She stated to three senior Yale University
              officials today, including two deans, that she did not impregnate
              herself and that she did not induce any miscarriages. The entire
              project is an art piece, a creative fiction designed to draw attention
              to the ambiguity surrounding form and function of a woman’s body."</p>

              <p>i was an art student and in my opinion, art is something that comminicates certain ideas to their audiences/patrons is a subtle and tasteful ways.</p>
              <p>it seems to me Miss Yale Art Major is pro-life and is trying to communicate her ideas through her works, just like the sick fella who eats MacDonalds everyday and fcuk up his own liver.</p>
              <p>this works are extreme indeed..but its intention is to bring awareness so people would be more responsible and pro-life. just like how the Supersize Me guy reminds people of how full of shiet MacDonalds are (rmb that whn ur eating ur Chicken McNuggets).</p>
              <p>As for how beautiful her works are...havent seen it, cant comment.</p>

              It's not a hoax. From : <a href="http">http://yaledailynews.com</a>
              
              <img src="http://yaledailynews.com/img/2008/04/18/48083c8d824d6_abortioncourtesyYDNsized.jpg">
              
              Aliza Shvarts â€™08 was never impregnated. She never miscarried. The sweeping outrage on blogs across the country was apparently for naught â€” at least according to the University. 
              
              As the news of her supposed senior art project chronicling a year of self-induced miscarriages was greeted with widespread shock on campus and elsewhere, the Davenport College senior traded barbs with Yale officials on Thursday over a project she described as an exhibit documenting a nine-month process during which she claimed to have artificially inseminated herself â€œas often as possibleâ€� while periodically inducing miscarriages. 
              
              But while Shvarts stood by her project and claimed that administrators had backed her before the planned exhibition attracted national condemnation, the University dismissed it as nothing more than a piece of fiction. 
              
              â€œThe entire project is an art piece, a creative fiction designed to draw attention to the ambiguity surrounding form and function of a womanâ€™s body,â€� Yale spokeswoman Helaine Klasky said in a written statement Thursday afternoon. 
              
              Klasky said Shvarts told Yale College Dean Peter Salovey and two other senior officials Thursday that she neither impregnated herself nor induced any miscarriages. Rather, the entire episode, including a press release describing the exhibition released Wednesday, was nothing more than â€œperformance art,â€� Klasky said. 
              
              â€œShe is an artist and has the right to express herself through performance art,â€� Klasky said. â€œHad these acts been real, they would have violated basic ethical standards and raised serious mental and physical health concerns.â€� 
              
              But in an interview later Thursday afternoon, Shvarts defended her work and called the Universityâ€™s statement â€œultimately inaccurate.â€� She reiterated that she engaged in the nine-month process she publicized on Wednesday in a press release that was first reported in the News: repeatedly using a needleless syringe to insert semen into herself, then taking abortifacient herbs at the end of her menstrual cycle to induce bleeding. Thursday evening, in a tour of her art studio, she shared with the News video footage she claimed depicted her attempts at self-induced miscarriages. 
              
              â€œNo one can say with 100-percent certainty that anything in the piece did or did not happen,â€� Shvarts said, adding that she does not know whether she was ever pregnant. â€œThe nature of the piece is that it did not consist of certainties.â€� 
              
              Told of Shvartsâ€™ comments, the University fired back. In a statement issued just before midnight on Thursday, Klasky told the News that Shvarts had vowed that if the University revealed her admission, â€œshe would deny it.â€� 
              
              â€œHer denial is part of her performance,â€� Klasky wrote in an e-mail message. â€œWe are disappointed that she would deliberately lie to the press in the name of art.â€� 
              
              Yaleâ€™s response to the supposed exhibition came at the end of a day of widespread shock. The blogosphere erupted in stunned indignation over Shvartsâ€™ detailed description in Thursdayâ€™s News of her supposed exhibition, which she said would include the display of blood she preserved from her nine-month endeavor. 
              
              As more news outlets posted their stories online early Friday morning, Shvarts responded to the Universityâ€™s second statement, asserting that her project was, in her words, â€œUniversity-sanctioned.â€� 
              
              â€œIâ€™m not going to absolve them by saying it was some sort of hoax when it wasnâ€™t,â€� she said. â€œI started out with the University on board with what I was doing, and because of the media frenzy theyâ€™ve been trying to dissociate with me. Ultimately I want to get back to a point where they renew their support because ultimately this was something they supported.â€� 
              
              It was a media frenzy that Shvarts triggered herself. The article in Thursdayâ€™s News was prompted by a press release Shvarts circulated on Wednesday in which she discussed â€” in graphic detail â€” what she called a cycle of self-insemination followed by â€œrepeated self-induced miscarriages.â€� 
              
              The Drudge Report linked to the Newsâ€™s story early Thursday, overloading the newspaperâ€™s Web site with traffic and attracting the attention of news outlets across the country. The article generated more press inquiries from the University than any matter since the controversy surrounding Yaleâ€™s admission of former Taliban diplomat Rahmatullah Hashemi flared up in 2006, according to a Yale official. 
              
              In an interview for the article in Thursdayâ€™s News, Shvarts explained that the goal of her exhibition was to spark conversation and debate about the relationship between art and the human body. She said her endeavor was not conceived with any â€œshock valueâ€� in mind. 
              
              â€œI hope it inspires some sort of discourse,â€� Shvarts said. â€œSure, some people will be upset with the message and will not agree with it, but itâ€™s not the intention of the piece to scandalize anyone.â€� 
              
              Shvarts said her project would take the form of a large cube suspended from the ceiling of a room in the gallery of Holcombe T. Green Jr. Hall. Shvarts said she would wrap hundreds of feet of plastic sheeting around the cube, with blood from her self-induced miscarriages lining the sheeting. 
              
              Recorded videos of her experiencing her miscarriages would be projected onto the four sides of the cube, Shvarts said. 
              
              And while some news stories late Thursday dismissed Shvartsâ€™s exhibition as a wholesale hoax, the Davenport senior showed elements of her planned exhibition to News reporters, including footage from tapes she plans to play at the exhibit. The tapes depict Shvarts, sometimes naked, sometimes clothed, alone in a shower stall bleeding into a cup. It was all part of a project that Shvarts said had the backing of the dean of her residential college and at least two faculty members within the School of Art. 
              
              Davenport College Dean Craig Harwood â€” whom Shvarts said supported the project â€” and Shvartsâ€™s thesis adviser, School of Art lecturer Pia Lindman, could not be reached for comment Thursday. The director of undergraduate studies in the School of Art, Henk van Assen, referred a request for comment to Yaleâ€™s Office of Public Affairs.
