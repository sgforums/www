            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>It's a great idea.<br><br>Think of a Chi-Hua-Hua dog.<br><br>Do u know a Chi-Hua-Hua can fit into ur pocket? Not small pocket lah, but at least a slightly bigger pocket.<br><br>And it can fit into a bag too.<br><br>Look at the amount a Chi-Hua-Hua eats. The amount he poos and pees.<br><br>Look at the size of his shirts.<br><br>The size of his crate.<br><br>Etc.<br><br>Well, guess what.<br><br>Guess.......<br><br>Yes, you are right.<br><br>IF ONLY people can be made smaller, we can achieve a TREMENDOUS breakthrough in human civilization, unparalled in the entire history of the human race.<br><br>Imagine, we eat less. Less food is needed.<br><br>Less clothes.<br><br>Smaller homes.<br><br>Smaller cars.<br><br>Smaller books.<br><br>Less human waste.<br><br>Everything that's imaginable.......will be lessened.......from A to Z.<br><br>A great deal of pressure will be taken off from our environment.<br><br>Imagine smaller desks and chairs. This will result in fewer trees being chopped off.<br><br>Imagine less human waste. This will result in better waste management. All the waste, from household waste to industrial waste will be reduced (coz industries also make less).<br><br>Imagine smaller homes. HDBs and Apartments can house more people, coz the height of a single unit is reduced. And smaller cars and roads. It will have great effect on urban planning. Now a city can support many more times the number of inhabitants.<br><br>Imagine the water level of swimming pools reduced. This will save water bills. And electricity.<br><br>Less oil is needed. Oil won't be like now, near to 70 bucks a barrel. So, global economy will increase. Due to lower oil price.<br><br>And on, and on........the effects would be so great, so widespread, and so amazing.<br><br>It will be a great breakthrough for human civilization. Because we can concentrate on other things. Pressures would be off a lot. Those time and effort and resources can be spent elsewhere. In other words, we will be much more efficient. I believe if this happens, it will be a great leap forward for the prosperity of humankind.<br><br>BEFORE u say this is a dream, please remember Chi-Hua-hua is an artificial breed coming from multiple breeds. Chi-Hua-Hua can be like that due to deliberate human design.<br><br>So, the question is........<br><br>If humans can see the advantages of having a breed of small dog, and in fact carried it out, why cant the same apply to humans? Please think about it.<br><br>I believe if people start to recognize the immense advantages, then scientists will start working on it.<br><br>Dont forget Dolly the sheep, who is a clone (a major scientific breakthrough in bio). If scientists want to, I believe humans can be made smaller. It can really happen. But first there must be greater awareness and a want to start doing it.<br><br>We can be as small as 1.5m. Then less than 1m. Then less than 50cm.<br><br>Yeah, don't laugh. Dont forget the Chi-Hua-Hua. Compare it with a big dog like German Shepard.<br><br>Yeah, humans are not dogs. But same.<br><br>Small dogs and big fruits can all be made. What about people?<br><br>It really is a great leap forward for the humankind and the world. It will solve many many problems.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's not like that.<br><br>Because people are smaller, everything we need which is related to our size, is reduced.<br><br>Look at ur chair. Yeah, the one you are sitting on right now. If you are 50cm tall, would u use that chair?<br><br>What kinda chair will u use? Much smaller right? What does it mean to our environment? We will chop fewer trees.<br><br>Imagine if you are 50cm, what kind of swimming pool will u swim in? The water level is much lesser, right?<br><br>Imagine the amount of water u drink daily. The amount of water u take for bathing ur small body and shampooing ur tiny hair. The amount of water for washing ur little clothes.<br><br>What does it mean? Water consumption---&gt; down. What does it mean? Less pressure on environment and less resources assigned to exploit and deliver the goods we want.<br><br>For example, that water. How much a desalination plant is worth to a city? Many millions right? You need to build expensive desalination plants to provide alotta water. This money could have been spent elsewhere, if the plant can be a simple one providing small amount of water.<br><br>In other words, less pressure on environment and less resources assigned to exploit and deliver the goods we want.<br><br>The saved resources from not building a big-capacity plant, like money and time and energy, can be assigned to other needs. Not to mention the saved water itself.<br><br>Like, now u spent 500mills on a desalination plant. Taking up 10 acres, 10 months to build. To deliver 10 litres of water.<br><br>In future, u spend only 100mills, taking up 2 acres, 2 months, to build. To deliver 2 litres of water.<br><br>Or build the same like old one, but it lasts much longer and never get hit its upper limit coz people use so little water. Can provide enough water for several generations.<br><br>Can u imagine what it means for humankind, if this is widespread?<br><br>All those efficiency and freed resources can really speed up our civilization.<br><br>It doesnt mean since everything is smaller then everything is same or back to square 1. We only make people smaller, and therefore people-size related products and services are lessened, the pressure to the environment is reduced, and less resources assigned to exploit and deliver the goods, like time, money, energy.<br><br>It's not the same. Like when u sit on a smaller chair, it doesnt mean u are shrinking the molecules of the chair. You don't shrink the whole world. You simply build a smaller chair from the same wood. So u use less resources to satisfy the same need. You save from using less wood. You save from using less time, coz the chair is smaller and quicker to build, u can still use the same machinaries if u need to, u save money too from the cost of wood and manpower wages.<br><br>Eat less, it means there is a real and absolute reduction of food intake. So we can rear fewer chickens, raise less crops. Less vaccinations for the chickens, and on and on.<br><br>All this will have huge effects.<br><br>Huge effects, from small people.<br><br></div>
