            <div class='col-md body'>Read on..and u be the judge for the moral of the story...<br><br>One fine day, an old couple ard the age of 70, walks into a lawyer's office. Apparently, they r there to file a divorce. Lawyer was very puzzled, after havin a chat with them, he got their story....<br><br>This couple had been quarrelin all their 40 over yrs of marriage, nothing ever seems to go right. They hang on coz of their children, afraid tat it might affect their up-bringing. Now, all their children have already grown up, have their own family, there's nothing else the old couple have to worry about, all they wanted is to lead their own life free from all these yrs of unhappiness from their marriage, so both agree on a divorce....<br><br>Lawyer was having a hard time tryin to get the papers done, coz he felt tat after 40 yrs of marriage at the age of 70, he couldnt understand why the old couple would still wants a divorce...while they were signin the papers, the wife told the husband.."I really love u, but i really cant carry on anymore,i'm sorry.."<br><br>"its o.k, i understand.." said the husband.<br><br>Lookin at this, the lawyer suggested a dinner together, just 3 of them, wife tot, why not, since they r still gonna be frends..<br><br>At the dining table, there was a silence of awkardness. The first dish was roasted chicken, immediately, the old man took the drumstick for the old lady.."take this, its ur favourite.." lookin at this, the lawyer tot maybe theres still a chance, but the wife was frowning when she answer.." this is always the problem, u always think so highly of urself, never tot abt how i feel, dun u know tat i  hate drumsticks?"<br><br>Little did she know tat, over the yrs, the husband have been trying all ways to please her, little did she know tat drumsticks was the husband's favourite. Little did he know tat she never tot he understand her at all, little did he know tat she hates drummsticks even thou all he wans is the best for her.<br><br>That nite, both of them couldnt sleep, toss and turn, toss and turn...after hours, the old man couldnt take it anymore, he knows that he still loves her, and he cant carry on life without her, he wants her back, he wants to tell her, he is sorry, he wanted to tell her "i love u"...He picks up the phone, startin dialing her number....ringing never stops..he never stop dialing....<br><br>On the othe side,she was sad, she couldnt understand how come after all these yrs, he still doesnt understand her at all,she loves him alot, but she just cant take it anymore....phone's ringing, she refuses to answer, knowin tat its him..."wats the point of tokin now tat its over...i have ask for it and now i wanna keep it this way, if not i will lose face.." she tot...still ringing...she have decided to pull out the cord... Little did she remember, he have heart problems...<br><br>The next day, she received news that he had passed away...she rushed down to his apartment, saw his body, lying on the couch still holdin on to the phone...he had a heart attack when he was still tryin to get thru her phone line.... As sad as she could be...she will have to clear his belongins...when she was lookin thru the drawers, she saw this insurance policy, dated from the day they got married, beneficiary of coz its her...together in tat file, theres this note...<br><br>"to my dearest wife, by the time u r readin this, i'm sure i'm no longer ard, i bought this policy for u, thou the amount is only $100k, i hope it will be able to help me cont my promise tat i have made when we got married, i might not be ard anymore, i want this amount of money to cont takin care of u, just like the way i will if i could have live longer..i wan u to know i will always be ard, by ur side...i love u" Tears flowed like river......</div>
