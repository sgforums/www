If not for the law, do you think the contractors will call them? Who did the search and rescue? CD lah. They cho bo. Who do you think lead the investigations? Sori, itÂ’s the people from the Min. Of Manpower, Safety Department.  DidnÂ’t you read the papers? They are technically incompetent for such investigations. Ask a policeman whatÂ’s the meaning of Â“hardcoreÂ”?
