            <div class='col-md body'>very much depends on the officer who reponds.  A lot of them know very little about law on the grey area as its a disputed area.   Not all think the same and put in equal effort in their work.  Also there are the NSfulltime, reservists, SC and volunteers.  SO they will react differently.  Now much better as the regulars sergeants above are more qualify, higher educated and can understand situation and law better.   They have better apprreciation of situation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>saw the program.  This conman really gusty.  probably even knows the law.  Not sure in this case its like a business deal turn sour as everything sign in black and white.  Those being cheated got to proof that they are being cheated.  Own others money is not a crime.  so the only recourse for them is collectively sue that fellow till he bankrupt which in his state now, he has no money in his name.  This guy is a pro.<br><br></div>
