            <div class='col-md body'>Quite an interesting discussion going above. I would like to add this job surviving strategy:<br><br>1. First as a new staff, act dumb, curry favor everyone, endure all the shit from your colleagues and learn as much as possible from them.<br><br>2. Then, once you master your job scope, play politics with your immediate colleagues. Back stabbed them, sabo them. Why? Cos there is only limited number of promotions a year.<br><br>3. At the same time, curry favor with other departments, especially if you are eyeing for transfer. If you are not eyeing for transfer, you can collaborate with other department colleagues to sabo your own department colleagues. You can do likewise to repay their help. A win-win situation. It is easier for your boss and your boss' boss to believe a "neautral" party who is from another department.<br><br>4. Suck up to the cleaning aunties and uncles. They are easily bribed and are the best people to help you spread gossips.<br><br>5. I know some people like to snoope at my dustbin and desk, so I purposely leave mis-leading documents for them to see. Shred the important docs and always lock all your documents whenever you are away from the desk.<br><br>6. Repeat until you are one step away from being the CEO.<br><br>Any more suggestions on winning office politics?<br><br>Btw, I think you can never distant yourself from office politics, it is a game you have to play whether you like it or not?</div>

I don't intend to be the USA, Russia or China in my department. I prefer to be Switzerland and remain as neutral as possible, making use of the politics that others play to build up my resume and siam all the useless projects and odd-jobs.

Even if you plan to be a neautral, she will still touch you one way or the other. To have a peace of mind, I suggest you ganging up on her with other neautrals or her weaker competitors and get rid of her once and for all. Either that or you hope that she will be transfered to other departments. If she managed to get promoted to become your boss, I can say life will even be tougher for you and it will be even more difficult to remove her.<br><br>One positive note is that at least you know what her agenda is. There might be others in your department who have their own hidden agendas and it is these covert agendas that is hard to know and protect against.</div>
