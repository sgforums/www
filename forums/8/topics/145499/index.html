            <div class='col-md body'>The fault lies with the boss...<br><br>This is an elementary problem..It is not surprising that senior staff would not want to teach the new staff in case she loses her influence if the new staff can do just as well or better.<br><br>As an employer myself, what I do is create a training file stating all the skills the new staff must learn and the supervisor in charge of teaching. I make it clear to the senior staff it is their responsibility to make sure the new staff can perform to their satisfaction. When the supervisor is satisfied, she has to sign off in the training file. I will test the new staff at the end of his training and based on his performance, I know which is the good senior staff and which is not.<br><br>It is in the interest of the senior staff to train well because if I am not satisfied with the performance of the recruit, I will not allow him to take over the routine duties of the senior staff. On top of that, a senior that cannot teach well will acquire a black mark against his performance...</div>
