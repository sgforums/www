            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mystic_law:</div><div class="quote_body">I have here a common ugly incident at work. Staff A, a 50 year old man has just joined the company for 4 days. On the first day of work, he was given a bit of on the job training of how to use the Oracle software system by staff B; a lady in her thirties.<br><br>Staff B taught staff A the Oracle system rather hastily and impatiently; without giving much time for Staff A to jot down and take notes of the steps required to execute a sales order. Staff B also spoke aloud that she doesn't like teaching others.<br><br>On the 4th day, there were some errors in the new staff (A)'s work. Staff B reported to the boss surreptitiously that there were some incomplete sales orders that staff A had keyed in.<br><br>Staff A witnessed the quiet whisperings of Staff B to the boss. Staff A deduced that staff B must have told the boss that the new staff (A) is incompetent or something to the effect. But Staff A did not make/think much of it. (aka backstabbing)<br><br>As staff A is new, I believe there should be some margin of error OR what they commonly called the learning curve.<br><br>Later when Staff A wanted to process some sales order, staff B told him not to process anymore.<br><br>One hour later, Staff A (who had earlier tendered resignation) confronted Staff B over what had happened. Staff A banged on the table very loudly and give Staff B a piece of his mind. That is, as a new staff, there are bound to be some errors in a new staff's work initialy.<br><br>Staff A also reiterated that if staff B dislike teaching other new staff in OJT, then she should stay at home; because every old/senior staff should help to give OJT to new staff.Staff A comented that staff B is being selfish in her attitude.<br><br>SO gentlemen and ladies, my question is :-<br><br>1) who is the instigator/ catalyst for disharmonious office environment???<br><br>2) Is the approach taken by staff B wrong?<br><br>Thank you for all feedback.<br><br>Back to top<br><br></div></blockquote>Since this is the working world, let's be smart lah...<br>First, let's make it 60% poiltics and 40% work...<br>To illustrate, staff A should make a plan on how to confuse the situation since the first impression given by staff B wasn't excellent...<br>By right, he should make a complaint to the boss despite the situation may not force him likewise..<br>Next, deny to staff B that he's make a complaint...<br>If staff b doesn't believe , then let him or her to go ask the boss...<br>Come back, deny<br>Why? Because this is to let the boss know that staff A has informed the boss but not to be intimidate by Staff B's request to know wat's going on...<br>Next, try to take of any chance to further confuse the situation...<br>makin' alliance with the enemy of Staff B...<br>Be more friendly to everybody and soon you will know Staff B's stuffies...<br>Now, this is only a simple scenario to show what politic is...<br>Just my two cents worth... Haha...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
