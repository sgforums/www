            <div class='col-md body'>It's not easy for a 50+ to be employed. To do justice to himself and to pave the way for others, he could have showed staff A that he could do it(Not easy for him though). But, if he managed to learn it, Staff B might claim that it is her credit to save her position and to gain points... y am i so skeptical.:p</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My take on this is if wanna resign at least find alternative employment then throw letter lor. Throw letter without finding another is lugi leh. Must find and sign with other company already then can KPKB with current company.  I am surprised a 50 yrs old guy dunno about such politik? Everywhere in every company all got politik. As long as got ppl interaction there is politik.<br><br>From wat i see, Staff A did it naively (as in no find alternative job still throw letter) whereas I admire Staff B survival skills in the company. I doubt the empty post vacated by Staff A can be filled for long cuz I think Staff B possessses incredible politik sense to survive. Unless company close shop or retrench or Staff B find a better paying job, I think Staff B every month take money home from that company  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
