              <p>I really hope my experience with the various Korean universities would be different. The admissions people at Yonsei UIC and KU so far have been very welcoming based on the fact that I made a trip down to Seoul just for this. SKKU and HUFS not so much so. Either that or Yonsei UIC and KU are really interested for my monies (expat students pay international rates)! LOL!</p>

              <p>Anyways, today I managed to cover Hankuk University of Foreign
                      Studies, Korea University and Sungkyunkwan University. The first
                      two have a course in International Studies which is taught in
                      English (along with Yonsei UIC, of course) while SKKU doesn't have
                      International Studies — their closest equivalent is International
                      Economics and the like...</p>

              <p>I think economics and history or business/finance are better courses. International relations in my view is not a good discipline to take.</p>

              <p>yeah i am sure it will be another pain in my ass when the application paperwork comes. will take hell long time to even transfer the deposit over and get things right. but i got about 4 months to do all that, so i think it will still be alright. i hope.</p>
              <p>now i am still considering my offers... u are so lucky u could go over and recce. how i wish i can do so too, but my parents don't like me to travel around myself. its so contradictory that they allow me to study overseas but don't let me check out the experiences myself beforehand. don't know their thinking la..</p>
              <p>sometimes i wonder if they are interested in my money too, since i am paying international rates too, but as long as they teach well and i get to learn the skills i need, i don't mind whichever uni it is. pray hard that the uni i eventually choose is providing me with the correct experiences. since u are there, get as much first hand info from them about the uni and the course details. :)</p>
              <p>good luck and keep going on!!! cheers!</p>

              <p>I am actually thinking of taking either 'International Studies' or 'Political Sciences &amp; International Relations'. After all, I am going to graduate with a Diploma in Advertising &amp; Public Relations in three months time and I want to go into diplomacy (PR-related) and the 'development' industry (aka your WTO and organisations like that).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If I wanted to take Econs/History or B/F I would have took a Diploma in Business Administration. Anyways this is the career path I want to take...</p>
