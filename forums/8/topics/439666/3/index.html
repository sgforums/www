              <p>Indeed. But SATs is an all-rounded exam which has a Mathematics component (as well as Critical Reasoning and more). TOEFL is simply an English Language test which tests one's proficiency in that language.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You brought up IELTS. Under Yonsei UIC guidelines, I can use either the TOEFL, TOEIC or IELTS results to apply. Should I just stick with TOEFL? Or is IELTS better?</p>

              <p>On your question, I think you should put in that you would quit your local course if they accept you in. It does show how committed you are to get into their university. I would do that, if I were in your position...</p>

              <p>I guess the most important thing we as Singaporeans need to learn is know how and when to switch from colloquial Singapore English (or Singlish as what some say) to 'proper' English without the "lahs, lorhs, and leys".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For me, switching isn't a problem and I guess I can still speak proper English, given that I communicate with many Caucasians (with slight concerted effort in doing so) and there is no time where they (or me) make a double-take...</p>

              <p>English is somewhat derived from German.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That's why English speakers don't find it hard to understand German as much as French. I know, because I learnt German and did not find it hard unlike French. By the way, I started learning both at the same time but I'm much more fluent at German than French. If you don't believe, go learn German. It isn't that hard to pick up, actually.</p>

              <p>TOEFL is actually conducted regularly in Singapore under the TOEFL iBT system. There are numerous tests, but are usually taken up quite quickly and registration is limited to slots.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I understand that pursuant to a law passed in R.O.K in 2010, TOEFL/TOEIC scores are technically not allowed to be used as submission for English Language proficiency, or at least for Korean students. Anyway, I guess there is no harm in submitting more than what is required...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks for your advice on IELTS. I think I'd apply for the TOEFL iBT test first, and then my SATs. I've really got a lot this semester and I think I'd be pretty stretched tight (in terms of my workload) too.</p>

              <p>Am now in Seoul to recce the different universities.</p>

              <p>Went to Yonsei University to check out their Underwood International College entry requirements earlier today. For those that might want to consider Yonsei UIC, this is for your info. The admissions department mentioned that they accept foreign students with the qualifications of one's home country and that they do not need TOEFL/TOEIC certificates.

              <p>Uhmm.....</p>
              <p>In my opinion Singaporeans are not native English speakers.</p>
              <p>Well, it depends on your understanding and definition of "native English speakers", but for me personally, my definition is like this.....</p>
              <p>I believe that native English speakers should possess the underlying fundamental cultural building blocks, and the language, English, is the manifestation and crystalyzation of that culture and values, and heritage.</p>
              <p>As such,</p>
              <p>In my opinion only Anglo-Saxon derived nations are the true native English speakers.</p>
              <p>The others like Singapore, India, Kenya, Nigeria, etc all the other countries that use English either due to historical reasons or economic reasons, are NOT native English speakers.</p>
              <p>In my opinion those countries, including Singapore, are peripheral countries and peripheral speakers of English language, not the core, and will forever be second-tier periphery, because they do not have the basic fundamental building blocks to support the English language to manifest as a strong representative language which can carry their values, traditions, norms, heritage, philosophy, culture.</p>
              <p>In other words,</p>
              <p>Harry Potter was made by an Englishwoman author, and would have NEVER come out from Singapore.</p>
              <p>Singapore can only scratch the surface, and sometimes mangle badly at that, such as the case with the phenomenon known as "Singlish" which is a pidgin bastardized English, but that is all that Singapore can do. It does not have the capability to perform a deep dive, and do more.</p>
              <p>Thusly,</p>
              <p>I conclude,</p>
              <p>Only Anglo-Saxon countries are the real native English speakers.</p>

              <p>In my opinion if someone can soak up 100% the values, ideas, culture, traditions, of a certain cultural group, he can express the language of that culture and can manifest it as a representative tool and medium of communication; then yes in that case he is a native English speaker.</p>
              <p>But most Singaporeans are not.</p>
              <p>Harry Potter was written by an Englishwoman named JK Rowling.</p>
              <p>Harry Potter would have never been written by Tan Ah Kow.</p>
              <p>Because JK Rowling is in possession of deep and strong English language as a manifestation of her thoughts and ideas and imagination and heritage and folklore and mythology.</p>
              <p>Tan Ah Kow would be confused because he cannot think of certain words or expressions, because even for "coffee" he is used to saying "Kopi-O" at Singapore hawker centres.</p>
              <p>Maybe, Lee Kuan Yew is at the same level as JK Rowling.</p>
              <p>But, Lee Hsien Loong, I doubt is at the same level as JK Rowling.</p>
              <p>I believe only very few elderly people like those at Lee Kuan Yew's age are capable and are at the same native-level like mastery of English language.</p>
              <p>Most people, like Lee Hsien Loong age, and below, they are already not at the same level as JK Rowling.</p>

              <p>I think I'm still going to do the TOEFL test anyways. The cost for me isn't the issue, the entire paperwork for the university application is, haha!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyways, today I managed to cover Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, Korea University and Sungkyunkwan University. The first two have a course in International Studies which is taught in English (along with Yonsei UIC, of course) while SKKU doesn't have International Studies — their closest equivalent is International Economics and the like...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yonsei UIC doesn't require the TOEFL, and neither does Korea University. These are the two that I'm aiming for though. But they said that entrance to both Yonsei UIC and KU is by document grading, and all documents that might aid my effort would count towards it (it is under a "secret" 200 point system which no one knows how it exactly functions). So I'm going to do my TOEFL and my TOEIC anyways. I have the time too — a whole two years.</p>
