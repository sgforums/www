              <p>FireIce, please move this thread if you deem necessary (I hope it can remain here, though).</p>
              <p>——————————</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who still as of now don't know my background, I'm a Singapore citizen born in this country but my mother is South Korean of birth (she has since received her pink I.C. more than 25 years ago).</p>
              <p>Ok here is my little situation which I'm troubled/worried about.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am graduating from a local polytechnic with a diploma in March 2012. After undergoing the obligatory 2 or 2.5 years of National Service, I would be able to proceed on to University in 2014/15.<br><br>Of course, having relatives still living in South Korea bolsters my desire to study there. An institution of higher learning which I'm looking at is the Yonsei University - Underwood Int'l College (Yonsei UIC). A requirement for entry into Yonsei UIC for foreign students is that they would have to undergo a TOEFL exam unless he or she is from a 'native English country', which a score from an English exam would then suffice. By the way, the last national exam that I took English Language was my GCE "O" Levels in which I received an A1.<br><br>That brings me to the question. Are Singaporeans considered 'native English speakers', and is Singapore considered by South Korea to be a 'native English country'? By virtue of the fact that Singaporeans of my generation (at least) technically grow up with English, would I be considered as a 'native English speaker'? I hope someone here can give some insight into this.<br><br>My second question might not be able to be answered, but I guess it is worth the pot-shot. Does any of you know the minimum qualifications (GPA score, etc.) for Yonsei University - Underwood Int'l College? Or perhaps if someone you know went there (though likely not as I'm sure Yonsei UIC is not one of most Singapore students' choices for Degree education)? Their website does not state the requirements for foreign students, and I believe they accept international students on a case-by-case basis.<br><br>I hope someone can help me on this. The redtape and excessive bureaucracy from the Korean side (Yonsei UIC Admissions Dept and the South Korean Embassy in Singapore) is really frustrating.</p>

              <p>Sorry to disappoint you, the fact is Singapore is not a native speaking country.    Native speaking countries are Australia, New Zealand, and of course the place of English origin England.</p>
              <p>We were under the British rule once upon a time but this did not make us a native English speaking country.</p>
              <p>The fact that you scored distinction A1 in your  GCE "O" Level may put you in a very good position for entry to the uni.   You may want to find out directly from that uni you want to go on whether they accept distinction in the English language for "O" Level.</p>

              <p>That is due to Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, lucida, 'lucida grande', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">I found the following paragraphs on NTU's website:<br><br>"The university has a distinguished lineage with roots that go back to 1955. We began as Nanyang University (Nantah), the first Chinese-language university in Southeast Asia, through donations from all walks of life, with the Yunnan Garden campus donated by the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan. <br><br>Nanyang Technological Institute was reborn on the same campus in 1981 with government funding to educate practice-oriented engineers for the burgeoning Singapore economy. In 1991 we became Nanyang Technological University with the absorption of the National Institute of Education." <br><br>source: <a style="color: #0044cc;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg/publicportal/...+us/history.htm">http://www.ntu.edu.sg/publicportal/...+us/history.htm</a> <br><br>First of all, anyone who is old enough can tell you <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Nantah was founded by late Tan Lark Sye in 1953 but unfortunately closed down by Lee Kuan Yew in 1980. </span></span></strong>(PAP supporters among Nantah alumni always insist that Nantah was "merged" with Singapore University to form the NUS -- make it more palatable to public perception). On the other hand, NTU was founded by Lee Kuan Yew in Nantah's old campus as NTI in 1981 initially and upgraded to NTU in 1992. <br><br>Secondly, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">don't forget that Nantah was a real CHINESE university (the only Chinese university outside of China and Taiwan so far)</span></span></strong> while NTU is an English university with a non-significant "Department of Chinese". (NUS has one too, nowadays, which decent university in the world does not have a Chinese Department?). <br><br>So you see, other than sharing the same premise, the two universities have no commonality AT ALL, what "lineage with roots" are they talking about ? <br>NTU did NOT began in 1955 and NTU did NOT begin as and never been a “Chinese-language university” as claimed in the passages on NTU’s website.<br><br>Here is the fact: <br><br>the property of now defunct Nanyang University was confiscated and given to NTU, the whole campus was ransacked and almost demolished, the old buildings torn down and replaced by new ones,<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> the beloved Nantah Gate was defaced and cut off from the campus by the highway (They wanted to tear down the Gate but no contractors dared to take the contract). </span></span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">After Nantah was closed down in 1980, no one heard about Nantah or Tan Lark Sye on media until early 1990’s when someone in PAP sensed that China</span></span></strong> was going to be reckoned with as another powerful country on earth. They started to see the economical value of Nantah's name (which they hastenly discarded in 1980) in pursuing the Chinese business, but it is an historical fact that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">the regime had been most unkind to Nantah and Tan Lark Sye</span></span></strong>, the big question was how could they erase this historical blackmark in people's mind ? The whole PAP propaganda machinery with the help from media has been working on this single idea ever since. They seemed to have found the ideal solution to their problem, namely, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">to modify and distort the history of Nantah and NTU ... </span></span></strong><br><br>First they changed the Chinese abbreviation of NTU from LiDa to NanDa (i.e. Nantah) on Chinese media which created an illusion on the mind of Chinese readers and audience as if Nantah was still alive. Later, Dr. Su Guaning started to push renaming of NTU's official name to "Nanyang University" which naturally did not go well with the silent Chinese community in Singapore and met vocal opposition Nantah alumni on web (you of course did hear a lot of opposition on Chinese media and you know why). <br><br>Consequently the idea was dropped in 2004 (the rumor has it that Lee Kuan Yew was annoyed by comments made by oppositions of renaming and requests by some supporters of renaming to rehabilitate his most despised enemy Tan Lark Sye) while they were planning a huge ceremony to be held in June of 2005. <br><br>With name-change or no name-change, now they just want you to believe that this angmo NTU is the same Nantah built in 1953 by Tan Lark Sye with the help from Chinese people of southeast Asia, and it has been operating since 1955, as if nothing had happened in the year of 1980 ("No, no, no, we never closd down Nantah, what happened in 1980 was just your imagination, honey"). <br><br>A Nantah alumnus gave me a metaphor to aptly describe the fabrication by NTU: "Someone killed your poor Chinese mother and confiscated your little atap hut. A twenty-ish Angmo woman comes along and moves in the hut. they now tell you in their <img class="inlineimg" style="vertical-align: middle;" title="Mad" src="http://singaporeforums.com/forum/images/smilies/mad.gif" border="0" alt="">straight-face that this "50 years" (really? but she looks like in her 20s) old angmo jarbo is really your old mother you so dearly missed and the good news is that she never got killed!" <br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">How can people believe such shameless fabrication and distortion of history? (Don't tell me Singaporeans and NTU students are so gullible and stupid to put up with such nonsensical political propaganda. Are they?)</span></span></strong></span></p>

Born into a peasant family of seven of very limited means, and orphaned young, he had little chance of an education before he made his way to Nanyang in his teens in 1916 together with his brothers.<br><br>After reaching Singapore, he worked in one of Tan Kah Kee’s factories, and within half a year he was promoted to a responsible position in the elder Tan’s Khiam Aik (Qianyi) company. Not long after, he left the company to set up with his brothers a rubber enterprise which, however, lost half its capital in a year.<br><br>After several years of struggling by oneself, he built up his own Aik Hoe (Yihe) rubber company and became one of the leading rubber industrialists of the region. He expanded his business to all parts of Malaya, Thailand and India, and diversified into insurance, paper and cement industries. His career as industrialist met the peak in the 1950’s when his company reaped huge profits from the rising rubber price.<br><br>He, himself was also an activist, and like other Chinese entrepreneurs of his time, believed in the value and importance of education. As chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in the 1950’s, he fought for citizenship for the Chinese of Singapore and for the Chinese language to be counted as one of the official languages.<br><br>As the respectful chairman of Hokkien Huay Kuan (Hokkien clan association) he developed many schools under the auspices of the association: Daonan, Aitong, Guanghua, Nanqiao and Chongfu. He also contributed to financing the Jimei schools founded by Tan Kah Kee.<br><br>In 1957 he donated considerable sums to Thailand’s Hokkien clan association to build overseas Chinese schools. His contributions to education, however, were not confined to Chinese schools. In 1949 when the University of Malaya was set up he gave it $300, 000, and between 1950 and 1960 he contributed towards the building fund of schools of different language media.<br><br>His most outstanding contribution, however, was the initiating of the founding of Nanyang University of Singapore. He personally donated a sum of $5 million to its building fund, as well as 523 acres of land for its campus on behalf of the Hokkien Huay Kuan.<br><br>In the period 1953 – 1963 he was appointed as the Chairman of Nanyang University’s Executive Committee, and gave both effort and money to look after various aspects of the university – building, teaching staff, research facilities, library, student welfare and others.<br><br>The founding of Nanyang University was a highly significant act for the Singapore Chinese community. Chinese from all walks of life donated towards its building fund. It had an effect on Chinese education in the region and beyond. One may say the setting up of a Chinese Studies department in Ngee Ann College, the University of Singapore and the University of Malaya stemmed from it. The establishment of the Chinese University in Hong Kong, the Overseas Chinese Chongsheng University in Thailand and the Southern College in Johore, Malaysia, may also have been inspired by the ideals underlying the founding of Nanyang University.<br><br>Tan Lark Sye died in 1972 at age 76 and in 1974 a Tan Lark Sye scholarship was set up, and in 1998 the Tan Lark Sye professorship in Chinese language and culture was established to honour this peasant boy from China made good.<br><br><a style="color: #668844; font-weight: bold;" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/641/451/1600/TanLarkSye.1.jpg"><img style="width: 297px; height: 236px; padding: 4px; border: 1px solid #dddddd;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/641/451/320/TanLarkSye.1.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="275" height="172"></a></div>

              <p>He is a hakka peranakan. Tony Tan I am not sure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In my interpretation, the Babas' newly-published distinctions between
                      "Straits Chinese" and "Babas" along cultural lines have to be taken
                      seriously when accounting for the time of their appearance and the more
                      recent past, but not further back (namely, the period preceding the
                      Japanese Occupation).</p>
              <p>According to the new cultural definition, a Baba should also be a Hokkien.</p>
              <p>According to some <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">purist Hokkien Babas, who regard themselves as true-blue
                      Baba jati, non-Hokkien Babas are only Baba chelup.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The expression suggests that the Baba chelup are only superficially dipped
                      in the paint of Babaness and are at best "nominal" Babas.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>Apart from the
                      conceptual history until the late '50s which contradicts such a narrow
                      conception of a Baba, we have a few examples of prominent non-Hokkien
                      Babas.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> First and foremost, there is Hakka Baba Lee Kuan Yew </span></span></strong>(who regards himself
                      as a Baba only technically).</p>
              <p>Others are the Melaka dondang sayang singer
                      and serunee player Yeo Kim Swee, who is a Hainanese Baba, and Ambassador to
                      Germany Walter Woon, who is a Cantonese Baba.</p>

              <p>According to some <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">purist Hokkien Babas, who regard themselves as true-blue Baba jati, non-Hokkien Babas are only Baba chelup.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The expression suggests that the Baba chelup are only superficially dipped in the paint of Babaness and are at best "nominal" Babas.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>Apart from the conceptual history until the late '50s which contradicts such a narrow conception of a Baba, we have a few examples of prominent non-Hokkien Babas.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">First and foremost, there is Hakka Baba Lee Kuan Yew</span></span></strong> (who regards himself as a Baba only technically).</p>

              <p>Sorry to disappoint you, the fact is Singapore is not a native
              speaking country.    Native speaking countries are
              Australia, New Zealand, and of course the place of English origin
              England.</p>
              <p>We were under the British rule once upon a time but this did not
              make us a native English speaking country.</p>
              <p>The fact that you scored distinction A1 in your  GCE "O"
              Level may put you in a very good position for entry to the uni.
                You may want to find out directly from that uni you want to
              go on whether they accept distinction in the English language for
              "O" Level.</p>

Half of Britons have German blood. You're right that Singapore isn't a native english speaking country. However, you're wrong that english came from England.
