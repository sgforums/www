              <p>You received A1 for English in the GCE'O' levels.</p>

              <p>BTW I do not think Singapore have the status of Native English

              What with Malay as a national language, English as a working
              language, and Mandarin as the preparatory language for the future
              rise of China, it is a mess here.</p>

              <p>Yes. I checked earlier today. Singapore is indeed not considered a 'Native English Country', or at least by the South Korean Ministry of Education.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The ten countries they consider nationals to be 'Native English Speakers' are the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Jamaica, Ghana, South Africa and Ireland. How the heck Nigeria, Ghana and Jamaica got in that list I have no idea.</p>

              <p>Sorry to disappoint you, the fact is Singapore is not a native

              Australia, New Zealand, and of course the place of English origin
              England.</p>
              <p>We were under the British rule once upon a time but this did not
              make us a native English speaking country.</p>
              <p>The fact that you scored distinction A1 in your  GCE "O"
              Level may put you in a very good position for entry to the uni.
                You may want to find out directly from that uni you want to
              go on whether they accept distinction in the English language for
              "O" Level.</p>

              <p>Personally, I would also want to go for the TOEFL/TOEIC tests just in case. I mean, for me, English (written or aural or whatsoever) isn't really a problem. I guess I will just see this getting another paper qualification. Ain't that troublesome either. For the TOEFL iBT I believe I can attain a 100 over 120.</p>

              <p>That brings about another problem. I don't want to apply to Yonsei University - Underwood Int'l College after getting my Diploma, and then ask for a stay till 2014 to accommodate my NS obligations, as it won't look good on me. The TOEFL test is only valid for 2 years upon receival of test results. So do I only take the TOEFL test when I'm serving my second year of NS? I fear NS would somehow 'corrupt' my standard of English, and I'm sure that fear isn't without grounds. After all, your vocabulary gets very 'advanced' after NS...</p>

              <p>but then if its me, i would apply to the uni after my diploma, and tell them i want to defer my commencement on whichever year i finishes my ns. i dont think it will look bad on you, as ns is practised in south korea too.</p>
              <p>i would want to set my future path right before doing ns. ultimately, the standards of acceptance of universities usually becomes higher as the years go by.</p>

              <p>but then if its me, i would apply to the uni after my diploma,
              and tell them i want to defer my commencement on whichever year i
              finishes my ns. i dont think it will look bad on you, as ns is
              practised in south korea too.</p>
              <p>i would want to set my future path right before doing ns.
              ultimately, the standards of acceptance of universities usually
              becomes higher as the years go by.</p>

              <p>I guess I would do the TOEFL twice, once at the end of this year so I can use the results if I need to apply next year, and once during my second year of National Service which would likely be used for Yonsei UIC.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In South Korea, their NS can be done at the age of 28, so most students going to Unis/Colleges there serve their national obligations after completion of their academics. That is why I mentioned about not deferring for Yonsei UIC.</p>
