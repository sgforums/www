            <div class='col-md body'>I can say that I have... Met the person that I love before I have met her...<br><br>There has always been this thing at the back of my mind that says something to me... back when I was just a kid.<br><br>I can declare now that I love my wife... even though I do not know who she is going to be. It may be someone I already know...  or it may be someone that I have yet to meet.<br><br>Why do I say these things.. because I have decided to love her... whoever she may be... whatever that she was and whoever she turns out to be. This is regardless of whether I know who she is because I know that I will love her. This sets the stage for me to be prepared when I do marry her.<br><br>As for, have I met the person yet... I would like to say that I have... just that I need a little more time to be sure, to really know her a little better. But until the journey is completed... we won't know.<br><br>There is this saying about Passion:<br><br>There are many things that will catch your eyes, but few will catch your heart. Pursue those.<br><br>Leave not a chance for regret for most of the time, we regret not what we did, but rather what we did not do.<br><br>Ok, the story goes like this. I have this love of this person in my mind, heart and soul you might say. I don't really think that she exists.. not till now.<br><br>Before I met HER, I had relationships with people that were close to the mark... I mean that I do love them...but something was just missing. I couldn't figure it out until we parted amicably that there were some differences between us. Just that we were so into the relationship that we fail to see that the writing was on the wall. That things weren't meant to be.<br><br>ok.. now I am drifting from the topic. The answer is yes, I met her... the person that I loved even though I did not meet her until recently.<br><br>I have this thing with beautiful women. Its not that I do not appreciate their beauty. Just that sometimes or in fact with me.. all the time... looks are just not enough .. it doesn't cut it for me. And my experience is that (Not all the time) beautiful people get away with thinking that looks are enough.. the character and personality is secondary. So when I met this person... She was ..umm... to me, another beautiful face... and that was it... No interest in anything eles for me.<br><br>NOT until I spoke with her. (You see, stereotyping will kill our chances for a happy life!!) I was so drawn to her. The mind, the beauty of her soul and the marvelous-ness of her love for life and people.<br><br>But I am still giving it time... I don't want to jump into it.<br><br>did I stray from the topic? sorry ..<br><br>But ok, all in all. I have met ther person that I love even before I met her. Corny isn't it?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Derek Nature (edited 06 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with Derek Nature, I think the song actually is saying that this girl is exactly the singer's ideal girl.  that's why even before the singer knows her (or even know who she is) he loves her already.<br><br>about netlove, well, it really depends.  it's possible but to my observation there are many people out there who treat the net just for a playground and since it takes two to make a relationship works...<br><br>------------------<br>Life is too full of random cruelties to take anything personally</div>
