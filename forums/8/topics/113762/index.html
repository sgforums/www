            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>This is a tribute to the nice guys.. The nice guys that finish last, that never become more than friends, that endure hours of whining and bit@hing about what assholes guys are, while disproving the very point. This is dedicated to those guys who always provide a shoulder to lean on but restrain themselves to tentative hugs, those guys who hold open doors and give reassuring pats on the back and sit patiently outside the changing room at department stores..<br><br>This is in honor of the guys that obligingly reiterate how cute/beautiful/smart/funny/sexy their female friends are at the appropriate moment, because they know most girls need that litany of support... This is in honor of the guys with open minds, with laid-back attitudes, with honest concern.. This is in honor of the guys who respect a girlÂ’s every facet, from her privacy to her theology to her clothing style..<br><br>This is for the guys who escort their drunk, bewildered female friends back from parties and never take advantage once theyÂ’re at her door, for the guys who accompany girls to bars as buffers against the rest of the creepy male population, for the guys who know a girl is fishing for compliments but give them out anyway..<br><br>For the guys who always play by the rules in a game where the rules favor cheaters, for the guys who are accredited as boyfriend material but somehow donÂ’t end up being boyfriends, for all the nice guys who are overlooked, underestimated, and unappreciated, for all the nice guys who are manipulated, misled, and unjustly abandoned, this is for you..<br><br>This is for that time she left 40 urgent messages on your cell phone, and when you called her back, she spent three hours painstakingly dissecting two sentences her boyfriend said to her over dinner...  And even though you thought her boyfriend was a chump and a jerk, you assured her that it was all ok and she shouldnÂ’t worry about it..<br><br>This is for that time she interrupted the best killing spree youÂ’d ever orchestrated in GTA3 to rant about a rumor that romantically linked her and the guy she thinks is the most repulsive person in the world... And even though you thought it was immature and you had nothing against the guy, you paused the game for two hours and helped her concoct a counter-rumor to spread around the floor..<br><br>This is also for that time she didnÂ’t have a date, so after numerous vows that there was nothing Â“seriousÂ” between the two of you, she dragged you to a party where you knew nobody, the beer was awful, and she flirted shamelessly with you, justifying each fit of reckless teasing by announcing to everyone: Â“oh, but weÂ’re just friends!Â” And even though you were invited purely as a symbolic warm body for her ego, you went anyways. Because youÂ’re nice like that..<br><br>The nice guys donÂ’t often get credit where credit is due. And perhaps more disturbing, the nice guys donÂ’t seem to get laid as often as they should.. And I wish I could logically explain this trend, but I canÂ’t.. From what I have observed on campus and what I have learned from talking to friends at other schools and in the workplace, the only conclusion I can form is that many girls are just illogical, manipulative bit@hes...<br><br>Many of them claim they just want to date a nice guy, but when presented with such a specimen, they say irrational, confusing things such as Â“oh, heÂ’s too nice to dateÂ” or Â“he would be a good boyfriend but heÂ’s not for meÂ” or Â“he already puts up with so much from me, I couldnÂ’t possibly ask him out!Â” or the most frustrating of all: Â“no, it would ruin our friendship.Â”<br><br>Yet, they continue to lament the lack of datable men in the world, and they expect their too-nice-to-date male friends to sympathize and apologize for the men that are jerks.. Sorry, guys, girls like that are beyond my ability to fathom. I canÂ’t figure out why the connection breaks down between what they say (I want a nice guy!) and what they do (IÂ’m going to sleep with this complete ass now!)...<br><br>But one thing I can do, is say that the nice-guy-finishes-last phenomenon doesnÂ’t last forever... There are definitely many girls who grow out of that train of thought and realize they should be dating the nice guys, not taking them for granted. The tricky part is finding those girls, and even trickier, finding the ones that are single...<br><br>So, until those girls are found, I propose a toast to all the nice guys... You know who you are, and I know youÂ’re sick of hearing yourself described as ubiquitously nice. But the truth of the matter is, the world needs your patience in the department store, your holding open of doors, your party escorting services, your propensity to be a sucker for a pretty smile...<br><br>For all the crazy, inane, absurd things you tolerate, for all the situations where you are the faceless, nameless hero, my accolades, my acknowledgement, and my gratitude go out to you... You do have credibility in this society, and your well deserved vindication is coming...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hazi... extract from: Why single women are attracted to jerks. By Don Diebel<br><br>Women are not "bad" people at all. Quite the opposite. But WOMEN ARE COMPLETELY CONTROLLED BY THIS ANCIENT MATING INSTINCT. Therefore, they have NO OTHER CHOICE but to go after ANY strong, dominant, untamable male. Or any male who can make her FEEL all those intense, uncontrollable feelings she lives for. The key to understanding women's strange behavior is "they have NO OTHER CHOICE" but to fall for these type of males.<br><br>If a nice guy became strong and dominant and HARD TO GET, she will go BLINDLY after that nice guy. The proof that I am right is that EVERY TIME a nice guy starts ACTING like a jerk, HE IS SUDDENLY WANTED BY ALL THOSE WOMEN WHO USED TO IGNORE HIM BEFORE. Women don't really want jerks. They probably want a nice guy. But ... "what women -WANT" and "what women NEED" are two different things. And their Subconscious <span style="color: red;">''genetic"</span> programming, that NEED to feel and feel and feel, will make women go uncontrollably after what they NEED, not what they want. And that is true of EVERY person, in any area of life. They will attract into their lives and/or will go toward what they subconsciously NEED, not what they think they want.<br><br>Even when women fall for a guy who is very handsome, they will leave him very quickly if they discover he is a nice guy who can be easily controlled by females. It happens all the time. And they will go after some not-so-handsome type, even ugly one, who is strong and dominant. Even married women will do the craziest things and go after THE guy who can "ignite" those feelings in them. What she loves are the feelings she FEELS. Not the guy! But in her mind, the guy and the feelings become inseparable. She loves the feelings. Therefore, she falls in love with the guy who can make her feel that way.<br><br>Women were "genetically" programmed to be SUCKERS for intense feelings and emotions in order to surrender and mate.</div>
