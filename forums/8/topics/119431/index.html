Give those jobs a try and if you really got the one that you really like, leave your job for it then. Forget about the few days of pay if you can really work in the job that you like. Who knows, your former boss might still pay you for a few days of work. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah.. i got this sorta dilemma recently as well.<br><br>company A offered me a position but i was arranged for a second interview with company B on thursday. told company A to give me more time to decide but i have only till friday.<br><br>though both positions are of similar nature, i thought company B's opening is more challenging.<br><br>thus, during my second interview, i shared my situation with the interviewers and hope that they could tell me what are my chances (doesnt mean i want a decision immediately but to assess my odds).<br><br>however, the reply from the female GM was: "...if you think you value this position, you should jolly well give up the other offer and wait..."<br><br>shortly after i left the building (with digust), i called company A and took up the offer.<br><br>one week later, company B called to offer me the post. i told them:<br><br>"too bad".</div>
