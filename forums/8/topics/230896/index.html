            <div class='col-md body'>alright saying stuffs abt teacher can do this and that but students cannot is like simply saying why did they implement age limitations? why got nc-16 m-18 and r-21? why pool centres only allow people people who are 16 above? cigarettes and alcohol 18 and above?<br><br>well in my opinion i do meet with people smth simple as.. "i got no money" (proceeds to enter KFC) or "you know how to do this question?", "dunno" (proceeds to ask teacher) *while teacher starts to explain* *interuption* "ya ya is like this do one aiya actually wanted to tell u just now one"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
