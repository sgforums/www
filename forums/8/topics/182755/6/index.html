They have all the while been very fierce in spreading such things. The only difference is whether they have gone overboard. Seriously, I have to call up the police for harrassment because they are harrassing non-stop just to get me to convert. And they are real extreme. Plus, they are the ones who are racists.

According to history of science, the Roman Catholics says the Earth is the centre, not Sun. People who believed otherwise are killed. Galileo was put on home arrest for suggesting that.</div>
