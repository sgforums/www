This routine involves a "bad cop" who threatens the subject, and a "good cop" who protects him from<br>the "bad cop". The subject is so grateful to the "good cop", and so worried about losing the good-will of his protector, that he invariably shows his appreciation<br>by telling the "good cop" what he wants to hear. In similar fashion, the "good" Christian talks about how much he loves and respects Muslims, while denouncing<br>the "bad" Christians who hate and have persecuted Muslims. The naive and ones lacking in knowledge of Christian history and bigotry will feel grateful<br>to the "good cop", and may automatically judge him to be a friend and reliable ally. Watch out for hidden motives behind such "friendship".<br><br>WHO BELIEVES IN THE SON OF GOD?<br><br>At the outset, the missionary will talk about his belief that Jesus is the messiah. Many Muslims don't find out until later, often after they have joined<br>a Christian friendship group, that their fundamental belief is that Jesus is god. Any talk about "the messiah" or "son of god" is merely a cover for that<br>belief, basic to Christianity .

As proof after proof<br>is shown to be meaningless, the missionary will hide behind his numbers, as if to say: "Well, we have so many more proofs, what's the difference if you<br>can disprove some of them". He will attempt to "split the difference" with you: "Well, even if half our proofs prove nothing, we still have another 25<br>or 50, or 150". Remember, all of their proofs can be shown to be untenable. Keep in mind that a faulty point is not worth 50% of a good point, or 25%,<br>or 10%. It is worthless. The simple mathematics are: 50 x 0 = 0, 100 x 0 = 0, 300 x 0 = 0.<br><br>CIRCULAR REASONING<br><br>Very often, the reasoning used by Christian missionaries is circular. That is, the "proof" only points to something is if you believe it in the first place,<br>and therefore is no proof at all.<br><br>MISTRANSLATION<br><br>Be aware of the problem of mistranslating. A person who is not familiar with Arabic can be lead to accept a mistranslating which puts a Christian "twist"<br>on a verse that never had such a meaning in the original.

And it is wrong for any person, christian or non-christain to view missionary work as a sales pitch.<br><br>The article is well-written and even though it is not without basis, the overall attitude ofthe article is rather negative in nature not just towards missionary work but towards christianity as well.<br><br>As someone did mention that missionary work happens more in unpenetrated areas so I'm guessing this article originated somewhere in the middle east where anti-christian views tend to be more extreme in nature. But let's take it with a pinch of salt, I'm no saint myself.<br><br>The article seems to assume a stance that all christians are evil and that they are nothing but "salesman" trying to con you. Just as I feel christians should show more respect for people with other faiths, I disagree with how all christians as having evil intentions when talking to you and that all christians use swindler tactics to trick people into their faith.<br><br>To be specific about one thing, I do not know about the writer's encounters, but basically all churches I know off (the orthodox ones at least) proudly declare Jesus as the son of God and this is never glossed over. In fact, it's supposed to be one of the first things Christians mention when reaching out to non-Christians.<br><br>The writer clearly shows how cynical he is about the Christian faith, and the amount of depth and organisation in his article goes to show how much thought he has put into going up against Christains and missionaries. His intentions and malice scare me to be honest.<br><br>I can't honestly say that the many bad examples of missionaries mentioned don't occur, but I can confidentaly say most of them don't occur. And to be honest, most of the many "sales tactics" he describes that missionaries do sound pretty absurb and extreme to me. You can ask any christian here in Singapore (the orthodox ones), I believe you'll get a similar response.<br><br>If you're a christian you've read the above, then beware not to piss people off in the same manner.<br><br>If you're a non-christian, then I hope you won't assume that all Christians are money swindling salesmen who use conmen tactics. Not all muslims are members of Al Qaeda right?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just to add, a lot of what he says are rather subjective. Like how the christians mention 100 proofs of which half are untrue or something like that. It seems like a pretty sweeping statememt as far as I see. And he is telling the reader to dismiss any possible fact that the missionary presents, even before verifying it. Sounds almost like assume guilty unless proven innocent. In any case, a missionary who keeps coming up with untrue examples or non-existant evidence to support his claims hardly sounds like a real missionary.</div>

Listened, not convinced, and they just keep coming back with the same weak arguments to try to convince u. Evidence? someone here said he believes in the evidence provided by God. What evidence is there other than a book? These people don't seem to realise that science is part of God's creation too. U can't believe in God and yet distrust his creation. How ironic. How do u expect hypocrites like that to convert anyone other than the dumb?</div></blockquote>Hmm very sensitive.. Science is the study of god's creations. Whose study? Humans. There is no perfect human in the world. Hence, we can never trust fully 100% on some of the studies of Man, including science. The theories discovered today, may all of a sudden be flawed in 10 years, 20 years, 100 years time. We studied that the smallest particle was atom. Then the theory changed. And changed, and changed. I don't know what is the smallest particle identified now. But who knows, it might be changed in future. That is science for you. It will never unlock the secret of life. People used to say it is impossible to fly last time. Now science has make it even possible to travel to outer space. So now I say it will never unlock the secret of life, in future it will be unlock. But knowing science and its flaws, we do not know whether what is thought to be unlock is still unlocked or not. It is an eternal cycle. Think about it. Even if science one day eventually manage to discover the very very smallest particle that makes up eveything(maybe an atom of an atom), "who" created it?<br>It is not just "a book". To attend to our pathetic lowly human brains, it came in the form of "a book". The "book" could have been made up by Man. Who knows right? To answer the question, is almost of the same degree to answer the question of Existence. And the attempt to answer the question, leads to each individual finding the religion that mostly answer their queries. To each his own. Mankind do not like to be wronged. That is why religion becomes a sensitive issue.</div>

It is the people who makes the religion look bad so <strong>please</strong> do not stereotype. Islam in facts encourages all Muslims to live peacefully and in harmony with their "neighbours" regardless of their religion. In history of Islam, the wars being fought was to DEFEND. Taking away one's life is a very big sin, but once upon a time the prophet was given a message from god, so as to defend yourselves so that Islam will not be wiped away from the face of this earth. And so they fought for their own survival. If you realise, that is happening everywhere in nature.<br>What is happening now is a misconception. These so called Muslims had their minds skewed so extremely, that "defend" has become a new meaning for them. Hence the mindless terrorism in the name of Islam. So do not say Islam is an aggressive religion. That is a baseless remark.[/b]</blockquote>How come I never hear Muslims condemning the terrorists in the nespapers on their own accord? I see them protesting like crazy over the cartoons? What is more important here if you say"Taking away one's life is a very big sin" in islam? Cartoons or mass murder?</div>
