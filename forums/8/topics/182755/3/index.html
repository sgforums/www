            <div class='col-md body'>I read through this whole thread.<br><br>I shall now attempt to answer all this once and for all...<br><br>Don't blame the Christians for trying to convert you guys. They are doing it out of care and concern.<br><br>But the way they evangelise...might not always be right.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>By saying that you will go to hell if you are not a Christian...you are simply instigating fear into the person to make him become a Christian. It is like pointing a gun at a person and saying "Be a Christian or die". It is not right! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Our God is a faithful, kind, caring, loving God. He loves you very much and so does not want you to be scared of him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>People should evangelise FOR God and not AS God. Do not say things to offend others, and if you are not sure, don't evangelise. Check the Bible first before saying anything. Quote verses if possible.<br><br>It totally doesn't matter what kind of Christian you are, be it Catholic, Anglican, Evangelist, Presbyterian, Protestant, so long as you "Obey the Lord with all you heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind" and "Treat thy neighbour as thyself".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Do not PESTER others to come to church. It is their desicion whether they want to accept Jesus or not. God gave humans the gift of will. It is your prerogrative whatever you want to do.<br><br>Whatever it is, let this matter not split us apart. Together we are Singaporeans, whether Buddhist, Christian, Hindu or Muslim. That is what racial harmony is. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Chill out, yeah? The next time someone pesters you to be a Christian, just tell him firmly, NO. A real friend won't force you to do things you don't want to do.<br><br>Peace out.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
