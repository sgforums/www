Muslim n Christianity are both aggressive religions. The wars fought down... but if u read both the Bible n the Quran.. the Irony is that they are all descendents from brothers. Split apart by thier own religion resulting in today. Both have been aggressors n played the part of untold misery to the human race. Man will always be weak till the end of time.. only the day when judgement day comes.. will we know the true answer.</div></blockquote>Be careful of what you say bro.. (Anyway Muslim is not a religion, Islam is the religion) Islam, I repeat again is <strong>NOT</strong>, an aggressive religion. Read my previous posts on page 5 man.. It is the people who makes the religion look bad so <strong>please</strong> do not stereotype. Islam in facts encourages all Muslims to live peacefully and in harmony with their "neighbours" regardless of their religion. In history of Islam, the wars being fought was to DEFEND. Taking away one's life is a very big sin, but once upon a time the prophet was given a message from god, so as to defend yourselves so that Islam will not be wiped away from the face of this earth. And so they fought for their own survival. If you realise, that is happening everywhere in nature.<br>What is happening now is a misconception. These so called Muslims had their minds skewed so extremely, that "defend" has become a new meaning for them. Hence the mindless terrorism in the name of Islam. So do not say Islam is an aggressive religion. That is a baseless remark.</div>

It might even just be a time issue, your friend choses to spend more time at church then at CCA, which would be his choice. His reasons only he would know.<br><br>I have Christian friends who take up takwandoe and karate, and their churches are not against it in anyway.

            <div class='col-md body'>To all,<br><br>Why busy ourselves defending our religion and criticising those of others. This is a useless venture. "We are just a human being searching for a path to discover truth and happiness and to make our life beneficial for others." There are already enough problems in the world, what is the use of creating more by having bigoted religious views and conceitedly defaming others?<br>"I'm this religion,and you're that religion. But, mine is better," it is like turning chocolate frosting into garbage: what was delicious becomes useless. Instead, we would be much wiser to look inside ourselves and the antidotes to intolerance, pride and attachment. The true criterion of whether we are a religious or spiritual person is whether we have a kind heart towards others and a wise approach to life. We can't judge another person's motivation, nor should we waste our time trying to evaluate others' actions. We can only look at our own mind, thereby determining whether our actions, words and thoughts are beneficial or not. For that reason we must be ever attentive not to let our minds come under the influence of selfishness, attachment, anger, etc.<br>Looking holy and important on the outside brings no real happiness either now or in the furture. However, if we have a kind heart and a pure motivation free of selfish, ulterior motives, a real practitioner we are indeed. Then our lives become meaningful, joyful and beneficial for others.<br>Each situation has to be regarded individually.However, in general, if we feel "They are criticizing my belief.They think I am stupid for believing that ,"it means we are clinging onto our beliefs.We are thinking "These beliefs are good because they are mine. If someone criticizes them, they are criticizing me." That is simply attachment and is not very productive. Such an attitude should be abandoned. We are not our beliefs. That others challenge our beliefs does not mean that we are stupid.<br>On the other hand, that does not mean that we automatically agree with everything other people say; we do not abandon our beliefs and adopt theirs indiscriminately.<br><br>"Until the hells are empty, i vow not to become a Buddha;Only after all beings are saved,will i myself attain Bodhi."<br><br></div>

Listened, not convinced, and they just keep coming back with the same weak arguments to try to convince u. Evidence? someone here said he believes in the evidence provided by God. What evidence is there other than a book? These people don't seem to realise that science is part of God's creation too. U can't believe in God and yet distrust his creation. How ironic. How do u expect hypocrites like that to convert anyone other than the dumb?</div>
