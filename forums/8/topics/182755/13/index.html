            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dinky1409:</div><div class="quote_body">Hmm very sensitive.. Science is the study of god's creations. Whose study? Humans. There is no perfect human in the world. Hence, we can never trust fully 100% on some of the studies of Man, including science. The theories discovered today, may all of a sudden be flawed in 10 years, 20 years, 100 years time. We studied that the smallest particle was atom. Then the theory changed. And changed, and changed. I don't know what is the smallest particle identified now. But who knows, it might be changed in future. That is science for you. It will never unlock the secret of life. People used to say it is impossible to fly last time. Now science has make it even possible to travel to outer space. So now I say it will never unlock the secret of life, in future it will be unlock. But knowing science and its flaws, we do not know whether what is thought to be unlock is still unlocked or not. It is an eternal cycle. Think about it. Even if science one day eventually manage to discover the very very smallest particle that makes up eveything(maybe an atom of an atom), "who" created it?<br>It is not just "a book". To attend to our pathetic lowly human brains, it came in the form of "a book". The "book" could have been made up by Man. Who knows right? To answer the question, is almost of the same degree to answer the question of Existence. And the attempt to answer the question, leads to each individual finding the religion that mostly answer their queries. To each his own. Mankind do not like to be wronged. That is why religion becomes a sensitive issue.</div></blockquote>lets put it this way so its easy to understand. I found this interview. It basically rebuts and answers all your arguments.<br><br><strong>Why do you think religion is dangerous?</strong><br><br>The way it encourages a kind of childlike, slavish obedience is very negative. It teaches people to be satisfied with inadequate answers to profound questions. Thanks to science, we now have such an exciting grasp of the answers to such questions, it's kind of blasphemy not to embrace them.<br><br><strong>You blame religion for causing wars. Why do you think this is?</strong><br><br>If you're told from the cradle that it's a virtue to believe in something in spite of lack of evidence, that leaves you with nothing but faith. So there is nothing people of opposing faiths can do but disagree. That is bound to cause confrontation.<br><br><strong>What evidence is there that religious fundamentalism is on the rise in the USA as well as in the Middle East?</strong><br><br>There is the astonishing fact that in the USA not a single member of the Congress will admit to being an atheist-and they wouldn't be elected if they did. Yet if you look at the country's intellectual elite, especially the scientists, 90 per cent of them are atheists. That mismatch is a strange phenomenon in a democracy.<br><br><strong>How do you feel about faith in schools?</strong><br><br>Ghettoisation is a terrible danger for society. What hope is there when children are segregated and taught their own version of history, with the other people as the bad guys? You're bound to get tribal wars. Every time I hear phrases such as "Catholic child" or "Muslim child", I flinch. There's no such thing. There is a child of Catholic or Muslim parents who, when they're old enough to be able to decide for themselves, may choose to follow a religion.<br><br><strong>If there were no religion where would that leave morality?</strong><br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>If your only reason to be good is that you're frightened of a great CCTV in the sky watching your every move, it doesn't say much for you as a person. There is something ancient about the impulse to morality, a strong empathetic tendency in the human mind, with clear Darwinian roots. This genetic empathy came first- religion climbed on the back of it.</strong></span><br><br>all of this, especially the last bit in red, shows just how religion is also just a human thing. Like u said, humans can never be trusted fully 100%. So how can u trust the bible which was claimed by its human authors to be the accurate record of the word of god? How can u trust that it has passed on down the ages accurately as it was written and meant to be interpreted from day one? How can u trust that its meanings have not been distorted when translated from language to language as it got passed on down thru time?<br><br>U say God will provide, but all u are doing is to use God as a justification to trust some humans while not trusting others. Who are u to make that decision which humans to trust and which not to trust? U trust god to help u decide? But the truth is, YOU made the conscious decision on which humans to trust.<br><br>So many religious theories have been proven flawed, such as the assumption that earth is in the center of the solar system, yet u would continue to believe in religion alone and distrust science with the possiblity of today's theories being flawed in future? Where is the reason and logic within that? U cannot justify it thru faith alone, anymore than u can justify religious-based violence. Unless u're telling me u also think its justifiable for people to be burnt at the stake in the past for the sake of religion, or u're telling me u have double standards with regards to where religion and morality clashes.</div>

The ball landed in the fairway, but rolled directly toward a water trap. Quickly Moses raised his club, the water parted and it rolled to the other side, safe and sound.<br><br>Next, Jesus strolled up to the tee and hit a nice long one directly toward the same water trap. It landed right in the center of the pond and kind of hovered over the water. Jesus casually walked out on the pond and chipped the ball right up on to the green.<br><br>The third guy got up and sort of randomly whacked the ball. It headed out over the fence and into oncoming traffic on a nearby street. It bounced off a truck and hit a nearby tree. From there, it bounced onto the roof of a shack close by and rolled down into the gutter, down the drainspout, out onto the fairway and straight toward the aforementioned pond. On the way to the pond, the ball hit a little stone and bounced out over the water and onto a lily pad, where it rested quietly. Suddenly, a very large bullfrog jumped up on a lily pad and snatched the ball into his mouth. Just then, an eagle swooped down and grabbed the frog and flew away. As they passed over the green, the frog squealed with fright and dropped the ball, which bounced right into the hole for a beautiful hole in one.<br><br>Moses turned to Jesus and said, "I hate playing with your Dad."<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

As they passed over the green, the frog squealed with fright and dropped the ball, which bounced right into the hole for a beautiful hole in one.<br><br>Moses turned to Jesus and said, "I hate playing with your Dad."<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>Ahh.....that speaks.<br><br>Ever happens for a reason.<br><br>oops!!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by HENG@:<br><strong><br>lets put it this way so its easy to understand. I found this interview. It basically rebuts and answers all your arguments.<br><br>Why do you think religion is dangerous?</strong><br><br>The way it encourages a kind of childlike, slavish obedience is very negative. It teaches people to be satisfied with inadequate answers to profound questions. Thanks to science, we now have such an exciting grasp of the answers to such questions, it's kind of blasphemy not to embrace them.</blockquote><blockquote>Originally posted by HENG@:<br><strong><br><br>You blame religion for causing wars. Why do you think this is?</strong><br><br>If you're told from the cradle that it's a virtue to believe in something in spite of lack of evidence, that leaves you with nothing but faith. So there is nothing people of opposing faiths can do but disagree. That is bound to cause confrontation.</blockquote><blockquote>Originally posted by HENG@:<br><strong><br><br>What evidence is there that religious fundamentalism is on the rise in the USA as well as in the Middle East?</strong><br><br>There is the astonishing fact that in the USA not a single member of the Congress will admit to being an atheist-and they wouldn't be elected if they did. Yet if you look at the country's intellectual elite, especially the scientists, 90 per cent of them are atheists. That mismatch is a strange phenomenon in a democracy.</blockquote><blockquote>Originally posted by HENG@:<br><br><strong>How do you feel about faith in schools?</strong><br><br>Ghettoisation is a terrible danger for society. What hope is there when children are segregated and taught their own version of history, with the other people as the bad guys? You're bound to get tribal wars. Every time I hear phrases such as "Catholic child" or "Muslim child", I flinch. There's no such thing. There is a child of Catholic or Muslim parents who, when they're old enough to be able to decide for themselves, may choose to follow a religion.</blockquote><blockquote>Originally posted by HENG@:<br><br><strong>If there were no religion where would that leave morality?</strong><br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>If your only reason to be good is that you're frightened of a great CCTV in the sky watching your every move, it doesn't say much for you as a person. There is something ancient about the impulse to morality, a strong empathetic tendency in the human mind, with clear Darwinian roots. This genetic empathy came first- religion climbed on the back of it.</strong></span></blockquote><blockquote>Originally posted by HENG@:<br><br>all of this, especially the last bit in red, shows just how religion is also just a human thing. Like u said, humans can never be trusted fully 100%. So how can u trust the bible which was claimed by its human authors to be the accurate record of the word of god? How can u trust that it has passed on down the ages accurately as it was written and meant to be interpreted from day one? How can u trust that its meanings have not been distorted when translated from language to language as it got passed on down thru time?<br><br>U say God will provide, but all u are doing is to use God as a justification to trust some humans while not trusting others. Who are u to make that decision which humans to trust and which not to trust? U trust god to help u decide? But the truth is, YOU made the conscious decision on which humans to trust.<br><br>So many religious theories have been proven flawed, such as the assumption that earth is in the center of the solar system, yet u would continue to believe in religion alone and distrust science with the possiblity of today's theories being flawed in future? Where is the reason and logic within that? U cannot justify it thru faith alone, anymore than u can justify religious-based violence. Unless u're telling me u also think its justifiable for people to be burnt at the stake in the past for the sake of religion, or u're telling me u have double standards with regards to where religion and morality clashes.</blockquote>Hi there. It is very interesting to read what you have posted. Some of your points are valid in fact all of the arguements are valid however, I believe my religion beliefs can counter back these pointers. Why do I say as such?<br>First of all, I am very tempted to try to counter back some of the points but I refuse. Why? Because it is in my religion teachings that if one who is not well versed or possess enough knowledge, try not to spread the teachings or teach the teachings because it will cause "misleading". (Sorry my command of English is not that strong, hope you understand what I'm trying to say in the previous statement).It is from these "misleads" that causes problems. I am not a "strong" Muslim but I roughly know a bit of here and there. But that is not good enough to convince someone else.<br>I know of a few pointers but I would rather someone else with a strong knowledge of Islam to tell you of these pointers. Try raising this "interview" in the islamic forum. I would like to know myself the rebuts.</div>
