So he although the term hasn't been coined during his time, he realised it meant that the sun only SEEMED to orbit earth because its our relative POV. From there he went on to work out thru the same line of theory that the sun is at the center of the solar system.<br><br>I don't need to coin a term to know what a concept means. And a concept can exist even though a term hasn't been coined yet.<br><br>Like I said, stop abusing Newton's name for your own misconception. He's turning in his grave so much that they can play Kylie's "I'm spinning around" in Westminister Abbey.</div></blockquote>Agreed with your point about how Newton came about that the sun was modeled to be in the centre because of the planets orbits<br><br>the sun modeled to be in the centre of the solar system is due to the fact that the planets orbited around it after the other planetary orbits was discovered. If you would notice, after they discovered that the earth and the other planets orbited the sun, they postulated that the sun was the centre of the universe, which many years after was disproved once again. However, my point is that relativity states there is no fixed reference point in our three dimensional frame of the universe, <strong>hence anything can be said to be in the centre of the universe</strong> (and remember that people then said the earth was in the centre of the universe, not solar system). The only physical constant reference point is the speed of light.</div>

There are so many insulting and offensive remarks about diff 'religions' here. But since ppl are still reading it....)<br><br>Ok i couldnt resist quoting this post. What he said is true.<br>you can get any guy to call himself christian and let him go around saying false stuff about christianity or telling ppl about Christ in a bothersome manner (even tho he may have good intentions) and thus, turning ppl off from christianity.<br><br>Not everyone who claims to be a christian is truly a christian by whom you can judge and have a debate of logic with. Talking about this on a forum isnt the right way to deal with this issue. And telling others about how stoic and cold you are about christianity isn't exactly fair either.<br>Why christians still share about how much God and Jesus love you is cos they've really felt that love.Same with why they share about salvation.<br>Its really up to you to decide whether you want it or not.
