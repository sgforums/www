It is on blind fate that christians believe that he was resurrected, it is this ressurection that gives u reason for ur fate. So be it. Though Judasim and islam have no account of this ressurection they do acknoledge that Jesus lived. He was a wise man in those accounts.<br><br>This brings me to the singularity of most christans understanding ow world religions.

There are bad practioners of every religion, but the thread starter is only trying to single out christians only.<br><br>Not all muslims are terrorists and would-be suicide bombers. Think about this before lambasting people of another religion.</div>

Which really makes me doubt your "kind intentions" in trying to inform people.<br><br>It really seems like you're more interested in focusing on anti-christian sentiments than anything else.<br><br>As for your article, it is hardly proof anything. It is more of an article suggesting a very hostile and wrong attitude towards christians or anybody in general. It does not provide very clear references pertaining to the number of approaches by missionaries on muslims, or how all christians try to reach out to muslims. I have addressed this in an earlier post which you very conveniently ignored.<br><br>Your article is very poor proof that missionaries are paid to preach and if you bothered to do at least a little check/research/study, you'll realise how wrong you are.<br><br>And to say most missionaries would do ANYTHING to convert a muslim is the same as say, most muslims would do ANYTHING to destroy America, Israel or any of their allies.<br><br>I assume you make such misinformed comments because you are young and probably ignorant. However, please stop making such sweeping statements with such malicious intent. Otherwise, I might suggest to relevant authorities to monitor you.</div>
