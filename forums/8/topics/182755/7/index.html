I can name u at least 3 off the top of my head.<br><br>More xtians have started wars in the entire human history than any other religion. And very ironically, these wars have often been against other xtians who have slightly different beliefs about xtianity. And then u look at the line of popes, they have not always been shining examples of religious devotion. Crusades for personal gain more than any other reasons. </div></blockquote>The only religion that does not discriminate against the rest are passive religions like BUdhism. Muslim n Christianity are both aggressive religions. The wars fought down... but if u read both the Bible n the Quran.. the Irony is that they are all descendents from brothers.

They are quite aggressive. It's only after a few wars that they did learn something. Wonder when will the Christians learn after so many wars they have waged.</div>
