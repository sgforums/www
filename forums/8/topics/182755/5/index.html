Xtians are normally the ones who do things to make themselves guilt free, not to benefit others. Afterall, the very reason they embrace xtianity is because they don't want to go to hell. If u look at it in context, its actually a selfish act, as they don't want to have to pay for their sins.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just because some of us are irritated or uncomfortable, there is no reason why the religion should be flamed. Almost all religions teach us to be better human beings and do good in the world. I admit, Islam also teaches us that there is only one true way, but it still encourages all Muslims to acknowledge and respect other religions. Why? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">So that this kind of "religion wars" should not be occurring</span>. Everyone that has a religion not necessarily follow their respective religions strictly. You may be irritated by <strong>SOME</strong> christians pestering you but <strong>do not</strong> stereotype the religion and other innocent christians. Being a Muslim, I'm irritated and angry by so called "Muslims" out there who are bombing innocent people in the name of Islam. My point is, it is not the religions to be blame but the ideology and methods used by practioners of the religions that are sometimes wrong. In this world, there will always be evil/bad and also good. Its just life. No matter how bad it is or how good it is at the end of the day, thats life...</div>

And no we don't just use carbon dating to date things. and honestly, earth is not even 6 million years old. its much older than that. If u can't respect our planet and give it its age's due, which, according to xtians, is God's creation, then what more other people? Like I said, its all about yourself 1st before everyone else isn't it?<br><br>As for the bible, lets just say its not so much God's living word as it is Constantine's living word.

So it looks to me that if im going to hell, I'm going to meet a lot of xtians down there. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  but u know what?
