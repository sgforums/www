            <div class='col-md body'>When I am tempted to sin, I simply remind myself of the basic fact of Jesus' cruxifiction. God the Father owns the whole world. Every nook and cranny, every dollar, every person, architecture, natural wonder, He owns them all. Yet of all those things He could have given up to save mankind, He gave the one thing that mattered to Him most - His one and only Son, who through the shedding of pure blood wiped the slate clean and defeated the works of the devil. It really moves me to know that my King, my Father who owns the whole world and all its riches, saw me worthy enough to sacrifice His own being to save us. Your King has suffered immensely for you, can you not fight your temptation?<br><br>It works wonders. I used to be enslaved to pornography and masturbation, but with daily prayer and focusing our eyes on the promises and the love of our Heavenly Father, there can be nothing too much for me to handle.<br><br>"Jesus loves me this I know, for the Bible tells me so. Little ones to Him belong, they are weak but He is strong. Yes, Jesus loves me, for the Bible tells me so."</div>
