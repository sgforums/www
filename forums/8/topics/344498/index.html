              <p>I came across this while searching for some mp3 on a blog.......is this true? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <div>1. Guys are more emotional then you think, if they loved you at one point, it'll take them a lot longer then you think to let you go, and it hurts every second that they try.<br><br>2. Guys may be flirting around all day but before they go to sleep, they always think about the girl they truly care about.<br><br>3. Guys go crazy over a girl's smile.<br><br>4. Guys will do anything just to get you to notice him.<br><br>5. Guys hate it when you talk about your ex-boyfriend or ex love-interest. Unless they're goin for the let-her-complain-to-you-and-then-have-her-realize-how-wonder<br>ful-and-nice-you-are method.<br><br>6. A guy who likes you wants to be the only guy you talk to.<br><br>7. Boyfriends need to be reassured often that they're still loved.<br><br>8. Guys are more emotional than they'd like people to think.<br><br>9. Giving a guy a hanging message like "You know what?!..uh...nevermind.." would make him jump to a conclusion that is far from what you are thinking. And he'll assume he did something wrong and he'll obsess about it trying to figure it out.<br><br>10. Girls are guys' weaknesses.<br><br>11. Guys are very open about themselves.<br><br>12. If a guy tells you about his problems, he just needs someone to listen to him. You don't need to give advice.<br><br>13. A usual act that proves that the guy likes you is when he teases you.<br><br>14. Guys love you more than you love them if they are serious in your relationships.<br><br>15. Guys use words like hot or cute to describe girls. We rarely use beautiful.If a guy uses that, he likes you a whole hell of a lot.<br><br>16. No matter how much guys talk about asses and boobs, personality is key.<br><br>17. Guys worry about the thin line between being compassionate and being whipped.<br><br>18. Guys think WAY too much. One small thing a girl does, even if she doesn't notice it can make the guy think about it for hours, trying to figure out what it meant.<br><br>19. If the guy does something stupid in front of the girl, he will think about it for the next couple days or until the next time he spends time with the girl.<br><br>20. If a guy looks unusually calm and laid back, he's probably faking it and is spazzing inside.<br><br>21. When a guy says he is going crazy about the girl, he really is. Guys rarely say that.<br><br>22. When a guy asks you to leave him alone, he's just actually saying, "Please come and listen to me."<br><br>23. If a guy starts to talk seriously, listen to him. It doesn't happen that often, so when it does, you know something's up.<br><br>24. When a guy tells you that you are beautiful, don't say you aren't. It makes them want to stop telling you because they don't want you to disagree with them.<br><br>25.When a guy looks at you for longer than a second, he's definitely thinking something.<br><br>26. A guy has more problems than you can see with your naked eyes.<br><br>27. Don't be a snob. Guys can be intimidated and give up easily.<br><br>28. Guys talk about girls more than girls talk about guys.<br><br>29. Guys really think that girls are strange and have unpredictable decisions and are MAD confusing but somehow are drawn even more to them.<br><br>30. A guy would give his left nut to be able to read a girl's mind for a day.<br><br>31. No guy can handle all his problems on his own. He's just too stubborn to admit it.<br><br>32. Not all guys are assholes. Just because ONE is a jackass doesnt mean he represents ALL of them.<br><br>33. They love it when girls talk about their boobs.<br><br>34. When a guy hits your butt it means that he wants you... sexually<br><br>35. Even if they refuse it all guys are ticklish on the ribs.<br><br>36. Guys love neck rubs and if he lets you keep doing it ..it means that he really likes you or his neck really hurts.<br><br>37. When a guy sacrifices his sleep and health just to be with you, he really likes you and wants to be with you as much as possible.</div>

              <p>35. Even if they refuse it all guys are ticklish on the ribs.</p>
              <p>Most are quite true in a way .. depends how much u really like and want to be with that girl and rest are pretty much the stuffs or situations that bf/gf will be in and also will do... like spanking her butt in public but discreetly. kekeke</p>

              <p>You might not have realised it, but alot of guys out there have really really bad taste in dressing up and that might just be the reason why some girls really buay tahan already and prefer to go for guys in uniform.</p>
              <p>At least you cannot dress up wrongly if the guy is already wearing a uniform which is standard across the organisation that the guy is working for.</p>
              <p>You cannot go wrong with a uniform, when the dress sense is already reduced to uniform.</p>
              <p>So guys who couldn't bother to dress up, or have poor fashion sense, or really don't care about their dress sense, should all wear their uniform to lookÂ presentable at least. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p><br>If you believed your tongue can help you to tell the difference between sweet, hot, sour, bitter. And your ears can tell you which sounds are nice and bad.</p>
              <p>Then you should believe your eyes when you see someone who looks good or bothered to dress up well.</p>
              <p>And you should also believe your heart when it processes everything that you cannot see or feel or realised when your heart tells you that the person is the one for you.</p>
              <p>I rather believe myself than anyone else, and there are always up and down in every situation and in life itself.

              <p>Thats why its so easy to decieve on the outside.Â  ;p No doubt we always tend to believe what we see, but what u dun see is the more crucial part. But i guess most people are content in just seeing with thier bare eyes. Cause to see is to prove its existence , to touch , smell and taste just further reinforces the already visual image of what u want to see and not what it truly is.</p>
              <p>Same thing , girls look attractive for a reason, and men are visual creatures. In the end, most of the time what is on the outside shell is not what it seems when u peel off the outer layer.</p>
              <p>But ur point now is whether the guys bothered to dress well, and previously it had notions of guys that have no fashion sense. So like i said , he may dress well, but just not up to ur fashion sense . And if u discard him immediately because of that, then u are already filtering out what ur 'experience' and 'heart' feels about that guy n most of the time its not even the case lo. Not even giving him a chance just because maybe his top didnt match his pant's and his shoes. U can believe urself with ur present experience and 'heart' or common sense... and all i can say is. 'O.K... U happy jiu hao'</p>
