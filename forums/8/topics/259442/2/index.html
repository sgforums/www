You obviously dont want to face the entire problem which I am facing.</div></blockquote>IÂ’ll say it again, junior Â– stop, take a deep breath, count to ten and think.  YouÂ’re just about shouting on this forum Â– either that or youÂ’re being a drama queen, which is just as bad.  Are you talking gibberish?  Sure you are, what with that ramble about orcs and hulks.<br><br>IÂ’ll let you in on a little something, sport.  If I had a dollar for everybody whoÂ’s tried your old manÂ’s crap on me, IÂ’d be a much richer man now, but damned if I ever let any of them win.  Relatives, colleagues, classmates, executive board members, theyÂ’re all the same to old Uncle Ged.<br><br>The crap youÂ’re facing at the moment is just Power Games 101.  Your mother's right - he's just playing funny buggers with you, dragging you into irrational arguments so that he can feel good that he's bamboozled his kid.  It's a cheap thrill, but hey, some people can't stack up to anyone their own size, so they like going home and kicking the puppy because they know it can't bite back - go figure.<br><br>So whatÂ’s the solution to this?  A couple of things.  First and foremost, THINK Â– IÂ’ve already recommended it twice now.  Second, itÂ’s a case of mind over matter Â– you donÂ’t mind because it doesnÂ’t matter.  If you ignore these two things, youÂ’re going to keep getting drawn into an irrational argument that you cannot possibly win.  DonÂ’t think about the substance of the argument, but instead think about what the old man wants and deny it to him.<br><br>From what youÂ’ve described, what your old man wants is for you to engage in the argument with him, regardless of how pointless, irrational or irrelevant it is, and guess what?  You keep obliging him.  Even if you walk away, that in itself given him something Â– after all, Â“no commentÂ” is a comment in itself.<br><br>When you get all emotional about the suituation as you are doing now, youÂ’re looking for more problems than solutions, because all youÂ’re doing is feeding your negative emotions.  So listen up, booster - get a grip and think through the situation because thatÂ’s the only effective way of dealing with it.<br><br>Anyway, I've spoken my peace.  Like your old man, you seem to want to have the satisfaction of having the last word, and again I say you both deserve each other.  If you want to enjoy your misery and keep looking for problems, suit yourself.  It doesn't change my world the slightest bit, and I don't mind because, hey, it doesn't matter, and to be blunt, any further discussion would be a waste of my time if you don't take any of this on board.</div>

Your mother's right - he's just playing funny buggers with you, dragging you into irrational arguments so that he can feel good that he's bamboozled his kid.  It's a cheap thrill, but hey, some people can't stack up to anyone their own size, so they like going home and kicking the puppy because they know it can't bite back - go figure.<br><br>So whatÂ’s the solution to this?  A couple of things.  First and foremost, THINK Â– IÂ’ve already recommended it twice now.  Second, itÂ’s a case of mind over matter Â– you donÂ’t mind because it doesnÂ’t matter.  If you ignore these two things, youÂ’re going to keep getting drawn into an irrational argument that you cannot possibly win.  DonÂ’t think about the substance of the argument, but instead think about what the old man wants and deny it to him.<br><br>From what youÂ’ve described, what your old man wants is for you to engage in the argument with him, regardless of how pointless, irrational or irrelevant it is, and guess what?  You keep obliging him.  Even if you walk away, that in itself given him something Â– after all, Â“no commentÂ” is a comment in itself.<br><br>When you get all emotional about the suituation as you are doing now, youÂ’re looking for more problems than solutions, because all youÂ’re doing is feeding your negative emotions.  So listen up, booster - get a grip and think through the situation because thatÂ’s the only effective way of dealing with it.<br><br>Anyway, I've spoken my peace.
