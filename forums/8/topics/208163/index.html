For example, candidates may be asked how to parallel-park a car.<br><br>To get a driving licence, candidates have to pass both the basic and final theory tests, and a practical driving test.<br><br>The basic theory test assesses candidates' interpretation of road and traffic signs.<br><br>Mr Kalidass said investigations revealed that in August last year, Ng approached Tan Beng Wah, 34.<br><br>It is not known how Ng knew Tan.<br><br>HAD TROUBLE PASSING TEST<br>Tan contacted his cousin, Teo Cheng Hoe, 36, who had trouble passing the test. It is not known how many times Teo failed the test.<br><br>Teo agreed to get Ng's help to pass the test for $1,000 and handed his identity card to his cousin, who in turn gave it to Ng.<br><br>Ng then passed the identity card to Goh, who used it to sit for the test at the Singapore Safety Driving Centre in Ang Mo Kio on 19 Aug last year.<br><br>Tan and Teo were aware that it was not Ng but another man who would be sitting for the test.<br><br>Mr Kalidass said that, unknown to the conspirators, Mr Lim Choon Seng, a senior tester at the driving centre, received a tip-off about the scam at 11pm on 18 Aug, a day before the test.<br><br>Mr Lim was told that someone would be taking the final theory test on behalf of a candidate named Teo Cheng Hoe.<br><br>Mr Lim informed the centre's chief tester, Mr Goh Yong Hua, and checks showed that Teo had arranged to sit for the test at the driving centre on 19 Aug.<br><br>The testers waited for the impersonator to turn up on the day of the test.<br><br>At 11.45am, Goh turned up with Teo's identity card and test slip.<br><br>He was assigned to a computer work station to take the test, which is conducted on a touch-screen.<br><br>After the test, Mr Goh questioned Goh, who admitted that he was an impostor.<br><br>Goh, who was arrested on the spot, was found with Teo's identity card and driving test slips belonging to Teo and two other persons.<br><br>The New Paper reported last December that Goh had sat for the theory test for two other persons on 21 Jul and 11 Aug last year.
