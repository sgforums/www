            <div class='col-md body'>yup...but seriously, DELL doesnt fit my purposes, there low-end graphics card, makes rendering of CAD graphics super slow and even memory out! even when i have 4gb memory installed.<br><br>Also on average my NUS office's DELL's PCs dun work longer than 3 years...think reliability is a problem. So always like dong bu dong have to call Dell support like that.<br><br>I not saying Dell not good...all their stuff are from OEMs, chip set, mobo, cards, drives etc...but their system design, like the casing design, fan location, heat dissipation, etc...lousy design so that products does not last that long...but they cheap...for mid end users maybe.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dell no good. use it for ex-company. problems with their docking station for latidute notebooks. no power to powerup up simple palm pda devices. even when connect to ac power source. i nv had problem with other brands. used to use a inspiron 510m but lucky get to change to  Fujitsu S series. Now so good much much better than the stupid dell. dell use cheap parts to make their computers, no wonder the price so cheap. louya dun buy dell. do it at your risk. esp. home range. but pda range is okay.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

Apple advertises as well, but is Apple unpopular with the users? The answer is no.<br><br>Whether a computer lasts, it's mostly due to the users. Users who maintain it well can make it last for as long as they like. Those who play games, overclock, change this and that setting, will spoil it sooner or later, as QC tests are done based on default values in a certain environment.<br><br>If you are not the kind who abuse the PC, and it breaks down, you are just unlucky.</div></blockquote>Maybe I'm just unlucky.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>But regarding the advertisements, yes, I would say that they do serve those purposes you've mentioned. However, if you were to compare Apple with Dell, Apple definitely is more popular especially among the Mac users. With correlation to advertizing, Dell seems to advertize more than Apple computers. And I would also agree, that their sales need improvement as compared to Apple, which is more efficient than the former.<br><br>Since every computer users knows about Dell, Dell's purpose of telling others about their new model or products everytime on the newspapers (more than any other models) clearly shows that either their product/model is always improvising as it it not efficient enough, or they're lacking in popularity among most users.<br><br>I've got friends who were once owners of Dell computers or laptops. Their main uses are just for homework or project purposes. From their testimony, their computers don't last more than 2 to 3 years, despite careful handling.<br><br>And back to topic, their technical support is also very inefficient. I once tried calling the helpline and kept asking them to send an engineer down to my home to repair certain componants as I'm in doubt due to unfamiliarity. But all they offered was phone-service and told me that they can't do it. Furthermore, they asked me to go down to their place with my computer to get it fixed. What kind of service is this?<br><br>Such unpleasant encounter has tarnished their reputation and my impression on their customer service and helpdesk.<br><br>Like what the topic starter has said, I fully support his point of view. I'll never trust Dell again, after I'm done with this computer. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
