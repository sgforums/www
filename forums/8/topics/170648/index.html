            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone, there are a few question i would like to ask. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>1) Just wondering if anyone would like to share the feeling of their first kiss.<br><br>To me, actually I wasn't quite what i've expected or imagine, i mean before my first kiss, i would actually had an imaginary person and kiss, and of course when i had my first, i found out it was actually nothing. It was just like normal touching of the lips. However, at that time, i actually thought i would be dreaming, to be doing such a thing, things like too good to be true.( Of course it was like heaven and flying when we kissed more and i realised i'm not dreaming. )<br>And as i said it was my first time, i was actually nervouse about it, i also don't know any techiques or moves or what to do.<br><br>but after like 1 minute of practising, i began to be braver and yeah my movements were less stiff. We proceed to things like french kissing and more intimate stuffs.....<br><br>2) I'm about to ask was, when you guys kiss( or even further ), do you start to erect? I don't know, but what about normal just a kiss or 2, or maybe a good night kiss as well?  If you do, do you feel pai seh about it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>haha cause it was my first time, then obviously whatever things i do its pretty thrilling haha ya, then feel abit pai seh..<br><br>3) what i was thinking was,  how does HIV/Aids spread btw?  Will it spread through kissing?  my guessing is no.. but i'm not too sure if saliva will spread..<br><br>4) if you erect, what do you do? specially if its in public, i mean if its private it would sound ok, but what if its a public place haha...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by [H]eart [B]reak [K]id:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi everyone, there are a few question i would like to ask. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>1) Just wondering if anyone would like to share the feeling of their first kiss.<br><br>To me, actually I wasn't quite what i've expected or imagine, i mean before my first kiss, i would actually had an imaginary person and kiss, and of course when i had my first, i found out it was actually nothing. It was just like normal touching of the lips. However, at that time, i actually thought i would be dreaming, to be doing such a thing, things like too good to be true.( Of course it was like heaven and flying when we kissed more and i realised i'm not dreaming. )<br>And as i said it was my first time, i was actually nervouse about it, i also don't know any techiques or moves or what to do.<br><br>but after like 1 minute of practising, i began to be braver and yeah my movements were less stiff. We proceed to things like french kissing and more intimate stuffs.....<br><br>2) I'm about to ask was, when you guys kiss( or even further ), do you start to erect? I don't know, but what about normal just a kiss or 2, or maybe a good night kiss as well?  If you do, do you feel pai seh about it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>haha cause it was my first time, then obviously whatever things i do its pretty thrilling haha ya, then feel abit pai seh..<br><br>3) what i was thinking was,  how does HIV/Aids spread btw?  Will it spread through kissing?  my guessing is no.. but i'm not too sure if saliva will spread..<br><br>4) if you erect, what do you do? specially if its in public, i mean if its private it would sound ok, but what if its a public place haha...</div></blockquote>First of all, welcome aboard you horny teenager. Let RETARDED_MORON do some sharing.<br><br>1) My first kiss, I believe, was at Escape Theme Park. There was virtually nothing emotional; just a couple of curious teenagers succumbing to each others' overwhelming drive. Sure, it did not feel extraordinary, or any different from what I would expect it to be. We just smooched. But even though it was our first kiss, we threw in something unconventional, namely a grape-flavoured candy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  We just kept transferring it to and fro each others' buccal cavities. That really sweetened things up!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>2) Not at all, boy. Not at all. Not even when I am doing the groping part. It beats me how anyone can!<br><br>3) HIV can only spread through bodily fluids/sharing of unsterilized needles/blood transfusion. Or any sort of variation of those methods I mentioned.<br><br>4) Try this: put your master hand in your pocket, grab your genital (inconspicuously, duh) and place it between your thighs. Either that, or try wearing tight jeans.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's all in a KISS!!! The body part where you love to kiss most<br>reflects your personality type!<br><br>Please choose the part you love to kiss most: And be honest!!!!<br><br>1) Forehead<br>2) Eyes<br>3) Nose<br>4) Face<br>5) Ear<br>6) Lips<br>7) Neck<br><br>The following is your personality:<br><br>Forehead:<br>You have a strong passion for life and at the same time a peaceful nature.Though you are a forgiving person, you demand respect from other people. Your talents are expressed well and you have good interpersonal skills. As such, you have a fulfilling social life and<br>your friends around you will find you to be gentle and understanding.<br><br>Eyes:<br>You are die-hard Romeo who requires lots of love and you can sacrifice everything for love as well. You express your love in a wild and passionate way. However, you are equally capable of becoming a vicious lover, manipulating your partner to achieve certain selfish goals.<br><br>Nose:<br>In a relationship, sex is something essential to you! You value friendship,loyalty and you have a strong desire for love and sex. You are playful by nature and you cannot stay long at a place without feeling uneasy. As a result, it is very difficult for you to establish a strong foundation for your career and it is advisable that you do not change your job with no strong reasons.<br><br>Face:<br>You value peace above all other things and friends are very important to you. You willingly share all your prized possessions with them and you are not easily bothered if you are short-changed. Also, you have a kind heart and you try not to harbor bad thoughts about other people. Maintaining a long lasting and affectionate relationship is your forte.<br><br>Ear:<br>As a very understanding person, you can accurately guess what is on a person's mind. You posses a disposition to appreciate or share the feelings and thoughts of others. However, you can also be someone who cracks jokes at the expense of others and in wanting to achieve your goals, you can easily sacrifice others. Towards relationships, you are not affected by emotional constraints and is very expressive. Your behavior is 100% congruent with your inner feelings.<br><br>Lips:<br>You are someone who is governed by a great sense of loyalty. When you kiss someone's lips, you are atcually expressing the hope of having one true love. Always radiating an aura of confidence, you are someone with very strong moral codes.<br><br>Neck:<br>Flirtatious by nature, you are unlikely to be someone that dreams of everlasting love. Although your passion for things is very strong, it fades away in just a while. Even when you are no longer in love with your partner, you selfishly demand him/her to love you still. You are unlikely to have great ambitions towards your own life and you are not particular about gender roles.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
