You have ten bags of marbles, nine bags contain marbles that weight 10 g each, 1 bag contains marbles that weight 11 g each. You have a weighing machine and you can remove any amount of marbles from any bags and weight them for one time and you are suppose to know which bag contain the heavier marbles just from the result of the weighing.

They don't sum up to 1 whole.  but they sum up to 19/20.  So half is 10/20, a quarter is 5/20 and a fifth is 4/20. Thus, the eldest son will get 10 cattles, second son will get 5 cattles while the youngest get 4 cattles.<br><br>2)A + B = 2<br>A = 1<br>C + D = 10<br>B = 2<br>A + B = 2<br>Total time =  17<br><br>3)Place 3 eggs on the each side of the balance so there'll be 2 eggs not on the balance.<br>If the balance is balanced then the bad egg is between the 2 eggs not on the balance so simply put the 2 on each side of the balance, the lighter one is the bad egg.<br>If the balance is unbalanced then remove the heavier side's egg and take the side that's lighter, remove one egg from the three, place one on each side of the balance.. if it balanced, the one egg from the three not on balance is the bad egg.. if not, then the lighter side is the bad egg,<br><br>4)Place 2 eggs on the each side of the balance so there'll be 4 eggs not on the balance.<br>If it is balanced then, the odd one is with the 4 untouched ones, to test which is the one, take 2 of the egg from the 4 eggs and put them on each side of the balance. If this time it is still balanced then it is between the two remaining untouched eggs, take one of them and compare using the balance with one of the normal 6 eggs, if it is balanced then the odd one is the untouched one, if it is not then the one comparing with the normal eggs is the odd one.<br>If it is not balanced, the untouched ones are all normal eggs.  Take 2 eggs out of the 4 eggs that is on the balance previously and put them on the balance. If it is balanced then the odd egg is between the 2 eggs not on the balance 2nd time, if not then the odd egg is between the 2 eggs on the balance 2nd time, the two eggs that might contain the odd eggs is labelled as "suspicious eggs".  To tell which is the odd egg between the 2, take one normal egg and compare with one of the suspicious eggs using the balance, if its balanced, the suspicious egg not on the balance is the odd egg, if not, then the suspicious egg on the balance is the odd egg.<br><br>5)One need to be able to tell which bag does a marble come from, if it is taken out.. can be done by careful arrangement..<br>Place bag in a straight line left to right, label them 1 to 10.  Take the number of marbles from them equal to their number. Place the marbles on the weighing machine in order the same as the bag they came from.<br>The last number of the weight of the marbles on the weighing machine is gonna tell us which bag is the bag with heavier marbles.<br>(i.e. 0 --- 10th bag 1 --- 1st bag ...  2--- 2nd bag.. and so on till         9 -- 9th)<br><br>Woohoo .. i tried.. hope i am not too wrong  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>Thanks for the quiz, i had fun doing erm'   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
