Man still fear that they need to pay for their crimes in the after-life, including YOU . You call yourself a free-thinker? A true free-thinker rejects the possibility of existence of superior godly beings in the world and only believes that Man come from Apes and dissappear from Universe after they die.If Deep in your heart you fear retribution or a need to pay for your sins or crimes in anyway, you are already NOT a free-thinker.<br><br>So If there is a solid evidence and 101% absolute proof of Man disappearing from the Universe after death, this world will be Hell. people will commit crimes out of greed and lust without regret, those victims will also retaliate and kill to fight back -afterall there is no need to pay for all the killings and crimes after death.<br><br>Understand little boy ?<br><br>[This message has been edited by SilverWings (edited 06 October 2001).]</div>

Like the others, i don't think we will go around killing, raping and commiting cos we believe everyone has their right to live and fairness. Without God/Allah/Hell, that doesn't mean our existing Legal system will fail, police will still be around to stop crime. Human right will still exist. what ever happen after death doesn't matter to us at all, cos being alive, we have our code of conduct to live fairly and righteous still exist.<br><br>Well, for religious fanatic, as you said. Does it mean that once they know there's no God/Allah/Hell, they will start commiting crime, rape, kill as they like since they have no worry what would become of them after death? Once that God/Allah/Hell restriction is gone, they will revert to their evil side and commit crime? Aren't all these religious fanatic like you a bonded evildoer who pretend to act morally just because there's this belief that you will be punished in hell to pay for your crime after death? Aren't you a hyprocrite? My lover naive religious fanatic boy</div>

Once there is absolute proof for disappearing from the Universe, it's totally a different world.<br>You dont go around killing and raping doesnt means others will not. In a world where there is no religion and all men disappears from the universe,  one day some rich gangsters who has no guilt rapes you in your asshole, rapes your mom and sister, then robs everything from you and they bribe the police and judge.

Iraq and Afghanistan will conquer MiddleEast killing all Westerners, Malays will chase all Chinese out of S.E. Asia. The Japs would have attacked Asia and raping all girls.
