So does Ghengis Khan and Hitler who have no religion kills around and massacre.<br>I agree that human nature being bad, but Law alone cannot restrict mankind. Religion comes into a very improtant role, MORE IMPORTANT than LAW itself. So you can see there are more non-religion wars than religious wars. Dont you think so?<br><br>There are just a few cases of religious wars, but for wars with no-religion involved , there are countless of them.<br><br>for religious wars, there are only two i remember:<br>Crusaders war against Muslims<br>Muslims War against Israel<br><br>for non-religious wars, countless:<br>World War I<br>World War II<br>Three Kingdom War of China<br>War of the Seven Kingdom in China<br>Japanese Massacre Chinese<br>Roman Empire masscare Christians (this is not conisdered religion war)<br>Ghengis Khan's war<br>Napolean's war<br>Babylonian War<br>War in S.E.Asia Sultan Empire<br>Japanese Clan War<br>American civil War<br>Greek War<br>Mongolian War<br>Iraq-Iran war<br>China Civil War (Communist vs Democratic)<br>Thailand Civil war<br>.....<br>......<br>......<br>......<br>......<br><br>These are the result of people not believe in retribution/religion.<br>Billions and billions of people died because of war.
