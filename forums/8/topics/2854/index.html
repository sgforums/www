            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Sparkle,<br><br>Not that it's not possible. It is just that after a certain period of time when you have spent a lot of time with the other person, he will grow to love you. I find it strange that it can be still clear that both of you are still platonic friends. I use what I call a bad analogy, look at the American TV series "Friends", where you see the couples like Monica and Chandler, Ross and Rachel. A lot of my friends criticize the show for the fact that they turned into couples. To me, it is perfectly realistic, because it is very difficult to have a fully platonic r/s. The only time when I think it could work, is that either one of the party is already attached.<br><br>Personally, I will say that the women who are my platonic friends are always attached, so I will not harbour the feelings because I don't wish to be the third party.<br><br>I have to say that it is difficult to control feelings, because relationship is something delicate and strange, and no logic can be applied to it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I think it's possible if the guy's gay... haha!(Best Friend's Wedding) IMHO, it's quite rare to find guys who remain close friends at a platonic level. I hope to be one of them! Haha, I do have some gal pals who confide in me and stuff like that cause I'm quite a good listener... but there were times when either I wanted to or she wanted to up the relationship, so we would talk and that would be the end of that.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think its definitely possible. I believe that there is an equal chance that he will fall for you or not fall for you over a long period of time. Some people also have fixed ideas of who they want as a partner, and you might not fit that pattern, just as you don't want a close guy mate to fall for you because you are not ready for relationship or not your type etc.<br><br>Or, you might even fall for him. Isn't that how some relationships are built? Friends first then partners later?<br><br>No suggestions on how to prevent a close friendship into getting too close, but like some other posters have said, if you are really that good friends, communicating with each other is the only way to sort things out if shit happens.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For a guy and a girl to remain just close friends is not impossible, just very rare.<br><br>It is difficult to say that when you just become friends with a member of the opposite sex, you have it in your head that you will just remain friends. Attraction may sometimes grow slowly, so after a period you feel yourself being drawn to a friend, especially if you have been spending a lot of time with him/her, be it talking on the phone, going out etc. Some people are uncomfortable remaining friends with someone whom he/she has tried to have a more intimate relationship with. It is in their minds that if we cannot be bf/gf then we should stop wasting our time. Othertimes it is just the awkwardness of it all. When you are with that person you find yourself being mindful of what you say or do so you will not give the other person anymore wrong impressions. In the end it becomes easier to just drift apart.<br><br>I have a female friend and we have known each other for almost 3 years now. Our friendship can be considered quite close, although it is a on/off thing. At times we can talk to each other everyday, sometimes through the night. Other times we do not call each other for weeks even. We have shared secrets, experiences etc. She even admitted that she liked me once way in the beginning, but at that time my heart was thinking of someone else. I have tried to make our relationship more intimate, but she just laughs it off. Till now it is more like a joke between us. Honestly, I have not gone out with her 1-on-1 before. Tried many times but it is mission impossible. She always cancels at the last minute or forgets about it. Oh well...<br><br>If you do manage to have a close friendship with someone of the opposite sex, treasure it. It really is a wonderful experience.<br><br>Just my two cents.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To me, it's extremely difficult for a guy and gal to have a nomal "close" friendship. I mean in most cases, the "brothers" of most girls are usually those who have failed in wooing the girl hence the next closest thing to be with the girl other than a comman friend is to be her "brother". Just look round and u will realized that usually, the more popular girls in schs have lots of "brothers".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with wat itain has said, the next closest thing most guys wanna be with the person they used to love or still love/like is to be a " brother". True , no doubt, "this term coined as " brother" may be somewhat like a very closed friend, but sometimes one can't help but wonder if guys still have the very least of hope that the lady of their affections may 1 day just reciprocate??<br>Ladies, i understand how u feel when it comes to platonic relationships, &amp; nothing special, u really mean it. But sometimes u ve to consider how some guys feel about this oso, cos they really r not sure where they 'll lik to be in your heart, i mean every one oso hopes dat they 've a place in the heart of their affections?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Repetoire<br>Well...It is not easy to reject someone who is your fren but most guys have to understand that most girls have an expectation of what they are looking for and they want someone whom they think they really like and suitable. I too dun believe in those Brothers and sisters kind of relationship so I never did have one cos I know it is all crap. I know some how or another it will not turn out the way it should be. But right, if the girl is popular, most guys will like her and she can't accept every guy that likes her right?<br>Anyhow it is a matter of how both of them communicates. It is sometimes hard for the girl to judge if the guy is nice to her cos he treats her as a really good fren or he likes her cos the girl dun want to to think that she is beng thich-skinned to think that the guy likes her if the guy has not expressed his feelings at all...I know of guys who will do all things for the girl they like and not expressing their feelings. They will do what they can for the girl,wanted to buy all the things she liked  etc etc..But tell me, what the girl can do in cases like those?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 04 January 2000).]</div>
