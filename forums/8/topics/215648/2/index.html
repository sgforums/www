I told my friends that NUS and NTU will never make it to the elites simply because they are solely result orientated that they lose their focus on cultivating undergrads.<br><br>To the local university, the place is like a assembly line moulding every man and woman into a degree holder. In overseas university, you learn to research and question. In lectures and tutorials, the interactions are spontaneous. You grill the lecturers and tutors to get different opinions and new area of knowledge. In local university, it is sadly only one way communication most of the time.<br><br>That is why I always believe our local university will never discover a John Nash or any nobel prize winner, simply because we are churning out a bunch of knowledge administrators rather than a bunch of thinkers. During my time, my school mates and I jointly tried to crack a few old unsolved mathematics formulas with some success. Unfortunately for me, I've to return back to singapore at that time and stopped my research on thermothology physonosis theory. It's a pity as nobody came close to it, not even John Nash.<br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i actually kinda agree with the threadstarter.<br><br>Not in the sense of grilling lecturers during lectures though, but rather after class. If u all have been to Uni, u all will surely know some quite a number of lecturers in SG uni are too lazy to entertain ur questions regarding other stuffs.<br><br>By that, i don't mean some bo liao idiotic stuff, but rather subjects that are more advanced maybe some research or sumthing. In fact just a couple days ago, my classmate was consulting our maths tutor on a problem sum he came across from a math reference book.<br><br>He shot him down with a curt reply :" why bother doing it? we won't set this in exam"<br>We were like o.0 wtf! muz we only do stuffs that will come out in exam.<br>if that's the case then we're nothing but exam robots.<br>Imagine, u study not to broaden ur knowledge but rather for exam purpose like wth.<br><br>In that case, our quality will only deteriorate with each passing generation. Coz each time, we're limited by our predecessor. In the near future, all become brainless fuk.</div>
