            <div class='col-md body'>A few years back, I reduced about 3kgs in a month because I was so addicted to The Sims (a computer game) that when I had my school break, all I did was play play play and skipped meals because of that.  I'd wake up and first thing I did was play The Sims, then grab a quick breakfast or even forego it altogether and throughout the day, just snack on whatever I could get my hands on, which was usually Jacob's crackers.  Whaddaya know, voila, a month later, I emerged from home 3kgs lighter.  hahaha!  Not a healthy way to lose weight though.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Now, I lose weight / maintain my weight by exercising at the gym.  In the first four months or so, I lost 6kgs but have hit a plateau since then.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  I've so much more to lose.  sigh.  I feel once you start exercising, you'll not have cravings for fatty, oily foods too.  That was what I felt.<br><br>As for developing bulky arms by lifting 500 ml bottle, if only muscles were that easy to develop!  hehe!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

Dat is if your heart pumps twice as fast the first thing that goes is the water, dats the easy part 4-10 kilos of water + some fat will be shed depending on your current body weight.<br><br>To achieve this I recommend a 5-6km very slow jog, 2-3 times per week. Food intake no-carbo slowly you will see your arms start to thin, facial starts to sharpen, upper part of tummy starts to go down. The hard part is trimming off the lower more stubborn part of it that takes more time.<br><br>slimming centers methods are guarntee to work problem is you are not. they use shock therapy or vibrating machines to break down the fat globules around your arms, thighs, upper and lower portions of tummy to make it easier for your body to push it out. Their method is much faster but problem with this is that once your body "recovers" from the shock your brain does a system check and says "hey how come these things missing" automatically your craving will come, food will be on your mind most times especially sugar. You will find it near impossible to control.<br><br>Slimming centers also use charming sweet talking chiobu sales gers or therapists to try to con you to signup for this and that, they use proven sales  tactics like group / status preassure plus a kind of very mild seduction for guys, if you not careful all your money$ WILL GONE. btw if you sign up for those $30 treatment, it comes non-inclusive of the gel, you have to purchase it seperately.<br><br>I have tried slimming centers, medication, acupuncture they all use the same concept of shock therapy. I find jogging and exercise still the best.<br><br>If you want to spend money maybe you should sign up for aerobics instead.</div>
