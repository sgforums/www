Mmmm....<br><br>Anyway, the advantage mentioned is total crap to me. If someone is retrenched this year, he doesn't have to pay taxes for his high salary last year? So what does this mean? Retrench people don't have to pay taxes for the job they once had?<br><br>Then why pay taxes now? I can plot my own retrenchment.<br><br>The Straits Times Interactive<br>SEPT 16, 2004<br><strong>Pay-as-you-earn tax method under study</strong><br><br>By Lee Su Shyan<br><br>A NEW way of paying income tax may be in the offing.<br><br>Instead of paying income tax on earnings for the previous year, workers may have to pay tax each month as they earn it, under a new government proposal.<br><br>That means their pay packet will be with the tax already taken out.<br><br>The move would also apply to companies as well as individuals.<br><br>It was outlined in a consultation paper put out by the Ministry of Finance which is seeking feedback on the idea.<br><br>The ministry says that for companies, this 'could improve their cashflow'. For individuals, this new system 'helps to smooth out their disposable income'.<br><br>Countries including Britain, the United States and Australia already use this pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) method.<br><br>Under the system Singapore currently uses, income tax paid this year is based on what was earned last year.<br><br>The switch will see tax being paid on what is being earned this year.<br><br>At the moment, an individual has to file his income tax return by April 15 detailing how much he earned the previous year.<br><br>Similarly, a company whose accounting year ends Dec 31 files an estimate of its income by Mar 31 the following year.<br><br>The MOF is asking for feedback on the ways a worker's tax will be deducted.<br><br>For example, the employee could inform the taxman of his estimated annual salary and other personal details at the start of the year. The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras) works out the tax and monthly payments are deducted via giro.<br><br>Alternatively, the employer could give the worker's salary details to Iras. It then works out the tax and gets the employer to withhold the tax from the employee's monthly salary.<br><br>Any difference - refunds or additional payments - will be settled later.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">An advantage of the new scheme is that if a person is retrenched or suffers a pay cut this year, he isn't left having to pay tax on the high salary he earned last year.</span><br><br>That's because if his income drops, the income tax drops accordingly.<br><br>KPMG's tax director, Mrs Chung Siew Moon, said one issue to be worked out will be whether estimated bonuses will be used in computing estimated tax liability.<br><br>The issue is that an employee usually gets his bonus at the end of the year, while the estimated taxes are paid throughout the year.<br><br>Another problem is how the change would be implemented. During the changeover year, individuals and companies could face paying the tax of the current year and the previous year.<br><br>Mrs Chung noted that when Malaysia made a similar switch in 2000, a tax holiday was granted on income earned in 1999.<br><br>Mr David Sandison, a tax partner with accountancy giant PricewaterhouseCoopers, said that if there was a tax holiday, this would most benefit retirees or those leaving the workforce. But for those starting work, they would have to pay tax immediately and not get the benefit of the time lag.<br><br>For companies, the new system means that taxes could be paid on a quarterly basis after filing a return of earnings for the previous quarter.<br><br>Or a company could make an estimate of its profits at the start of the year and make monthly instalments.<br><br>The MOF said that companies 'whose profits fluctuate from year to year will benefit most from current year assessment'.<br><br>It also said the scheme would be one way of stabilising the economic cycles.<br><br>The public consultation period started yesterday and ends Oct 30.<br>Copyright @ 2004 Singapore Press Holdings.
