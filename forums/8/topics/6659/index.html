            <div class='col-md body'>Finally, the Rock has come back to (wherever u want him to)<br><br>Triple H's wife's name's Stephanie McMan or something i think...<br><br>Anyway, yeah, i have to agree that WWF during the late 80s and early 90s rule man.  I remembered i was just a lill pri schboy then and cried to sleep when my dad refuses to let my watch wrestlemania coz it was too late!!!  HAHAHA<br>My favourite wrestler was as first The Ultimate Warrior (who doesn't like him!!) with his cool neon elastic bands on his biceps plus his cool shoes!!  And that ugly facemask paint!!  woooooo  Later i guess i supported Bret Hart coz he's just such a complete wrestler.  Tag Team?  "oooOOoOooOOOooOOoOOOooh, what a ruuuushh!!!"<br>ask your friends if u dunno whom i'm referring to.  Now, i dunno, i guess it's pretty predictable as almost every match there would be an interference and because of that butt-in (be it a chair smack, or a distract/knock out-the-referee-then-dirty tricks) the cheater would win.  The wrestlers do not have NICE INTRO MUSIC!!!  All they have now is heavy metal tunes that aren't sticking.  I like the Acolytes theme song though haha.  And i used to think wrestling was real!!  I'm out!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, I am one the millions! I also like Kane but my all time fav wrestler has got to be the Ultimate Warrior(go figure!).<br>For all those who miss the past wrestlers, eg. Hulk Hogan, Bret Hart, Macho Man, etc.. u can still catch them doing their stuffs in WCW(even though the look of the show is damn weak). During the past, WWF wrestling focus more on actual matches than the "drama plot" and right now the "plot" is being focus more instead. So maybe thats y u guys prefer the past WWF.<br>Btw, Triple H's "wife" is Stephanie McMahon, daughter of WWF chairman Vince McMahon.<br><br>rebluett: the match was won by Ultimate Warrior during Wrestlemania VI or VIII or something like that. It was also the first time both Intercontinental and Heavyweight belts were on the line and Ultimate Warrior was the first to win both. Also Ultimate Warrior is the only wrestler that Hulk Hogan could not win(they met twice) in his whole wrestling career!<br><br>Sniperjim: the bad guys have always played cheat, way back when pro wrestling was invented!<br><br>Rinoa Heartilly: Chyna is a woman who is trying to be a Xena. But hey, Lita looks gd! I dont mind being moonsawed by her!! Hehe!<br><br>I dream of seeing these matches:<br><br>Sting vs Ultimate Warrior(both started out as tag team partners)<br>Hulk Hogan vs Rock(this would be really something)<br>Bret vs Kane(my fav techical wrestler vs my fav strength wrestler)<br>Undertaker vs Andre the Giant(wow...)<br>Rick Flair vs Stone Cold(maybe wont be a classic but it will still be interesting)<br>Shawn Michaels vs Macho Man(they both shared the same manager once)<br>Killer Bees vs Hardy Boyz(the pioneers of high risk manouvers vs the current princes of high risk manouvers)<br>Demolition vs LoD(I want to see it again!)<br><br>Peace,<br>SpookyKid<br><br>Love is the Dance of Eternity<br></div>
