Would you?<br><br>These are quoted from msnbc :<br><blockquote>How does someone become so full of hate that he is ready to massacre so many, and die in the process, turning a body into a guided missile? Most experts agree suicide bombers are not lunatics. They are usually rational idealists who are prepared to die for what they believe is the greater good of their society.<br><br>A typical candidate [is] a young man from a <strong>religious</strong> home, first approached in the mosque, then recruited, tested and trained to be a walking bomb,Â” says terrorism expert Brian Jenkins. Â“They are acting in their view with the <strong>approval of God</strong>.Â”<br><br>No country has more experience than Israel where suicide-bombers are a daily threat. There have been at least two attacks a month for the last year Â— more than 60 Israelis have been killed, hundreds wounded.<br><br>Terrorism experts say there are two types of motivation for the bomber. The first involves anger and a sense of hopelessness.<br><br>Samir Toubasi, a 19-year-old Palestinian, was caught with a 22-pound bomb by Israel, while driving to a disco. He was ready to kill himself and as many Israelis as possible.<br><br>Â“I lost my job, my future, my hope,Â” says Toubasi. Â“Then Israeli soldiers killed my friend. I wanted to die.Â”<br><br>So Toubasi decided to become a suicide bomber. His goal Â— to kill Israelis Â— is supported by many in the region who are angry at IsraelÂ’s treatment of the Palestinians.<br><br>Â“War makes you hard-hearted,Â” says Miriam El-Kholi, a Cairo worker. Â“Death has become part of their daily life. They know theyÂ’re going to lose someone.Â”<br><br>The second motivation for the bombers is a <strong>deep religious belief</strong> that a better life awaits them in <strong>paradise</strong>. But Islam is divided on suicide bombers. The Koran, the Islamic holy book, forbids suicide and many Moslems condemn the suicide bombers.<br><br>But others see them as martyrs, warriors committing not self-destruction, but heroic acts. And every death in battle with Israel fuels Arab anger, much of it directed against America, which is seen as IsraelÂ’s chief ally. In the minds of the bombers, both are legitimate targets for terror.<br><br>Events like those Wednesday in the West Bank just keep the pot boiling. Nine Palestinians were killed by Israeli soldiers, who were trying to prevent more attacks by suicide bombers. But it also caused more anger in the cycle of Mideast violence that it appears has now come to the United States.<br><br>Israel has found the only answer to suicide bombers is good intelligence, to stop them before they begin their murderous journey. And now Israel is calling on Washington to pool all their resources in the fight against terror.<br></blockquote>I pity for those innocent life that was taken away in this barbaric terrorism act. My colleague and i was discussing during lunch time why the terrorist have to choose that faithful tuesday morning and not during the night or weekend period when there is less people in the building, less life-lost. They purposely wanted to kill as many life as possible so as to send a strong message to US to stop being a KPO? Inhuman act I would say.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 13 September 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[QUOTE]Originally posted by SilverWings:<br><br>&lt;b&gt;That's unfair way to put it.<br>What if I say I am speeding in my own residential estate and someone who claims he is the police enters my place and catch me?<br>Fair?&lt;b&gt;<br>If you are speeding and in so doing endangering the lives of others..you should be caught.<br><br>&lt;b&gt;US has no right to claim they are the world police. They are making peace, true, but they are doing it to benefit their own country's economy and military when they  ally with other country, their priority is not for peace.&lt;b&gt;<br>Only with peace can there be prosperity. Thus in a way..peace is their priority. Like I said before..peace costs. You cant expect the US to perform a free service. They're not a charity organization. The benefits of this peace outweighs more than the costs incurred without it.<br><br>&lt;b&gt;US has always wanted other countries to disarm their Nuclear Weapons but they themselves do not disarm their Nuclear Weapons. So now since you say Countries are meddling with other countries affair, wouldnt it be better if they dont interfere each other's affair ?&lt;b&gt;<br><br>Each country is a member of the world and if their actions affect the world..then it should be the affair of other countries. Would you do nothing if your neighbour plays Mahjong in his own house at 3 am in the morning??<br><br>&lt;b&gt;And if you read carefully and observe, even if the US is not around, CHina will not attack Taiwan just to take over it. What CHina wants actually is union in peace with Taiwan. Yes they were threatening Taiwan, but they will not attack Taiwan because of the fact China as the leader of Chinese will not punish Chinese of other countries.&lt;b&gt;<br><br>What if this 'union in peace' involves imposing of China's ideals on Taiwan's?? And I'm sure the military excercises China did was for fun...<br><br>&lt;b&gt;US was interfering with China's own problem but at the same time they told China they do not accept two China existing together? What hypocrite is that?&lt;b&gt;<br><br>The fact is the world needs a 'police'. Countries cannot be allowed to do whatever they want. There will be total chaos and everyone would suffer. It is undeniable that US gets to benefit most from this peace and maybe at the expense of other countries. But those countries would suffer alot more if not for US. The fact is nations hate to be checked up upon. My mother likes to check up on my activities and i find it extremely irritating but the intentions are good. The US has a lot of faults but if US were to relinquish its role, who would asume responsibility?? Noone would dare to. The fact is a lot of nations are vocal when the right decision is clear and silent when there is controversy. They rather stand on their moral high ground and let US make the decisions. When the decision proved unpopular, they are quick to criticize and condemn. It takes courage to make vital decision, much less of it to criticize.<br><br>Terrorism is a problem for all civilized nations. Yet why is US doing most of the work and why are they bearing the brunt of the Middle-East hatred? Becuz it is their responsibility and they have to bear the risks that come with it. Don't be so naive and think that they would be no terrorrism if there isnt any US.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Found this interesting letter on the net written by a Canadian. Just like to share it with you guys.<br><br>America: The Good Neighbor<br><br>This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as the most generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the earth. Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy were lifted out of the debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of dollars and forgave other billions in debts. None of these countries is today paying even the interest on its remaining debts to the United States.<br><br>When France was in danger of collapsing in 1956, it was the Americans who propped it up, and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it.<br><br>When earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the United States that hurries in to help. This spring, 59 American communities were flattened by tornadoes. Nobody helped.<br><br>The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped billions of dollars! into discouraged countries. Now newspapers in those countries are writing about the decadent, warmongering Americans.<br><br>I'd like to see just one of those countries that is gloating over the erosion of the United States dollar build its own airplane. Does any other country in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing Jumbo Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star, or the Douglas DC10? If so, why don't they fly them? Why do all the International lines except Russia fly American Planes?<br><br>Why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or woman on the moon? You talk about Japanese technocracy, and you get radios. You talk about German technocracy, and you get automobiles.<br><br>You talk about American technocracy, and you find men on the moon -! not once, but several times - and safely home again.<br><br>You talk about scandals, and the Americans put theirs right in the store window for everybody to look at. Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued and hounded. They are here on our streets, and most of them, unless they are breaking Canadian laws, are getting American dollars from ma and pa at home to spend here.<br><br>When the railways of France, Germany and India were breaking down through age, it was the Americans who rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an old caboose. Both are still broke.<br><br>I can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced to the help of other people in trouble. Can you name me even one time when someone else raced to the Americans in trouble? I don't think there was outside help even during the San Francisco earthquake.<br><br>Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one Canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get kicked around. They will come out of this thing with their flag high. And when they do, they are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating over their present troubles. I hope Canada is not one of those<br><br></div>

Bombing Pearl harbour only speeded up congress's decision or roosevelt's plan to use it as a back door into declaring war on Nazi Germany.<br><br>The US had already lost ships in the Atlantic and Pacific to Jap and German U-boats. So it was only a question of time. And frankly, no sane govt would wanna commit their soldiers into any war unless absolutely necessary. So it's superfluous  to say US didn't want to get involved.<br><br>Anyhow, again, the facts and logic dun sound off revenge as the reason to drop "little boy" and "Fat man". The horrendous casualties during the island-hopping campaign prompted them to use it to FORCE the Japanese into surrender, something they would have been unlikely to accept had extreme measures not been taken against them.<br><br>So if they were not out for World peace, wat were they out there for?
