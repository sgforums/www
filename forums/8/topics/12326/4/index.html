So if the americans think the same way as u do , i believe more lives will be killed. Pple get educated not for nothing . n u dun use violence to slove problems. I agree that US had been rather arrogrant but no one deserves to die.<br>No point arguing what had happenend b4 ( wat the US had done ) But what can the US do now. So do u think we should revenge on Japan on what they had done to us? What's done cannot be undone. So do u want more terrorist to do more fearful things to U.S so more amercians will die? Even if someone is ignorant , they dun deserve to die<br><br>This message has been edited by domyoji33 (edited 12 September 2001).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by domyoji33 (edited 12 September 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like domyoji33, i feel sorry for those innocent lives sacrificed, whether it was during the current attack or those that took place becoz of US's KPOness.<br><br>Personally, i believe that the US do have their fair share of faults. However, if they were never there to interfere, or perhaps another 'big brother' nation was up there, to deal with the problems, things could have been worse off.<br><br>The more important thing currently, i feel is that the US would not wage a war, or anything of that sort to any ctry. Instead, concentrate on rebuilding those major structures that were under sabotage and recovering their economy, if not the world economy which was already on the verge of toppling would crash.<br><br>'I promise tt there'll be times for quarrels n a time when we mgt go seperate ways, but i oso noe tt if i let u go now i'll regret dis 4eva coz i noe tt u'r e 1 4 me'<br><br></div>
