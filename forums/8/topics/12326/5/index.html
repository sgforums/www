            <div class='col-md body'>The numbers do count as it not only reflects the amount of lives lost but it also represents the number of people who are going to grow up without their mums, dads and their loved ones. Though the physical injuries are great, the emotional scar is much greater and would have a much a greater effect. It is sad that lives are lost, be it the life of a top ranking officer, the life of a father trying to work for the family or the life of a terrorist dying for an unjust cause. The value of one life is the same as that of another, be it an ambassador or a lowly civilian. As the British Prime Minister had said: "These attacks were perpetrated by fanatics, utterly indifferent to the sanctity of human life."<br><br>The U.S does not deserve to be attacked. Nobody should be blamed for these attacks except for the terrorists themselves. Even if the U.S were to share part of the blame, these disagreements should be settled at the diplomatic table and not through cowardly acts such as this. Furthermore, these acts are carried out with the full intention of killing civilians. The bombing of the Chinese embassy was an accident and can u please specify what attacks they made on third-world countries? The US don't take military actions just for the fun of it or just to flex their muscles. You think that US wants to be Kpo? Please.. they wanted to pull out of the Middle East peace process and wanted to reduce their presence in Asia but the European countries wanted US to continue the peace efforts and countries like  Taiwan and Singapore want their military presence to maintain stability. According to your logic,  Europe and Singapore too should be blamed for these attacks as well since they're the ones that wanted US to be Kpo. I'm not naive to believe that US does not gain by being a Kpo but realistically peace costs money. Many Malaysians believe that the water treaty benefits us more than it does them and that Singapore are taking advantage of them..so is it justifiable if they were to attack Singapore?<br><br>You might think that the US are abusing their power but realistically their actions are severely restrained by other countries. We can actually control this 'police' of ours. I know that US has a lot of blood in its hands but I believe that for every blood taken, countless other lives are saved and peace and liberty is protected. Unlike this terrorist act, most of US military actions are justified. U dun wait for somebody to stab you with a knife before you start defending yourself do you?<br><br>"I am not siding the Terrorists at all, but If the US has never been such KPO, such disaster will never have happened"- Silverwing.<br>You are rite..if the US weren't such Kpos this disaster would not happen. Worse disasters would happen and it won't happen on American soil as their defenses won't be spread out thinly across other countries. If they were to increase their military strength, pple accuse them of starting an arms war. Now, they are labelled as being weak...While other countries are busy being friendly with China, US has to be the spoiler and remind China of its human rights issues. To me, its a thankless job.<br><br>Previously, countries have been poking US with knives and they can only retaliate by giving those countries a slap on the wrists for fear of being labelled a bully. It's all going to change from now on. Our 'police', a symbol of peace, has been attacked and they will respond. Like the German Chancellor said: "This is not only an attack on the United States but an attack on the civilized world."<br></div>

You are just assuming the communists are bad people and the US are good police. What if I put it this way :  the communists are people who dont like others to interfere their affairs while the US is someone who likes to show-off and poke into other country's affairs?<br>And, looking at the US, they allow guns and weapons to run free among the country citizens. Children killed other children with guns. Is the US doing right thing about this?<br>Look, every country has their own political bad-points. You cannot assume a country is bad because it is a third-world country and another is good because it is an advanced country who like to make peace.

It's UP TO YOU to 'decide'.....<br>But just imagine trying to help someone and end up being ACCUSED of having MOTIVEs and INTENTIONs.... Whether it's really so OR not... The FACT is we need a 'big brother'.... 'Guy' with a 'KPO'/F**k-up/ OR HEROISM attitude.... Doesn't really matter anymore...?<br><br>------------------<br>In LIGHT I shall FEAR NOT. FOR what I AM is CUT so DEEP inside of ME.<br>I LIVE my FLESH and SOUL ONLY to BLEED for the OTHERS.<br>FEAR ME NOT. FOR I AM YOUR 'MASTER'. GIVE YOU STRENGTH. FOR YOU ARE MY 'ENEMY'.<br>DEVIL PHRASE I<br><br>I have no 'friends' nor 'family'.<br>I hold no past and see not future...<br>These are just samples of illusions....<br>I don't exist, but I shall live ETERNITY.....  DEVIL PHRASE II<br><br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>
