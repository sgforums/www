Tourist attractions?</div></blockquote>True,the US suffered great casualties in the island hopping campaign trying to drive the japanese soldiers off the island near Japan.Coupled with the fact that the japanese womenfolk were being trained to kill the US soldiers led the US government to use the atomic bomb as if they really invade Japan,the struggle put up by the japanese will be so strong that countless more US and japanese lives will be lost.So the bomb was dropped to prevent more US and japanese lives being lost.Although the atomic bomb killed a lot of japanese,but the death toll will be higher had US invaded Japan as the japanese will gladly fight to the death,even womenfolk.Time to read up more on World War 2 campaigns,Silverwings,ehehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Theory Of Relativity<br>Eating a lot of good food will make 1 hour seem like 5 minutes while eating lotsa horrigible cooked veggies will make 5 minutes seem like 1 hour <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">~~~<br>Playing Diablo 2 Add-on <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[QUOTE]Originally posted by BillyBong:<br><strong> As u so clearly stated above, China can brush the US aside. So why bother that they are busybodies as long as they cannot in anyway influence the direction of the countries' govt? </strong><br><br>Yes, China can brush US aside, but it will always be better if they are to coorperate. Making a friend is always better than making an enemy. That's why in the view of foresightedness, It's always better to be friends than foes. US claims to support the doctrine of "One China",  But look at how US supported Taiwan, wont CHina get angry?<br><br><strong>And to get the facts straight, US did NOT "grant" entry for China into WTO. It was voted upon and vetoed by the WTO. </strong><br><br>Yes True. But US, being the leader of the world is one of the greatest deciding factor for China's entry to WTO. Remember when US crashed CHina's fighter plane and China was angry, refusing to return the spy plane to US, US threatened to reject China's entry to WTO.

We were at a Labour Day weekend event and he was munching on a hot dog. He suggested I choose four people, firefighters or police officers, and tell their stories. I guess I had disappointment written all over my face, because the former official - in office back when the World Trade Center collapsed - looked down, paused for a moment, and then said: 'Write that the government let us down.'<br><br>Then he could not be stopped. He started with the first bombing of the World Trade Center back in 1993 and what was learnt about Al-Qaeda and terrorism then.<br><br>He went on to the bombing of the United States Navy warship, the Cole, in the harbour at Aden, Yemen, and how that was for sure an Al-Qaeda operation. He did not mention the 1996 bombing of the Khobar Towers in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, a residence for American servicemen, but he did mention the bombing of two American embassies in Africa. Those cost 224 lives.<br><br>It has been almost a year since Sept 11, but still the anger was in his voice. The government should have known something was coming, he said. The government should have done something.<br><br>'I lost a lot of good men,' he said. 'The best men we had.'<br><br>Not a day goes by when I do not think of Sept 11. People talk about 'closure' - a silly, psychobabblish term - but there is no such thing.<br><br>At whom should our anger be directed? Well, certainly at the murderers and those who helped them. Kill them. Kill them all.<br><br>But a piece of the anger - or maybe just outrage - has to be reserved for the government, the federal government. It screwed up. It screwed up bad. That was the message of a column I wrote shortly after Sept 11. I called the terrorist attack a 'massive intelligence failure', which it was on its face.<br><br>Back then, though, we knew little. I pointed out that there had been ample warnings - including an article in The Washington Post in which Mr William Cohen, then the Secretary of Defence, had warned of the imminence of a terrorist attack. The Secretary of Defence, for crying out loud.<br><br>Almost no one paid any attention. Now we know so much more.<br><br>We know that the Clinton administration was lethargic in trying to nail Osama bin Laden. It mounted a missile attack on his Afghan compound, but when that failed, nothing much more was done. We also know, though, that government officials were growing increasingly concerned.<br><br>The National Security Adviser, Mr Samuel Berger, told his incoming replacement, Ms Condoleezza Rice, that the new Bush administration would spend more time on terrorism and Al-Qaeda than on any other subject. The new administration dawdled.<br><br>CLUES, BUT NO FOLLOW-UP<br><br>THE Federal Bureau of Investigation had warnings - tips about shenanigans at flight schools. The memorandums were filed and forgotten. The Central Intelligence Agency was on the case but short on operatives who spoke either Arabic or Pashto. The airlines were asleep.<br><br>A terrorist had been seized in the Philippines with a laptop stuffed with airline timetables, but no one was putting two and two together. Maybe in another column I will dwell on grief, mourn the dead and salute the heroes.<br><br>But this one is a reminder that planes crashed into the Pentagon, the World Trade Center and a Pennsylvania field not because the terrorists were so awfully competent but because the government was so awfully incompetent.<br><br>From the Oval Office on down the line, what should have been done was not. The terrorists succeeded because the government failed.<br><br>The former city official had one other thing to say. The people who died - the firemen, the cops, the office workers - were often brave. But to label them all 'heroes', while sometimes apt, obscures the fact that they were also victims who were ill served by their superiors, their equipment, their government.<br><br>The tendency now is to play the sad bagpipes, fly the glorious flag and rally around those whose job it was to ensure that nothing like Sept 11 ever happened. Yet it did. An accounting has yet to be made.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>think about it guys...there is more to come in this millienium</div>
