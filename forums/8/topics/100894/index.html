            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Cheap and reasonably good </strong><br>Aug 4, 2004<br><br>Prices start from $588 but you have to get used to a new software interface and miss out on cool games with the ePC. CHUA HIAN HOU tests it out<br><br>Bargain-hunting Singaporeans snapped up nearly 1,000 sets of the new low-cost ePC desktop within a week of its launch. This was despite the use of the less popular Linux operating system and relatively low hardware specifications.<br><br>"We didn't expect to do so well - we sold out over the first weekend and spent the week fulfilling the backlog of orders," said Mr Bernard Chew, chairman of Office 1, the wholly owned subsidiary of NTUC FairPrice behind the ePC.<br><br>At just $588 for a new computer with branded parts like an Intel processor, Seagate hard disk and Philips monitor, it is easy to understand the attraction of the ePC.<br><br>"We haven't seen anything else cheaper for the same configuration," said Mr Chew. The ePC is modelled after the successful sub-US$300 (S$540) desktop business of US-based supermarket giant Walmart.<br><br>Mr Chew expects to sell about 2,000 to 3,000 units monthly and is working on bringing prices of entry-level units below $500 "eventually".<br><br>One happy buyer is Mr T.S. Ong, who purchased the entry-level ePC317 system with a cathode-ray tube (CRT) monitor from the Bishan NTUC FairPrice supermarket for his primary-school children.<br><br>He found the system "good value for money - cheap and expendable even if the children spoil it", he said in Mandarin.<br><br>The ePC's affordable price comes with drawbacks though.<br><br>To keep costs low, the ePC uses the free Debian Linux operating system instead of the more mainstream Windows.<br><br>For buyers who do not want Linux, Office 1 is offering a bundled deal of Microsoft XP Home Edition and Works 7.0 for $159. There is no similar offer for Microsoft Office though.<br><br>Components are lower-end parts with sufficient power to run productivity applications but not the latest games or power-hungry applications like video-editing.<br><br>This means buyers may have to get used to a new graphical user interface. It's not dissimilar to Windows but still takes some getting used to.<br><br>In addition, the current version of the ePC lacks some features that Windows users may be used to, for example, the universal serial bus (USB) plug-and-play support.<br><br>In addition, there are less software such as utilities and games available for Linux users compared to Windows users.<br><br>"But for parents, this can be seen as an advantage since they may not want their kids to spend all their time on games," said Mr Chew.<br><br>Some buyers are even more resourceful. For example, Mr Ong, who declined to have his picture taken, plans to install his pirated copy of Windows XP on the ePC to get the best of both worlds - cheap hardware coupled with a familiar software environment.<br><br><img src="http://computertimes.asiaone.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2004-08-04/news01a_040804.jpg"><br><br><strong>HOW THE ENTRY-LEVEL EPC STACKS UP </strong><br><br>Setting up the system was a breeze. The cables were all size- and colour-coded so there was little chance of making a mistake. After plugging in all the necessary cables, I powered up the system.<br><br>It took about two minutes to boot up to the log-in screen where I encountered my first roadblock.<br><br>I was unable to find any log-in instructions in the box and made my first call to Office 1, where I was immediately given log-in instructions and was able to progress to the desktop screen.<br><br>An Office 1 spokesman explained that this was a glitch - the log-in instructions were supposed to be included in the box.<br><br>The Debian distribution of Linux included the KDE or the K Desktop Environment (a graphical user interface for Linux), Internet browser Mozilla and productivity software OpenOffice, which are all the software most home users need to get started.<br><br>I tried Linux - my first time - the desktop layout was easy to pick up and I was able to use the ePC to navigate my way around, create documents and connect to the Internet.<br><br>I found the ePC317 slow - it took about 40 seconds to start up OpenOffice. But this may be acceptable to home users.<br><br>My other gripe: The ePC did not have out-of-the-box USB (universal serial bus) support.<br><br>When I called Office 1 again, the spokesman explained that the current version of Debian does not have such plug-and-play support.<br><br>However, users can download drivers to get this to work and he guided me through the process. He added that the next production run of ePCs, which will be available within the next two weeks, will come with out-of-the-box USB support.<br><br>The ePC317 is value-for money for home users.<br><br>While the hardware is slightly pricier than a similar system built by retailers in Sim Lim Square, buyers do have peace of mind as the warranty is backed by NTUC Fairprice.<br><br>I still prefer the familiar Windows interface though, and would like to see a Windows-bundled system at a sub-$700 price point or the option of a more user-friendly Linux distribution like Lycoris instead of Debian.<br><br>Unless you need a PC in a hurry, it might be a good idea to let Office 1 iron out ePC's kinks like the lack of USB support before getting one.<br></div>
