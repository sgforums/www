            <div class='col-md body'>I was almost involved in an accident before. A few months ago (think is Dec 03), I was crossing Outram Rd going towards New Bridge Rd bus terminal, the pedestrian light was green. This ang moh drove a open-air car turning right from New Bridge Rd to Outram Rd, almost hit me! I was just a few feet away from the car, he then braked, turn to the next left lane and drove off. I was too shocked to notice the plate number. Another pedistrian walking behind me witnessed this.<br><br>Yesterday, a SBS Transit bus (believed to be service 170) was involved in a fatal accident at the junction of Dunearn Rd and Adam Rd, at 11.15am. I passed by the junction at around 10.15am, onboard service 186.</div>
