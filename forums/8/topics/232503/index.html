I did not buy the<br>roadbike because the staff serving me could not tell me the difference<br>between a $900 bike and a $300 bike except that they were both had<br>aluminium frame.  I did not buy the fax machine because no one bother to<br>serve me despite standing at the fax machine section for 15 mins. I<br>approached a staff at the adjacent section selling telephone but all he<br>told me was the staff selling fax machine is not around and did not<br>offer any assistance.<br><br>On the 21/10/06 I returned to xxxxxxxx - Suntec City - to get a refund<br>for the laptop as I had discovered that the laptop only supported<br>Windows XP and could not be used to run my DOS programme. The salesman<br>who sold me the laptop 6 days earlier was very unhappy and refuses a<br>refund  of the laptop citing various lame excuses. He finally agree to a<br>refund after I went through xxxxxxxx's refund policy with him. At this<br>point he make a photocopy of my identity card claiming the company's<br>need to track my refund history. I was outrage and disappointed at being<br>treated like a criminal and asked for the duty manager. The duty manager<br>arrived and agreed that it was not xxxxxxxx's policy to make photocopy<br>of customer's IC but he was no better than the salesman for he wanted to<br>take down my particular's instead.<br><br>I am very disappointed with the xxxxxxxx staff, from the lack of<br>product knowledge to the lack of service and finally to their staff's<br>attitude  of negating on the company's promise of a refund if goods were<br>returned intact.  They should not bother to track my refund history as I<br>will not be shopping there anymore.<br><br>Dr. A</div>
