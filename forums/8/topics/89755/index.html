            <div class='col-md body'>Read from dunno where that says " Life can only be understand backwards, but live forwards".<br>I tin it means u study history, understand where r d faults commited by previous governments and we live our lives by improving on it and not commiting the same faults again.<br>So, which proves tat history is oso quite important for the good lives we are having as well as wat we are going to have.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A lot of parents are complaining that we are loading too much facts on the average kids. I'm not saying we should do away with history. Sec 1 syllabus on Jap. occupation a bit heavy for so young. What is the point making them studying life sciences, solving very difficult maths questions, doing D&amp;T- some of these they won't make use of.   I know a lot of them drop the subjects like A.Maths, Lit cos they cannot cope.</div>
