The low cost is in china but not in shanghai / beijing. Such cities are already invaded by big MNCs and there is a big gap between city pay and rural pay. as well as between white collar pay and blue collar pay.<br><br>i think you must understand the background. this is the fact.<br><br>for example: most of the poeple in singapore stay in HDB/Condo. however, in bukit timah. people stay in landed property.<br><br></div>
