This is not everyone can do. I respect that.<br><br>One thing I wish to point out is - I know there are Malaysian students studying in UK, not because of their academic capability but their ability to pay the school fee. As you know, not every UK university is Cambridge, Oxford - having a strict entrance criteria. More wish to earn extra income from foreign students. Therefore, it is not a surprise that the academic standard is lower on those foreign students.<br><br>Do you think so? Are you just looking in this category of students and made your conclusion?<br><br>Second, 10 years of experience. Not easy, man. Most of the time, those engineers with 10 or 20 years of experience is very hard to go to another new job, unless direct competitor. Do we have so many direct competitor companies setting up here in Singapore? No, I don't think so.<br><br>This is my experience from my MNC too. Back in the States, yes, engineers of many many year experience are still in the company. Here in Singapore, not many, because they only setup a branch here less than 15 years...<br><br>Still long way to go, Singapore!</div>

As you know, not every UK university is Cambridge, Oxford - having a strict entrance criteria. More wish to earn extra income from foreign students. Therefore, it is not a surprise that the academic standard is lower on those foreign students.<br><br>Do you think so? Are you just looking in this category of students and made your conclusion?<br><br></div></blockquote>Not really. I happened to be at a pretty reputated uk uni in EE,<br>defly not one of those too commercialised or popular ones among sporeans,<br>but really reputed in whole of Europe in EE.<br><br>Well, quite a number of the malaysians then were actually<br>top students and some scholars from malaysia.<br>Of cos these scholars top the exams but not really so in pratical,<br>i believe is the lack of experiences.<br><br>Interestingly, many of the malaysian stayed on to do phds.<br>They are smart, hardworking and disciplined i have to say.<br>But still on the whole the angmohs interest level in practical stuffs<br>impressed me.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>This is my experience from my MNC too. Back in the States, yes, engineers of many many year experience are still in the company. Here in Singapore, not many, because they only setup a branch here less than 15 years...<br><br>Still long way to go, Singapore!</strong></blockquote>I dun think this is so. I believe it is spore society acceptance/recognition<br>of engineering as a profession.<br>The pay and prestige is not there.<br>So ultimately, after abt 5 yrs of experiences, most will try to<br>to get into managements, with an MBA etc.<br>While others simply jump out of R&amp;D and do sales or entirely<br>different field.<br><br>Almost no company here would employ somone who is still doing<br>engineering work at age 30+. They would rather get someone<br>younger and cheaper. You get what i mean.<br>So you better make sure u get into management by age 30-35.<br><br>A good fren of mine who is really quite a good SW eng<br>walked out of the profession and started doing bussiness<br>in entirely diffferent field. He complained of lack of recognition<br>for his work even though he helped the company solved many<br>critical issues and saved his bosses ass several times.<br><br>I have the same experiences myself and am already tired<br>of working for bosses/companies who under-recognise<br>my work. Don't think i wish to elaborate too much on these.<br>Anyways, im pretty sure i will have much brighter career prospects<br>and opportinities in US. (having worked there for a while before)<br><br>Well...you may want to approach your friends who are R&amp;D engineers<br>and ask them if any of them wish to stay in R&amp;D field.<br>Im pretty sure most of the responses will be what i had mentioned.<br><br>In simple words:<br>R&amp;D engineering has no recognition in spore.<br>Its associated with nerdiness, low pay and no career prospect.<br><br></div>
