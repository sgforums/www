I gave up also in chasing for the money.. another of my friend lent her even more.. ahha and didnt get back too ....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>10000 is not a small amount, if he wants to get married, then what about his parents, his wife etc ?? can't they support him .. ? If I were you, I won't lend, because its a loose loose situation, if he manage to return u then u are considered lucky, if he doesn't return, u keep chasing him, it will also make the friendship sour what.. so ?? what do u gain in the end...<br><br>If u owe him a favour, can return by other means... well this is just my personal opinion, the final decision is urs... if u chose to lend, then u shld be prepared not to get it back.... just think that u have gave it to charity....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>My 2 cents worth.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think for wedding dinner the chances of making money is quite high lar.  Although may not be very profitable at the end, at least can cover cost so less risk that your friend will default on payment.  Also, he wouldn't want to end a happy occassion on a dirty note by owing you money mah, more incentive for him to pay up.</div>
