              <p>I believe, that recently the government is trying to stir up racial issues that are not there, so that singaporeans are divided by race, and no one will take nationality as seriously anymore.<br><br>For example, on of my good friends was invited to an Indian community forum where K Shanmugam was present. One topic a citizen brought up was that there is an unnecessary influx of Indian nationals coming here and behaving horribly horribly.When a few others suggested that not many Indians need to come here to work, K Shanmugam flared up and said that if he were to restrict number of Indians, there would only be too many Chinese people from China. Then when the citizin pointed out that it is not a matter of race, but of nationality, Law Minister had no answer.<br><br>Similarly, about the Amy Cheong issue (which was blow out of proportion) K Shanmugam said that Singaporeans have deep fault lines with racism, which is completely wrong. <br><br>So here is what I'm saying: Nowadays, Singaporeans are more united than before, and race is not a dividing factor, but nationality is. This is a big problem for our ministers, as if foreign "talents" are not hired, they would lose out on a big money bomb. </p>
              <p>Is it possible that they are stirring shit up about race just so that people are not so anti-FT?</p>
