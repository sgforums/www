            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>This amazing experience occurred when I was about three or four years old, years before what happened to me in my other story, The Presence, and in a different apartment. We lived in a pretty bad neighborhood at the time. Many people died there from shootings, stabbings, and the such. This is a bit of a tangent but it helps to show how dangerous the neighborhood was.<br><br>On a certain night, my cousins were visiting and we were watching t.v. When we heard the doorbell ring. Considering how dangerous the neighborhood was, my mom motioned for us all to become silent while she peered out the peep-hole to see who was at the door. I, being young and stupid, peeped out of our big front window which was next to the door. What I saw was a man dressed all in black standing at our door with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other. My mom quickly motioned for me to get out of the window and I did before the guy could see me. He eventually left leaving us unharmed. Thank God! Now back to the main story.<br><br>This apartment had a long staircase that led upstairs to three bedrooms and one bathroom. The bathroom was on the immediate left while the three bedrooms were to the right on alternating sides of the hallway. Being young and afraid of the dark, I would sometimes sleep with my mom. On this particular night, I woke up beside my mom finding myself in need of a bathroom. It was eerily dark and silent that night so I figured that I'd go do my business as quickly as possible and then run back in bed with mommy. I stepped out into the hallway and made my way to the bathroom. Before reaching the bathroom, one would have to pass by the staircase. As I did, I saw something that was the beginning of an experience I don't think I'll ever forget. Coming silently up the stairs toward me was a young blond nurse. She was pushing one of those hospital emergency beds and upon it was the figure of a person covered from head to toe with a white sheet. Mind you, these beds usually have wheels that should squeak and generally make a lot of noise hitting the steps when pushed up a staircase. However, the bed made no sound at all as she wheeled it up to me! When she came near enough to speak with me (oddly, I don't remember feeling fear while I spoke with her, only curiosity) she said something that has horrified me ever since I could remember it.<br><br>Nurse: Will you keep this body for me?<br><br>Now, I had no intention of "keeping a body" for anybody so I responded very plainly.<br><br>Me: No.<br><br>The nurse again asked, "Will you keep this body for me?" and I again said, "No..." I got the feeling that she wanted to go somewhere and leave the body with me but I also got the feeling that If I kept it there was no assurance that she would return to get it back.<br><br>We repeated this a few times-the nurse asking me to keep the body and me firmly refusing.<br><br>Finally, the nurse said something like, "I'll show you," as she lifted the white sheet of off the face of the body. What I saw immediately replaced my curiosity with terror. I saw a bloody face so disfigured with cuts and bruises that I think an immediate family member would have a hard time recognizing it.<br><br>After showing me this, the nurse had the nerve to ask me one more time , "Will you keep this body for me?"<br><br>I looked from the horrible face to her and said, "No!"<br><br>At this, the nurse somehow wheeled the bed around and began to walk down the staircase without a sound until she reached the bottom and disappeared.<br><br>I don't remember if I used the bathroom after but I do remember jumping back in bed with my mom and cuddling next to her for the rest of the night. I told my mom and she thinks that the nurse possibly could've been someone who was murdered in the apartment considering how dangerous the neighborhood was.<br><br>I am not known to be one who makes up things like this and, seriously, how could a toddler come up with such a vivid and disturbing story? To this day I don't understand why the nurse wanted me to keep the body and I still wonder what would have happened if I had said yes...<br><br></div>
