            <div class='col-md body'>Chiam See Tong in his early days as MP, asked why HDB flats are so expensive. Now that is a silly question, because every Singaporean knows HDB flats are subsidised. He also asked more benefits for workers in 2001 recession, I guessed at that time he forgot that LHL has already said that reducing worker benefits is good for workers because otherwise employers will run to China.<br><br>Chiam seems out of touch these days, fighting for the downtrodden, poor and unemployed. He still fights for freedom of speech and democracy. But what Singaporeans want is ENTERTAINMENT - SHOPPING and TOURS!<br><br>His opponent Sitoh realised that and is organising a MEGA tour, he might even go as tour guide. After 40 years of PAP, our citizens are happy with the state of our society, we don't worry much about the poor people, the sick people, unemployed people and the loss of Democratic rights and freedom. What we want as Singaporeans is good deals in electronics goods and good tour packages.<br><br>To win the next election, Chiam has to stop harping on issues like unemployment, poverty, medical care, cost of living, democracy and organise more budget tours and shopping trips. I suggest he organise a tour called "GIGA tour to Malacca" complete with stopover at JB for seafood and grocery shopping to beat this Sitoh feller's $88 MEGA Port Dickson package.<br><br>After 40 years of PAP and all the "indifference conditioning", the Opposition parties and members face an uphill task. Unlike other countries, routine topics like unemployment matters little to Singaporeans whose pre-occupation is shopping.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sacarstic as usual.<br><br>But some of what you say are quite true, as in nowadays Singaporeans want more entertainment instead of caring for the poor, elderly and sick. Going by how many Singaporeans want a casino here, it is very obvious. Nearly half of the population wants it and their reason - we can earn more money.<br><br>As for Singaporeans don't care for Singapore, it is still too early to tell until something happens to Singapore. Wonder how many will stay in Singapore.</div>
