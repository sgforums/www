Outside the school border - does it mean in a public venue i.e. common roadside pathway? Does it state that there should be no smoking within 10 meters or something? If there is , your friend is in the wrong. If not, the security guards are in the wrong , however doubt if there is any recourse to it unless you dare to challenge them to CMF (call my father).

So do you judge a person that much by his external?<br><br>wait.. did i even mention, fight?</div></blockquote>Oh! Yes, you go to school. Yes, you might know how to obtain high marks in your exam. BUT I think ----<br><br>You have not LEARNT!<br><br>Why?<br><br>Don't give trouble IN SCHOOL does not mean that you are a good student. A good student must behave well anywhere and any moment!<br><br>You have given yourself double standards! One in school campus and another one out of school campus!<br><br>Smoking, tattoo, wearing offensive clothes, these are all INDEED bad habits and behaviour!<br><br>Schools donÂ’t bend students from doing something for nothing. Because you have not LEARNT the reason, the purpose behind the disciplinary action taken by the school, thatÂ’s why although you donÂ’t do it in campus but you still think that it is OK to do it outside. If youÂ’ve really LEARNT, you will never do it anywhere and any moment!<br><br>A responsible school should not only teach you the subjects youÂ’ve enrolled but will also teach you how to be a positive, well behave and self disciplined person. It should also teach you how to differentiate Â“rightÂ” and Â“wrongÂ”, what is Â“normalÂ” and what is Â“abnormalÂ”, what is Â“appropriateÂ” and what is Â“inappropriateÂ”, what is Â“positiveÂ” and what is Â“negativeÂ”. If you have really LEARNT, then you should know what the things that you should do and in which way you should behave.<br><br>A personÂ’s Â“externalÂ” can tell people not all BUT A LOT about him or her. The Â“externalÂ” is not referring to whether beautiful or handsome but whether clean, neat and whether well behave.<br><br>I judge a person from both his external and internal. I CERTAINLY, DEFINITELY donÂ’t judge a person ONLY from how high marks he can obtain in his school examination!<br><br>Happy Learning ChingAlvin! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

A kid want to behave sard sard like an adult?!  What has he learnt?! Without proper learning and keep thinking of acting like an adult and fighting for "rights" and worst still he DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IS RIGHT AND WHAT IS WRONG, most probably he will be ended up behave like a HOOLIGAN and NOT AN ADULT!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Let me tell you, if nobody correct him or if he continue to behave in this childish, stupid and terribly negative way, in future, the next person stop him and ask him for ID most probably will be a policeman!
