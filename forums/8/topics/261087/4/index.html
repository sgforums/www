Simple examples like giving hints for exam, asking for more marks when not satisfy with the marks given for their assignment, etc., etc.! These make students TAKE MORE AND MORE THINGS FOR GRANTED!

Like one of our members mentioned: Student is the king! There are all kinds of OVER-convenient feedback channels for students to COMPLAIN their teachers. Students even are ASKED to or APPROACHED or even come to the extent like "BEGGED" to give feedback on all their teachers! You know what I mean? ---<br><br><strong>Teachers nowadays are GRADED BY STUDENTS!!</strong><br><br>I don't mean providing feedback channels is no good, we just don't need to take it until that high profile like APPROACHING them to give feedback and even providing questionnaire for them to just tick tick tick! Come on, if a teacher's attitude is bad to the extent that students can't tolerate, then do you think they won't take action to complain, do you think they don't know how to complain and must wait until you push questionnaire for them to tick?!<br><br>Actions like providing them questionnaire or sort of "begging" them to feedback will definitely give them wrong impression that teachers are under their "CONTROL" and trying to TAKE ADVANTAGES on their teachers!!! Simple examples like giving hints for exam, asking for more marks when not satisfy with the marks given for their assignment, etc., etc.! These make students TAKE MORE AND MORE THINGS FOR GRANTED! A simple and obvious example is like what our ChingAlvinÂ’s way of thinking Â–<br>Â“we are consumer, why are we subjected to wat they deem as inappropriate?Â”!<br><br><strong>Students nowadays are really OVER PAMPERED!!</strong> and become like what Chinese say --<br><br><strong>No Big No Small!!!</strong><br><br><strong>LUCKILY! It is really lucky that we still have this compulsory National Service!</strong><br><br>Let all those over pampered young people to go for at least 2 years of serious and tough training!<br><br><strong>I really think that our way of treating EDUCATION needs to be revised!</strong><br><br>I really hope that our NS boys will never be pampered like our students.<br><br>I really hope that our army officers will never have to treat our NS boys like their CUSTOMERS!!!<br><br>Otherwise ----<br><br>It will really cause a <strong>BIG DISASTER </strong>to our nation!!!<br>[/b]</blockquote>Whoa, whoa, relax, man. Not all students are like this; remember, it's always the minority who give the largest negative image.<br><br>Yes, I'm a student in a JC, and yes, I admit I have a comfortable life. Many students have comfortable lives. However, that is not a good reason to state that ALL students are over pampered.<br><br>The reason for the MOE adopting more liberal practices is that they want to breed a new kind of student: one who is willing to speak up and give ideas and comments. The more authoritarian style of learning and teaching doesn't help in this case, because the student is not considered; it becomes a very one-sided affair. If the teacher is a terrible one (in part with your unhappiness with grading teachers), then it would be worse, wouldn't it? For creativity to be nurtured, you have to remove certain restrictions.<br>An analogy would be that of an eagle. Chain it to its perch and it'll never soar. Let it fly freely and it might attack you or do business on your clothes. The key to it is balance between the two; to train the raptor to be listen, but allow it to fly when it wants to. This new plan of the MOE is obviously in the development phase, therefore, it's not exactly working out the way we want it to.<br><br>Of course, respect still has to be kept. I do my part by greeting any teachers I see, and paying attention in class. I also remind my friends to try and be respectful. It doesn't harm anyone in the process anyway.</div>
