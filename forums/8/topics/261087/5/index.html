[b]EVEN FOR EDUCATION</strong>!! They treat it like <strong>DOING BUSINESS</strong>! Treat students like <strong>CUSTOMERS</strong>! I've got friends teaching in our University, JC and schools. When I chit chat with them and talk about this issue, all of them gave me the same feeling! Their morale is low. They MUST serve students like surving CUSTOMERS! Like one of our members mentioned: Student is the king! There are all kinds of OVER-convenient feedback channels for students to COMPLAIN their teachers. Students even are ASKED to or APPROACHED or even come to the extent like "BEGGED" to give feedback on all their teachers! You know what I mean? ---<br><br><strong>Teachers nowadays are GRADED BY STUDENTS!!</strong><br><br>I don't mean providing feedback channels is no good, we just don't need to take it until that high profile like APPROACHING them to give feedback and even providing questionnaire for them to just tick tick tick! Come on, if a teacher's attitude is bad to the extent that students can't tolerate, then do you think they won't take action to complain, do you think they don't know how to complain and must wait until you push questionnaire for them to tick?!<br><br>Actions like providing them questionnaire or sort of "begging" them to feedback will definitely give them wrong impression that teachers are under their "CONTROL" and trying to TAKE ADVANTAGES on their teachers!!! Simple examples like giving hints for exam, asking for more marks when not satisfy with the marks given for their assignment, etc., etc.! These make students TAKE MORE AND MORE THINGS FOR GRANTED! A simple and obvious example is like what our ChingAlvinÂ’s way of thinking Â–<br>Â“we are consumer, why are we subjected to wat they deem as inappropriate?Â”!<br><br><strong>Students nowadays are really OVER PAMPERED!!</strong> and become like what Chinese say --<br><br><strong>No Big No Small!!!</strong><br><br><strong>LUCKILY! It is really lucky that we still have this compulsory National Service!</strong><br><br>Let all those over pampered young people to go for at least 2 years of serious and tough training!<br><br><strong>I really think that our way of treating EDUCATION needs to be revised!</strong><br><br>I really hope that our NS boys will never be pampered like our students.<br><br>I really hope that our army officers will never have to treat our NS boys like their CUSTOMERS!!!<br><br>Otherwise ----<br><br>It will really cause a <strong>BIG DISASTER </strong>to our nation!!!<br>[/b]</blockquote>sinkapore is really hopeless case. so much of education yet ethics have been degrading as the years go. how r we going to entrust this nation to future ministers who happened to be a bunch of complain kids who keep talking about Rights when they do not have EQ?</div>
