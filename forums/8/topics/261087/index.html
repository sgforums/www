            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, i would like to ask, is there a set of laws protecting student rights?<br><br>Take for example, is it necessary for us to produce our student ID upon request by the school security? Or, are we subjected to the school if we smoke around, but not within the school campus?<br><br>I am fed up with the school's security throwing their weight around, i would like to build up on my knowledge on things like this.<br><br>Not that i want to do bad things but there's this once, i stayed in my class past 5.30 PM, doing work.<br><br>The security came in and ordered us out and i asked him why cant we stay in class?<br>he buey song and immediately changed his tone, saying we go against the security's order, demanded our ID and said he wants to charge us.<br><br>I dont like security throwing their weights around so, would want to built up on the rights of students... thanks</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>They are protecting students' rights to a safety environment by checking carefully. So asking for ID is perfectly reasonable. Whats the big deal of showing it to them.<br><br>But from your story, it seems like theres no need for the securities to do what they have done. Wanting to charge you?<br><br>About u not allowed to stay in the class after school, check with your school admin, maybe its a school policy.<br><br>However, it does sound like they are abusing their authority in your case.</div>

See securities are not police. However, this kind of case is possible to win but highly unlikely. Because it is almost impossible to prove to the judge that the security does not have a reasonable suspicion  against you or what you are doing at that time.
