            <div class='col-md body'>The Meaninglessness of Sincerity<br><br>i once asked someone what this whole "sincerity" thing was all abt but never got a good answer out of it. what is it to go after a girl "sincerely" anyway? maybe i'm being naive but is there another way to go after a girl? you mean some ppl like a girl and wish they could be more than frens but do it "insincerely"??? what does that even mean??? i would be most grateful if someone could enlighten me.<br><br>which leads to my next point. assuming we know what it means to be "sincere", then is bugging a girl all the time showing your sincerity? i've heard of cases where the more you persist with a ger, the higher the chance you'll succeed with the girl. of cuz wif other gers, the more you persist, the more they hate you and tell their frens abt you. but why should it be that for some ppl, "sincerity" is equated with how much you bother the girl??? i really, honestly don't get it.<br><br>if a guy leaves a ger alone after she has shown no interest in him, does that mean he is not being sincere? i thought the guy was showing a good measure of respect for what the ger wants. you mean if i dun respect her wishes and persist some more, that is a measure of my sincerity??? goodness. plse tell me that sincerity means more than this. if a ger doesn't show interest, isn't it only prudent to forget abt her and move on? even if the guy moves on, does that mean he wasn't "sincere" in the first place? you mean if one is "sincere" he should never be able to get over a ger? or is it that if a guy gets over her too quickly then he's not being sincere? double goodness. i always thot that sincerity meant that you like the girl for who she is and really want to see if things can work out between the two of you. no one can be certain what the outcome will be. but then that's the chance he's willing to take. it's a serious matter and that's what he really wants to do, to give things a try. but then this would be true of every person who goes after a girl right? so what is so special abt this thing called "sincerity"? everyone is sincere one what!<br>but if this is the case, then "sincerity" in courtship has no meaning. because everyone is sincere to some extent. but why should the "extent" of sincerity count for anything at all?<br><br>methinks that if you equate sincerity with how much (or how) a guy is willing to chase you (the "extent" of sincerity), then i wonder whether it's a measure of his liking for you or a measure of how much you want your own ego stroked instead. sincerity shouldn't be (though i know for some ppl it is) a big concern at the initial "chasing" stage. it (i.e. sincerity) should only become apparent when (or if) he is willing to work thru the r'ship and all its problems and ups and downs. isn't that the true measure of sincerity? and so if you know a guy is like that, that he has the kind of character that is willing to see things thru and work things out thru thick and thin, then that's a measure of his sincerity right there. he just is that kind of person to be serious abt a r'ship. so shouldn't we move beyond the surface level of what "sincerity" means already? if sincerity is just abt how much you'll do for a girl at the start of the r'ship, then that's a very poor measure of the guy indeed. which guy wouldn't put his best foot forward and give it his all? so the one who can convince you the best is the most "sincere"??? triple goodness. once you get to know the guy, you'll know whether or not he's the kind to play around or the kind who will flee when problems arise or whether he will stick by you no matter what. the true measure of sincerity to me is whether he can last the long haul. see after 2-3 yrs whether he will still do the same things he did when he was first courting you. most guys will not. if you think otherwise, you must know really amazing guys. stick with them then.<br><br>my point is this: tying sincerity with what or how much a guy is willing to suffer for you or do for you at the start of a r'ship is not a sure sign how much he'll treasure you later on. and yet some gers place so much emphasis on this fact. in the end it's all a game isn't it? who impresses you more at the start. how peculiar human beings are to place so much hope on something they know will not be indicative of things to come. in other words, a show of "sincerity" at the start of the r'ship is pointless, meaningless and empty, if you think that that "show" points to how much he likes/loves you. and yet some guys are being picked over others precisely on this score.<br><br>if you think all this is obvious, and that there will be other factors that girls figure into their assessements, then why is it that "sincerity" still figures so much in the evaluations of some gers?<br><br>"oh, but he sent me a 100 roses every day for the entire month of february!"<br><br>"he didn't have to call me. i was overseas yet he spent so much money calling me every night. and he lost so much sleep even tho he had to work the next day."<br><br>"oh i told him abt this really expensive watch i really liked and he bought it for me! and i don't even know him all that well!"<br><br>"he made me these little cards to tell me how much he missed me. and he writes such wonderful poetry!"<br><br>aren't all these signs of what one might call "sincerity"??? of cuz if there is no chemistry in the first place these little signs lose their meaning. but even if the chemistry is there, what meaning can one find in these signs? if a ger likes two guys and one does more for her than the other, she'll prob pick him. but why??? cos of how he makes her feel? he makes her feel special maybe. in the end really, all "sincerity" amounts to is making the ger "feel" that she is special (tho i think this is a really impt thing to do, it shouldn't be equated with sincerity). it's a fleeting, momentary thing. whether or not she really is special we will only know in the long run. cos once the "feelings" are gone and problems come around, we'll see whether the "extent" of sincerity now is proportional to the "show" put up at the very beginning. what i'm trying to say is that "sincerity", a concept for so long restricted to what a guy would do at the start of a r'ship, should instead (and more properly) be a concept used only in the long run. at the start, everyone is "sincere" (and so the word has lost its meaning) and the only thing that matters is how you make each other feel. sincerity should be taken out of this context and put to work in the longer term. it shouldn't be abt how much passion there was at the beginning (altho passion is impt, it shouldn't be equated with sincerity). sincerity should, instead, be abt how hard a person is willing to work at the r'ship down and thru the years. but since you can never tell at the outset whether someone will stick by you thru all the ups and downs, "sincerity" can never be spotted beforehand. you can only gauge it by how a person handled previous r'ships (and even then it doesn't mean that your r'ship wif the person will end up well), not by how much he is willing to do for you now. sincerity then can only be appreciated in retrospect, as it were, thru the rear view mirror. hence, liking a guy at the very beginning because of his "sincerity" is (as the title of my post says) meaningless.<br><br>quadruple goodness! so cheong hei! i go for lunch now.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah, heard from some ger frens that height certainly matters. the taller the better. even the really short gers want tall guys. something abt giving them a sense of security. or so they can wear really high heals or platforms or whatever. which means that even if u have a face right now that only your mother could love, take heart, cos if you have the height, they might just fall for you. maybe being so tall and so high up makes the view from down there a little hazier....they can't see your face. so they think you must be okay.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>dunno abt muscles but being toned will help too. generally try to stay fit-looking (even if you're not fit). i believe having broad shoulders helps add to the sense (or illusion) of security too.<br><br>back to the topic, i think some gers want to be impressed by different guys and so they go serial dating and look for this thing called "sincerity" or some x-factor thingey. some are afraid if they commit too soon then one day someone "better" may come along and then they'll already be attached. but what they don't realise is that this can happen at anytime with anyone at all. so these same gers run ard with different guys (i personally know some of them), trying to find that elusive "right" guy, even when right before their eyes there are some good choices already. "not quite good enuf," some may think, "there's more down the road maybe". but we can never be sure. for all you know, the "better" or even the "best" one may have been further up (instead of down) the road than you realised. you may have already met him. maybe even the first guy you met down the road may have been THE "right" one. why not? are you going to give him up just because you felt he wasn't sufficiently "sincere" (in some vague sense) or because he didn't harass you enuf for you to think he was sincere? some things, some opportunities, only come once. not all guys sit and wait for you while you look and pick and choose. tho some suckers will....<br><br>like i said in my earlier post, how things feel at the beginning with a guy and how they may seem to be are not indicative of long term success. my guess is that we should take a chance on ppl we like and are comfortable with and whom we know will work hard at the r'ship, without forgetting how to have some good old fashioned fun along the way.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by ray (edited 11 June 2000).]</div>

This ironic feeling really seems awkward.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Anyone faces this problem too?<br><br>[This message has been edited by weez (edited 15 June 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>weez - ya i think i noe what you mean. icq/irc is deceptive. can communicate for months there sometimes and all seems so nice and rosy. then once you meet up it seems like u dun really noe them even tho you guys have talked abt everything from a to z. and somehow after the meeting the magic is lost sometimes. so sad.....altho once on irc/icq again you feel like you "know" them again. maybe that's why should try to spend more time knowing them in person lor. icq/irc should be secondary.<br><br>damian - it's true not all girls are like that but it doesn't help when many of the ones you know are like that. welcome to the real world i guess.<br><br>[This message has been edited by ray (edited 15 June 2000).]</div>
