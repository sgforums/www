Each squad will have 5 gunmen and for each gunmen, they will have 5 rounds. 4 blanks and 1 live randomly arranged without them knowing. Each gunmen will have a different arrangement. At the warden's cue, the squad will then burst fire at the target (i.e. the prisoner with the garb).

            <div class='col-md body'>Was wondering if anybody seriously put themselves in the shoes of a person who is due to be executed by hanging?<br><br>As someone said earlier, someone who is due to be executed but yet cannot do a single thing about it. I believe the prison authorities would have removed all articles deem to be 'dangerous'. So even if one wanted to go 'out' with his/her own hands, you won't be able to.<br><br>What would one feel and think as the execution date draws nearer? It's like going on a journey, except it's a one way trip, leaving this familiar world to the next. Depending on one's beliefs, what would be waiting at the other end?<br><br>Would you be able to eat when you're at death's door step? Does it really matter how much is spent on that last meal? Doubt you are even given a fork and knife, well, not metal ones anyways. Would you be able to sleep on that last night?<br><br>You are lead to the gallows. What would you be thinking now? Does making peace with your maker really help now? Does the executioner wears a mask? What does he say? You are lead over the trapdoor. If one wasn't scared earlier, you would be right now. The your hands and legs are bounded if they weren't earlier when you were lead out of your cell for the last time.<br><br>Perhaps your charges and punishment is read to you. Any final words?<br><br>Perhaps a hood is put over your head, but does that really matters.<br><br>When the trapdoor is released, you would free fall for a second (your life flashes before you) until the maximum length of the rope is reached. The weight of your body applies pressure on the noose around your neck. The tensile stress created from the sudden stop of the free fall severs your vetebrae and spinal cord. The last thing you hear would be the cracking of your back bone. But your heart continues beating for the next 15-30 minutes.... You are later brought down and certified dead. And your organs are harvested....<br><br>If the execution is deemed humane by some people, the process leading up to it is mind-wrecking.</div>
