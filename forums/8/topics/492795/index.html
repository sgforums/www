              Most Singaporeans are very kind., while there some nasty ones around. Those you see on Facebook are the minority...
              They are like that because their jobs were taken up by foreigners, overcrowding, etc. Don't worry, they are just the minority.
              Enjoy your stay here. :-)

              <p>I studied in Singapore when I was younger (around 12 / 13) and remember getting picked on constantly for having freckles on my skin and ginger hair. It is true Angmoh do have hairier arms. I used to be quite jealous of my Chinese friends. I was also picked on for having thin lips and that I was n't able to kiss anyone because I had no lips.</p>
              <p>Looking back its just teenagers being idiots but I am still quite self concious of my Angmoh traits. I even considered having lip implants and getting rid of all the hair on my arms and legs. Then I thought who cares this is how i was made.</p>

              <p>thanks for the replies - well i assume he was singapore coz he had a singapore accent and used the racial slur 'angmoh' which i find rather offensive. singapore is a very hot country for me - i cant help but sweat! and yes i am hairy and the sweat and har combos producers odour - hopefully my body will get used to the heat....</p>
              <p>was discuessing this with my friends last night...</p>
              <p>I was lead to read about a killing of a white guy in boat quay last Xmas - beaten up by some singaporeans - i was also told by my colleague of an irish friend of his beaten up at Archipeligo  - he was hospitalized for 3 months then had to go back to Ireland - he was too traumatised.</p>
              <p>Listen i know singaporeans are  good peace loving people - you have a great and very safe country - its a fact - but in any other country these examples I mentioned would be described as hate crimes pure and simple - but when the victim is a White its ignored and brushed under the carpet ......</p>

              <p>I suppose the one common denominator in all these accidents is that they were in boat quay - probably a likely place for flashpoints to occur - i get that - i just wondered if there was a latent animosity towards 'angmog' amongst people here and it some how surfaces in that environment......</p>
              <p>In England for example there is alot of latent hatred towards the muslim minority now and ive seen it appear often in 'drinking environments'.....</p>

              <p>I was only called names and abused at school and it was only verbal. I just think its normal teenagers being idiots with each other. I would imagine boat quay is not the most pleasant place in the world  especially late at night.....maybe clarke quay is more 'civilised'......</p>

              <p>Racism stems from ignorance. If a man says he hates this race or that race without giving them a chance to get to know clearly the good and bad.....then its pure ignorance and racist.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>however if a man has lived all his life with people of the race he dislikes. He has tried every means and given every shot to make it work fairly and yet if he after decades still finds he dislikes that race....its NO LONGER called racism.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It becomes a conscious choice that is derived from this very human trait called EXPERIENCE</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Singapore is a big city and there are many people with diverse views and experiences with angmohs. Some angmohs have bad intentions and seem to be parasites and leech whatever Singapore provides them. Some angmohs have good intentions and love Singapore way more than many Singaporeans do. I know that there is an increasing number of angmohs immigrating to Singapore for work and eventually gaining Singapore citizenship. When someone says fat smelly hairy angmoh to you, he probably brought up a stereotype because of his bad experiences with the bad angmohs who give angmoh people a bad name. So we must try to embrace those angmohs who love Singapore and would like to genuinely be a part of our multiracial country. Don't worry pastyangmoh, its probably is just a one-off experience. If you are a citizen and love Singapore, no matter what your skin color is, the law will always protect you. Haters of Singapore's current political system are always going to stir shit up. We are a multiracial country after all where angmohs/caucasians have been a part of since our founding years. Source: Youtube link</p></div>

              <p>I do not agree that "angmoh" is a racial slur. It is hokkien for "red hair".</p>
              <p>I guess it was used when the hokkiens first come into contact with westerners (caucasians) who looked very different - with blue/green eyes, non-black hair etc.</p>
              <p>Personally I am fine with ang moh, indians, chinese, etc. As long as they don't create trouble (loud music late into the night, drunk behaviour, agrressive behaviour etc.)</p>
              <p>I am a Singaporean and most of my working life, I was a minority in my workplace! So, lots of experience working with non-Singaporeans. Most of them are great colleagues and friends. But being physically different does beget some unwanted attention sometimes. Cannot be helped - I feel out of place when I am overseas in some countries.</p>
