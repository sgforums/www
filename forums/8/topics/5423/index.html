            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm, seems like this is a touchy topic 'cause i dun see any replies yet...<br>well, first of all, i'm definitely younger than you but my dad has something similar happen to him in ur situation... well, he was the boss and it was a colleague who was trying to "hit" on him. but my dad very blur one, he dun even know... his motto is as long as he's "clear inside" it dun matter. so he treats everyone the same way, no matter how they feel... he told me he even scolded dat girl once cause she messed up on some big project... everyting is all good now because girl found new person to flirt with... marriage is definitely very important, i'm sure u know dat... i even told my dad i'd beat him up if he ever thought of divorced and he just laughs. i guess, u could try ignoring it and focus on ur family and work and u won't even notice her... or maybe she flirts with all people too so its not like she;s into u... she's just like dat... a flirty, horny slut  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> just dun take it seriously... ever told ur wife about it though?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for the advice, I will take on board what you say Wu tang and after the next show is finished I will make a move. I won't need to close my eyes though as she is quite nice in that headmistress, power position, kind of way. Actually its quite a turn on having a nice lady in charge of you, telling you what to do. I'll tell you all how it goes, just hope the wife doesn't find out.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well I did as originally suggested, and Sue was really fantastic, as soon as got John P and the other wasters out of the studio we got down to business on the table. Unlike anything I have ever done before, she is out of this world. Just hope my wife doesn't find out, just can't get Sue out of my head though. Keep thinking and saying her name over and over again.<br><br>Why do you want to acid attack me, I asked for advice, didn't see much until I said I was taking what was on offer. Well it is too late now, and Sue wants it to be a regular after work thing, I will just have to go along with it now and do as she wishes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ally - I am sorry to hear about your economic strife. It is nice to see a man taking responabiliy for his familys well being even if it means doing unpleasant things.<br><br>And for all you others with your talk about acid and condemning this man. Sheesh... The acid thing is so downright stupid I will not even comment it. And for you who say Â´donÂ´t do itÂ´, have you ever been forced to tell your children that their vacation to Bahamas has been cancelled or that you have to sell one or two of your daughters ponys just because you donÂ´t have the money. I thought not.<br><br>A mans greatest responsibility is to his family and I am glad that Ally realizes this and acts like the provider they expect him to be.</div>
