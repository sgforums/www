              I notice something... in JC, it seems the majority of students are middle class to upper middle class. ( i'm one of them), and only a few are from poorer households. There also seems to be a lesser percentage of broken family without a so called nuclear family.
              
              whereas, for many people who drop out after o levels, it's likely to be poorer family with less stability at home and financially.
              
              What strikes me is that though only 10% of Singaporeans stay in private housing, there seems to be a disproportionately large percentage of those in the JCs. (and even my sec. sch, SJI)
              
              
              So what do you guys think?

              <p><br>I think your maths failed....10% of Singaporeans is alot of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>But what are you looking for?</p>
              <p>Is it a poor student who is smarter than the rest of the middle-class and upper middle-class students?</p>
              <p>And that poor student don't really have money to buy books or study cos he needs to help out in his family business?</p>
              <p>And does he also comes from a single parent family, whose Mom left his Dad and him for a richer guy when he was young?</p>
              <p>And his Dad happens to run a Tofu Shop in Bukit Timah Hill and he always need to deliver fresh tofu everyday rain or shine down the "mountainous"  Bukit Timah Hill Road at 3am-4am and he only takes like 5-15 minutes or faster if he is focused?</p>
              <p>I know who you are talking about......he's also very handsome one right? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p><br>I think too much weight is being put on the financial ability to hire tutors for your kids.</p>
              <p>Is it too much to expect that parents who are more financially capable simply have more knowledge and experience in knowing how to educate or inspire their children to learn ?</p>
              <p>Knowing how to inspire your children to learn is hardly exclusive to only rich parents.</p>
