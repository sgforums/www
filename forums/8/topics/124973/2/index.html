            <div class='col-md body'>Up to now people have not woke up from reality that singapore is bulit only for the so-called "elites" and "royalites".. Failures and their future generations will be systematically "terminated".. It's a "high-class" communist country with some hilter's influence..<br><br>It's not hard to see this point from the many speeches and policy implemented over the years.. singaporeans are systematically put into heavy burdens that build up over the years so that they got no chance to have a say.. It's a vicious cycle..<br><br>If one is poor and nobody helps him and does something stupid, it is a social problem and not just his problem.. imagine if the whole Damn country start to have many poor and with minority super "elite" a revolution would take place..<br><br>This is a clear signal that we should instead look at how the poor and jobless are coping..<br><br>In singapore begging is consider illegal.. try living like him for just a week with no lights, no money but with kids and no job.. then maybe you will get to know his psychological state..<br><br></div>

"some ppl" will say that is alot.. u know 300% increase!!! but just look at how much other things increase over 30yrs too.. then u know 300% is nothing....<br><br>so this loyal staff was retrenched but heng this company is a big MNC(of coz not locally owned) give him alot for the retrenchment.. enough for him to enjoy this life for the next 10 yrs at least... but this loyal guy worry about his son and daughter's future decided to save every single cent to pay for future education fees so he started looking for a job again....but 30 yrs of loyalty mean nothing in todays world... so he cant find a job... and cant stay in a job for long after that.. reason being....china man or m'sian are always cheaper and younger than him in which ever company he work in... dun even dare to take sick leave even if he is sick... scared that it will be another good reason for the employer to fired him.....and now he will collect used drink can and newspaper coz those thing can get him a cup of coffee or 2.....and still looking for job.<br><br>my point of saying this boring story is that not everyone is lucky... some have choice some do not .....but are we going to just forget them and blame them for this?....is the government doing enough for those ppl help make Singapore what she is today or are they going to reward those ppl that may make Singapore wat she WILL be in future?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think we can't do much for those who is already caught in this current situation.<br><br>What I find worrying is that there are a lot of Singaporeans who are headed in that direction. Is there anyway we can prevent this vicious cycle is the question.<br><br>I have seen quite a number of people around me who are just making ends meet. No savings, no insurance etc and they are paying for their bills and children. They are still young now but what happens when they are older and fall sick? Where is the money coming from? As well, due to daily necessities alot of items are bought via monthly installments. They won't feel it now, but once they hit their 40s.....we see another group of people affected.<br><br>I guess the key now is to stay relevant but it is really a chicken and egg problem - You need money to stay relevant. Another way is to change the mindset that a lot of Singaporeans have - Ask what you can do for the company and not what the company can do for you. If one can do that, the rewards will come naturally.<br><br>To me, we are all in our comfort zone and having FT here is taking away that feeling because alot of the FT who come in, come in hungry and will work for a lower pay and pick up more duties. I'm not talking about highly paid caucasians here but skilled professionals from India, China, Malaysia etc. As locals we will have to further prove to our companies that we are worth the higher pay they are paying us for our work, and not paid higher because we are locals. The world is getting smaller and competition fiercier. We really don't have that luxury anymore.<br><br>From what I see, things will only get tougher, not easier. Guess we all have to brace up for the rough ride  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

The singapore govt takes a different approach. If companies want to screw employees, the govt helps to bend them over and hold them down. This helps attract foreign investment.</div>

It is for those heading into the trap. As mentioned, it is a chicken and egg problem. Anyway I think that instead of the government giving out the 'economic relief fund' to everyone, even to those who don't need it, they might as well put it in some skill upgrade program for people who wants to upgrade but can't afford to.</div>
