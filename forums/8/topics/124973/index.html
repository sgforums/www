So many shops have closed down. Sole proprietor are dividing their small HDB shop into four microscopic parts and letting them out for a measy few hundred dollars, just to substain their rent..<br><br>Savings in the bank doesn't yield as much interest as in the past.. The advice from our parents that keeping money in the bank for our future doesn't apply to our kids.. its not a people's bank as proclaim any more, with 2 dollars deduction for accounts less than 500, and some bank 1000..<br><br>Go to Jalan Besar, China town and you will see the Living wretched old man lives by scrapping and sleeving off old electrical wires of appliances to sell the copper as scrap,cutting out old carton boxes to sell etc...<br><br>They struggle just to earn enough money for a days meal. It is a day to day survivor for many peasants out there.. everything seems to be going down-hill.. It doesn't help with our very own propaganda state controlled sh*t times, where information is often doctored, and people are mis-inform of whats the real situation..<br><br>We can see many tents being put up at east coast, where those poor peasants call it their home.. something that does not happen in the past..Look around your neighbourhood blocks at night.

            <div class='col-md body'>While Khoo was jobless for 10 months, the family's electricity supply was cut, telephone line disconnected and they had little food. They sometimes ate in the dark and the children studied near the window, making use of light from the corridor.<br><br>For now, the family - they have four children, aged three to 17 - is getting by on hand-outs from relatives, close friends and neighbours. But Madam Ziah does not want to live off others forever.<br><br>She will move the family in with her in-laws and rent out their three-room flat in Bukit Panjang, to earn some money. The eldest son is also pitching in by working part-time at McDonald's while studying in ITE, but might have to give up school.<br><br>Despite the situation, Madam Ziah defended Khoo as a 'good man' who never lost his temper, despite his mounting frustration. 'But I would rather he scolded or slapped me than go rob a bank.'<br><br>____________________________________<br><br>April 2, 2005<br>Maybank robber gets 4 1/2 years, 9 strokes<br>He collapses on hearing sentence and is taken to hospital; judge says stiff penalty needed to protect the public<br><br>By Ben Nadarajan<br>DESPITE a heart-rending mitigation plea by a man who tried to rob a Maybank branch last November, a judge dished out a severe punishment to him yesterday.<br><br>District Judge Tan Puay Boon sentenced Brian Khoo, 43, to 4 1/2 years' jail and nine strokes of the cane, after saying that protecting the public was the court's overriding concern.<br><br>Khoo collapsed after hearing the sentence.<br><br>Blind in the right eye and physically weak as a result of being shot twice by a Cisco guard during the attempted heist, Khoo did not hear his sentence when the judge pronounced it.<br><br>He had to turn to the court interpreter to find out what it was.<br><br>But the interpreter could only say 'four years ...' before Khoo gasped in shock.<br><br>'Four years?' he blurted out, before collapsing onto a fellow inmate in the dock.<br><br>The packed public gallery reacted with shock at the collapse, while policemen, lawyers and court staff nearby helped Khoo up.<br><br>The judge adjourned the court session while some police officers rubbed medicated oil on Khoo's forehead. But he remained in a daze.<br><br>An ambulance had to be called, and he was stretchered out of the court and taken to hospital.<br><br>The judge, who took a day to deliberate the sentence, said earlier that he had considered the accused's personal circumstances leading to his attempted stick-up at the Maybank branch in Bukit Timah on Nov 9.<br><br>Khoo had been jobless for 10 months and became increasing depressed because he could not provide for his wife and four children, aged between three and 17.<br><br>In an impassioned plea before the court on Thursday, Khoo moved several people to tears when he expressed remorse for what he did.<br><br>But yesterday, the judge said: 'No banks or financial institutions should be thought of as places where people can resort to obtaining easy money, however difficult their financial positions may be.'<br><br>He added: 'No worker or customer at these places should ever be subject to the terror the staff members and the customer of the bank had felt when the accused committed the robbery.'<br><br>Though sentenced to nine strokes, Khoo may escape caning because of his poor health.<br><br>The judge said he would refer all of Khoo's medical reports to the prison authorities.<br><br>If they decide that Khoo is unfit to be caned, they could refer the matter back to the court, and the judge would then decide whether or not to spare the rod.<br><br>Khoo suffered multiple facial fractures and has two bullet fragments lodged in his head as doctors felt it was too dangerous to remove them.<br><br>Escaping caning may not lighten Khoo's sentence though. Several lawyers told The Straits Times that under the Criminal Procedure Code, the judge could choose to up his jail term by as much as 12 months to 'compensate' for doing away with the caning.<br><br></div>
