            <div class='col-md body'>On April 13, 2006, my girlfriend and I was verbally abused and harassed by a taxi driver driving a silvercab.<br><br>We got on the silvercab that was parked in front of  7-11 Orchard building. We told the taxi driver to send us to two destinations. We told him to send me to Bedok North Rd and then to send my girlfriend to Tampines.<br><br>The cab driver, who was a male Chinese in his late 30Â’s, was driving recklessly at about 100 to 110 km/h throughout most of the journey. About 5 minutes into the journey, there was a truck that was driving slowly in front of us. The taxi driver followed very closely behind the truck honking away at it. This forced the truck to speed up. The taxi driver then made a sudden swerve to the right and then sped off.<br><br>At about this time, there was a very bad stench. My girlfriend wound down the window a little bit to let some air in for circulation. Upon seeing this, the taxi driver shouted angrily,Â” Close the window, aircon on.Â” We were surprised that he had to shout. My girlfriend replied that there is a bad odour and that we do not want to suffocate. With this he reacted by winding down all the windows.<br><br>As we exited pie at bedok north road, it was about 20-25 minutes past midnight. He shouted at us again, "Tell me where to turn". I said, Â“Ok. SureÂ”. I felt it was not right for my girlfriend to continue the journey to tampines with the very aggressive driver. I feared for her safety and told her to drop off with me to take another cab home. When we stopped at bedok north road, my girlfriend told the driver that he can stop the meter as she will not be continuing my journey to tampines. He turned around and with a very angry look and shouted, "What did you say?Â” She repeated and was still very calm. He then replied, Â“Ok. No problem.Â”<br><br>My girlfriend gave him some money and he gave me 17 dollars change. As we were getting out of the cab, my girlfriend asked me, Â“How much did I give the driver, was it 50 or 20?Â” My girlfriend was beside the cab and still checking how much she had left in her wallet to check how much she had given him. The driver then wound down his window and through the passenger side shouted "How much I give you?" My girlfriend then asked him, Â“How much was the fare?" She asked so that she can calculate the difference.<br>He then shouted back, "I ask you how much you just say how much." I then peered through the passenger side and told the driver "You don't have to shout at my girlfriend, you can talk to her nicely." My girlfriend then returned the extra 10 dollars the driver gave by mistake. The taxi driver kept shouting at me, "WhatÂ’s your problem hah? What's your problem?" He then said, Â“You wait. You wait.Â” He turned off the cab engine and got out of the cab, all the while shouting.<br><br>As he was approaching me, he said "You think I'm scared ah? You think I'm taxi driver I'm scared ah. So what silvercab?"<br><br>By this time he was looking very aggressive and he shouted, Â“I don't give a f***. I don't give a f*** who is standing here in front. I just shouted at her what. I did not f*** her. You so angry for what? F***!Â”<br><br>He came very close to us about 1m away. He then hurled more verbal abuse by shouting, Â“Don't want to go tampines, want to f*** is it?" He then challenged me to a fight by saying, "So what. You want to fight me ah. You fight me I fight back"<br><br>We took his registration no. and did not look back.<br><br>At this point my girlfriend told me to walk away and make a complain to silvercab. She was shaking and was very afraid for her life as she didn't know what else he might do.<br><br>The taxi driver the shouted, Â“Complain ah. Singaporeans always complain what. You not<br>gentleman. You gentleman come and fight ah."<br><br>He went back into his taxi and as he drove away, he shouted out the passenger window, "You want to f***, I send you to geylang."<br><br>My girlfriend lodged a complaint to silvercab and Lin informed her that they will notify her of the actions taken. My girlfriend was still shaking when she made the report and broke down when she had to recall all the vulgarities he said.<br>We also lodged a report to the police for verbal abuse and harassment.<br><br>I am very disappointed with silvercab to allow such a dangerous person out in the streets. What if it happened to a person with a weak heart? Something should be done to keep control of this.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think silvercab will just either ignore the complain or will just send you a letter to tell you that the driver had been sack. Write into ST fourms ba, best if you include the taxi number here and in the paper. Wonder if the driver got sack, will his taxi license be revoked by LTA? Or he jus apply to other company and continue drving and terrorizing other ppl?</div>

When we stopped at bedok north road, my girlfriend told the driver that he can stop the meter as she will not be continuing my journey to tampines. He turned around and with a very angry look and shouted, "What did you say?Â” She repeated and was still very calm. He then replied, Â“Ok. No problem.Â”<br><br>My girlfriend gave him some money and he gave me 17 dollars change. As we were getting out of the cab, my girlfriend asked me, Â“How much did I give the driver, was it 50 or 20?Â” My girlfriend was beside the cab and still checking how much she had left in her wallet to check how much she had given him. The driver then wound down his window and through the passenger side shouted "How much I give you?" My girlfriend then asked him, Â“How much was the fare?" She asked so that she can calculate the difference.<br>He then shouted back, "I ask you how much you just say how much." I then peered through the passenger side and told the driver "You don't have to shout at my girlfriend, you can talk to her nicely." My girlfriend then returned the extra 10 dollars the driver gave by mistake. The taxi driver kept shouting at me, "WhatÂ’s your problem hah? What's your problem?" He then said, Â“You wait. You wait.Â” He turned off the cab engine and got out of the cab, all the while shouting.<br><br>As he was approaching me, he said "You think I'm scared ah? You think I'm taxi driver I'm scared ah. So what silvercab?"<br><br>By this time he was looking very aggressive and he shouted, Â“I don't give a f***. I don't give a f*** who is standing here in front. I just shouted at her what. I did not f*** her. You so angry for what? F***!Â”<br><br>He came very close to us about 1m away. He then hurled more verbal abuse by shouting, Â“Don't want to go tampines, want to f*** is it?" He then challenged me to a fight by saying, "So what. You want to fight me ah. You fight me I fight back"<br><br>We took his registration no. and did not look back.<br><br>At this point my girlfriend told me to walk away and make a complain to silvercab. She was shaking and was very afraid for her life as she didn't know what else he might do.<br><br>The taxi driver the shouted, Â“Complain ah. Singaporeans always complain what. You not<br>gentleman. You gentleman come and fight ah."<br><br>He went back into his taxi and as he drove away, he shouted out the passenger window, "You want to f***, I send you to geylang."<br><br>My girlfriend lodged a complaint to silvercab and Lin informed her that they will notify her of the actions taken. My girlfriend was still shaking when she made the report and broke down when she had to recall all the vulgarities he said.<br>We also lodged a report to the police for verbal abuse and harassment.<br><br>I am very disappointed with silvercab to allow such a dangerous person out in the streets. What if it happened to a person with a weak heart? Something should be done to keep control of this.<br><br></div></blockquote>sue the taxi driver la i think the driver must be mad.. singapore also set law saying that a guy canot say the f word to a woman or the woman can sue the guy..</div>
