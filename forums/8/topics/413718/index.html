              <p>Hi guys, I feel the need to raise the attention of the public regarding<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> 'AUDIO HOUSE'</span></strong>. This afternoon, I went to Singapore Expo with my Father with the intention to buy a '40' inches Samsung LED. TV.</p>
              <p>We walked to Samsung kiosk where there was like an aution going on there.The salesman at the front was using a microphone saying '40' inches Samsung LED TV was selling for <strong>S$1,499</strong> with freebies which are as below.</p>
              <p>1) A cheap looking HDMI cable which they claimed is S$120.</p>
              <p>2) A really cheap looking net book without a single brand on it.</p>
              <p>3) Free original wall mount</p>
              <p>4) Free delivery to my house</p>
              <p>We got the white card and proceed to the back. Before we can ask any questions, <strong>Salesman A</strong> took out the invoice and demanded us to make payment quickly before it's gone. I say ok but before making payment, I'll need to take a look at the netbook and the specs. <strong>Salesman A </strong>says I can't. (little fishy here) I demand again and he finally flash the cheap netbook infront of me and I took a closer look... damn it's looks damn cheap without a brand on it except made in China printed on the back of the netbook and he claims this brandless netbook is very expensive and came with high specs running on some cheap weird looking operating system. It's not even Linux, Windows or Mac. (umm... maybe it's better than my iPad I guess haaa...)</p>
              <p>Next he passed the invoice to my Father and my Father saw the price printed on the invoice was <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>S$1,599 instead of S$1,499</strong></span> as claimed. We asked <strong>Salesman A</strong>, did you make a mistake? Kindly check please. <strong>Salesman A</strong> came back and says there is no mistake. I demanded he check again and he seems pissed off. He came back the 2nd time and says his boss told him S$1,499 is fine but no netbook. At this time, my Father and I started to raise our eyebrowns and feel something fishy is going on here. It's totally different from what we've heard from the salesman infront with the microphone.</p>
              <p>Here come <strong>Salesman B</strong> (An award winning retard). He came over and was pretty rude (Cheap low class ah beng) and insisted both of us heard wrongly. He told us <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>everybody</strong></span> heard <strong>S$1,599</strong> and only the 2 of us heard <strong>S$1,499</strong>. I asked him who is <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">the everybody</span></strong>? Please ask the person to come over and he kept quiet. Without any hesitation, both my Father and I walk out of this so called 'GOOD' deal. IMO, we felt this is a scam and they are trying to con us.</p>
              <p>After this incident, I'll never ever step foot into <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">AUDIO HOUSE</span></strong> again because they've tarnished whatever little reputation they may have. Of course I'll warn my friends as well.</p>

              <p>Well thanks for your input. I already have an iPad so of course I'm not even interested in that cheap netbook. The issue is about <strong>AUDIO HOUSE</strong> twisting their words and the public should be careful about them. Thank you.</p>

              <p>there are lots of places not only the one you mentioned. even some people claim repuatted ones once of twice you will have people complaining about their services, or theor good sold. you wanna share expereince i share with youlots lots.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BALLY FOTO, at one of the storeys funan. sold me faulty xD card when i made a camera purchases back in 2007. rsults in loss some all the data in one of my night shoots.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>JOHN 3:16. solded lemon condition items to me, also one other overpriced items.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BARGAIN CITY (online store) - sold me one DSLR probably was a display test unit. when i checkthe shutter count insied already fired about 700 when i bought it. it should be zero becasue i bought from other shops their shutter count is always 0.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so th eissue is always check pricing before buying, and some shops should be avoided. some places some items you should not buy from there.</p>

              <p>Please, for goodness sake, everyone in the crowd knew that it was $1599. And all other sales with invoices stated clearly as $1599. NO ONE else made a complaint on the price but only both of you? All other sales went through smoothly.</p>
              <p>I really dont get your point of view. If you did not hear clearly, please do not put the blame on Samsung TV promoters as NONE other customers came to complain about that particular invoicing sales price.</p>
              <p>If you think its a scam, walk away, save yourself some embarrassment by keeping quiet instead of whining here about how you got "scammed".</p>

              <p>Peronally I love to go audio house as it is really cheap if you want to save up some money or get freebies when you buy something. But end up never buy.</p>

              <p>Diamaru also have audio house right? Went there many times, salespersons more than customers at times.</p>

              <p>GLC really work there? so how's the salesman pay?</p>
              <p>playsation can sue audio house. seems like there are still people going there buy things now as i type.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>most have proof. where's the brochure? link it or scan print here. audio records of conversation (although some find it unethical, even managers and my ex-comapnyy. people whogot promoted also do that). we need some hard evidence so that juries here can make a judgement and cast votes.</p>

              <p>OIC seems like either Salesman A or Salesman B is here. <strong>Where and who is the everybody who heard S$1,599?</strong> Oh yea, I don't need you to tell me not to buy from courts and buy from
                                   you guys instead. Got it? I'll buy anywhere but Audio House.</p>
              <p>Ok great I didn't hear correctly so be it. S$1,599 then up to you
                                   not my concern. Of course I'll not even try to waste my time to tell 
                                  you where is your mistake because the best way to deal with low class 
                                  salesman like you is to let you continue making the same mistakes and 
                                  don't even realise it until the day you fall.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">In my humble opinion, I personally think it's a scam to me which is why I walked away</span></strong> without even wasting my time talking to you</p>
              <p><strong>All other sales went through smoothly? Care to prove it here? All empty talks. Don't piss on my back and tell me it's raining.</strong></p>
              <p>BTW, the 2 salesmen who spoke to me seems like some retarded ah bengs who thinks consumers are as retard as they are.</p>
              <p><strong>PS:</strong> <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">I
                                   bought the '40" inches Samsung LED from Harvey Norman for S$1,399. 
                                  Comes with Free HDMI cable, original wall mount and free delivery.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Oh yea, Harvey Norman didn't try to sell me a cheap low class net book without a brand on it for.. Let's do the math </span><span style="color: #000000;">S$1,599 (Audio House Price) - S$1,399 (Harvey Norman Price) =</span></strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>S$200 (Haaaa....
