              <p>OIC seems like either Salesman A or Salesman B is here.
              <strong>Where and who is the everybody who heard S$1,599?</strong> Oh yea, I don't need you to tell me not to buy from courts and buy
              from you guys instead. Got it? I'll buy anywhere but Audio
              House.</p>
              <p>Ok great I didn't hear correctly so be it. S$1,599 then up to
              you not my concern. Of course I'll not even try to waste my time to
              tell you where is your mistake because the best way to deal with
              low class salesman like you is to let you continue making the same
              mistakes and don't even realise it until the day you fall.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">In my humble opinion, I
              personally think it's a scam to me which is why I walked
              away</span></strong> without even wasting my time talking to
              you</p>
              <p><strong>All other sales went through smoothly? Care to prove it
              here? All empty talks. Don't piss on my back and tell me it's
              raining.</strong></p>
              <p>BTW, the 2 salesmen who spoke to me seems like some retarded ah
              bengs who thinks consumers are as retard as they are.</p>
              <p><strong>PS:</strong> <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">I
              bought the '40" inches Samsung LED from Harvey Norman for S$1,399.
              Comes with Free HDMI cable, original wall mount and free
              delivery.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Oh yea, Harvey Norman
              didn't try to sell me a cheap low class net book without a brand on
              it for.. Let's do the math</span> <span style="color: #000000;">S$1,599 (Audio House Price) - S$1,399 (Harvey
              Norman Price) =</span></strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>S$200 (Haaaa.... You're lucky if you can
              sell it for S$20).<br></strong></span></p>

              <p>Hi, I dont know if your mentally retarded or you have selective hearing which enables you to not process the information into your minute brain. I guess balding at 20's really affects your thinking processes.</p>
              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I have already mentioned, no other customers came to complain about the price, the whole crowd had a few hundred people? The buyers for that particular set did not even complain but only you?</p>
              <p>And please, throughout the 15 minutes conversation, you kept mentioning your ipad at home, do i look like i give a flying fuck about your ipad? If you are so rich, why come for this IT show for cheap bargains. And btw people, he actually snuck through the crowd of hundreds of people to grab the 5 cards the emcee was holding up. It was a mess. Would a rich person do that? Or a cheapo which couldnt satisfy his gains.</p>
              <p>Calls us retarded ah bengs, but so? We have a decent job, we got families to raise, and at the very least, I dont use my money to fucking show off, dude, whatever man about your ipad. Who knows if its even made from some china brand, cheapo. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>P.S, did you go to lao fo ye at expo? They sure can help you with hair problems, better go fast, before that small patch of grass on your head you call hair, disappears.</p>

Who knows if its even made from some china brand, cheapo. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>P.S, did you go to lao fo ye at expo? They sure can help you with hair problems, better go fast, before that small patch of grass on your head you call hair, disappears.</p>

              <p>Hi, I dont know if your mentally retarded or you have selective
              hearing which enables you to not process the information into your
              minute brain. I guess balding at 20's really affects your thinking
              processes.</p>

              <p>I have already mentioned, no other customers came to complain
              about the price, the whole crowd had a few hundred people? The
              buyers for that particular set did not even complain but only
              you?</p>
              <p>And please, throughout the 15 minutes conversation, you kept
              mentioning your ipad at home, do i look like i give a flying fuck
              about your ipad? If you are so rich, why come for this IT show for
              cheap bargains. And btw people, he actually snuck through the crowd
              of hundreds of people to grab the 5 cards the emcee was holding up.
              It was a mess. Would a rich person do that? Or a cheapo which
              couldnt satisfy his gains.</p>
