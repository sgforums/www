            <div class='col-md body'>Sat at BK at cine for 3 whole hours talking about our woes, heartbreaks, aspirations, with a couple of other guys from college into the wee hours of the morning. At the end of it, we felt ever the more depressed and disillusioned with our lives. On the way out of cine, met this gal who was a year my junior at college, found out that my friend was actualli interested in her for quite some time. Come to think of it, I thought her quite attractive back in school. Decided no pt thinking on, so deviated my thoughts on to some other subject.  Took a cab home, paid the fare to the driver who was doing 120kmh on the CTE, can't blame him though with the number of taxis on the road at this time. Got home, turned on the news, eat the packet of cold-stilled fried rice my mum mistakenly bought thinking I was coming home for dinner. Ate it through with the minimal savagry my hunger could afford me, all this while shuffling between cable channels.</div>
