Since it had been hours since her last meal and she was feeling hunger pangs, she flew down to the irresistible delicacy and began to pig out.<br><br>She ate and ate.....and then....she ate some more!!! Finally, she decided she'd had plenty.   She washed her face with her tiny front legs, belched a few times, then attempted to fly away. But alas....she had eaten far too much and could not get off the ground.<br><br>Wondering what to do about this unpleasant situation, she looked around and spotted a pitchfork leaning upright against the barn wall. She'd found a solution!! She realized if she could just climb up that handle and jump off to become airborne, she'd be able to fly again.<br><br>So, she painstakingly climbed to the top of the handle. Once there, she took a deep breath, spread her tiny wings, and leaped confidently into the air. She dropped like a rock and splattered all over the floor.<br><br>Dead fly.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> What is the moral of this sad story?<br><br>"Never fly off the handle when you know you're full of shit."</div>
