When you become too possessive, it would lead to disastrous consequences which make everything irreversible. Trust me, it has happened in my life, and I have completely lost someone from my life.<br><br>Sometimes, in life, we have to let go whether we want it. If love is ever a choice, who would want exquisite pain.  I learned from recent experiences, if I love that someone, I just let go and give her the space to grow and have her way. I might not be happy to allow this to happen, but if it is the right and sensible thing, then I should do it. It does not matter what happen to me, but what I can do to make her happy. I would feel happy for her if she finds that someone later in her life, whether it be me or not. It is better that way than to suffer later if u insist on happiness now? It is your choice.<br><br>Going away to another place is a good thing because it gives you a fresh start and u make your own life in another place...

Nobody can tell.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>However, I agree with prodi, you must have the strength to go on and make a new life of your own, cannot stay on the same ground for your life, earth moves, so does people..<br></strong></blockquote>if you do not lift that matter off your chest, it will follow you wherever you go. Ultimately its yourself who you have to face, not the places which reminds you of her. Yes, by going to another place you may have a new life, but you are just trying to "forget" and not "accept". If you can "forget", one day you will "recall" and everything will all come back to you.<br><br>If you have alredi accepted the truth why should you leave ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi UgLy BuT AdOrabLe,<br><br>You see, if the other person would choose you to be the one to give her happiness, then you do not need to ask the question whether if u leave her behind, it would mean anything anymore. It is a choice which we have to make. Sometimes, it is not up to us to make such choices. Circumstances play a part in steering our decisions. We cannot decide to love, but we can only choose to love.<br><br>I would leave u a quote from Neil Gaiman's Sandman for a reflection :<br><br>"You are mortal: it is the mortal way. You attend the funeral, you bid the dead farewell. You grieve. Then you continue with your life. And at times the fact of her absence will hit you  like a blow to the chest, and you will weep. But this will happen less and less as time goes on. She is dead. You are alive. So live."<br><br>Have a good day...</div>

(check out my comments on the Thread "I Can't Forgive and Forget") I never believe in forgetting, but accepting. You can't accept something by running away from it. But you can accept it by facing it, though it is going to be painful.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>and I feel that there's no need to forget, coz its unforgettable, its a part of my growth, and a lesson. I'll treasure it very much.<br></strong></blockquote>exactly ! that's why i never believe in "forgetting", these things are part of your life, if you want to have *complete* happiness, you must learn accept your *complete* life. By forgetting, you will fail to accept your life completely. I think you know what i mean and are sharing my thoughts.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>if I have to "changed" myself, to upgrade myself into perfect to suit him, then I think, it wouldn't be me anymore, coz I think ppl changed according to time and experiences, not as and when U want to change, then you can changed.

In terms of skill, morals, ethics and character. I don't have a good character but i am always trying to be better, every single day. And by changing into a better person does not mean you are not yourself anymore, do you get wat i mean ? If you have changed to a better person, you are now THAT better person who is still yourself.<br><br>I only hope that when my right one arrives, i have much more to offer her than what i can ofer her now.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Guess I ought to do more soul searching<br></strong></blockquote>this is already a subconcious sign of you wanting to be better.<br><br>[This message has been edited by LittleMan (edited 06 April 2000).]</div>

It varies from person to person.<br><br>Sometimes i think it is just an excuse for a breakup. That person is just not comfortable with your presence and your very presence will be seen as "possessive". It just leaves us thinking "Are we really THAT possessive?". I was just hoping that they dun take me for granted.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Littleman,<br><br>It is not a contradiction. It is alright that a person is away to a far distant land to start a new life. However, if one uses that the time to be away to escape from the past, one would inevitably be haunted. Hence in the end, no matter how one tries to avoid the past by going away somewhere, he would have to face it. That is something which I know from experience, that I have not able to escape. Hence the solution is to face your demons and then letting go and getting over it.<br><br>Have a good day.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How would you feel when you have to give up the person, presumably the person is happy with who they are with now, meaning they are attached. You tell them that you are willing to get out of their life, so long they are happy. Mind you, in this situation you are supposed to be the person who is hurt.<br><br>Then after a few months, their bf/gf called up and asked you about what you had done. It's like the whole issue is already over, and you have decided to let the person go away.. why can't they just let the whole issue fade away.<br><br>In wishing that the person you love will be happy, you are hurt.. and left to fend for yourself.</div>
