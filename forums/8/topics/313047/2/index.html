              as far as im concerned, seems like no consumer's complaint bout this brand or from FDA...So how can we simply say if this is just another scam of bio-ray??
                  
              As for TS, i think if u wan better explanation, perhaps might be easy for u to call their company and find out. or simply try some sample if available for very short period to see the effect.
              
              I hope u do some homework be4 straight away buy it, i know ur knees might give u problem. but some homework is all what u need to buy that expensive stuff

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Just to be fair, I've tried their socks and they do work. They gave me more energy and I felt huge improvements to my blood circulation. I was better able to exercise for longer periods of time. I also felt less pain in my feet especially when I wore tight leather shoes. However, my mum tried the socks and she did not feel a thing. One reason could be that my mum has better blood circulation than I do (I am a typical bed/couch potato). So, sometimes a product's effectiveness would depend on the individual using it. I don't think that Bio-Ray's products are a hoax, it's just that their brand sounds awfully like q-ray and bioray, therefore leading some people to associate them with one another.</p></div>
