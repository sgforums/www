              <p>Tha<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">t English is a `neutral' language is, of course, an ideological illusion.</span></span></strong> Since</p>
              <p>Singapore was a British colony for 150 years, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">English was already a common language</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">among the privileged local population who worked for the colonial administration</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">and whose children had access to the limited opportunities of learning the language.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>This included the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">first generation of political leaders who, as English speakers, had</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">access to British university education immediately after the second world war. </span></span></strong>The</p>
              <p>ideological promotion of English as a `neutral' language to all ethnic Asian children</p>
              <p>has suppressed this class dimension. The <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">political utility of this illusory `neutrality' is</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">that it enables the state to articulate, in English, its own interests distinctly, apart from</span></span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">captured by the racial majority. The position of monolingual Chinese speakers</span></span></strong></p>

              <p>When japanese came and invade Singapore, they targeted the chinese population and carried out a massacre of the chinese population.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew was a collaborator of the Japanese during WWII.</p>
              <p>This means that he was a traitor to the chinese community and also to the british.</p>
              <p>What does this say about Lee Kuan Yew's character?</p>
              <p>I think Lee Kuan Yew is a bastard chinese traitor, WWII connived with japanese, after WWII went to ang moh country, come back gain power then destroy chinese education. </p>
              <p>This type of chinese like Lee Kuan Yew that can betray chinese to such an extent is rare.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>“It is also now an undeniable fact that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lee worked earlier for the Japanese military during the Occupation making Britain’s English materials available in Japanese-language for the occupiers,”</span></span></strong> he added. </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Suffice for me to point out one example. Lee Kuan Yew in his memoirs stated that as he was working for the Japanese broadcasting at Cathay Building during the Japanese occupation. Hence, he was able to receive news before other Singaporeans of the impending Allied return to Singapore. He claimed he had discreetly disseminated the information. As such, he was afraid the Japanese authority would punish him for doing so if he were identified. It was a heroic act. He fled to Cameron Highlands to hide till the return of the Allied forces.</p>

We may note that Intelligence is a very different sector from Broadcasting.<br style="color: #ffffff; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-align: -webkit-auto; background-color: #141414;"></span></strong><br style="color: #ffffff; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-align: -webkit-auto; background-color: #141414;">She was never sued for libel. If you believe her story, then logically Lee Kuan Yew’s flight to Cameron Highlands could not be to evade the Japanese, as claimed. I am sure this puzzle must be in the minds of most of you, and especially those who will be attending the Memorial service at Nilai tomorrow, in honour of those who died fighting against the Japanese aggressors.</p>

In this, Jing Quee has done Singapore an enormous service, and lived the life he wanted to.</p>
