                  How can you blame lee kuan yew for this? You said that mandarin should be used as the main language in Singapore. What will the malays and indians think about this? He wrote in his memoirs that he made english the language in schools and workplace so that no race will have an advantage over each other (there were lots of racial riots back then) and also because it will put Singapore on an international level. He'd always encouraged singaporeans to speak good english in schools and speak chinese at home. It's the parents' fault for not teaching their child mandarin. They think it's 'low class' or unimportant. If I can choose whether I want to be good in english or chinese only or be average in both, I'll choose to be average in both. Because of our bilingualism, we can do business with both major powers, US and China. When it comes to language, I'd rather be a jack of all trades than a master of one.

              <p><br> How can you blame lee kuan yew for this? You said that mandarin
              should be used as the main language in Singapore. What will the
              malays and indians think about this? He wrote in his memoirs that
              he made english the language in schools and workplace so that no
              race will have an advantage over each other (there were lots of
              racial riots back then) and also because it will put Singapore on
              an international level. He'd always encouraged singaporeans to
              speak good english in schools and speak chinese at home. It's the
              parents' fault for not teaching their child mandarin. They think
              it's 'low class' or unimportant. If I can choose whether I want to
              be good in english or chinese only or be average in both, I'll
              choose to be average in both. Because of our bilingualism, we can
              do business with both major powers, US and China. When it comes to
              language, I'd rather be a jack of all trades than a master of
              one.</p>

              <p>Bilingual language policy is mostly a failure in Singapore. Only
              a small percentage of people are truly bilingual. Singaporeans end
              up with neither english nor mandarin. They get shit.</p>
              <p>That is one reason why I say mandarin should be the dominant
              language in Singapore.</p>
              <p>It can kill off singlish.</p>
              <p>But Lee Kuan Yew won't accept the end of bilingualism because to
              do so will harm the interests of the english speaking elite that
              controls Singapore. </p>
              <p>I hope that after Lee Kuan Yew is dead there can be change in
              Singapore's language policies.</p>
              <p>Get a banana like Lee Kuan Yew to handle language policies of
              dialect chinese. You only get shit. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Look at Chia Thye Poh's impressive command of mandarin and
              english, he is the product of the older education system:</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://singaporerebel.blogspot.com/2012/03/censors-clear-chia-thye-poh-video-rates.html">http://singaporerebel.blogspot.com/2012/03/censors-clear-chia-thye-poh-video-rates.html</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are a lot of good things that we can learn from the older
              education system of Singapore. Any reform effort must start from
              looking at what the older system did right. Why it could produce
              someone like Chia Thye Poh, good in both mandarin and english?</p>

              <p>Bilingualism policy was a flop...nanny has already admitted</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1018826/1/.html">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1018826/1/.html</a></p>
              <p>nanny's mistake was that he thought english was the driving force behind Sg success</p>
              <p>But look at countries like Hongkong, China, Japan and Korea, they are so prosperous and successful without having to rely extensively on english,</p>
              <p>They don't even need to bootlick the west by mastering the english language to perfection</p>
              <p>It'll suffice for us to just use basic english to communicate effectively, u don't need a superb command of english in order to be successful</p>
              <p>U know why singapore has become a developed nation in such a short span of time?</p>
              <p>Cos it has no more land for future development liao, most of its available land are already fully developed</p>

              <p>no matter how 'ang moh' singapore government wants its citizen to portray, we are afterall still an asian country and society located in Southeast Asia</p>
              <p>so what's the big deal using singlish? You want kids with good verbal command of english, don't let them study in local schools, send them to Australia or USA or europe and let them interact with westerners..</p>
              <p>or there is another way, replace 70% of the population with westerners/ang mohs</p>
              <p>Now the government is starting to bootlick China by emphasizing on the importance of mandarin, and with the mass influx with PRCs into sinkieland,  i see mandarin slowly displacing english in the next few decades</p>

              PAP has invested a lot of energy into destroying the chinese education system in this country. They won't allow the threat to return. Lee Kuan Yew will also oppose it till death.
