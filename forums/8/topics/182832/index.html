            <div class='col-md body'>try sparkling juice? those bottles of sparkling juice can make the place LOOK like a club. Ambience is important as well. Dim lightings and have a mini stage for performances.<br><br>I have an idea. Split the 'club' into 2 sections. One section for students to study, the other to relax and chill out.</div>

Things that changes fast are those fashion and trends etc. This can be a place for adolescents to relax and basically chill out. It does not have to be a cool place, just a place to hang out, thats all <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
