            <div class='col-md body'>haha... I leant my lesson after pluto nash - it sucks worse than a vacume cleaner. In addition, if the show has too much computer graphics. I would not go see, yes I am hinting at starwars. If in the trailer, I see too much action and I notice there is no much storyline, I will keep my money, thank you. This is because all the stuff in the trailer is propably the only good stuff you will see at the end of the movie.<br>There are many directors out there who have too much free time and there are too many actors out there waiting for the next paycheck for their next liposuction. So they have an excuse to make a lousy movie and con our $$$.</div>

Reading reviews would probably give a clearer picture though no movie is guaranteed of its worth in most sense.<br><br>There are times when people are busy or such. Or last min intention to watch a movie. There are lines which tried to create a wrong impression of the movie from the adverts. No doubt every distributor would try their best to sell its movie to the fullest. But it does not justify to delibrately put up a LOUSY show and claiming its worth...<br><br>Watching a movie is like buying a product without actually having the rights to see it beforehand... Like me trying to sell oranges in a wrapped up basket to you... I can tell you nice things, but telling you MISLEADING things..? I still feel that such moves just ultimately reflects on one's honesty and reputation...<br><br>Of course, then again.. 'Justified' or not is really subjective in different people's eyes.
