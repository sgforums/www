            <div class='col-md body'>I need some help here. Are gals automatically assuming that u are talking crap when u praise them? I cannot seem to be able to compliment them and get a thank you. Instead I have been give skeptical looks and that kind of 'ya ya right....' kind of replies. I don't compliment people that much. But when I do, I am sincere. I wonder why is it difficult for them to accept? Maybe I am not sincere enough. I don't know.<br>Girls, any comments on this?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guy25...<br>Err...I am always guilty of that...becos I think mainly is becos they are just being modest and shy about it, esp it is the first time they hear about it.<br><br>If it is a compliment of face value...I think most ppl will be just reply it back with a smile and they feel embarrased. I think even confident gals like me can't take personal compliments very well...<br><br>I think it is just the character of the person. As for me, compliments about my character weighs much more than the looks I possess...<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa, nice to see a reply so soon.<br>It's true. Maybe compliments on a lady's appearence or something along that line is embarrassing for her.<br>Come to think abt it, I get embarrassed when someone compliments me as well. But how to make someone feel good abt themselves without making them feel like they are being patronised?  Especially when it is someone u care and like, how would u convey the message? Maybe if that person looks exceptionally nice that night? Or if I find that person very smart? Should I let my thoughts be known? Or just keep it to myself?<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I think a lot of this has to do with the self-confidence of the person. I used to stammer and play down the praise. Then a friend scolded me, "Why can't you learn to accept a compliment graciously?" Nowadays I just smile, say thank you, and change the topic. Either that or I'll diffuse any discomfort with teasings and jokes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some reason why compliments are hard to accept:<br><br>1. You're scared that it's a joke and the person will turn around and call you arrogant.<br><br>2. You don't think you deserve the compliment (self confidence a factor here)<br><br>3. You are scared you cannot live up to it. Or you don't want to.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>JC Boy,<br><br>I forced myself to learn how to accept compliments graciously. Still not very good at it myself.<br><br>If you want to give compliments, offer it most casually. (If you kan cheong, she will feel kan cheong too) As an added measure, string a distracting question after it. Like "You look beautiful. Have you eaten?" So if she feels uncomfortable, she can choose to just answer the second question.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe I can contribute from what little personal experience I have had.<br><br>First of all.... most girls (i think) take compliments bad because it puts them in a situation where if they accept the compilment is makes them seem arrogant.. so the only other option is to act skeptical and hence make the situation awkward.<br><br>Of course most people do think there is some truth in compliments... why else would people say them???<br><br>I find the easiest way is to compliment somone is in a kind of joking way... It'll usually be a korny kinda line but it doesn't put them in a bad position if they believe you or not.... plus they usually are pretty funny and can easy some of the tension of complimenting someone..... anyway... if u say it enough... I'm sure they'll get the message that your not just saying it....<br><br>Well I dunno if that sounds pathetic or not.. but I think it works... but I'm not the most experienced person... so don't but putting your faith in me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

I dun see any redness in them...how do you manage to keep it like that? no matter how hard I try, mine gets red anyway...you see...(show her your eye...ha ha:-) sure to take pressure off....:-)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sincerity. Only wholehearted sincerity reflected through your tone of voice when u praise anyone, can u expect to get the person to accept your compliment.
