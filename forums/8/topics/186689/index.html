From the posts above, I gather the old route is Timpohon. That was what I took at the time. Basically, the route, at least as far as to the laban rate resthouse, is pretty straightforward and involves nothing more complicated than climbing steps. However, i will not say it is very easy. I recall it as being pretty darn exhausting, though I was very unfit at the time.<br><br>The way my friends and I did it was to travel to the resthouse in time for some dinner and a bath. Early next am, we then tried for the summit. This was definitely tougher than the last section. There was no real steps here and you simply followed a guide rope up to the summit.<br><br>You can descent in a day. however, be careful. I think the descent is more dangerous than the ascent.<br><br>Edit: Did some googling and found this website: <a href="http://www.borneo.com.au/Mesilau.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.borneo.com.au/Mesilau.htm</a><br><br>The following quote ought to prove helpful to you<br><blockquote>The Mesilau climb does involve a climb up, then a drop into the Mesilau valley, and then another climb to regain the lost height. That was a great arrangement, as we got to see both routes. Our guide arranged transport (30 RM) to take us back to our car at Mesilau when we reached park HQ. The drive is about 30 mins.<br><br>Overall, if you've climbed the mt before, I'd recommend the Mesilau route. If not, then the traditional route is probably just as good. If you like to meet other westerners, then the traditional route is definitely better! Pretty jungle the Mesilau way.<br><br>Hard to compare distances, but I'd say it should be only about an extra hour the Mesilau way.  </blockquote>In summary, the old route is probably easier for someone who calls him/herself 'undertall'. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
