Nutrition is very impt to training. U can train like siao but if U dun eat right U cant grow. And protein is the most impt amino acid if U wanna build muscles.<br><br>For chest areas, maybe U can start doing bench presses (Flat, Incline or Decline), dumbbells presses (Flat, Incline, Decline), flys (Flat, Incline, Decline), pullovers, dips, pec deck or even cable crossovers.<br><br>Since U r a beginner, juz choose one or two compound/mass building exercises and do ard 3 sets for tt ex. For e.g. 3 sets of flat bench press (1x20xW, 2x15xW, 3x12xW), 3 sets of Flat flys (1x20xW, 2x15xW, 3x12xW).<br><br>*1x20xW --&gt; means 1 set of 20 reps x W (the weight which U can lift 20 reps without pausing for rest using perfect form), 2x15xW means the second set of 15 reps with the weight U can lift for 15 reps using perfect form etc.<br><br>For abs, U can try doing crunches, leg raises.<br><br>For upper abs, you can try doing a few sets of crunches. For lower abs, a few sets of leg raises. For obliques, you can do twists or twisting crunches.<br><br>One thing to note is do not neglect Ur other bodyparts. All muscles on your body are impt in bodybuilding.<br><br>Good Luck for Ur training.<br><br>Cheers.<br><br>Note: Results may vary, it all depends on your genetics. And results doesnt show in a few days, you need a period of time before results show.<br><br>Bodybuilding is a life long commitment.<br><br>P.S: U can try buying the protein supplements from Chunyong. Chunyong and I are using the same products and since I started using the supplements one mth back, frenz said that I haf grown bigger.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
