            <div class='col-md body'>AD2000 local or not if not den only watched chicken lice war.Local productions should be cheaper what cos the cost is also cheap. Den hor like abit cheapo to pay $8 compared to hollywood production lor. then as for english they should stick to singlish cos then f they import the movies abroad people will watch it and get a rough idea of how singaporeans interact. As for british or american they should forget it cos the way the slang will turn even a tragedy into a comedy.<br><br>------------------<br>I am American Badass???<br>Dunno leh got people say i got attitude problem which is similiar to an american punk biker.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Then as for local talent i can related with sadly i can only say Lim Kay Tong becos he is the only one who i think really has good acting skills in the local scene. Nit that we dun have the talent it is just that the talented people like myself simply dun hjave the chance to prove our acting skills. I aspire to be a actor lahbut thats not the point here the point is that all the talented local actors are not given enough exposure to the international scene.<br><br>------------------<br>I am American Badass???<br>Dunno leh got people say i got attitude problem which is similiar to an american punk biker.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'd have to say that I enjoyed Eating Air, Mee Pok Man and 12 Storeys immensely... didn't have the chance to watch "chicken rice war".<br><br>Do short films count as a movie? Singapore's released quite a few independent short flicks during the Asian Film Fest. Problem is that they all try to emulate the style of<br>Eric Khoo. Everything is always given this raw and gritty angle.<br><br>Good actors? Kay Siu and Kay Tong... and Tan Kheng Hua. She's a remarkably versatile actress. Ivan Heng is great, but a tad bit too drama-mama, but that's my opinion.<br><br>Deathwish: I believe Lim Kay Tong acted as some vietnamese militant officer in one of the low-budget films in the early 90's. Hmm.. Lim Kay Siu and his wife acted in "Anna and the King".. a rather juicy role, I might add. Lastly, Ivan Heng has played a really really tiny role in "5th Element"...<br><br>------------------<br>Don't like what I'm saying? Bite me....<br>but not too hard please.</div>
