            <div class='col-md body'>Oh you mean there is freedom of speech here? Ok then,<br><br>I think people who queue to buy hello kitties are acting out a Freudian subconscious sexual longing. It is obvious that Hello Kitties are allegories of the vagina since Â‘kittyÂ’ or cat, is also Â‘pussyÂ’. This subconscious sexual longing is manifest in the mad rush for the doll (which also has sexual implications). The Â‘pushingÂ’ and Â‘shovingÂ’ displayed in the queues are naturally sexual acts that have broken from the subconscious into the public realm. Singaporeans at last are rebelling against the sexual repression that has for so long suppressed them by turning Hello Kitty into an objectification of sexual desire.<br><br>Now if we accept that Â‘kittyÂ’ is interchangeable with Â‘pussyÂ’ to mean the vagina, then Â‘HelloÂ’ must also be latent with meaning. Â“HelloÂ’ is a cultural convention. A greeting. It implies first contact with another individual. This may be seen as a longing for a sexual fling, a one night-stand with a stranger or the hope of Â‘first-nessÂ’ Â– meaning virginity. It is well known that traditional men prefer virgins. When boyfriends and husbands say they are buying the dolls for their wives they are expressing an subconscious desire or hope that their partners are virgins or were virgins all over again for them to Â‘pushÂ’ and shoveÂ’.<br><br>Hence Hello Kitty is Singaporean menÂ’s way of saying they want or desire a virgin to defile by manner of pushing and shoving.<br><br>cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa,<br>I do get yr pt that pple should be spending their time and $$$ doing more meaningful things like charity and volunteer work instead of queueing up for 15 hrs to get a couple of kitties.<br><br>However there seems to be a few pts that I do not agree with.<br><br>You said that " my g/f can live w/o it", i agree she can. But look ard us. Do we really need that fan, that dress/shirt, that piece of elctronic equipment, that CD etc to LIVE? Do we need to go clubbing? Probably a mixture of yes and no. So why so we buy or do the things we do not ABSOLUTELY need? Because we look good in them, makes our OWN life more comfy, and basically we like them. So there you are, everyone of us do things that we simply like or maybe just out of a whim. If yr partner one day queues for something u really like, say some rare limited CD or a ticket to a concert, r u going to condemn him totally or deep down u feel happy and touched but refuse to give him due credit just cos you do not feel that it is the right thing to do and you can live w/o it?<br>I agree that there are more things that I can do and should do to help the less fortunate. But somehow or other I'm not doing them other than the occasional act of helping a blind look out and board the bus or helping an elderly carry his/her heavy bags. Guess it is just a flaw in me and many others ard whether in S'pore or elsewhere. In this case, I'm getting the kitties just to see the brightness lights up in HER eyes when she gets the surprise in school. That's my choice and decision, stupid as it may seems to some.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Anyway what is the definition of "useless"? Something that does not bring benefit to make a person's life better? Well, in this case, I satisfy my breakfast and lunch and tea for that day with the meals I got and the toy makes another person happy at least for that day if not more... So is that useless?<br>I respect and understand yr viewpt but mine is just a tad different.<br>Just my self centered opinion......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi hello kitty...<br>oooo...i saw an angry face on u....why be angry...u r the talknig point of the whole singapore point....so many pples fighting for u....u should be happy tht pples are all queuing up for u....<br><br>Hey u even did a "good job" in keeping the police busy har else they will be out of jobs.........Hmm..i even saw some Ah Lian Ah Hua fighting becoz of u....Got some threaten calls from Ah Beng too har... Hmm...and tht 's not all...U are able to caues a social disturbance in singapore which not even the opposite party can do it...<br><br>IT's really a pity tht a softtoy can show soo many ugly faces of singaporeans.  If singaporean can fight among each other jsut becoz of a softtoy...i wonder wht will happen to us when a need for us to unite to fight our enemy comes. Would all of us just be like the sand where we are all scattered ard.  I think the government got to relook at the " one people, one nation, one singapore" slogan...It doesn;t seems to fit in at this moment.  WEll, i overheard someone telling me b4 tht singapore wanna go towards a gracious and cultural country during the 21st century...Hmm...I wonder again...<br><br>As one of my philiphine colleague was telling me yesterday while reading the newspaper..." oh my gosh, why singaporeans do such thing becoz of a softtoy"....I just kept quiet as i don't knoe wht to say...<br><br>Anyway, if all the hello kitty fans out there is to buy the softtoy in a healthy and organise way...no one will bother to said anything much abt it.  Just pray tht Mac will review its market strategy when selling such toys again next time. Else i won't be surprise tht the best way to "defeat" singapore during a war is not by weapons or solders but by creating some small commotions here and there and singaporean will fight among themselves first...LEt hope we can change all these...God bless all of u...<br><br>B.regards,<br>patie<br><br>[This message has been edited by patie (edited 29 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Funny that this little fur ball would bring up so much who ha....<br>When I was in australia, when they had discounts or special offers, there were not so much crowd. When watching a movie, they actually buy the tickets 15 mins before hand. No rush man. Probably because their country is big? People are used to the slow paced life. They know that things will be there, no rush to go for it? But the funny thing is, when asians go over, they still rush for things. I wonder, is this an inbred thing in us? Are the westerners more relax? All this rushing abt is causing unnessary stress to the people. Maybe in our fast pace life, we have missed out the actual meaning of life. To live life as we enjoy. Living a day at a time. People in war torn countries are fighting for survival. We should be lucky and thankful that we have the time, energy to Q up for these dolls and not thinking abt survival.<br>The bottom line is....sometimes people get too competitive that they forget what they are fighting abt. In 5 years.....I think I would laugh myself silly thinking of the things I did for this cat.....yes I am guilty as charged.....I did Q for this, but I gave up when the Q was ridiculously long. Not worth the time. Could be spending it with people I love, or finishing work.....<br>Don't mind the shifting of ideas thru and fro....not enough sleep....from work! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ladies and gentlemen,<br>there is nothing wrong with pursuing something that one likes or wants. However, when one fervently pursues something he/she likes, the value of the object in question should be brought into consideration. It is the value of something that will decide whether the fervent want is silly or not. It is difficult to decide for others what is valuable and what is not. In a 3rd world country, water is considered valuable, but not in singapore. The food blatantly wasted by these bastards are considered extremely valuable by 3rd world country denizens. In the eyes of other people, we are throwing away something that is of "high value" for some stuffed toys that are of apparent lower value. This will inexplicably draw ridicule from the rest of the world. Yes, you can say who the f**k cares about the rest of the world. If they do not care, they could easily have shot you guys like animals when trouble ignites. Hence, it is totally inappropriate to harbour such selfish thoughts. Think of the ridicule the kitty queues are drawing from other countries, the image you guys are tarnishing. Think in longer terms the catastrophe you guys are breeding, the message you guys are delivering to our children. In time to come, no country would ever respect us. If things get even worse, happens periodically and gets publicised, we'd go down in history books as the country with the most ridiculous people per square metre. And you, my friends are the villians. As for people who genuinely want the kitties. I am very sad to say you guys are being collectively termed as idiots. There is certainly nothing wrong with genuinely wanting the kitties. It's those who are out for a quick buck and cheap thrill that surly your actions for wanting the kitties. What you guys could have done is trying to forgo the kitties and look for alternative pleasures in life. Certainly the time spent could be used chasing some other pleasures in life. There is no need to add to the furore just to further your wants. You will certainly not die if you do not get the kitties. In the unlikely case that you will die if you do not get the kitties, contact macdonald's, I am very sure they will be glad to save your life... and probably enrolling you for some psychiatric treatment. I hope everybody spend some time reflecting on this issue, the ridicules and inconveniences these HELL Kitties have brought to us. I am very sure all of us can think logically when the red mist of rage and jealousy has subsided.  And please, there will be never be a rational conclusion/resolution if we are not ready to discuss things calmly. Let us all grow together as a nation, gracefully.<br><br>[This message has been edited by StRiDeR^ (edited 29 January 2000).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by StRiDeR^ (edited 29 January 2000).]</div>

There is once where people in US and UK also have long queues for teletubbies and end up fighting but of course, curbed in time, before glasses are broken..

            <div class='col-md body'>After seeing all those reports about the craze about Hello Kitties. I don't think much of it until I went to Northpoint the other time (it was during the sale of the Romantic Wedding Fashion). The crowd was DAMN long man! It stretched all the way from Northpoint Mac till the Bus interchange!<br><br>We normal shoppers have to cut across the queue just to go over to Northpoint. You should have seen some of their faces man. Like want to kill me for cutting across...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Me and my bud got into an arguement about this Kitty Craze. He collects em all and was crazy enough to queue 10 over hours to buy two pairs! Well, he told me that there were Police stationed at every Mac to control crowd. I don't think I saw any cops at Northpoint... Probably he mistook the Security Guards for Police! Hahaha!<br><br>Well, I've overheard some of my colleagues saying that fights broke out mainly due to queue-cutting. My bud told me that IT'S ALRIGHT AS THE PEOPLE WHO CUT IN HAD FRIENDS QUEUEING AHEAD! Thank God for him the crowd at Mac didn't hear this comment of his, or he'll be lying in Tan Tock Seng Mortuary.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Seriously, if those guys are thinking of centralizing the Kitty sale counter at ONE MACDONALDS, the Police Task Force, Civil Defence and probably SAF Armour had better be put on standby. I can't imagine 108 Macdonald outlet crowds combining into ONE FUCKING CROWD! It all takes is just one fight about queue-cutting in the middle and it will turn into a riot!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Personally, I have nothing against this Hello Kitty and it's pretty cute. But to queue over 10 hours to get a pair is NUTS!!! True, it MAY BE collectors items, but what happen if the Kitty Company decides to re-release the Wedding Fashion Collection FOR SALE AT ANY KITTY SHOP?!  :p<br><br>I can't imagine their faces...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

And the government still say that they want singapore to become a first class economy with first class citizens. With these types of people around, how is it possible for singapore to progress? You know what, the other day I was at eBay.com and I saw people selling the Hello Kitty complete collection for about 300 US dollars. People waste their time, money and food just to buy those useless stuffed toys to sell them. Think of those people in third world countries who are fighting for food and survival. Think about what all these food and money would mean to them. These people are really the scum of society. What a disgrace!!! Even my Canadian friends know about the incident.

            <div class='col-md body'>MsSeuss,<br>I applied to McDonalds for funding for my thesis. Below are extracts from my letter of proposal and their reply..<br><br>----<br>Dear Ms Heng Chee Hui<br>(McDonalds PR Officer)<br><br>I write as an avid fan of dead cows and wanton American imperialism. Allow me to congratulate you and your conglomerate in making Singaporeans look like utter idiots. Yes, I agree that doesn't require much effort since we happily do so without provocation. I also write in the hope that you share the fervent quest for social education and definition of the Singapore Identity as I. As such, I appeal to the mega fat cats over at McChicken Land to fund a research project on the impact your Hello Kitties have made to our social fabric. It is my opinion that McDonalds is enabling Singaporean men to express themselves sexually with plastic pussies. Us perverts and repressed are greatly in your debt. Your company has provided sex for the country, a good healthy meal, all delivered with a smile. I am confident that you will acknowledge this service to our anal-retinal island and agree to throw money my way to write up my findings.<br><br>Yours Sincerely<br>Terence<br><br>----- She wrote back<br><br>Dear Terence,<br><br>MacdonaldÂ’s is a well-established family restaurant. It has provided diseased cows and floppy fries to millions over the world and we take pride in underpaying our employers. We are the true spirit of capitalism. However I write regretfully to inform you that your pussy theory is unfounded. It is our resident CLOWN, Mr Ronald McDonald who is in fact the vessel for sexual objectification. Mr Ronald McDonaldÂ’s big red feet are allegorical to a certain part of his anatomy. Unfortunately he is not available for comment as he is currently on trial for paedophilia. Charges were brought against him during a routine birthday party at our restaurant. I am unable to make further comments as the trial is still on-going. Nonetheless we would like to state our confidence in our clown and that the charges will be found baseless. Thank you for your interest and may your oily-beef stuffing days be long and prosperous.<br><br>Your sincerely<br>Ms Heng Chee Hui<br>McDonalds PR Officer<br></div>
