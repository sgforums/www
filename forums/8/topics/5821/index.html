            <div class='col-md body'>To Rinoa, Sparkle and the rest :<br>I share your sentiments to the subject. When I read about this incident, I was really laughing out loud here. The reasons for my laughter are as follows :<br><br>1)Singaporeans are actually fighting over each other over very trivial issues. When I was home for the holidays, I was amused by the obsession of people over a few toys. Some people bought these toys to appeal to their gfs, and some bought these toys for investments and others for a variety of reasons which I seriously wonder what is actually the level of maturity of this country by evaluating the rationale behind buying these toys.<br><br>2)The thing is that Singaporeans are sheltered from a low crime rate. They never realize how horrible it was to live in other countries where sometimes, you have to worry about your life. I was listening to an Irish friend who told me about the political situation in Ireland, and how he grew up against neighbour gangsters who extort, and have to constantly struggle for his life. This is not a joke, and we are talking about a country having political turmoil. Perhaps, we live in too much comfort that we don't have a world view of things.<br><br>3)I would imagine how my ang moh friends would be laughing over this matter if I ever want to tell them. After all, they already laughed over the issue of chewing gum, the 2 Singaporeans who got a year's jail by a random check in Singapore airport for their bodies contain drugs for 3 weeks. What else is new...<br><br>4)A friend of mine who is planning to be a teacher in Colorado where the shooting of the students happened, told me that she considers to go to Singapore for retirement, because it is very safe compared to the other nations.. People out there, valued security and safety more than we do, and what we can fight over, not freedom or anything grandeur, but a few worthless pieces of shit... What more can I say...<br><br>[This message has been edited by prodigal (edited 28 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa and all who condemn the Kitty buyers,<br>I agree with all of you that pple should not waste food by dumping them etc. They deserve to be shot and condemn. However I do not think there is anything wrong with just queueing up to buy the toy with the meal unless you create problems and fight and what have you.<br>We have people queueing for tickets to concerts, National Day Parade and things like that as well. What is the part that is disgusting is the behavior of people in the group queueing and their wastage of food after getting the meals.<br><br>I have never liked HK b4 and during this promotion I never got a single pair till this week( cos my g/f likes the Jap one). Went with a few friends to buy 4 meals each and we all took at least 2 sets b4 distributing the rest to other friends who want to eat. No wastage of meals here. Some of my friends even took the meals back to heat up in the night to eat. What's wrong with us? dun think anything wrong unless u wish to condemn us for queuing over the night to get something we want.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with Rinoa's disgust that ppl in the Third World countries are queueing for food and yet we are queueing up with nothing but HKs in mind....<br><br>Queueing up for HK is a personal choice..but the wasting of food shows the pathetic and pampered side of Singaporeans...<br><br>------------------<br>Rationale : the use of intelligence to avoid the truth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Light<br>I knew that there is no wrong to queue for something that U want but dun you think everything starts with something that YOU want and YOU like???The thing is I dun understand this rationale is that why would SG a rich country not queue to help ppl not queue to donate food and money, not queue to do vounteer work but spend their precious time and money on these useless toys..Oh,,,Just because my gf likes it....and can your gf live without it??YES!! So the point if that we are wasting our own body resources to do something that we LIKE which is so unmeaningful..Just sit down and think so many ppl queueing up for this toy,getting frustrated and as such, what do you get of the day is just a kitty and hoping some ppl will eat the food which is not the primary motive of going to MacDonalds...BUT if you were use the same amount of time and money to help the needy, at the end of the day...You will make another person or more happy..and you yourself will have a sense of self satisfaction....<br><br>I do not accuse of ppl being INCOMPASSIONATE,IMMATURE becos they went to queue for soemthing they like but for the fact is that they rather spend the time and money on something so useless than on something which is beneficial to the unprivilledged...Hope u get my point<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 28 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>riona riona riona, tsk tsk i think you've been away from home too long! since when were singaporeans a caring bunch of people? oh sure we have the "extraordinary" bunch who were featured on tv sometime ago, but hey they make up 1% of the population! the other 99% don't give a flying fuck!<br><br>and the answer lies in your response:<br>"why would SG a rich country not queue to help ppl not queue to... "<br><br>money numbs people. makes them unfeeling. surely this is nothing new? this is exactly why the courtesy campaign is still around after sooo many years! people here DON'T CARE! so please relax, and take comfort (if its possible!) in the fact that nothing much has changed since you left!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>firstly, i have to state that i find this whole hello kitty hooha very amusing, stupid yes, but mainly amusing. however, it really saddens me to see how people can so carelessly throw away food that they paid good money for... don't talk abt 3rd world countries, even in sg alone, there are families who are struggling to make ends meet, parents toiling day and night just to give 3 meals to their children. but here, outside Mc.Donald's, people are throwing food away by bags. and for people to actually resort to violence for '2 pussies without a mouth' ( <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">), well, that's plain disgusting.<br><br>however, as revolting as their behaviour may be, i feel that rinoa is taking this a bit too far... firstly, people have a right to do what they want for 'fun'. yes, SOME people are carrying it a little too far, but not everyone's like that. just like some ppl like playing DDR, some ppl love racing go-karts, and some ppl love playing pool.. there are those who love Hello Kitty. is it really wrong to want to queue up for their favourite toy? yes, they are going a little too far, and extremely kiasu.. but hey, didn't the same thing happen when they starting giving away National Day tickets?i think you're being a little unreasonable. people are entitled to the freedom of spending their time as they like it. yes, it would be nicer if we would all volunteer and do our bit for charity, but that's optional.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>WEll...I agreed tht some ppples are there becoz they want to collect the hello kitty as a collectible item....But don't u think tht queuing up in the middle of nite to do all these is abit ridiculous...It;s really too extreme...<br><br>ya pples queue up  for national day 's tickets...But this is for a differnt reason...they queue up for their own COUNTRY. They want to support their own country by attending the parade and tht why they are willing to queue up for it....not for PERSONAL reason...<br><br>Ya..pples are free to like wht they want to do and RINOA got no right to comment on all these...But since this is a forum..everyone got the right to write wht they want,correct? She is no exception too.  So u got no right to say that she is wrong in writing all these too???:-)..Of course u r free to write wht u want too? :-)<br><br>B.regards,<br>patie...</div>
