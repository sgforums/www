              <p>For me that is, I clearly know what I want from women. Well what I am going to state here are solely what I feel.</p>
              <p>1: <strong>Learn to laugh, not just at stuff but with us or even better at us.</strong><br>Humour has 3 roles, first, it identifies common ground. "Oh really you like that too?" that sort of thing. It also defuses awkward situations. Lastly it shows your spine/backbone. So go ahead and take us down a notch, laugh at our yearbooks faces, make fun of it. <br>I want a woman who is as comfortable relating her own ridiculous stuff as she is listening to mine.</p>
              <p>2: <strong>Take it outside/public<br></strong>I do personally like women who is willing to show their love in public. But that doesn't mean they should suck up to me all year long. Subtle displays, a kiss along a street, smouldering a look across at me during a party or gathering. Wow, that seriously take the heat up. I want a women that is confidence enough in her <strong>sexuality</strong> to make moves.</p>
              <p>3: <strong>Kiss me when I am down<br></strong>I want a partner, not a caregiver or nanny/whatever. We all have weakness. So fix our problems, not our character flaws. Lift me up when work project is a pain in the ass. Help me feel secure and I will want to spend time with you.</p>
              <p>4: <strong>Guys night out<br></strong>My fellow ladies here, ever being granted by a occasional guys only night out? Boxing my buddies out is a relationship breaker. Instead, if we are meeting at some pub or something, have a first round with my crew then go home and relax alittle. I will keep you in my mind all night along and next time, my buddies will whine less if I am having a date with my women during the EPL season.<br>Relate to my friends, not tolerate.</p>
              <p>5: <strong>Let me spend time with your side..<br></strong>Men are jealous. I admit it. I hate it as much as you ladies do. We are not wood, mind you. I know you flirt but I seriously don't mind -provided only words, not numbers and caresses. I want a girl who radiates, someone who makes other say " wow, interesting" I want her to be social with other men without being seductive. So introduce me to your friends. I will feel less threatened by other men in your life. Invite me along once in a while. You don't need to stay by my side constantly, eye contact across the room will do.</p>
              <p>6: <strong>Reinvent foreplay<br></strong>I love foreplay as much as you ladies do. I feel its important. It helps me to syncro with my partner. The longer the better, at least 15 minutes. Whisper to me, talk to me. Mess around, make it fun and sexy. :)</p>

              <p>Singaporean guys, I am one myself but seriously from my experience, loosen up abit people.</p>
              <p>Stop worrying about looking like Brad Pitt or some hot guy. Ladies drool over hot guys but that doesn't mean she have to have one. Then you might say "Nah she is going for a dude that have shitload of cash then." C'mon, relationship is not just about looks and $$. I feel sense of humour is the most important to ladies. What they really care is humour, not cocky but just plain funny.</p>
              <p>When a waitress spill water over you and yes that sucks but turing into a devil won't help to dry your clothes. When we men get worked up, our girl feels uncomfortable. Let it slide and smile.</p>
              <p>Let our girls see the silly side of us. being goofy. I always do to my girl anways. Lol. I feel when I am able to be myself, a woman feels like she can relax and be herself as well.</p>
              <p>Do something when she is in a bad mood, don't just stand there and wait for it to steam off. Let her know we are there for her. Listen to what she says, listen to her vent. Hold her but at the same time, don't offer solutions unless she asks for one.</p>
              <p>Most important of all.. Gentlemen, the most debated issue I have encountered in this forum between genders and even skin colours. Knowing when and how to be one is cool. Open doors for her, hold her hand as she crosses the road, help her with her coat but don't order her around like booking an appointment date with her docs when she hasn't made one. Play protector to your ladies man, when someone is being rude to her, stand up and defend her and not do nothing.</p>
              <p>Ditching any jealousy trigger helps. Reassure her, be up front. When your phone rings, answer it in front of her, instead of taking it in other room unless it's noisy. They will understand. Share your world with her.</p>
              <p>And well the sexual part, I shall skip it. Haa.</p>

              <p><br>So you agreed with Mr.Shadow? If yes, please show your support to him then.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately I'm too weak to even carry an axe, let alone grinding it..........</p>
              <p>But I have been blessed in many other areas apart from not blessed with incredible strength in your imagination.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's good to hear honest opinions coming from Mr. Shadow, and it would be great to hear more opinions from many others.</p>
              <p>So state your opinions here and show us that you're really "worldly and beyond that", otherwise....it would add zero credibility to your self-proclaimation.</p>

              <p>Ah, finally we got a foreplay master, that is what is lacking in local guys, lack of foreplay and kisses, just want to dig into it right away. Total lack of Romanticism.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whatever kisses, i find guys lack of mouth hygiene. Just can't stand a guy with a foul smelly mouth no matter how good looking he is, so please guys, brush your teeth, use listering, use mouth spray or whatsoever, get your mouth smell nice, cos we really mind. Mind your mouth.</p>

              <p>Wow Parn, that's kinda hitting below the belt on that last comment.</p>
              <p>Very aggressive for a lady, assuming you are of the fairer sex. With the internet you can never tell.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes Shadow gege, share more of your wisdom!</p>
              <p>&lt;in case its no clear, and admittedly, it is difficult to convey tone in forum messages, the previous statement is dripping with sarcasm&gt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Me personally, I have a "foreign" girlfriend. She's kinda mixed with a little french and german ancestry. Dated Singapore girls, and a delightful korean girl as well. Everybody is nice as long as you treat them well. Afterall, relationships are a two way thing.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You give and take. And if a girl is after a guy, who's successful, why not? Just like I would never say to a good looking girlfriend (although that's not paramount), I presume a girl would aso like to have a gent who's going places, especially when making a personal choice about who she wants to go out with. Just because you may be "nice" doesn't entitle you to all the girls out there in the world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And in a forum if you're shouting to the world at large that you can't get girls even though you're of "sterling character," well, I think that calls for a moment of self-honesty does it not? :)</p>
              <p> </p>
