              <p>This topic is quite funny. It consists of bitter guys and girls who have probably failed in their relationships or failed in geting their 'dream' mate (if you can find someone so perfect, maybe you might wanna let the rest know), bashing the opposite sex.</p>
              <p>It takes BOTH the guy and the girl for the relationship to work. That means NO unrealistic expectations. Guys can't expect girls to be at their back and call every second of their lives. Similarly, girls can't expect guys to bend over backwards to carry the lightest handbag in the world just because it's 'gentlemanly'. Actually, if you ask the western foreigners, that's considered wussy to them.</p>
              <p>And don't expect the relationship to be all happy go lucky. No one is perfect, and if a relationship consists of 2 imperfect people, that means the relationship will be darn imperfect.</p>
              <p>Judging by the high and increasing divorce rate in Singapore, I'd say that BOTH the guys and girls have unrealistic expectations of each other.</p>

              <p>IT's funny that you actually used and compared Singaporean culture against Western culture when you implore us to consult the western foreigners regarding the 'gentlemanly' issue over carrying handbag for the girls.</p>
              <p>Maybe you're a foreigner and that could explained why you chose to pick a western foreigner to define as a benchmark for Singaporean males. But let's face it, all foreigners are just plain rude when you place them in the midst of our Asian culture. The reason for that is, they come from a different culture and background and it's not considered rude for them in the place where they came from...but of course if they were to apply Asian culture in the place where they came from, they would be considered more courteous and polite. Therefore your comparison against Singaporean males was really done in a bad taste.</p>
              <p>One more thing I would like to highlight, foreigners regardless of your race and where you come from, generally behave better and more refined and will always put on their best act when they are outside of their home country. And that also apply to SIngaporean too.</p>
              <p>Divorce rates are high around the world and not just in Singapore itself, so if you were to do an accurate comparison for all countries, SIngapore is not as high as mentioned. Reasons for divorce varies and I have never seen a case of divorce stating "unrealistic expectations".</p>
              <p>Words are powerful if used in the correct situations, so please stay focus to the topic and focus on the topic.</p>
