              <p>You are the one out of topic...that western reference was an example, not a benchmark. And nice inference that I'm a foreigner. When I'm a Singaporean, born in Singapore, staying in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The point of the discussion is about Singaporean girls and guys. And I'd still continue my stand that both sexes expect too much from each other.</p>

              <p><br>That depends. If you take reference from the western cultures and live by their rules, too bad for you. :P</p>
              <p>Most people will of course help out at the funeral. Unless the funeral means nothing to them.</p>
              <p>Also, it again boils to the expectation of, in your example, the girl toward the guy. In this case I would feel it's quite an unfair demand to not help out at the funeral.</p>

              <p>hmm. i wasn't following the conversations, but i was just
              thinking of mixing in a little scenario.</p>
              <p>let's say.. i've a relative who just passed, maybe an aunt or
              uncle. and of course it would be very supportive to help out
              because it would mean alot to my parents.</p>
              <p>and the girlfriend's angry because we actually planned a date on
              the day of the funeral.</p>
              <p>so i assume western culture would be to screw how my parents
              feel and please the girlfriend.</p>
              <p>because if i don't, i'll be a mommy's boy, right?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>A mommy's boy is someone who cannot think on his own two feet. So everything has to consult his mommy and get her approval before anything else.</p>
              <p>Example of a mommy's boy is this . The mother don't like the girl .. the guy dumps the girl.</p>
              <p>FYI in western culture also have mommy's boy. The only difference is the number of guys is lesser in western culture because they don't live so close to their mothers. Unlike SG guys who lives WITH their mothers ..... and since mothers will always be mothers.. they will meddle with your affairs like it or not.</p>
              <p>If you are the kind who knows how to draw the line and not let your mother meddle with your private affair , then you are NOT a mommy's boy.. Gettit ?</p>

              <p>All I can say is, every women got different expectations toward
              guys. You read Maxim and FHM, look at the interviews of all the
              monthly hot chicks inside. Some of them want guys to be sweet and
              caring and sensitive to her needs, not good looking nvm. Some want
              the guy to be arrogant cos "nothing turns me on more than a bad
              boy". Some want the guy to be able to handle their child and able
              to cook cos "its sexy when he can turn the kitchen into a
              paradise".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Every girls got their own expectations, every guys too. But
              whether the expectations are good or bad, realistic or unrealistic,
              is another topic all together.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And lastly, I haven't read any of them hot chicks in those mag
              that they like angmo guys! Plus one to us Asian guys! LOL.</p>

              <p>Stucktoes: While I agree about every girl having different expectations, I'd still think that for mags, the people interviewed will be kinda pressured to give some 'nice' answer. Or an answer that would sit well with the people who're gonna read the mag. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>might not like locals, but safest bet say local lo..</p>

              <p>How <span style="text-decoration: underline;">should</span> singaporean girl behave towards Singapore guys? There shouldn't be a should. Why? Cos it is too narrow in context and gosh it looks like a mcp's kind of question.</p>
              <p>Yes it's interesting to know and read about some of the experience they have came across here but it does not represent the general. There is a flaw of mode thinking that what one has experienced truly = the reality. Just focus on the trees and not seeing the entire forest.</p>

              <p>Hi pple, just happen to chanced upon this thread. </p>
              <p>Well pretty interesting i would say.</p>
              <p>Eh, i hope i will not be flamed or considered a retard or watever.  Frankly i dun care.</p>
              <p>Wat the main point eh? How should Sg Girls behave towards Sg Guys? Lol.</p>
              <p>Correct me if i am wrong, every questions posed will originate from some reasons. to the creator, hope your relationship is doing well.  If your guy think u are misbehaving, then ...well.  Enough said.</p>
              <p>Hope someone do not start another thread on How Sg Guys should behave towards Sg Girls? </p>
              <p>I agree with some common points already highlighted, that is to be urself lor. Regardless of who or wat they are, upbringing  and where the other half come from etc.  Dun make a difference. Agree?</p>
              <p>The lucky guy or girl get their ideal partner with sincerity of cos.</p>
              <p>Sg i think is a bad generalisation. How about girls should behave towards guys should be more appropriate. I think it bring both local sexes in a bad light, if u all agree.   </p>
              <p>this is just my retarded and myopic reply. Kindly dun flame hor. I did go through all the seven pages leh</p>
              <p>Cheers!</p>
