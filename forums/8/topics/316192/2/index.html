              <p>What can I say, if your conscience is clear and you have your own goals in life, good for you! The same can't be said for the many SG duds I've had the ignominy to encounter, who are perpetually wallowing in their own trivialities.</p>

              <p><br>Life is never a bed of roses.</p>
              <p>I believe these guys whom u mentioned are deeply troubled by failed relationship or confession they experience in the past.</p>
              <p>I am just one of the pathetic example.</p>
              <p>"can't be bothered", wait for the right one etc... is an excuse we give to spare us unwanted agony, and they can be auntie asking u when are u getting a gf, must find a gf in university and so on.</p>
              <p>Therefore, being one myself makes me appreciate the pain that these guys are suffering. Not that we didn't try, just that we don't know how. We seriously don't understand what the girls are thinking.</p>
              <p>The greatest problem that any guy will have to face is to fully understand his gf really.</p>

              <p>Ya angel, i appreciate ur comments.</p>
              <p>I should say that u are still young and couldn't really see the path that leads to happiness. Nevertheless, it is great knowing u and I seriously hope that u will hold on to ur moral beliefs many years down the road.</p>
              <p>In a more serious note, I dun mind being single till i die. Let's look at Tay PingHui, borned a hunk and quite wealthy but then he has yet to get married. Lin ChiLing, 32, going to marry to a toilet bowl tycoon.</p>
              <p>So, there are many people out there who can lead a fulfilling life without a spouse, y not me? Y should I always wallow about not having a gf, money, look and so on when i can build my own career, acquire valuable IT skills and have tonnes of $$$ to keep my family happy?</p>
              <p>Most importantly, if i die die must have a wife, i can easily get one from any marriage agency and what's more I can choose those that can give me a harmonious family life, not one that constantly quarrel over money. </p>

              <p>some guys just want to have a damn gorgeous girlfriend, some guys want average, down to earth girls who understands him. some guys want girls who can understand they are also humans and will have problems, while some guys will hide all his problems and keep it to himself.</p>
