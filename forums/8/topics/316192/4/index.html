              <p>First of all , everyone must contribute thier opinions first , then we can work out from there how many different opinions are there and whether there are any similiarities , positive or negatve , slowly work it from there. Cause there is no one way. But many ways with different branches from different categories. lol.. damn.. i think i too like to categorise things.. hahaha... categories work , HR , women, CD's ,  lol..</p>

              <p><br>relax angel.. easy with those words. what he said is just a summary of his understanding. I'm sure he went through enough to say those things.</p>
              <p>nobody will deny any girl's purchasing power. but there is a sense of responsibility that all guys have been instilled since young to have to earn enough to support. in the olden days, man work female take care of home, man as long as bring money back is quite good liao. now woman come out work and also have better qualifications, it's natural that girls overtake guys in career aspect.</p>
              <p>like we have been discussing, everybody has expectations. I supposed the push to limit just meant that some girls have higher expectations in the hope for a better future. it's not wrong for him to say that because that is also a fact.</p>

              <p>bout having career lower than them, hm, maybe guy just wan to feel more superior in career la. cuz in our society, if a gal career and salary is higher, perhaps unker aunty relative will say some bad words lei. But one good thing if the gal has better career is that, the guy will have a motive to strive better and harder hehe</p>

              <p>I believe most guys are kind of easy to satisfy,</p>
              <p>girls would generally be much preferred to be :</p>
              <p>1. kind hearted, easy going, filial.</p>
              <p>2. pretty, sweet looking.</p>
              <p>3. tactful and considerate.</p>
              <p>4. good and decent, yet can be wild in the bedroom.</p>
              <p>5. height is not an issue, but not too drastic.</p>
              <p>I'm not a girl so the general guidelines for guys I don't know exactly but here's my guess</p>
              <p>1. Tall or at least a half head taller.</p>
              <p>2. Good looking or presentable.</p>
              <p>3. Intelligent in actions and decision making. -Zarks</p>
              <p>3. must be romantic if not at least must be sweet.</p>
              <p>4. Humourous enough to keep her entertained.</p>
              <p>5. Rich is a plus point, Average also can since I can afford my own stuff.</p>
              <p>6. Generous and sociable with her friends.</p>

              <p>I look for different things, so here's an elaboration of what I said at the top of page 3.</p>
              <p>1. She's got to be able to support herself and get her own life in order, without relying on a crutch like her man or her parents.</p>
              <p>2. She isn't a hypocrite (in the moral and expectations departments) or a leech.</p>
              <p>3. She can hold her own in an intelligent conversation, is not afraid of being vocal and cares passionately about a sport, hobby or cause.</p>
              <p>4. She is able to let her hair down, and is sporting about being on the receiving end of some mickey-taking.</p>
              <p>5. She should be considerate, at least be kind to other people who practise kindness, and not look down on cleaners, waiters, etc</p>
              <p>6. She inspires confidence that she does her part in the growth of the relationship. (Related to 1)</p>
              <p>7. She doesn't have problems with trust and honesty. (Related to 6)</p>
              <p>8. She appreciates and reciprocates the favours her man does for her. (Related to 2 and 5)</p>
              <p>And it won't be complete unless the lad lives up to these standards. To me, these are more important than looks and height, and apply to foreigners and locals alike.</p>

              <p>This topic is quite funny. It consists of bitter guys and girls who have probably failed in their relationships or failed in geting their 'dream' mate (if you can find someone so perfect, maybe you might wanna let the rest know), bashing the opposite sex.</p>
              <p>It takes BOTH the guy and the girl for the relationship to work. That means NO unrealistic expectations. Guys can't expect girls to be at their back and call every second of their lives. Similarly, girls can't expect guys to bend over backwards to carry the lightest handbag in the world just because it's 'gentlemanly'. Actually, if you ask the western foreigners, that's considered wussy to them.</p>
              <p>And don't expect the relationship to be all happy go lucky. No one is perfect, and if a relationship consists of 2 imperfect people, that means the relationship will be darn imperfect.</p>
              <p>Judging by the high and increasing divorce rate in Singapore, I'd say that BOTH the guys and girls have unrealistic expectations of each other.</p>

              <p>Let's face it Dura,</p>
              <p>Women are tired of being the submissive wife/gf, obedient dotter in law. Always expected to play by the men's rule.</p>
              <p>Women just want to be liberated from these traditional and conservative thinking of men.</p>
              <p>While men, wants to hang on to traditionalizm, simply because it benefits them.</p>
              <p>Modernization is creating this polarization in many relationship/marriages, therefor you see higher divorce rates.</p>
              <p>The older generations are not willing to divorce because they fear shame. How many of them are actually happy with their marriage till death do they part?</p>
              <p>Do you want to stay in a marriage when love is all gone and there's only hate and resentment ?</p>
              <p>I'm not advocating divorce, but I surely don't enjoy the idea of being force to stay in a marriage that wasn't working.</p>
