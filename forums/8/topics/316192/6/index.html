              <p>IT's funny that you actually used and compared Singaporean culture against Western culture when you implore us to consult the western foreigners regarding the 'gentlemanly' issue over carrying handbag for the girls.</p>
              <p>Maybe you're a foreigner and that could explained why you chose to pick a western foreigner to define as a benchmark for Singaporean males. But let's face it, all foreigners are just plain rude when you place them in the midst of our Asian culture. The reason for that is, they come from a different culture and background and it's not considered rude for them in the place where they came from...but of course if they were to apply Asian culture in the place where they came from, they would be considered more courteous and polite. Therefore your comparison against Singaporean males was really done in a bad taste.</p>
              <p>One more thing I would like to highlight, foreigners regardless of your race and where you come from, generally behave better and more refined and will always put on their best act when they are outside of their home country. And that also apply to SIngaporean too.</p>
              <p>Divorce rates are high around the world and not just in Singapore itself, so if you were to do an accurate comparison for all countries, SIngapore is not as high as mentioned. Reasons for divorce varies and I have never seen a case of divorce stating "unrealistic expectations".</p>
              <p>Words are powerful if used in the correct situations, so please stay focus to the topic and focus on the topic.</p>

              <p>You are the one out of topic...that western reference was an example, not a benchmark. And nice inference that I'm a foreigner. When I'm a Singaporean, born in Singapore, staying in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The point of the discussion is about Singaporean girls and guys. And I'd still continue my stand that both sexes expect too much from each other.</p>
