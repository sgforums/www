              <p>Objectively,</p>
              <p>guys who offer themselves to girls are those who know how to or at least have the effort to get what they want. can be good guy, or bad guy.. no difference.. just like those girls who display interest in you and date you.. might not mean she's easy or what ma.. if everyone play hard to get.. seems like the world is very hard to live in..</p>

              <p>Seems like honest guys are particular rare nowadays, and to be able to find one who can relate his truth directly from his heart/mind/soul is indeed the rarest of all the gems..."The One".</p>
              <p>For me, I would look at 3 areas in deciding for a guy...ranked accordingly.</p>
              <p>1) Looks (Physical appearance, body shape, hairy or not?[Beastly enough?])</p>
              <p>2) Ability (Capable or not?, LifeSkills, Intelligent)</p>
              <p>3) Personality (Able to humour me or not?, Sensible, Sensitive)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As in either they throw themselves at me or I have to go hunt them myself, I don't really mind either cases as I'll hunt and choose the right one for myself.</p>
              <p>jojobeach is fairly correct with her assumptions.</p>
              <p>I'm disappointed that Singaporean guys who are eager to launch a critical compaign against their own Singaporean girls, are not eager enough to reveal their honest inner thoughts regarding how they expects their girls to behave towards them.</p>
              <p>Those "mate'ly" types can go mate with their German whore in their Euro Forums and stop hankering over Singaporean Girls or any other asian girls.</p>
              <p>Ang Moh males are obviously and have absolutely been horrifically overrated.</p>

              <p>I believe most guys are kind of easy to satisfy,</p>
              <p>girls would generally be much preferred to be :</p>
              <p>1. kind hearted, easy going, filial.</p>
              <p>2. pretty, sweet looking.</p>
              <p>3. tactful and considerate.</p>
              <p>4. good and decent, yet can be wild in the bedroom.</p>
              <p>5. height is not an issue, but not too drastic.</p>
              <p>I'm not a girl so the general guidelines for guys I don't know exactly but here's my guess</p>
              <p>1. Tall or at least a half head taller.</p>
              <p>2. Good looking or presentable.</p>
              <p>3. Intelligent in actions and decision making. -Zarks</p>
              <p>3. must be romantic if not at least must be sweet.</p>
              <p>4. Humourous enough to keep her entertained.</p>
              <p>5. Rich is a plus point, Average also can since I can afford my own stuff.</p>
              <p>6. Generous and sociable with her friends.</p>
              <p>any other add-on qualities you seek? maybe we can start a list down.. :)</p>

              <p><br>sayang and accompany is subjective, some girls want guys to be macho and independent. not sticky.. so generally a guy should be sweet(already listed) in a girl's context would be that sayang and company issue.</p>
              <p>If I say I don't care, I'm lying. most people have expectation in the appearance. that explains the good looking if not presentable. so can bring out to show friends.. like that lo..</p>

              <p>there is no right or wrong. but it'll be a plus if the guy is sporty ba.. so more chances to share a sport hobby together. No offence to slightly overweight or average looking dudes. you'll be surprised with girls sticking with their guys no matter if they're overweight or average looking,</p>
              <p>two reasons</p>
              <p>1. some girls think plump guys looks cute and cuddly(not cuddles) and also less stress on herself to maintain herself religiously.</p>
              <p>2. average looking guys can give them a form of trust and security compared to the good looking. most have the impression good looking man are flirtatious or playboys, or pretty girls are materialistic.. vice versa.</p>
              <p>whatever it is, what size you are, someone will appreciate.. now we're making a general list.. so if you're not in the star-like/x factor/model like person, you're more likely to look around your own range.. just like if you're sporty, you'll probably look out for someone who at least willing to do sports occasionally?</p>

              <p>yea, my gal said that normal looking guy gives more security after all. The same goes to me, i would feel a bit jealous if shes too pretty and all guys looking at her and keep befrending her.</p>

              <p>Man.. i kinda opened one . Its NO' Ma'aM . A open minded view to both genders.. but.. participation is almost non-existence with a few proper replies.  At least it didnt have as much BS as related threads here.  he he</p>
              <p>First of all , everyone must contribute thier opinions first , then we can work out from there how many different opinions are there and whether there are any similiarities , positive or negatve , slowly work it from there. Cause there is no one way. But many ways with different branches from different categories. lol.. damn.. i think i too like to categorise things.. hahaha... categories work , HR , women, CD's ,  lol..</p>
