For example if your hp battery is originally 5 bars at full. If you charge it to 4 bars then stop charging, next time the battery will at most reach the 4 bars capacity even if the screen shows 5 bars.</div>

There is two major effects the user will observed.<br><strong>1. Memory effect</strong><br>Occurs when user charge a partial discharged batt. lets say the user decide to charge the batt with 70% remaining power to 100%. The top 30 % will be fresh and discharge as per normal when used. As it reaches 70%, the user will experience a sudden drop of power( less current output). The chemical in the batt for the 70% portion will be reluctunt to give up their stored energy.<br><br><strong>2.Lazy effect</strong><br>Occurs when user do a partial charge on the batt. The uncharged portion will develope a resistence to store the energy. Keeping a batt in a partial discharge state will also leed to Lazy effect.<br><br>side info:<br>for a NiMH batt...<br>Peak voltage is 1.55V (100%)<br>norminal voltage is 1.2V<br>minimum voltage allowable 1V (0%)<br><br>There are also charger that provide refreshing function to keep your batts healthy...<br><br>Cheers</div>

Seriously though, I'm just stating what I know and I cannot claim to be always right.<br><br>Anyhow, on top of my head, battery life is directly related to how deep the battery is cycled each time. For example, if you deplete the battery by 50% before recharging, as opposed to a 100% discharged, u will get roughly 2X as much life cycles (not that simple in reality).  Hence you can see why it is not a good idea to deplete a battery intentionally, as you'll be losing life cycles.<br><br>Obviously the best way to avoid this is to actually use the battery until it's near depleted. As for your cell phone question, they don't use batteries with memory effect nowadays, that's why you do not need to care about it.</div>
