IDE is just the term on the interface with the mainboard and should not be taken as comparision with FDB motors. you should compare IDE (the interface) with SATA (serial ATA), ultra 320 or Fibre channel. the 3 menntioned has transfer rate (rate at which data is channel to and from the HDD) which can be compared and weighted for pros and cons.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>more info. prescott is set to replace the aging northwood line. it is coded as 'E'. all the 'C's, 'A's are northwood. people complained prescott isn't up to mark. it runs hotter(bad for overclock), and doesn't have much performance boost over northwood 'C'. fyi, most techies prefers northwood over prescott. that is, just get 'C'.<br><br>for ram, pc2100 = 266mhz, pc2700 = 333mhz, pc3200 = 400mhz. most newer systems support 400mhz, so get that. if your board uses dual channel ram, get twin pack(2 sticks of 256mb), the rams have to be identical in order to work. fyi, dual channel helps boost performance greatly.<br><br>also, at least get a 9600pro($200). i recommend chaintech 5900xt($300). better still, sapphire 9800pro($400).<br><br>like the rest, if gaming is what you has in mind, AMD is the only choice.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
