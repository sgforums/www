            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, I'm an eurasian with Singapore citizenship...<br><br>Hence, I started off like you - not knowing what's there to do etc.<br><br>Do what the locals do...<br><br>1) Shop till your drop... well, it depends on what you wish to buy, there's always the best place to get it... for example, sports stuff ==&gt; you would expect things to be less pricey at Queensway etc.<br><br>Orchard would be quite general I would say...<br><br>2) Eat... try all kinds of local food... I was dared to try 'Sambal udang' (a malay dish) many years back and I cried eating it... man, it's fiery hot.<br><br>3) Observe the people around you... I spotted the first she-male in 'Orchard towers' and she's really gorgeous until she opened that mouth of hers... Then only, I realised that harsh truth.<br><br>4) The others...<br><br>Movies, Bowling, Skating, Clubbing, Singing, Sports - Volleyball games at Sunset Bay(Sentosa), Swimming, Online Gaming, Chatting(MSN), Reading (I'd love Borders for that), Soccer (Watching/playing/betting on it)<br><br>As for place of interests... they are expensive. I would suggest not visiting the zoo... Sentosa is fine, but cost wise, it's high.. Hence, you shall decide...<br><br>As for downtown east, that would be themeparks - Escape and Wild Wild Wet... again, cost price...<br><br>Anyway, enjoy your stay here... have fun!<br><br></div>
