            <div class='col-md body'>Well, for me, I dun have that kind of problem in relationship cos my bf very good to me. Hmmm...but when it comes to exams, sometimes I do get that kind of feeling. Like for example, I put in alot of time and effort to study a particular subject, end up I dun get the results which I deem fit for my effort put it...feels really fustrating cos those subjects which I never put in effort actually get unexpectedly good results...so sometimes me do wonder...might as well dun put in so much effort lor.<br>I guess alot of people go through what you went through too. Alot of times we feel that for the effort put in, why am I getting less than those who put in less effort? But life's like that. For example, those smart ass can study for a few hrs and get straight A while some need to study like mad to pass. Some just need to use their eyes to 'send electric waves' to guys and make them fall head over heels for them while some need to do all sorts of things to please a guy just to get him to notice her. We see these examples everywhere. You're not the only one who is feeling this way.<br>Sometimes it can also be due to our expectation too high? We expect to reap what we sow...but are you expecting too much? Especially in terms of relationships...it doesn't mean that you put in alot of effort and feelings, the other party to do the same for you or do what your friends' bf do for them. Sometimes, we just need to be contended and thankful for what we have. We put in our best effort for everything, and whatever result we get, we dun have to feel too upset cos at least we can say to ourselves that at least we tried our best.<br>All the best. Stay happy. Dun give up trying.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

When I was back in Poly, out of a group of 3 I was the one doing &gt; 90% of the project... The other 2 just couldn't be bother and heck care attitude man... Despite my gentle reminder, one of them even use sarcastic words to say I'm stupid to be in a team with them and such... He even URGED the other partner not to be involved in the works, sit back and just wait for me to complete the job.... Of course I was PISSED then lah... Then when it was near to the end of the project for hand up and presentation, I just can't take it anymore and told the lecturer I want break up from the team... When the lecturer finally agreed after hearing us out, the other 2 who DUNO WHAT WAS GOING ON demanded that I hand over to them what I had done and explain all things to them.... What I had then PROVED to the lecturer was that IF they really did their work like they'd said, HOW can they not know a single thing? Anyway, the project was CRUCIAL for the subject... The lecturer talked to me to hand over those things and just forget about the issue....<br>After rushing through the project for endless nights I was already dead tired to improve and modify my then 'completed work'.... The other 2 guys then took over my work and IMPROVED it... Have PLENTY of ENERGY to plan their presentation and BINGO! They OVERSCORED me with a HIGHER GRADE because (1)Modified and improved project (2)More energy to plan their presentation (3)Better 'teamwork'... &lt;- I should say 'GREAT teamwork' lah.... The more ASS one even came to me to 'show off', saying that this is the DIFFERENCE between people who does their work and people who don't (referring to me lah...).... I was quite pissed when it all 1st happened lah... But luckily for me, MOST of my course mates knew what happened... So by the end of the project when he was saying things like that, I wasn't really angry and more like heck care liao... And only ONE THING occured to my mind.... 'That is the DIFFERENCE between ASSHOLES and normal people....'  :p<br></div>
