              <p>Alright i`m gonna ord in like 2 months and i havent applied into any uni courses yet . The problem is i dont know which subjects i like to study . I was quite a slacker during my schooling days thus resulting in a crappy 1.9 poly GPA.</p>
              <p>So the only uni i could go is either private ones in singapore or overseas . But for overseas i have to take their foundation course. which is an extra 1or 2 years. Which is a waste of time . I`ve considered taking a business degree cause it`s the degree which takes the shortest amount of time to get. But my dad has an engineering company and i was thinking if i were to take over from him then i`ll have to have an engineering degree. But engineering degree takes 4 years . And that`s way too long for me .</p>
              <p>Cause i`m not young any more in another 4 years i`ll be 27. 27 and just a fresh grad ? How slow is that .</p>
              <p>So any helpful advice from you guys would be really appreciated .</p>
              <p>Thanks</p>

              <p>erm hello, it is not about how long it takes, it is about what you wanna do in the future right? Like what industry you are interested in. Dont study for the sake of studying same goes to getting a degree. If not i think it is a waste of time and money sia.</p>
              <p>A degree is not just a degree, it is what kind of degree. Why people always want to take degree but duno what they want to do in life.</p>
              <p>During the NS time should have planned liao and think about it.... What u studied in poly? Sure have sth u like right.   </p>

              <p>to TS: maybe u wanna try working at your dad's company for awhile and see how engineering is like before you decide sth. I feel that working in different sectors/industry as a trainee or sth help, as in to open up your eyes, get exposed to diff industries and make you to have a feel of what it's like in every sector. That way you can decide what you really like and want in life. It's never too late to earn a degree. Some people are just late bloomers.      </p>

              <p>Oh my god. The problem with you is not the GPA. It's your attitude. Everyone makes mistakes in their lives. I shitted up my poly grades as well and ended up barely passing. (I did pass though). If you want to take the opportunity to get into a Uni to right your wrong mistakes, I can empathize and even cheer you on. But what the hell, you don't even know what you want to study?!</p>
              <p>Are you telling me that you're going to waste 25K doing something you're not sure about just so you can do it 'in the shortest possible amount of time'? Here I am, struggling to find a job to make money to support my future Uni studies because I'm a poor fuck and there you are, so easily deliberating the course you're going to take in Uni by asking strangers to make a decision for you, without so much as putting in ANY DISCERNIBLE EFFORT WHATSOEVER to research on the courses or even have a goal for yourself.</p>
              <p>I don't wish to judge you here, but I really am quite pissed off at people like you. My emotions tell me that you do not deserve a university education because you take things like these for granted. Is there no worth in the university education to you? What the hell are you living for? What are you even going to study for? To fail and get 1.9 GPA points again? People are struggling everyday to find things to live for, to suffer for their future... and here you are like a pampered rich man's son who has money at his disposal. You're making a huge mockery of University education as well as the efforts of true, genuine learners who want to pursue higher education.</p>
              <p>How utterly disgusting.</p>
              <p>Please, just donate that money to someone who can better appreciate it and go think about what you want to do with your life.</p>

                  a chill pill. TS is 23, people still don't know what they want to
                  do with their life at 40. If you ask university students right now
                  what they want to be when they grow up (a three year old would
                  answer that in 5 sec), i can guarantee you that 80% of them will
                  say they have no clue. Merely asking for advice is what everybody
                  does. Its just that most people ask their friends or family, not a
                  public forum. And <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a style="text-decoration: none; color: #5d5ebc;" rel="nofollow" href="http://armedforces.sgforums.com/users/265983">ã�ªã�„ã‚�ã‚‰ã�„</a>,</span> you're totally not judging, you're stereotyping TS with your idea
                  of an ungrateful rich child. Oh wait, that is judging.</span></p>

              <p>That's a really weak excuse to use. The point of my rant was to express my shock and disgust at this person who is about to make one of the most important decisions in his life using such a haphazard, mindless manner. He might as eenie meenie minie mo his choices and flip a coin for the last two, eh?</p>
              <p>What kind of a stupid question is "What should I study in Uni"? The one who knows best is the one who is supposed to study, and that question should be posed to the person himself, not an online forum. At this stage of his life, the very least he should have done is to assess his current situation and his future needs- this means taking into account his strengths, likes, passion and narrow down a list of future careers, but he's here treating a degree like as if it's some piece of useless paper, wanting to make a choice based on how much time it takes. That's probably the most ridiculous way to make a choice, if you ask me. Besides, most standard degree courses are 3-4 years, and if he's looking at a private U, it's going to be a part-time degree, unless he's enrolling in unisim. So time doesn't really matter that much.</p>
              <p>What matters most is how much it's going to benefit him in the future. What happens if he suddenly is unable to cope with the degree course halfway? Private Unis don't allow course transfers because the syllabi are different for each course. What happens next? Quit the course and find a new one? Or grit his teeth and emerge out of it with another 1.9 GPA?</p>
              <p>How to think of contingency plans when real plans haven't even been made yet? Which is why I told him to think deeply about the matter first. People can only help with course information. The question of the choice should never be posed to the public, but himself.</p>

              <p>hey guess what? i stopped reading again after <span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 17px; color: #333333; font-weight: bold;"><a style="text-decoration: none; color: #5d5ebc;" href="http://armedforces.sgforums.com/users/265983">ã�ªã�„ã‚�ã‚‰ã�„</a>; </span><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 17px; color: #333333;">because every single post in this forum, you get so emotionally involved that the stuff you write is just boring. Do you honestly think that your way of thinking should be everybody else's? That your opinion is always right and anything everybody says is wrong? Have you even been to university? And if you have, you obviously never really had friends during that period. Whoops, i guess i just made this personal.</span></p>
              <p>TS prob wrote in this forum in the first place because he wanted to tell everybody that he's becoming ord, secondly to say that he has the opportunity to go to university, and lastly that his dad owns a company. </p>
              <p>and you prob wrote in this forum, for the need to sound smart and feel superior to others.</p>
              <p>Hmm i guess i think my way of thinking is right and yours is wrong. And i guess that i am sort of getting emotionally involved in this post. Guess i must be an idiot and a loser as well then.</p>
              <p>ps. im prob not going to read your retort, but to make yourself feel better, please write back. I'm sure this forum needs to see you reply to my personal attack. (hope i didnt damage your ego too much)</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I don't think you should worry so much about being a 'fresh grad' at 27 if you were to take a 4 year degree course since you're a Singaporean male who went through poly. I'd agree with some of the people here who've posted that you should actually sit down and consider what industry would interest you before deciding on your course (eg tourism &amp; hospitality, mass comm, business admin, banking &amp; finance, etc), not the shortest way to get a degree. The attitude isn't right. What would your future employer think, if they were to find out that you took some chapalang degree course which only lasted a year? Your cert may not even be duefully considered.. That would be a waste of money wouldn't it?</p></div>
