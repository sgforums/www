So add up the time waiting and extra lessons incurred, my fren who take 4 times to pass in the end bill add up only 100 dollars cheaper than the Centre but at the expense of a longer time.<br><br>Verdict: take private instructor better first time pass else very leh cheh longer time to get the license.[/b]</blockquote>Ya i agree wif u. If u enrol wif a pte instructor, there is possibility u will fail for the 1st time and waste more money on revision lessons,  but wat if u fail for the first time when u enrol in sch??? Wun u spend even more??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Wun u spend even more??? </strong><br><br>There is a sort of "unwritten rule" that most Centre will make you pass within 1 - 5 attempts provided you are not really tat bad a driver? Furthermore, if too many failures will reflect on the image of the whole school not just the solo private instructor alone.<br><br>Another bonus is retake practical test is much faster. Like if fail, maybe 1 - 2 weeks can take the next one?<br><br>I dunno fail private retake practical muz wait how long now but for my era, the waiting time is quite long cuz i think priority placings are given to centre students? Afterall, private students take test muz take the centre inside circuit then can go to outside main road.</div>
