            <div class='col-md body'>The BioPhotonic Scanner is a device that tells a person the level of their body defense score by scanning for the antioxidants in their body. Please allow me a few minutes to explain the relationship between antioxidants, free radicals and the BioPhotonic Scanner.<br><br>Our body are constantly being bombarded by free radicals everyday. Free radicals are toxins that cause cells and DNA damage. Free Radicals are introduced to our bodies in any of the following ways:<br>- breathing (Air Pollution),<br>- stay in the sun (Ultra Violet Ray damange),<br>- smoking (chemicals in cigarettes)<br>- receive second hand smoke (when we are near smokers)<br>- Stress<br>- Food (unhealthy and unbalanced diet, food that are not cleaned properly and still contains pesticides) ........... Just to name a few.<br><br>However, our body has a wonderful way to remain healthy. Our body naturally produces antioxidants to combat these free radicals that are damaging our cells and DNA every day. Antioxidants are produced in our body when we eat a balanced diet and lots of fruits and vegetables. Unfortunately, many people today are not eating a balanced diet and do not eat enough fruits and vegetables.<br><br>Dr Richard Cutler of the National Institute of Aging, Washington DC, said that "The amount of antioxidants in your body is directly proportional to how long you will live." It is therefore important for everyone to know their antioxidants level in their body.<br><br>Our machine uses the Raman Ray technology to detect the antioxidant level in the body. The Raman Ray was discovered by Sir C V Raman. He was awarded the Nobel Physics Prize for the discovery of the Raman Spectroscopy. Through a painless and non-invasive 3 minute process, our machines can detect the amount of antioxidants in a person's body. There is NO NEED to draw blood or collect urine samples. It is a very simple 3 minute process with our machine.<br><br>Dr Lester Packer, the world famous "Father of Antioxidants" said in CNN that "Everyone should use the BioPhotonic Scanner to learn their optimal Body Defense Score. Once you have your number, work to increase it and maintain it with a diet rich in fruits, vegetables and vitamin supplements." Our scanner has also received media coverage from CNBC, Fox News, ABC News, Bloomberg television, NBC News, CBS News etc.<br><br>We now holds the Worldwide Patent Rights of the BioPhotonic Scanner for 18 years starting from 2001. In these 18 years, no one can manufacture the scanner except us.<br><br>William Pryor, the Director of the BioDynamics Institute of the Louisiana State University wrote in an article published in the 1992 "Time" magazine<br>that:<br>"Antioxidants may one day revolutionize health care......."<br>"... Foresees screening people through a simple test to assess how much damage free radicals have done to tissue, much as patients today are screened for high cholesterol." His predictions have now come true with our BioPhotonic Scanner!!!<br></div>

It could be your body that cannot take such good supplement. Let me give you example, you have been eating bland food and suddenly you eat bird nest and good stuff. of course your body cannot take it because such food are too strong and. But it take time to get your body adjust to these supplement. Other example you have been eating bird nest and shark's fin everyday and suddenly ask you to eat bland food how will you feel.<br><br></div>
