              <p>I would run around inside my house instinctively. Prior to any symptoms of fatigue i'd immediately(instinctively again) stop, drop and roll to my refridgerator and grab some of my favourite cold(plain, 0 nutritional value) water. Then i'd roll to my Floor Fan and just lay there staring at the stars. After a few hours i'd realize that my Ceiling's gone, and ask myself what i did wrong for the Government to have done this to me. I'd go on and on thinking that the Government has some grudge against me, but i'd gradually realize that it was just a ceiling wallpaper i made myself out of my Skills in Digital Art. Then i'd go on and on about my stupidity, only to realize that my feelings have blinded me, creating an illusional barrier between me and reality, and by then i'd have digressed far enough to have forgotten about whatever important event was to happen the following day.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'd Remember what was to happen after i wake up the next day though, since my Programs do not easily delete off data of Events with High Priority.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>//Just to Sum Up:</p>
              <p>I'd Roll on the floor and allow my processing speed to lead my mind astray far enough for me to temporarily forget any important events to follow.</p>

              <p>That's normal for me. I got over it by preparing earlier than scheduled, and then the rest of the time before implementation begins i just rest. Or play Hard enough to wake up my mind enough to consider myself in a state of what i call Overdrive where my mind works at its optimum point, to fully experience the event that holds such high priority.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Most Recent case, though, was just last friday. I was asked out by my Girlfriend to watch Haunted Changi. I wasn't really interested in Local Horror, More so after reading some 'reviews' on facebook. Meeting time was supposed to be approximately 16 00, movie screened at 16 20. It was right around 13 00 then, so i decided to rest up for approx. 1 hour. Bad idea. Overslept. Postponed the date to Tomorrow instead.</p>

              <p><br>Unless you are inhuman or dumb, everyone will sure to have some feeling of it, that is part of life, and the older you get, the more relax you become, that is why big leaders alway goes to old peoples who can handle to tension better than us.</p>
              <p>But this is natural, take it as part of life, so instead of worrying over it, get excited and enjoy it.</p>
