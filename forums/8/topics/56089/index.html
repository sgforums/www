Wonder if any of them are in Aunt Agony? Or if any of you are one in the making.<br><br>SEPT 1, 2003<br>Straight Talk<br>When Mr Macho hits a Snag<br>Men seem to have a harder time getting over a break-up than women. And these are confident guys who enjoy meeting women. The Snag phenomenon is partly to blame<br><br>By Nicholas Fang<br>TRANSPORT REPORTER<br><br>STRAIGHT TALK<br><br>A RECENT spate of break-ups has left me surrounded by friends and colleagues who are suddenly single after having been in relationships lasting up to three years.<br><br>After the tears had dried and the initial shock of being thrust back into single-dom had passed, it surprised me to see that, contrary to traditional stereotypes, in most cases it was the guys who had the most trouble getting over the break-up.<br><br>I got to spend tea-breaks, lunches, dinners and drinking sessions with my gloomy mates, listening to them bemoan the loss of their 'one true love'.<br><br>And they clung to their exes, sometimes in truly embarrassing fashion, calling them constantly and wanting to hang out with them on the pretext of 'still being friends'.<br><br>At the same time, I noticed their ex-girlfriends had no trouble getting back into the swing of a bustling social life, 'making up for lost time', as one told me during a recent pub crawl which lasted till 4 am.<br><br>To be fair, it had been almost half a year since she broke up with her ex and it was her idea to end the relationship.<br><br>But a casual poll of female acquaintances who had broken up recently confirmed that about 90 per cent of them were back out socialising with friends, if not actually dating, within a month of breaking up.<br><br>Make no mistake, though. While not all of my male friends are the proverbial Casanovas, they are all outgoing, sociable, and confident individuals who enjoy meeting women and engaging in relationships which sometimes are fleeting at best.<br><br>So what is responsible for reducing them to the emotional, blubbering state that some of them are still in today, more than six months after breaking up?<br><br>After all, aren't male homo sapiens supposed to be biologically inclined towards spreading their genetic material among many partners while the female of the species prefers a monogamous relationship?<br><br>A colleague who broke up with his girlfriend recently after close to two years placed the blame squarely on women and their desire for that phenomenon which emerged over the past two decades - the Snag.<br><br>'Women want the sensitive, new age guy who's in touch with his emotions, his feminine side, and is comfortable showing his vulnerability,' he said.<br><br>'So we try to be all these things and what do we end up with? Men who are so emotionally fragile that they can be brought to their knees by the ending of a relationship.'<br><br>Much has been written in previous Straight Talk columns on the perceived emasculation, figurative of course, of the Singaporean male.<br><br>It's become passe to be a tough guy. Machismo went with the 1980s, and hiding one's emotions behind a gruff exterior has gone out of fashion.<br><br>We like shopping and fruity cocktails and we're not ashamed to admit it. And now, we mope and sulk for months on end after a relationship ends.<br><br>I'm all for being a more balanced individual and getting more in touch with all aspects of one's personality and character.<br><br>But there is something definitely unattractive about someone who can't let go and who clings to a relationship that has reached its use-by date, as a number of female friends have informed me.<br><br>'Women find clingy guys just as annoying as men find women who can't accept that a relationship is over,' a friend in her late 20s told me recently.<br><br>But she admitted that it was traditionally the women who have had a harder time letting go than the men.<br><br>So women's desires for men who are in touch with their emotions and their sensitive side may have backfired with the creation of clingy guys who won't let go of them when relationships end.<br><br>But I don't think that all the blame can be laid on the ubiquitous Snag.<br><br>Another likely contributing factor is the clear distinction that most guys draw between casual relationships and what we feel is likely to be the one that leads to a more permanent commitment.<br><br>It seems to occur to most men as we approach our 30th birthday that we should perhaps be thinking less about hanging out at the hippest night spots in town and more about whom we would like to settle down with.<br><br>But because there is such a stark contrast in the amount of emotional investment we make in the two different situations, we often fall much harder when we've decided that someone is 'the one'.<br><br>Women, on the other hand, generally seem to have a relatively more balanced approach to relationships and how much of their emotions they commit.<br><br>This, combined with how they are more independent and hence less likely to be waiting at home and pining for the guy that got away, makes for a worrying picture for us men.<br><br>But maybe it's time that we accepted this reality and the fact that men don't have the upper hand anymore in relationships and that we are just as vulnerable to being hurt when things don't work out.<br><br>And if we can accept that, then maybe we can see a return of the emotionally resilient and strong Singapore male.<br><br>After all, the sooner we bounce back, the sooner we're back in the game. And if nothing else, it will make hanging out with my mates much more bearable.<br><br>Send your comments to stlife@sph.com.sg<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Copyright @ 2003 Singapore Press Holdings.
