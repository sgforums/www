            <div class='col-md body'>Let's just say you are a gal and there are two guys that u have ABSOLUTELY the same impressions of. This means that u like both the same amount, and i guess we can imply that it is in a romantic sence.<br><br>They both live exactly 15 mins drive away from your house, so for simplicity's sake, let's just say they live in the same block of flats.<br><br>Now, one of these guys own a car and is able to deliver u supper one night when u complained that u are hungree. Mind you, this is at 3am in the morning. Further, you also did complain to the other guy who happens not to drive a vehicle. Hence if he were to deliver supper for you at that time he would have to take a cab to a 24hr kopitiam, buy the food, take another cab to deliver the food to u, maybe watch u eat, and leave, hence taking YET another cab home. Obviously the guy with the car would be able to do all of the above as well.<br><br>1. Now if the guy with the car does deliver the food, but not the guy that drives, becos of the inconvenience and becos it's impractical, does that deem the former guy a "sweeter" guy? would u think that he is a nicer and more considerate guy becos he delivered supper while the other guy had not?<br><br>2. Wat if both guys delivered the supper to you? Obviously the guy without the car would have gone thru greater trouble and money to get supper for you. So who would be the "sweeter" guy now?<br><br>Don't ask too much details and answer off-topic, just take the scenarios at face value becos i'm just bo liow and wanna know wat u all think.<br><br>For guys, i guess u could either reverse the roles and replace the 2 guys above with gals, or else you could comment on the scenarios as is.<br><br>thanx pple!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>tough</strong> to reverse the roles for a guy coz i think it sounded pretty unreasonable to have my girlfriend buying me food, just because i am hungry and lazy, not to mention at such hour! so let's just stick to your scenario.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>without much considerations, i find it obvious that the sweeter guy is the one without personal transport, due to the fact that he went thru more trouble, just to satisfy the needs of his girlfriend.<br><br>i think to measure the leve of <span style="font-style: italic;">sweetness</span>, the sincerity should be the concerning factor instead.<br><br>it is how the guy reacts to such request, with or without personal transport. he can buy you supper at 3am and throw the wan tan mee on your face as soon as he arrives. for that, you wouldnt call that sweet, would you? (though i would have done the same if i were ask to wake up after 6 hrs of OT just to buy supper)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>okok sweetness or sincerity.. same shit different day lar ahahaha..<br><br>maybe RAW touched on a point that is one of the easier ways to "rate" the guys.... for scenario 1 it is wat is seen, being more powerful than wat is felt or heard.<br><br>however for scenario 2, it is obvious at first that the guy w/o transport is more sincere/sweet becos he put in more effort (yet again, we see "more" action).<br><br>so how fair is this to the guy with transport then? is he to leave his car behind and take a cab etc etc just like the other guy to prove that he's equally sincere?</div>
