            <div class='col-md body'>Four guys were sitting on a table in a community centre hall, doing nothing.<br><br>The first person was Adam. Adam was a stressful person ever since he can remember. He was a shy person who feels uncomfortable hanging out with people because everyone is always chit chatting happily among themselves and he do not know how to be the same like them. Sometimes, there are certain things that he does not like to do but when people ask him to join them, he wants to reject them but always fail. He is frustrated that he cannot get what he wants in life.<br><br>This morning, feeling normal, he went to the community centre and saw a table with chairs. He sat at one of the chairs and just idles.<br><br>The second person is tom. Tom is a very calm person. He is an average person in his life. He got a university degree in architecture and has worked as an employee for the past ten years. He has got a girlfriend at age 25 after his friend introduced a girl to him. His girlfriend was not very pretty but tom thought that he could not afford to be picky already. He has always failed to get a girlfriend.<br><br>He is a very calm person and he achieves it by studying Buddhism regularly. He is not very smart and sociable so his life is quite plain although it is peaceful.<br><br>The third person is ken. ken is a very smart and powerful person. He is single, has lots of girlfriend before and lead a very exciting an interesting sex life with all his girlfriends. He is adventurous as he has tried all sorts of thrill rides and sports. He is also very sociable as he enjoys connecting with people. He has always be everyoneÂ’s favorite friend because he knows how to humor people and is very absorbing speaker.<br><br>We can now see the three guys sitting beside one another on the table. They are all feeling normal and peaceful now because it is a very quiet place they are in. Adam past life was terrible, Tom was okay and Ken had the best life anyone could have dream of. However, all is but past events.<br><br>Suddenly, as they were idling, they could feel the ground trembling and it quickly developed into a strong shaking. As the tried to run away from the building, the roof structure broke loose and collapsed. All of them died instantly.<br><br>Few hours later, the earth quake stops and medical personnel were deployed to every affected area in the country. At this community centre, they found three bodies which belong to Adam, Tom and Ken.<br><br>One month later after the incident, the nation returned to its normal state of economy and people are returning back to the normal way of life. An enigneer, uncle soh, was finishing is work and so he drove to Geylang street 21. he parked his car at the roadside and got out. After deliberating over the various choices, he went to house 25. He saw a young girl at her twenties and chose her. They went to a room upstair and have sex.<br><br>It is 2 oÂ’clock in the morning. The wind blew lightly in the cemetery at Kallang field. There were about one hundred tombs at the place. One the top right side, TomÂ’s tomb lay quietly with rustling leaves sweeping across the stones. Ken and AdamÂ’s tomb lay at the bottom section of the cemetery. At this time, Uncle Soh was licking the girlÂ’s breasts and his cock hardened.<br><br>The fourth guy sitting beside the three person in the community centre was Uncle soh. He managed to escaped during the earthquake that day. Ten years later, he developed a pill that prevents the ageing of cells. He kept the discovery secret and used it on himself.<br><br>Four hundred years later at one morning, uncle soh woke up in his apartment and sat on his table idling, just like the time at the community centre long ago. His heart was peaceful and the air was fresh from the morning dew. He has a great life, like Tom, but above that, he had a long life.<br></div>
