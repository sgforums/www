            <div class='col-md body'>rinoa, no... you r not 3rd party.  3rd-party status only for those directly involved.<br><br>3rd-party involvemt is not highly recommended b'cos it can get pretty ugly and there might be bloodshed.  3rd parties are also rarely pardoned.  eg. recent gigi leung &amp; ekin cheng.<br><br>actually, there was this girl I really like b'cos she's quite a good-natured girl.  then I discovered that she has a boyfren, and he's terribly possessive, which led to infrequent quarrelling.  I went thru a period of depression but @ the end, I decided that if she's not happy with her relationship, she must be firm enough to end the relationship and not b'cos of me or anyone else.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hobbes, u took the words right from my mouth.  If the girl breaks off with the bf, then it is between them. It has nothing to do with u. Remember, if u are not a third party, then u will have more wonderful memories, and not think back and feel guilty. I don't know but I always believed in retribution.<br>Rinoa, do u think u broke off the relationship? Maybe u just showed the guy that he could be more happy. But if u really made the effort to go in and instigate a break up, making him fall for u, then u are guilty as charged. But if u did nothing but just be a friend, u don't have anything to be bothered abt!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm.. I had always fall for girls who are attached.. just plain coincidence I supposed. It is a really painful experience trying to go after such girls. Remember, it take double the effort in going after an attached girl than a single girl.<br><br>It is absolutely not advisable to be the 3rd party, unless you can convince yourself that you can provide more happiness to the girl and you truly love her.<br><br>Love is blind.. follow what your heart feel.</div>
