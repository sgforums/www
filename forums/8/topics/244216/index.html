Even though many Buddhist monks can levitate (even one of my friend -- a forummer in sgforums -- experienced this phenomena from meditative experience and concluded levitation is truly possible), they cannot do that in public because under Vinaya vows given by Buddha, monks are not allowed to show supernatural powers for publicity stunts.<br><br>Hindus and other religions still can show because they don't have rules forbidding their display.. and furthermore Buddhist teachings always downplay the significance of such powers.<br><br>Here is an example of a documented case of a real yogi levitating -- quite well known, <a href="http://www.amazingabilities.com/amaze8a.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazingabilities.com/amaze8a.html</a></div>

It is a very common practice.. perhaps you have not seen enough Buddhists or monks. Reciting a mantra or a Buddha can also help in stabilising the mind and to cultivate <span style="font-style: italic;">samadhi</span>, or a state of one pointedness.. so that the mind does not waver so much.<br><br>Second thing is Buddhist meditation isn't meant for entering a state of trance. Of course if he close his eyes he won't know what's happening around lah... but my point is Trance is not the goal of Buddhist meditation.<br><br>I wrote this in: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=239181" rel="nofollow">Questions About buddhism</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">In Buddhist meditation, there is a state of complete alertness and clarity, which is why Buddhist meditation is <strong>not</strong> about going into a state of trance. It is not about blanking out. The nature of the Mind (not to be mistaken as our ordinary, sentient mind that causes the cycles of samsara, but rather Mind refers to our Buddha Mind or Buddha Nature), or so called our true self which is no self, contains the lucid/luminous aspect. The other aspect is the Emptiness aspect, which we might talk about that next time. Ultimately, through meditation and practise one will realise and experience/get in touch with one's primordial state of pure awareness, or one's Buddha Nature, which is like a clear bright mirror reflecting everything we experience in the world. This is just an analogy (and not a very good one since ultimately even the mirror is not a separate entity from its reflection, but rather it is a form of moment-to-moment 'participatory' awareness). It is also an all pervading presence of 'yourself' connected with the universe, so in this state of pure awareness there is actually no seperation between you and me or the universe, and everything is just spontaneous arising of this pure awareness, and we and all Buddhas are all one in a sense. The 'self' is merely an illusion, based on identification with the 5 skhandas, which is why the Buddha taught about no self. If we were to investigate, we will not find 'self' in the 5 skhandas (five aggregates), or our sensory experiences, or even in our thoughts, and therefore it would be meaningless to grasp on this fictitious idea, which is the root of all ignorance, afflictive emotions and sufferings. Through meditation one can also transcend this attachment through insights and awakening.<br><br>Reality has always been so (non dual) but due to the layer of illusion of separation, like the layer of dust covering the clear bright mirror and preventing us from seeing what's the reality of it all. Which is what the Buddha taught about 'purifying the mind' is all about -- clearing the dust, or attachment to dualistic, afflictive emotions (such as greed, hatred, jealousy, envy, etc) and ignorance, to reveal the reality underneath it. And this is what is special about Buddhism, as all 7 Buddhas Gatha says that the 7 Buddhas taught Buddhism as 'Avoiding all evil, Doing all that's good, and <strong>Purifying the Mind.</strong>' The third one, purifying the mind, sets Buddhism different from the other religions. At the time of death, if one can recognise the primordial clear light as one's true, original nature, one's 7th consciousness dissolves into this clear light and becomes liberated or enter into nirvana. Otherwise our Karma, along with the 7th Consciousness (consciousness of a seperate 'self' based on ignorance) will pull us back to undergo the endless cycles of rebirth in the world of suffering -- Samsara. Therefore to summarise, Buddhist meditation and practise has nothing to do with attaining any states of trance, but rather, it is a process of Awakening and Awareness.</span><br><br><a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=244351" rel="nofollow">My sincere apology if any offence taken</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">To add.. not only attachment to afflictive emotions but also to incessant thinking, and dualistic notions and ideas of things due to ignorance (i.e not knowing the true nature/reality of all phenomena as emptiness) and illusions... which is also form of grasping, attachment. For example we grasp at appearances thinking that they truly exist even though all phenomena are empty of inherent existence.. as they are co-dependent arising and arise out of causes and conditions.. and are ever impermanent. Because of these illusions.. we suffer.. and cannot be liberated. We can start to purify our minds by practising mindful awareness... with mindfulness we will become more aware of the reality of ourselves, our thoughts and behaviors, and the reality of our thoughts and experiences (i.e emptiness, impermanence, the 3 dharma seals/4 seals, etc)... and with mindfulness we will also not become caught up and lost in appearances and thoughts, and eventually through practise and insights these thoughts and illusions will be self liberated as they arise and there will be an immediate awareness the moment they arise, and we will not become attracted and become lost in them, we will not be deceived by our minds, illusions of self and permanency, into attachment, seeking, or aversion.</span></div>
