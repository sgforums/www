            <div class='col-md body'>December 22 1999.<br><br>I AM a 60-year-old taxi driver. In the moringing of March 15 this year I picked up a handicapped passenger and dropped him off at Upper Paya Lebar Road. I realised that I was close to a bus stop, and therefore in a bus-lane during peak hours which is an offence.<br><br>As the passenger was physically handicapped and had to walk with the aid of metallic-frame crutches, I felt that he should not have to walk further than he needed to. I decided to drop him off in a spot as convenient to him as possible. After I dropped him off, I continued driving. As the traffic was heavy then, it took me a while before I could filter out of the bus-lane.<br><br>A few weeks later, I received a fine from the traffic police for $130. I wrote a letter of appeal to the authorities and explained to them the circumstances that led to my being in the bus-lane during peak hours. But it was to no avail. I then turned to my PAP MP, Mr Teo Ho Pin, who told me that he could not do much and just simply sent my letter of appeal to the Traffic Police again.<br><br>As I need every cent of my income - $130 is about two-and-a-half days of income for me - I contested the fine to see if the courts could be more understanding. But the judge not only ruled that I was guilty and increased my fine to $1000, and also suspended me from driving for four months. Lawyers tell me that there is no use appealing as the process would take longer than the four months of my driving suspension and I would also incur more expenses in legal fees.<br><br>I don't know what to do now as I cannot afford not to drive my taxi for four months! What am I going to do for income? I still have a son who is doing his National Service and a daughter in the university to support. I am being punished harshly for my act of concern for someone else.<br><br>I want some justice to be done in my case. I also want to let others know how heartless the Singapore Government can be. I have approached many people for help but each time I have met with a blank wall. Only the Singapore Democratic Party has tried to help me<br><br>Lee Kea Huat</div>
