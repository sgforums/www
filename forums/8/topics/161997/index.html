            <div class='col-md body'>Non-Malay won't get into lift with Malay. How civil are we if we can't be civil to fellow Singaporeans?<br><br>The Straits Times<br>November 8, 2005<br><br>I have been teaching in an international school in a Third World country for almost two years now. Recently I was back in Singapore to celebrate Hari Raya Aidilfitri with my family and friends.<br><br>What I experienced on the morning of Hari Raya makes me question how civilized are we if we can't be civil to fellow Singaporeans.<br><br>On Nov 3 at Block 723, Tampines Street 72, I was waiting for the lift to send some cakes I had bought overseas for my fiance's family. A non-Malay man was also waiting for the lift but when the lift came, he refused to take it.<br><br>Inside the lift, I kept the door open when I heard someone rushing to catch it. As soon as she stepped into the lift, her body had an 'automatic repel' action, or should I call it 'allergic reaction' to seeing a Malay girl in baju kurung inside.<br><br>It caused her to bounce back outside. She shook her head vigorously indicating a change of mind to stand in the same lift with me. As I shut the lift door, I saw a smirk on the man's face as he sniggered and nodded in agreement with the woman.<br><br>I have been keeping myself updated with the news in Singapore. I am well aware of the convicted racist bloggers but personally I think enforcing the laws to combat racism is not enough.<br><br>I have mingled with friends from other races, religions and cultures since I was young. Right from pre-school to university, these friends had walked with me through obstacles and we understood one another despite our differences.<br><br>In a multiracial country like Singapore, it is not enough just to be tolerant. We also need to mingle with others before we can understand them.<br><br>I was really upset by what I experienced especially when I had just arrived in Singapore a few hours earlier. How can we get foreign professionals to come to our country when we drive away our own professionals by exhibiting such attitudes?<br><br>Third World countries look up to Singapore as modern and efficient. But really, how modern and civilized are we in Singapore when educated people behave in less than intelligent ways?<br><br>My experiences in the Third World country where I work have taught me the importance of culture and humanity. Having to work with people from diverse backgrounds and nationalities is an experience.<br><br>We have cultural exchanges on a weekly basis. We also emphasize lifelong skills and independence amongst our students. In Singapore, are we adopting an assumed superiority and have forgotten about basic human values such as tact, sensitivity and understanding?<br><br>Junaidah Bt Sidik<br><br></div>

However, the malay gal should not think otherwise as it would cause discourse in different races due to miscom, misunderstanding etc, should give the man the benefit of the doubt?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by crazy monkey:</div><div class="quote_body">Non-Malay won't get into lift with Malay. How civil are we if we can't be civil to fellow Singaporeans?<br><br>The Straits Times<br>November 8, 2005<br><br>I have been teaching in an international school in a Third World country for almost two years now. Recently I was back in Singapore to celebrate Hari Raya Aidilfitri with my family and friends.<br><br>What I experienced on the morning of Hari Raya makes me question how civilized are we if we can't be civil to fellow Singaporeans.<br><br>On Nov 3 at Block 723, Tampines Street 72, I was waiting for the lift to send some cakes I had bought overseas for my fiance's family. A non-Malay man was also waiting for the lift but when the lift came, he refused to take it.<br><br>Inside the lift, I kept the door open when I heard someone rushing to catch it. As soon as she stepped into the lift, her body had an 'automatic repel' action, or should I call it 'allergic reaction' to seeing a Malay girl in baju kurung inside.<br><br>It caused her to bounce back outside. She shook her head vigorously indicating a change of mind to stand in the same lift with me. As I shut the lift door, I saw a smirk on the man's face as he sniggered and nodded in agreement with the woman.<br><br>I have been keeping myself updated with the news in Singapore. I am well aware of the convicted racist bloggers but personally I think enforcing the laws to combat racism is not enough.<br><br>I have mingled with friends from other races, religions and cultures since I was young. Right from pre-school to university, these friends had walked with me through obstacles and we understood one another despite our differences.<br><br>In a multiracial country like Singapore, it is not enough just to be tolerant. We also need to mingle with others before we can understand them.<br><br>I was really upset by what I experienced especially when I had just arrived in Singapore a few hours earlier. How can we get foreign professionals to come to our country when we drive away our own professionals by exhibiting such attitudes?<br><br>Third World countries look up to Singapore as modern and efficient. But really, how modern and civilized are we in Singapore when educated people behave in less than intelligent ways?<br><br>My experiences in the Third World country where I work have taught me the importance of culture and humanity. Having to work with people from diverse backgrounds and nationalities is an experience.<br><br>We have cultural exchanges on a weekly basis. We also emphasize lifelong skills and independence amongst our students. In Singapore, are we adopting an assumed superiority and have forgotten about basic human values such as tact, sensitivity and understanding?<br><br>Junaidah Bt Sidik<br><br></div></blockquote>+3...i tink the case will be even worse if its a indian person coz to some ppl the indians are smelly (due to the oil shit) to them...<br><br>But cant help it lah...i also will move a few inch away...but only in other place coz my place all chinese... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Overcoming racial discrimination is always a challenge in every society.<br><br>It isn't something that can be inculcated by govt forces or through racial harmony campaigns. Education plays a part but so does expanding our awareness and breaking out of our typically conservative shell.<br><br>We have to evolve beyond our primitive and backward thinking. The fact that inter-racial marriages are on the rise is a significant indicator of how we have progressed as a society despite isolated incidents.<br><br>But such things inevitably take time.</div>
