How civil are we if we can't be civil to fellow Singaporeans?<br><br>The Straits Times<br>November 8, 2005<br><br>I have been teaching in an international school in a Third World country for almost two years now. Recently I was back in Singapore to celebrate Hari Raya Aidilfitri with my family and friends.<br><br>What I experienced on the morning of Hari Raya makes me question how civilized are we if we can't be civil to fellow Singaporeans.<br><br>On Nov 3 at Block 723, Tampines Street 72, I was waiting for the lift to send some cakes I had bought overseas for my fiance's family. A non-Malay man was also waiting for the lift but when the lift came, he refused to take it.<br><br>Inside the lift, I kept the door open when I heard someone rushing to catch it. As soon as she stepped into the lift, her body had an 'automatic repel' action, or should I call it 'allergic reaction' to seeing a Malay girl in baju kurung inside.<br><br>It caused her to bounce back outside. She shook her head vigorously indicating a change of mind to stand in the same lift with me. As I shut the lift door, I saw a smirk on the man's face as he sniggered and nodded in agreement with the woman.<br><br>I have been keeping myself updated with the news in Singapore. I am well aware of the convicted racist bloggers but personally I think enforcing the laws to combat racism is not enough.<br><br>I have mingled with friends from other races, religions and cultures since I was young. Right from pre-school to university, these friends had walked with me through obstacles and we understood one another despite our differences.<br><br>In a multiracial country like Singapore, it is not enough just to be tolerant. We also need to mingle with others before we can understand them.<br><br>I was really upset by what I experienced especially when I had just arrived in Singapore a few hours earlier. How can we get foreign professionals to come to our country when we drive away our own professionals by exhibiting such attitudes?<br><br>Third World countries look up to Singapore as modern and efficient. But really, how modern and civilized are we in Singapore when educated people behave in less than intelligent ways?<br><br>My experiences in the Third World country where I work have taught me the importance of culture and humanity. Having to work with people from diverse backgrounds and nationalities is an experience.<br><br>We have cultural exchanges on a weekly basis. We also emphasize lifelong skills and independence amongst our students. In Singapore, are we adopting an assumed superiority and have forgotten about basic human values such as tact, sensitivity and understanding?<br><br>Junaidah Bt Sidik<br><br></div></blockquote>Well maybe it has nothing to with him/her being malay ! Frankly, I am a singaporean, after all these years growing up in a multi-nationality environment , we already grown unconsious of what race is which. But of course there are alway those few who still cannot let go, and somehow they are alway the one complaining about it, for they just put everything conveniently to race, and refuse to put blame to themself as a person.<br><br>I think the author must actually question herself/himself on how civil are him/herself instead. Because unknowingly herself/himself is the one that is bias but assume that the others are and blaming them !<br><br>In the situation, author say it clearly say he/she bring cakes !!! Maybe she bring so many boxes that people don't want to get in to crash the cakes as there is little space<br><br>Finally what type of cakes ? Well to her it may smell like heaven but to the rest it may be smell like hell !  Take singaporean for example we love durians, so unconsciously we are used to the smell , but for other foreginers , it smell so bad that they can vomit ! Think about it , even airline , mrt &amp; bus banned durian, for the sake of others , does that equal to discrimination ? No it is being civil minded and take in consideration for others who may not share the same enjoyment taste and smell.<br><br>Clear this case reflect someone who instead of asking herself why ? asking is the cake favour too strong for others. Instead of being civil minded , he/she instead put the blame on others. Maybe he/she is the problem he/herself, alway blaming people for things first, don't solve the problem.  he/herself has forgotten about basic human values such as tact, sensitivity and understanding instead.<br><br></div>

How civil are we if we can't be civil to fellow Singaporeans?<br><br>The Straits Times<br>November 8, 2005<br><br>I have been teaching in an international school in a Third World country for almost two years now. Recently I was back in Singapore to celebrate Hari Raya Aidilfitri with my family and friends.<br><br>What I experienced on the morning of Hari Raya makes me question how civilized are we if we can't be civil to fellow Singaporeans.<br><br>On Nov 3 at Block 723, Tampines Street 72, I was waiting for the lift to send some cakes I had bought overseas for my fiance's family. A non-Malay man was also waiting for the lift but when the lift came, he refused to take it.<br><br>Inside the lift, I kept the door open when I heard someone rushing to catch it. As soon as she stepped into the lift, her body had an 'automatic repel' action, or should I call it 'allergic reaction' to seeing a Malay girl in baju kurung inside.<br><br>It caused her to bounce back outside. She shook her head vigorously indicating a change of mind to stand in the same lift with me. As I shut the lift door, I saw a smirk on the man's face as he sniggered and nodded in agreement with the woman.<br><br>I have been keeping myself updated with the news in Singapore. I am well aware of the convicted racist bloggers but personally I think enforcing the laws to combat racism is not enough.<br><br>I have mingled with friends from other races, religions and cultures since I was young. Right from pre-school to university, these friends had walked with me through obstacles and we understood one another despite our differences.<br><br>In a multiracial country like Singapore, it is not enough just to be tolerant. We also need to mingle with others before we can understand them.<br><br>I was really upset by what I experienced especially when I had just arrived in Singapore a few hours earlier. How can we get foreign professionals to come to our country when we drive away our own professionals by exhibiting such attitudes?<br><br>Third World countries look up to Singapore as modern and efficient. But really, how modern and civilized are we in Singapore when educated people behave in less than intelligent ways?<br><br>My experiences in the Third World country where I work have taught me the importance of culture and humanity. Having to work with people from diverse backgrounds and nationalities is an experience.<br><br>We have cultural exchanges on a weekly basis. We also emphasize lifelong skills and independence amongst our students. In Singapore, are we adopting an assumed superiority and have forgotten about basic human values such as tact, sensitivity and understanding?<br><br>Junaidah Bt Sidik<br><br></div></blockquote>I find this a bit too incredible... I've never ever seen anyone avioding the lift because of racial differences. Furthermore, we have been living in a multiracial society for so many years so much so that we seem oblivious to sitting beside/being with another person from another race. It is, honestly, hard to believe.<br><br>But I have to agree that maybe racial discrimination is still around, but it is very minute and not that serious her in singapore. So i really don't think people will aviod the lift just because of a malay woman unless she is up to something or for some specific reasons</div>
