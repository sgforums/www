The firings came after a weekend in which Chinese officials acknowledged an additional 448 undisclosed SARS cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in China to 1,959 including 86 deaths.<br><br>The Chinese government also announced plans to tone down its traditional weeklong May Day holiday to a single day of celebration.<br><br>"The purpose of such an act is to prevent the massive movement of people and the possible spread of the disease," says Gao Qiang, an executive health minister, in a news release. The Communist May Day holiday on May 1 traditionally attracts millions of celebrants to travel across China.<br><br>An investigative team from the World Health Organization arrived in Shanghai today to investigate the SARS outbreak in that major shipping port where local officials have so far confirmed only two cases of SARS. An earlier report from the WHO raised concerns that health officials in many areas of China may not be prepared to handle SARS and might not be reporting all probable cases of the disease to Beijing authorities.<br><br>The WHO has also expressed concern over how the SARS outbreak seems to taking a turn for the worst in Hong Kong. Over the weekend, a record number of SARS patients (12) died in Hong Kong, and officials say these deaths are occurring more frequently in young, previously healthy people.<br><br>Local health officials in Hong Kong say a more severe form of SARS has emerged among a cluster of 321 SARS cases that occurred among residents of the Amoy Gardens apartment complex. About 20% of these patients require more intensive medical care compared with the 10% of other SARS patients that have required such care. Two-thirds of the Amoy SARS cases have also developed diarrhea as a symptom of their disease compared with 2% to 7% of cases in other outbreaks.<br><br>In response to the continued spread of SARS in Asia, the CDC has updated its travel guidelines to help travelers protect themselves from SARS. Worldwide, 3,861 probable cases of SARS have been reported to the WHO, including 217 deaths.<br><br>The CDC and WHO already have issued travel advisories recommending that people postpone all non-essential travel to Hong Kong, mainland China, Singapore, and Hanoi, Vietnam.<br><br>If travelers decide to go through with their travel to these areas hardest hit by the SARS epidemic, the CDC advises the following precautions:<br><br>Assemble a travel health kit containing basic first aid and medical supplies. Be sure to include a thermometer, household disinfectant, a supply of surgical masks, disposable gloves, and alcohol-based hand rubs for hand hygiene.<br>Inform yourself and others who may be traveling with you about SARS.<br>Be sure you are up to date with all your shots, and see your healthcare provider at least four to six weeks before travel to get any additional shots or information you may need.<br>You may wish to check your health insurance plan or get additional insurance that covers medical evacuation in the event of illness.<br>Identify in-country healthcare resources in advance of your trip.<br><br>While travelers are in areas affected by SARS, they should wash hands frequently with soap and water to minimize the risk of illness. Alcohol-based hand rubs may be used as an alternative.<br><br>To minimize the possibility of SARS infection, the CDC recommends avoiding close contact with large numbers of people as much as possible. But CDC does not recommend the routine use of masks while in public areas.</div>

A non-Malay man was also waiting for the lift but when the lift came, he refused to take it.<br><br>Inside the lift, I kept the door open when I heard someone rushing to catch it. As soon as she stepped into the lift, her body had an 'automatic repel' action, or should I call it 'allergic reaction' to seeing a Malay girl in baju kurung inside.<br><br>It caused her to bounce back outside. She shook her head vigorously indicating a change of mind to stand in the same lift with me. As I shut the lift door, I saw a smirk on the man's face as he sniggered and nodded in agreement with the woman.<br><br>I have been keeping myself updated with the news in Singapore. I am well aware of the convicted racist bloggers but personally I think enforcing the laws to combat racism is not enough.<br><br>I have mingled with friends from other races, religions and cultures since I was young. Right from pre-school to university, these friends had walked with me through obstacles and we understood one another despite our differences.<br><br>In a multiracial country like Singapore, it is not enough just to be tolerant. We also need to mingle with others before we can understand them.<br><br>I was really upset by what I experienced especially when I had just arrived in Singapore a few hours earlier. How can we get foreign professionals to come to our country when we drive away our own professionals by exhibiting such attitudes?<br><br>Third World countries look up to Singapore as modern and efficient. But really, how modern and civilized are we in Singapore when educated people behave in less than intelligent ways?<br><br>My experiences in the Third World country where I work have taught me the importance of culture and humanity. Having to work with people from diverse backgrounds and nationalities is an experience.<br><br>We have cultural exchanges on a weekly basis. We also emphasize lifelong skills and independence amongst our students. In Singapore, are we adopting an assumed superiority and have forgotten about basic human values such as tact, sensitivity and understanding?<br><br>Junaidah Bt Sidik<br><br></div></blockquote>I think the author of this letter is oversensitive la.<br><br>Siao ah just because someone don't wanna take lift with you they become a racist? Some people don't enter the lift with me when I'm in it with my dog but I don't get all upset about it what. They're not necessarily dog haters, maybe they are allergic to animals, had a bad experience with one or just fear them?<br><br>She was also carrying cakes, maybe they were the wrong kind of cakes? I know I won't enter a lift with someone carrying durian cakes because I'm ultrasensitive to the smell, does that mean I detest the race of that person? If that person's the same race as me how? And anyway what makes the person so sure those two were Singaporeans?<br><br>My neighbour's Malay and Muslim, so she is supposedly not allowed to get into too close contact with dogs or their saliva I'm not sure which one. On the few occasions my dog and I are waiting for the lift and she's there too I always make sure she has the option of taking the lift first without me. However after a few times she just trusted me in handling my dog and now she just holds the door open for me to get in because she is understanding and trusts me to handle my dog well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Racism is everywhere la. You can issue punishments or whatever legislations against an act of racism but that will only stop the act itself. It won't make that person less racist or more race tolerant.. in some cases it might even aggravate it....<br><br></div>

Ask the writer why she bothered to differentiate herself into a Malay and the other two strangers into nonMalays in the first place (oh yeah, and don't blame the white man for it!).<br><br>If they forced the Malay lady to get out of the lift or to take the lift later or closed the lift door when they saw her rushing in or sth liddat, I totally understand the strangers may have been racist, in fact very ugly and small penised/flat chested ones for that matter.<br><br>But if they allow you the privilege of going into the lift alone and first, what's there to kick a fuss about man? And same race folks may do that too.<br><br>having said that it's very very true that racism is widespread in singapore, it's not a tiny minority.<br><br>if I may generalize, chinese are the most racist, indians the second most, malays the least of these three races, haven't seen/met/observed/interacted with/Fucked/penetrated etc etc enough eurasians to conclude anything.<br><br>so some of the chinese folks need to improve themselves alright but if you feel it's only the chinese who can do it or who actually do it, you must be unobservant or lying.<br><br>There are CONSIDERABLE numbers of racists both among Indians and Malays. And so too among foreigners (be they chinese, koreans, indians, bangladesh, phillipines, thailand, indonesia or the white men or whoever). Not enough eurasians or sikhs or others to conclude anything.<br><br>The general stereotype is that those who're in power can only be racist, those who're not privileged can not be so under any circumstance. But don't fall for that kind of crap.<br><br>As a footnote, my strong, thick and long 18 inch penis is not racist, all women/girls are welcome to send me their nude pics. If my penis responds positively I'll initiate the most thrilling Fucking session you girls/women could've ever imagined.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The writer of the article was being too sensitive.  The woman who refused to take the lift could be due to different reasons... she forgot something.... she decided to take a lift all by herself etc etc.<br><br>Likewise, I don't have any Malay neighbour in my block.  Can I say that Malays don't like to live in the same block with non Malay?  Cannot what.<br><br>Chinese are not as racist as most ppl think.  Yes, we do make racist jokes from time to time.  But we also joke about our own race what.  Look at how we circulated and laughed at the Star Wars in Hokkien by Class 95 DJs.</div>
