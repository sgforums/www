            <div class='col-md body'>The Taiwaneses have the right to choose their leader (president), so why cant us Singaporeans also have the right to choose our own leader (PM), instead of let the government choose for us.<br><br>i mean that our next PM is BG Lee, but why cant us have a choice to vote between Tony Tan and BG Lee. Of course, people know Tony Tan is old already so the government dont want him to be PM, but dun you know that not all Singaporeans want BG Lee to be PM because he is son of LKY???<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you have read the interview of Lee Kwan Yew with ??? (Safire ??) you will know that Tony Tan was Lee Kwan Yew's ideal successor. But he refused the position. Only Goh Chok Tong was more willing to take up. This happened in 1990 if i am not wrong.<br><br>Well, are you sure that if we are given the chance to elect our PM, your ideal choice will run for the election ? What if no capable candidates are willing to run for the election ? This is a very sensitive issue and we as commoners will not know.<br><br>Learn from Taiwan ? Well, I dun envy Taiwan. There are too many strikes and protests. Singapore is well-known as a strike-free country. This is very important if we want to achieve high score in the annual Perc assessment. Without political and social stability, who would come and set up their businesses here ?<br><br>The most recent strike I can remember was in 1986. The shipbuilding workers went on strike allowed by our previous President Mr Ong Teng Cheong. That strike ended in just 2 days becuase the businessmen from States and Europe ahd called and asked "What is happening ? I thought Singapore is a strike-free country??"<br><br></div>

I old liao lah.<br><br>&gt;&gt;but if there r at least 2 candidates, dun u think we should have the right to vote for our ideal PM even if in the end the ideal one lost???<br><br>Are we ready for it ? Once again i would like to address the issue of national maturity and political sensitivity. I don't think we as a nation has matured and is politically sensitive yet.<br><br>In the past, people want our own elected President, now we have it. And people are not satisfied now, they want our own elected PM. Maybe it will happen. But it takes time, we are a young nation, even younger than Taiwan. Let's do things slowly, you rush you end up like Russia.<br><br>Maybe we will have our own elected PM one day. And MAYBE after that, people will want their own elected DPM, Finance Minister, Education Minister blah blah blah.<br><br>We used to complain that there is no freedom of speech in Singapore, now we are going to have our own Speaker's Corner, the first in Asia i believe. But look at what pple are saying (see topic : Speaker's Corner?) Are we ever satisfied ?<br><br>My opinion is, since PAP is our elected party. We must give them our full trust and support. It is difficult to be a leader, but it is more difficult to be a follower. We are the followers. Let's do our part to support them.<br><br>One problem i find to be very different between a Singaporean and a Hong Konger is, when something wrong happens, Singaporean will blame it on the government but the Hong Kongers will blame it on themselves. We have to learn from the Hong Kongers. People said singaporeans are sheltered/protected/pampered by the government. Why ? Becos we choose to be. We have to learn to step out of the greenhouse and face the real unprotected world.<br><br>Perhaps we should stop asking for wat the government can do for us, but what we can do for the country.<br><br>We elect our government to represent us, not to serve us.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt;&gt;wah, really, in 1990, i only in pri school.<br><br>okz. Me also not old then. I grow up then read about it one.<br><br>&gt;&gt;elect the government??? we didnt, our parents/grandparents did.<br><br>I did ! hehe<br>Wait for your turn lah ! aiyo !<br><br>&gt;&gt;why a age 35 nation can be considered "young"???<br><br>Well, how mature we are as a nation depends on the people. We are descendants of immigrants. Our society is highly heterogeneous. Have we created an identity for ourselves ? Have we made our heterogeneous society into a homogenenous one ? It takes generationS to create a national identity. 35 years is not even one generation.<br><br>Our generation is already very different from our parents' generations. We are the product of post-war baby boom. We are born AFTER singapore gained independence. When we were born, Singapore is already a country. But not when our parents were born (my aren't dunno about yours). Hence there are differences in thinkings/believes/expectations and ideals. When our parents' generation dies away, our generation will take over and gradually Singapore will be more like a country.<br><br>My opinion is, we need to focus on national building now. Focus on educating the younger generations, make sure that when our generation dies, they can take over and do well.<br><br>It takes generations to change and 35 years is not even a generation.</div>
