            <div class='col-md body'>Guard right to send maid to end of queue<br><br>I WAS tickled by Mr Alfred Loo's account ('Guard at POSB sent maid to back of queue'; ST, Jan 5). It seems we now have yet another use for maids - to be our personal proxies in queues so we can attend to other things without losing our place in a line.<br>The Cisco officer, in my opinion, acted judiciously and considered the interest of other patrons in the line at POSB Hougang branch.<br><br>Appointing proxies to take up space in a queue is ungracious and unashamedly, typically 'ugly Singaporean' behaviour. If Mrs Loo had an important errand to run, she should have planned her schedule with greater care.<br><br>If Mr Loo is to be taken seriously, I can only infer that all Singaporeans who have busy schedules (and can afford maids) should take them along to take up positions in queues in banks, post offices or at any other counter.<br><br>At the very least, we should all get our own mannequins and place them in queues while we attend to other things.<br><br>Narendran Krishnan<br><br></div>

We were queuing outside a hotel one late Saturday night at the taxi queue.  There wasn't much taxi so the queue became long.  We waiting for more than an hour till our turn.  When a taxi pull a NS guy came to us and asked us to let him go as he was late for booking in, my friend say "yes" and I say "no".  I said if let him go, we had to go back to the queue to queue again or to take over his place.  That's only fair.  Or he had to ask everyone behind us if they mind to let him have the taxi.  My friend called cold hearted without sympathy and was angry with me.. I was prepared to re-queue and he wasn't, so who was right and who was cold hearted...  anyway, I gave in but before I asked behind if the queue allow it . ..  no one say anything and so we let the guy get in ...   sigh....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is just a case of retarded discrimination. As long as the maid was willing and not forced to queue for her employer, what's wrong ? Its not as if anyone cut the queue. It's still standing in line, just that a representative is standing in.<br><br>Take this example. If your extended family, say 20+ people were at a family function, and everyone wants drinks. Does that mean all 20+ people are supposed to queue just because everyone wants drinks ? No right ? Most likely 2-3 people will REPRESENT everyone and queue to buy drinks.<br><br>So its the same what. As long as someone else is willing to queue fairly and wait in line for another person, nothing is wrong !<br><br>In this case, it must be discrimination. Just because its a maid queueing, the guard saw it as INSUFFICIENT representation and sent her to the back. If it was a HUSBAND/PARENT/CHILD, do you think the guard would've dared to do anything ?<br><br>So what makes a MAID less important than any other person when queueing up ? Is she any less human such that her representation of her employer is not recognise ?<br><br>All these people ... do things without thinking first. Very insulting</div>
