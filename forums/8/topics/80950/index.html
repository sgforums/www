            <div class='col-md body'><strong>(Qilin hotel) which is near Qi Meng Ding.</strong><br><br>Well tat time I stay at Cai Hong Hotel quite close to Xi Meng Ding also. First nite see gang fight already.. they juz grab a bicycle and throw at the other party and the other party call for help use cane with splitted ends fight back then pee pee police come one of them squat down head bleeding while his buddy run until see no shadow. End of show I pity the bicycle owner, bicycle is so innocent!<br><br>Ok enuff experience. For me we took their train around. Train can reach one are Tam Shui. Another is Yang Min Shan &lt;-- this take train then take their public bus then can reach. Long She Temple where there sell snakes blood to drink. And one is dunno which come out got 1 very big bookshop. And for those drink wan is Shuang Ren Jie? Also can take their train reach Taipei Zoo entrance fee only 60 NT very cheap compared to Singapore Zoo entrance fee. And the most famous is pasar malam at Shi Lin Ye Shi. Take train drop at Jian Tan station. Best is buy train ticket unlimited whole day more worth it.<br><br>I think it is always best to ask the hotel receptionist for recommendation and help as in what transport to take can reach there. For guys seeking thrill, ask the MALE hotel worker not the lady female receptionist.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
