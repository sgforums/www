            <div class='col-md body'>To Twiggie,<br><br>In a long distance relationship, trust and commitment are important factors. It will not work out if you and/or your partner is always insecure and constantly thinking about infidelity.<br><br>I, myself, am working overseas, attached and even if I do go back to Singapore, she will not be there, she is not Singaporean. Things have worked a long way out for us. It has been more than a year already.<br><br>Communication is important. Talk it out, cherish the time that you spent with each other.<br><br>Though to make this work, both of you will need to make certain sacrifices in terms<br>(when you know your partner needs you, you will be there for him/her) Even though you are not physically there, just by communicating to him/her helps to solve the situation. Vice-versa.<br><br>There are so many more things that you will need to make it work. The relationship itself can't just be superficial. Getting to know each other and know that this is what you want and be determined to work this out.<br><br>If it can get through the barrier of distance, it will show a greater maturity and mutual trust in the relationship.<br><br>'Absence makes the heart grow fonder.'<br><br>If you can't live with the fact he/she is constantly not around you, then maybe you need to rethink about the whole issue.<br><br>To the other question with the tempt of lust, who wouldn't be tempted to? No man is saint. Same for the women given the same condition. (although some may argue this to be untrue, what if this person turns out better in every ways to your partner, then you would be contemplating on why you didn't search awhile longer before settling on the current one)<br><br>What I have posted above is only a hypothetical scenario.<br><br>It is not easy to find someone you love, learn to live and love him/her.<br><br>This is my view, my intentions are to share, not to dispute about it being right or wrong.<br><br>Have a good day.<br><br>T.L<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To all..i think that long distance relationship is really dependent on mutual trust and mutual understanding loe...for a fact..i am currently also having a long distance relationship...i am studing overseas and my gf is still back in singapore.. initial part will be tough but then..slowly things will being to work out and getting used to not seeing each other for a long time is something that needs a long time to get used to...so it is not impossible to maintain a relationship..but it is just tough...</div>
