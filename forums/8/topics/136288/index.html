            <div class='col-md body'>From :  Mr Alexander Sidorov &lt;---&gt;<br>Reply-To :  "Mr Alexander Sidorov" &lt;---&gt;<br>Sent :  Wednesday, June 08, 2005 12:40:08 PM<br>Subject :  For your consideration; F---<br><br>|  |  | Inbox<br><br>Dear Sir/Madam,<br><br>There is a chance that you have come across media coverage about<br>Yukos Oil Company recently. If not - then this business proposal is<br>not intended for you.<br><br>Yukos is a fully-integrated oil and gas company with headquarters<br>in Moscow, Russia. It is one of the worldÂ’s largest private oil<br>companies by reserves and market capitalization. Yukos is an open<br>joint-stock corporation publicly traded on stock exchanges both in<br>Russia and abroad.<br><br>Yukos' CEO, the wealthiest man in Russia and the 16th wealthiest<br>man in the world according to Forbes Magazine, Mikhail Khodorkovsky<br>was considered to be one of RussiaÂ’s most powerful oligarchs until<br>his arrest at gunpoint on October 25, 2003.<br><br>Until recently Yukos oil company was chaired by Mikhail<br>Khodorkovsky, one of the wonder boys of Russian capitalism, who<br>together with a group of colleagues is said to own 40 to 60 percent<br>of Yukos?shares. However, Khodorkovsky was arrested in October<br>2003 on charges of tax evasion and fraud and is currently standing<br>trial while remaining in detention. After his arrest, Khodorkovsky<br>resigned and was replaced by Russian-born U.S. citizen Simon Kukes<br>as Yukos?CEO. Shortly thereafter, the Russian government took the<br>unprecedented step of freezing Yukos shares. Yukos has been subject<br>to relentless government scrutiny since 2003.<br><br>On May 31, a Moscow court sentenced Khodorkovsky, former head of<br>the Yukos oil firm and once the richest man in Russia, to nine<br>years in prison. KhodorkovskyÂ’s partner and friend Platon Lebedev<br>also received a nine-year jail term. The prison sentence was one<br>year less than the 10-year maximum sought by the prosecution. The<br>verdict was predictable and aimed at intimidating independent<br>business structures in Russia, various observers have said. The<br>state decided in advance that Khodorkovsky should be convicted.<br><br>Of course the actual sentence was decided and discussed at the top<br>echelons of executive power. Nobody has any illusions the court was<br>independent, not even the broader public. The trial, which has<br>alarmed investors and hurt President Vladimir PutinÂ’s international<br>standing, is widely seen as an attempt by the Kremlin to make an<br>example of a political rival and warn RussiaÂ’s business elite to<br>keep out of politics.<br><br>This is not a sentence. It is an act of reprisal.<br><br>The sentence had to be long enough so Khodorkovsky was in jail in<br>2008, at the next presidential elections. His lawyers and advisers<br>will do everything they can to see international public opinion<br>does not forget about this case.<br><br>Tax authorities are demanding a total of $27.5 billion from Yukos,<br>once RussiaÂ’s fastest growing oil company and top exporter. They<br>have also frozen its assets and crippled it by selling its main oil<br>producing unit, Yuganskneftegaz, at a forced auction in December<br>which raised $9.35 billion. The Russian court bailiffs announced on<br>May 27, that so far they have recovered 392 billion rubles ($13.97<br>billion) in unpaid taxes, fines and penalties from the embattled<br>Yukos Oil Company.<br><br>My name is Alexander Sidorov, a loyal Yukos associate at present<br>and a strong supporter of Yukos' independence vice versa<br>malpractices of the Russian government. I act under direct<br>authority of a dedicated group of senior Yukos associates, of which<br>I am part. Our primary objective is to liberate as many assets of<br>Yukos from political control by the Russian government as possible<br>and to limit or prevent confiscation of Yukos' assets. For this<br>pupose, we have developed a series of strategies to consolidate<br>these assets.<br><br>If you share a common interest with us, we offer you a genuine<br>business proposal for your consideration.<br><br>In this particular case, our consolidation strategy focuses at<br>effectively reclaiming a very considerable amount of value. As an<br>operator for this strategy, you will receive a substantial share of<br>the assets that are successfully reclaimed. We are looking for a<br>capable and thustworthy person, preferably someone with a prominent<br>business background and extensive financial resources, who will act<br>in close cooperation with ourselves to pursue this strategy. If you<br>do not meet these criteria, this proposal is not meant for you.<br><br>Naturally, your selection as a possible candidate will be subject<br>to a set of conditions.
