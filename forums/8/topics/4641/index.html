            <div class='col-md body'>Bellittled,it's the double standards syndrome you are talking about,a good example can be found here in Singapore,some people want kindergardens to be located near where they stay for convenience,but when the kindergarden is proposed to be put under their block,they raise objection as they scared the noise will drop their property value,so most singaporeans i see are quite selfish in that they wants something good,but are unwilling to take the bad that comes with it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">))</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The big hoo-ha about this Annabel Chong aka Grace is such a 'notorious' public figure becos<br>1. She is an Asian<br>2. She is educated in SG and is one of the best student  before she got raped in States<br>3.First Asian to be in the Guinness records for such sex exploits and proud of it!<br><br>The funny thing is she only turned haywire after getting raped. She has lost the total self-worth and 'vowed' to break the world Guinness records by having as many sex partners as possible and of cos she knows what disgrace means! In the end she still lost to some other gal. Think about it, if not for the fact she is educated in SG and all...I dun think anyone who even bother to make a mountain out of molehill. Disgrace? not to the Nation since she has gone to the States with good results whom she supposedly get all the good education from SG...and maybe the institution she graduated from and the family will feel so called shameful. But it is her life and she chose to be promiscious in a high profile manner rather than being one of the prostitutes in any part of the world...At least, she caught your attention and that is what she wants.Live and let live...<br><br>------------------<br>We have no right to ask when sorrow comes, "Why did this happen to me?" unless we ask the same question for every moment of happiness that comes our way.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 21 April 2000).]</div>
