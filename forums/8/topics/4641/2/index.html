It was only after that. Looking back at my life, I realized that a lot of things I've done seemed to be totally out of control. All that trying to get away from my coddled life was because I was trying to take back control by being out of control, which is kind of a paradox.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I happen to hold the view that the gang rape is an excuse that trigger for the gang bang. Many pitiful people has been raped in all parts of the world and did they do what AC did? Clearly not.<br><br>While we have to examine ourselves b/4 we judge others, it is good to know where one stands in the first place. Although she was a victim and may be doing all these to try to gain back some lost ground, I think while we may pity her but what she did was indeed distasteful.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup,it is indeed distastful,but we cannot say that her excuse for doing what she did is wrong as we do not know what went thru her mind when she was getting gang raped and thus cannot fully understand her reasons for doing what she did now  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">))</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is best if we don't discuss her here. Since no one here know what is her way of thinking. It not apporiate to pass judgement without knowing her.

            <div class='col-md body'>Why is so many people concerned with her being raped or not?<br><br>The fact that she went into hardcore pornography could be a culmination of many many complex factors that could include love for sex as much as the rape incident.<br><br>But she is a disgrace to those who are more morally upright, but she definitely hits it off with those who enjoy her shows.<br><br>So is she a disgrace?
