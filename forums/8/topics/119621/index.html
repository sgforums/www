And now, this shocking case...<br><br>By Faith Teo<br>wenli@sph.com.sg<br><br>DESPITE a long history of mental illness, he nailed a job as a teacher.<br><br>The 35-year-old, only identified by his surname Liu, was in charge of evening tutorials and doubled up as night watchman for the school's boarding house at the Changhe village school in Gansu, China.<br><br>Last December, Liu was arrested for systematically raping 24 young female students in the space of a year.<br><br>After picking his targets, all aged 12 to 14, he would drug the girls before sexually assaulting them, reported local paper Chongqing Evening News.<br><br>His rape spree came to light when one of his victims, a 12-year-old, accused Liu of raping her.<br><br>Others soon followed suit.<br><br>In one report, a girl reported that Liu gave her medicine that made her sleepy, and the next morning she woke up naked next to him.<br><br>She said Liu then warned her not to tell anyone.<br><br>But she did, and so did another, who said she was raped five times.<br><br>Yet another reported three rapes.<br><br>The reports alarmed parents, and 15 of them registered their protests with the local education authorities.<br><br>But nothing was done for a long time.<br><br>Ironically, it was Liu's history of mental illness that protected him.<br><br>The authorities told angry parents that they could not take immediate action to remove him because his illness prevented them from intervening in the matter. It is unclear why.<br><br>Less than three weeks ago, Chinese newspaper The Standard reported that the government had closed 10,000 kindergartens and 2,000 schools in a nationwide campaign to solve problems of violence in schools.<br><br>Up to 27,000 staff were also sacked, after it was found that they were not qualified to work with children.<br><br>Some had criminal records, while others had mental problems.<br><br>CRISIS<br><br>The campaign was prompted by a spate of knife attacks on students, and an inspection of all schools was carried out from October to December last year.<br><br>DORM STABBING<br><br>In one horrific instance, a 21-year-old man stabbed eight teenagers to death in November as they slept and injured four others after breaking into a school dormitory in Ruzhou, Henan. He was later executed.<br><br>KNIFE ATTACK<br><br>In December, a knife-wielding man forced his way into a primary school classroom in Jilin province and attacked 12 young children, slashing them in the head and back.<br><br>PRIMARY SCHOOL RAPE<br><br>1People's Daily reported in 2003 that an elementary school teacher from Jilin Province was executed after being found guilty of molesting or raping 19 female students, all under 14.<br><br>He was exposed only four years after he began his attacks, when he was assigned to teach a new class.<br><br>The new students there reported his advances to the authorities.<br><br>SERIAL RAPE<br><br>Another elementary teacher from Guangxi was sentenced to death in January last year after raping four students a total of 14 times. The youngest was just 9.<br><br>The 26-year-old would launch his attacks after convincing the girls to stay behind after official school hours on the pretext of giving them private tution.</strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">       <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
