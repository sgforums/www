            <div class='col-md body'>Family dramas are cheap, easy to make and popular with the average Joe. But isnÂ’t it time we brought some action dramas back into our TV diets?<br><br>IN the course of local television history, there has never been a programme that brought me to my knees.<br><br>But here I am, asking, no, begging Derrol Stepenny Promotions and MediaCorp never Â– ever Â– to let footage from this yearÂ’s Ford ModelsÂ’ Supermodel of the World/Singapore contest be aired in any foreign country.<br><br>I couldnÂ’t bear it if the Malaysians were to laugh at our ridiculously low standards of beauty.<br><br>Whatever happened to our Junita Simons and Anita Akbars? Are we sifting through the dregs at the bottom of the beauty barrel?<br><br>When I unwittingly tuned into the programme last Friday night on Channel 8, I spent the length of the contestÂ’s broadcast calling on God and invoking His name each time they introduced a finalist.<br><br>Sometimes, I would go: "Oh my God."<br><br>Sometimes: "Oh my God!"<br><br>And sometimes: "Oh - My - God."<br><br>It would be too cruel to mention names here and let it not be said that IÂ’ve ever been cruel to animals. But honestly, does the show really have to go on even if there is nothing to show?<br><br>Suffice to say, Friday night was the nadir of my weekÂ’s TV viewing pleasure Â– whatever there was of it.<br><br>I never realised just how barren our local programming was until I went on leave last week and did nothing but watch TV and play computer games.<br><br>There wasnÂ’t a local single show I looked forward to the entire week, and considering we now have five local channels plus cable TV (if you can affort it), thatÂ’s really a sad state of affairs.<br><br>I once said that we should have more programmes like Channel 8Â’s Vive La Famille - now I ask, can we ditch the family dramas and get some action back into our TV diets?<br><br>We are literally swimming in locally-produced family dramas and sitcoms. Just count them:<br><br>Channel 8 has Holland V at 7pm and Baby Boom at 9pm on weekdays;<br><br>Channel U has Ok No Problem at 8pm on Thursdays to Saturdays and Together Whenever at 8.30pm on Wednesdays to Fridays;<br><br>Channel 5 has Brothers 4;<br><br>Channel i has...ok, letÂ’s not go there.<br>ItÂ’s occasionally nice to watch a family drama you can relate to, but even eating your favourite dessert every night can become a chore. I canÂ’t believe IÂ’m about to say this - but I miss Triple Nine.<br><br>I miss the sight of some macho hunk breaking into an apartment, yelling "Police!" and then running after some criminals with a drawn gun.<br><br>It was unbearably cheesy and full of cringe-worthy moments, but you could be sure that in every local police drama, there will be someone going undercover, some scenes where people take off their shirts, and some scenes featuring a red-light district.<br><br>It doesnÂ’t have to be a police drama. What about a tough courtroom drama - without the relationship mush that bogged down Channel 5Â’s medical drama First Touch? Or something about us exciting reporters (we only wish).<br><br>I thought Channel 5Â’s supernatural thriller Restless was a good attempt at exploring a new genre untapped by our English channels.<br><br>The point is - letÂ’s put some punch and a couple of exploding cars back into our dramas and sitcoms.<br><br>And if necessary, we can use the "supermodels" from this yearÂ’s pageant as part of the body count.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
