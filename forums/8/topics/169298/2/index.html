As for the statement 'one life is bad enough', I agree to some point. However many religions which teaches reincarnation also teaches that one is able to escape reincarnation. <strong>In fact, especially in Buddhism, one is able to escape the sufferings of samsara even in this lifetime.</strong></div>

Every night our 7th consciousness accesses this 8th consciousness and what results is 'dreams'. The 8th consciousness is a storehouse of all our karmic seeds... so when karma is created, karmic seeds are stored in the 8th consciousness. At the time for rebirth to take place the seeds ripens and draw us (samsaric sentient beings) back into the six realms of rebirth.<br><br>The teaching of Anatta (no self or no soul) is more on the ultimate sense that there is no entity, including consciousness, called a 'self' that is going through reincarnation since all phenomena are merely streams of moments rather than a fixed entity. Meaning that rather than a fixed entity that is changing, each now-moment serves as the cause for the next now-moment. No-self is actually a broad and important teaching in Buddhism. Many people think that there is a self, or treats the body as self. But in reality and in contemplation, one will realise that there is no self. However I shall not go into detail for now... else it'll be off-topic.<br><br>Nirvana - a state liberated from samsaric rebirths, is free from both wholesome and unwholesome karma, as both types of karma will only lead to virtuous and unvirtuous realms, respectively. Only those with pure karma can enter Nirvana. <span style="font-style: italic;">Having surpassed the state of arising and ceasing, and maintaining the state of non-arising and non-ceasing, non-defilement and non-purity, non-increasing and non-decreasing, this state of suchness is called Nirvana.</span><br><br>It is absolutely possible (in Buddhism) for one to reborn in a far-away-galaxy as long as you have that karma for it.<br><br>Lastly, I believe this article: <a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol8no4c.htm" rel="nofollow">Life after Life</a> should be able to answer most of your questions. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
