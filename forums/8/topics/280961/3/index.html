            <div class='col-md body'>Let's zoom in to the two languages of English and Mandarin. I come from an English-speaking family. Both sides of my family speaks english. But i can speak mandarin pretty well too, although there is an English accent in my speech.<br><br>I see no disgrace in being a chinese who doesn't know how to speak mandarin. There are lots of whites in the States whose English isn't that good either. Some can't even spell as well as us.<br><br>Well, to me - Chinese is just a tool. You can't deny that English is - THE INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE. It is the MAIN gateway to communication. Chinese/mandarin will NEVER be an International Language. Even the Chinese are starting to make it compulsory to learn English, or at least a beneficial option.<br><br>The key to good communication is to allow yourself to be understood. I've got people speaking f*cked up English as though they come from China. F*ckin' terok. They got me f*ckin' fed up. Thus, when I see them struggling to impress me with their 'excellent' English, I switch to Mandarin and Singlish.<br><br>Imagine that situation when they're speaking to a foreigner - your usual Angmoh. If you're that Angmoh, would you like to have any business deals with them? [A chicken talking to a duck]  Well, the same could be said for your Chinese counterpart. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>The European countries, the States, etc ('the angmoh markets') and even India - how many really know how to communicate in Mandarin? I know that the Chinese market is there to be tapped, but the quality - be it labour, products and goods, services, etc ain't as established, renowned &amp; 'value for money.' Like they say - 'you pay peanuts, you get monkeys.'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Why do English-speaking people stereotype Chinese-speaking people as low-class? Please take a look at your lovely Chinese Ah Bengs. Do you wanna unconsciously wear their cheena tags?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Oh, try flirting with an 'angmoh-pai' girl speaking in mandarin. She'll give you one tight slap and ask you to f*ck back to China.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>One way to rid the barrier is to be effectively versatile in changing your way of speech according to situations. (ie. ability to code-switch, which is an advantage.)<br><br>Unfortunately, most Singaporeans can't. But fret not, Singapore loves cheenas, if you had noticed. Nobody cares if you're good in English.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I pick a few comments here to comment:<br>1) chinese who can't speak chinese<br>2) people who act superior by speaking english only<br>3) languages in general<br><br>1) If you are born and bred in China - any dialect or language is still chinese, not necessarily mandarin! So, if I can speak dialects but not mandarin, am I not chinese? I had to correct this misconception when I was at a Speak Mandarin Campaign when a stupid professor made the comment that Chinese who cannot speak mandarin are not Chinese. I get his impression here too. So, to these people, you are the most stupidiest Chinese if you make or maintain this misconception.<br><br>2) There will always be INFERIOR complex people <span style="text-decoration: underline;">who have the need</span> to prove their EGO by speaking another tongue - thinking that they are the 'educated' ones as compared to their chinese-speaking cousins. For a long time, people think that angmoh is superior. This myth is still in many minds, not only in SG but also in HK. These inferior complex people naturally look down on chinese-speaking folks. My suggestion is to ignore such pariahs, avoid speaking to them (as they have no brains), better to talk to your dogs or cats - at least they don't mind what language you use!<br><br>3) Languages - people on this Earth speak different languages or dialects. It is as natural as the colour of your hair or skin or facial feature. There is no such think as the superior race, the chosen people, god's children or whatever that renders one more superior than another. The need for superiority is really man's weakness and the cause of a lot of strives, wars, ethnic cleansing, racial riots, atrocities, blatant murders, senseless killings.<br><strong>MY language is THE language. MY race is THE race. MY god is THE god. MY one is THE one!</strong> THINK THINK THINK!</div>

In the past, I thought cheena refers to the language slang and behavior of Chinamen.

Denying your own roots is not the problem here. Although u are chinese, you are no longer in china and yellow skin does not mean u must know everything chinese. Decendents of the english who colonise the world do not know english history as well. (e.g australians)<br><br>The problem here lies with the unwillingness to learn a new language. This means that you are denying yourself to communicate with other people (main chinese duh) in the world. I have frens from china currently studying here who can both read and write in english and chinese fluently. In the future, we would lose out to these ppl as they have an extra edge on us as they know chinese. It even worse with the chinese market opening up, it can trasnlate to millions of dollars lost juz because you fail to learn a language.<br>Since you have the opportunity, you shld learn it, at least for the economic value.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Let's just say when such people speak clear and concise English, you would have the notion that they're bragging or showing off. So you deemed the angmoh's English is way better than Asians and if that particular Asian fella is able to speak pretty well, your brain would be tuned to detecting that 'invisible accent.'<br><br>And I won't deny when you speak impeccable English, there's bound to be some 'differences' in the pronunciation which is inevitable. That's cause you simply can't speak well, and you think it's so cool to speak in disastrous English.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Thus, if you can't even get your pronunciation right, and/or insist on speaking Singlish and/or Chinglish for your entire life, good for you then.
