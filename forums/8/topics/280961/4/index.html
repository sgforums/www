            <div class='col-md body'>In my view, people who don;t speak chinese language are mostly two type of people<br><br>One, they are bought up in english speaking home environment where the maid and parents are speaking in english, then when they go to school, they struggle with the mandarin and they gave up on it, thinking, what the heck, mandarin is so tough, anyway, the subjects are all taught in english mostly, as long as my english is good, i can find a job and study my books.<br><br>So this type of people are breed by their parents and the government who decide to make english the instruction language of education in schools and this is not their fault. In a practical sense, Singapore multi racial society, english is our   language to link chinese, malays, indians and other nationality. Beside in terms of business, alot of countries are english speaking, so that the rational behind it. I don;t mind these people as long as they respect their race, their history due to the fact that they are mostly influenced by circumstances.<br><br>However , i feel the second type is a frankly laughable, those who think that speaking chinese is in their mind " low class" or "cheena". In my view, these type of people suffer from inferiority complex. Yes they have a problem with their self identity and self esteem. They want to be western so bad but they are not but they at least wanna imitate and get closer.  Look, If you want embrace and learn from other culture, fine, but don't put down and insult yourself and your race. that's when you close the line between learning other culture and abandoning your own identity. If you don't respect yourself, how will you earn other people respect? Case in point, try going to america and australia and see whether you want to be proud of yourself as a first class version of yourself or a second rated wannabe there? So please wake up from your miserable illusion and grow some backbones and respect for yourself.<br><br>Anyway, to close my post, i am a person who enjoy both english and chinese equally, i speak whichever is suitable for the listener and i enjoy both english and chinese entertainment media, why learn one only when you can have them both? It;s really allow yourself to experience more in life. On a economic angle, China are slowly rising up to become the next superpower, it may be a reality that chinese language will become a internationally used language in the future.</div>

"no offense" and "kinda stupid" usually dun mix together. Anyway I understand your point.  KTVs are mainly Mandarin/Cantonese songs. Thus it wont be suitable for you if you only listen to English songs. Just tell your friends straight that you are not interested in KTV. Everything will be solved.<br><br>To clarify, my initial post refer to people who speak English for the sake of acting high class while looking down on their own culture and language.
