What I am refering here are Singaporean teenagers and young adults, not ABC. In Singapore, we have a lot of opportunity to learn both English and Mandarin whereas in America they might not have it.<br><br>I'm not implying that speaking English is bad. No. In Singapore society, speaking fluent English is necessary. But the issue is NOT to have this mindset that "Mandarin speaking people are cheena and of lower class." This mindset is flawed.<br><br>If you can't speak your Mother Tongue language, fine. But the least you can do is not to look down on it.</div>
