That old luggage of mine was so full that it might explode anytime. <span style="color: red;">I was trying my</span> very best to make <span style="color: red;">use</span> of every single inch that the old luggage can contain. The thought of <span style="color: red;">travelling</span> outside my homeland for the first time <span style="color: red;">is making</span> me <span style="color: red;">go</span> crazy. The highly excited me was jumping around like <span style="color: red;">a</span> monkey <span style="color: red;">which</span> just could not wait for the time to depart <span style="color: red;">for the vacation</span>.<br><br>It was finally time to carry our big and packed bag<span style="color: red;">s</span> into the van. My uncle double check<span style="color: red;">ed</span> that everything that is needed to bring along was <span style="color: red;">taken</span>. This is the beginning of my journey outside <span style="color: red;">my</span> homeland for the first time. Rays of the sun <span style="color: red;">shone</span> down fiercely <span style="color: red;">on</span> my uncle's car while <span style="color: red;">the</span> then gentle wind of the air-condition<span style="color: red;">er</span> blew <span style="color: red;">our faces</span>. The sky was clear.<br><br>Wild imagination started to <span style="color: red;">race through</span> my mind. <span style="color: red;">The thoughts</span> of the coolest theme park, of their wonderful food and the best temperature Genting would have. The air temperature of Genting is as cold as the temperature my uncle's car air condition<span style="color: red;">er is giving out</span>.<br><br>We pass<span style="color: red;">ed</span> the <span style="color: red;">causeway</span> which divides Singapore and Malaysia <span style="color: red;">to</span> take a break in a restaurant. The restaurant was quite dirty but as we <span style="color: red;">could not</span> find any other <span style="color: red;">decent</span> place<span style="color: red;">s</span> to eat, <span style="color: red;">hence</span> we ate there. After eating, we continue<span style="color: red;">d</span> our journey and <span style="color: red;">were</span> finally able to reach our destination, Genting.<br><br>After both of us book<span style="color: red;">ed</span> in into a hotel room, <span style="color: red;">I</span> was stuck inside the washroom for quite sometime. <span style="color: red;">It was not</span> because <span style="color: red;">of</span> their washroom <span style="color: red;">being</span> nice, but <span style="color: red;">was due to a stomachache I had</span>. I felt very ill that day and my uncle <span style="color: red;">brought</span> me to see a doctor. The <span style="color: red;">search</span> for a doctor was <span style="color: red;">took</span> quite <span style="color: red;">a</span> long <span style="color: red;">time</span> as we were unfamiliar with the place.<br><br>After the doctor<span style="color: red;">'s</span> injection, i slept in the hotel and that <span style="color: red;">was</span> how i <span style="color: red;">spent</span> my first day outside Singapore. During my <span style="color: red;">sleep</span>, my uncle went to the casino <span style="color: red;">and(cancel this "and")</span> without me as <span style="color: red;">I</span> was underage. Another reason was <span style="color: red;">because I could not</span> leave <span style="color: red;">my</span> bed and <span style="color: red;">so</span> he took the chance to go there.<br><br>After <span style="color: red;">I</span> woke up, <span style="color: red;">I felt so energized</span> that <span style="color: red;">I was able</span> take down a tiger! Maybe this energy was stored yesterday <span style="color: red;">when I was resting</span>. There has only been <span style="color: red;">one</span> thing on my mind. The Theme Park. I <span style="color: red;">got</span> my outfit and went off to the hotel lobby without my uncle<span style="color: red;">'s accompanying me</span>. The exit of the hotel<span style="color: red;">,(cancel this "comma")</span> was open and <span style="color: red;">I</span> saw something <span style="color: red;">I</span> had never expected.<br><br>Water <span style="color: red;">droplets were dripping</span> from the sky down to the ground <span style="color: red;">I</span> was standing <span style="color: red;">on</span>. This also <span style="color: red;">meant</span> that the Theme Park will be close<span style="color: red;">d</span>. I was so sad that <span style="color: red;">I</span> went back to my room and <span style="color: red;">then</span> called my uncle to wake up. I ask<span style="color: red;">ed</span> him what should we do <span style="color: red;">at that time</span> since we would not be able to enjoy ourselves in the Theme Park. He suggested the Arcade.<br><br>I then went to the arcade with my uncle and play<span style="color: red;">ed</span> there. There <span style="color: red;">was</span> nothing really special about the arcade and <span style="color: red;">I</span> was not in the mood <span style="color: red;">to play</span> as <span style="color: red;">I had missed going to</span> the fantastic theme park <span style="color: red;">that I had been</span> dreaming about.<br><br>Soon<span style="color: red;">, it was evening</span> and we went back to our hotel. The next morning, we <span style="color: red;">started on our trip</span> home.
