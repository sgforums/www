            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Nelstaer:<br><strong><br>In China, the government is not promoting the old scriptures to the population. Many of them are costly so laymen hardly get hold of them. Taiwan has some publications. I bought the Chinese I-Ching and Tao Te-Ching. More of the old scriptures should be published in paper-back so the average population can afford to buy them. These scriptures are in Classical Chinese texts. Therefore modern texts of simplified Chinese have to be printed side by side with the classical texts. I am looking for Chinese Chuang Tzu, English/Chinese Book of Songs, English/Chinese Spring and Autumn etc.<br></strong><br><br>costly ? I don't know you still buy them <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> , i downloaded a few scriptures of  various text into my PDA so i can read them any time i like...<br><br><strong><br>The Chinese do not have a standard to regulate the cultural and religious activities. Most are mixture of Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism. Taoism allows Chinese to burn paper money and other articles. Pure Buddhism does not allow these burning but at some Buddhist temples you can still see this practice. DonÂ’t you think the Chinese Buddhists are stupid. Also Monkey God is suppose to be Buddhist but you can find this deity in mostly Taoist temples. So are Chinese praying to the right deity. In Singapore I do not find the Monkey God in any Buddhist temple. Therefore Chinese Taoists are stupid to pray to the Monkey God in their temples.<br></strong><br><br>haha...buddhist are tolerant, besides the core teaching was not emphasizing on rules...Anyway not only chinese is in either this religion. Picking on race is bad enough still want to include religion some more....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br><strong><br>Chinese build temples to pray to their heroes. The latest addition is Mao De-dong. Chinese also pray to their ancestors. Moreover Chinese believe reincarnation. DonÂ’t the Chinese think it is stupid to pray to these people if they are reincarnated again. So who are they praying to when the dead persons are reborn as humans or animals? Stone? Wood? Paper? Metal?<br></strong><br><br>Is that all you know about reincarnation and praying? Does believing  reincarnation means must do so? Must definately go through reincarnation?<br><br><strong><br>Some Chinese food cause cancer; food like salted vegetables, salted eggs, century eggs, salted fish etc. The Chinese government should discourage the Chinese to produce these items for sale and consumption. More fresh vegetables and food should be eaten.<br></strong><br><br>There is many unhealthy food by many non-chinese. There is also many healthy food produce by all kind of people. If using your logic of those unhealthy should be ban, i guess the original writer unhealthy remarks against chinese should be ban as well...<br><br><strong><br>Taiwan Chinese are playing games with the mainland counterparts. By relying on America, they think one day they can achieve independence. They must be naÃ¯ve or stupid. One solution for China to press Taiwan is to give them 5 years to declare Taiwan is Chinese or else on the 1st of January 2006, China will ban Taiwan investment in China and present investment not allowed to expand. This is a way of sanction against Taiwan. Just like what America does to Cuba.<br></strong><br><br>haha, if china have to do that they will do immediately still need to wait  that long ? They have do want they must right now, reasons that you will not comprehend.<br><br></blockquote>Bottom line is that you have not conducted any statistical result nor gather enough knowledge to make any comments on chinese....Very ignorant, thinking that stringing what he/she thought as 'prove' will make the claims real.<br><br>To sum up everything, Stupidity is very subjective and quite racial independance. But one thing for sure is that the writer who refer chinese as stupid was a classic example of stupid, showing the independance of topic material to race and yet tries linking them again in the subsequence paragraph</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chinese history - I love the long chinese history ....10K years?<br><br>In history , chinese were once separated groups of tribes . Then during the  periods of dynastic rules , more and more of them almagated into the same "Han" group for political unification purposes. Did you know the cantonese people are actually a mixture of northern chinese and ethnic Yue  people during the Xia dynasty until they assimilated together in the Tang dynasty? Hence that is why the older generation call themselve "tung yan" or "tung shan yan" but still part of the same Han group because of the ancient Han dynasty.<br><br>Ancient chinese like assimilation because of the political and warring advantage. Bigger your army is , the more you win. The ancient chinese were also keen for knowledge , hence you have the invention of paper and gunpowder - in the Ming dynasty the chinese had seismic machines to measure the richter scale.<br><br>China likes assimilation better than invasion in the past. Assimilation meant it made life easier and  less problematic in an economic and political sense (stems off rebellion since there is a belonging within the separate groups). The biggest mistake the Ming dynasty had ever made was to shut itself off and that led to the Ming dynasty downfall.<br><br>Assimilation has been a thing for us chinese -  it is a form of survival for us as minority groups. It is either chinese assimilate the culture or we assimilate into the culture. In most developed nations,  we still hold the roots high in value by having chinatowns. Hence we are also the largest ethnic group in the world.<br><br>The peranakans are chinese who married the straits malays and assimilated their culture .<br><br>Let's put it this way : Chinese are not stupid. Arrogant at times yes but never dumb.<br><br>Resistance is futile. You will be assimilated.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i beg to differ... chinese are NOT stupid. r u a chinese btw??<br><br>you tend to equate all these as the erosion of the chinese culture. bt i wld prefer to see it as an exchange of ideas and cultures. in this era of globalisation, increased international relations between nations have given rise to a new unifiying culture -- the american culture. also, countries find themselves interdependent on one another. true, too much interdependence can be detrimental, just as in the case of USA and cuba. bt in this world, which country, be it asia, europe and the middle east, can safely say that they r nt dependent on USA economically, politically and militarily? Taiwan is no exception. jux cos they r trying to get into USA's good books doesn't make them stupid. on the contrary, they r smart. they know that in order to survive in today's world and secure their vested interests, they have to suck up to the USA, which is what singapore is doing right now. the chinese r not alone in this. INdonesia, Israel, Europe where majority of the population are predominantly malays or ang mohs are obliged to maintain their bilateral relations with USA. N with the proliferation of the American culture, many chinese have allowed these influences to be assimilated into their lives. this may nt be a bad thing. while keeping up with current global trends, they r rejecting decadent influences at the same time. aft all, many chinese still frown upon western practices of homosexuality n cohabitation. issues concerning sexual promiscuity r still deemed unacceptable or abhorred.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by fymk:</div><div class="quote_body">Chinese history - I love the long chinese history ....10K years?<br><br>In history , chinese were once separated groups of tribes . Then during the  periods of dynastic rules , more and more of them almagated into the same "Han" group for political unification purposes. Did you know the cantonese people are actually a mixture of northern chinese and ethnic Yue  people during the Xia dynasty until they assimilated together in the Tang dynasty? Hence that is why the older generation call themselve "tung yan" or "tung shan yan" but still part of the same Han group because of the ancient Han dynasty.<br><br>Ancient chinese like assimilation because of the political and warring advantage. Bigger your army is , the more you win. The ancient chinese were also keen for knowledge , hence you have the invention of paper and gunpowder - in the Ming dynasty the chinese had seismic machines to measure the richter scale.<br><br>China likes assimilation better than invasion in the past. Assimilation meant it made life easier and  less problematic in an economic and political sense (stems off rebellion since there is a belonging within the separate groups). The biggest mistake the Ming dynasty had ever made was to shut itself off and that led to the Ming dynasty downfall.<br><br>Assimilation has been a thing for us chinese -  it is a form of survival for us as minority groups. It is either chinese assimilate the culture or we assimilate into the culture. In most developed nations,  we still hold the roots high in value by having chinatowns. Hence we are also the largest ethnic group in the world.<br><br>The peranakans are chinese who married the straits malays and assimilated their culture .<br><br>Let's put it this way : Chinese are not stupid. Arrogant at times yes but never dumb.<br><br>Resistance is futile. You will be assimilated.<br><br></div></blockquote>10,000 years of history, but no tradition of liberal democracy.<br><br>Any use in that? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

There was widespread criticism of US involvement in Vietnam back in the swinging '60s (which led to the rise of hippie culture emphasising peace), just as there is widespread unhappiness about the war in Iraq in the 21st century.

Tiananmen incident was an eg of chinese people's patriotism and tenacity under oppression by govt. do not equate chinese people with their govt. the only excuse Lee Tenghui and puppets have to their people, for not rejoining china is the inept way china is run. otherwise taiwanese people will gladly reconcile with their motherland where their roots began. just like the 2 koreas. then, a bigger and stronger china will serve as a necessary power check for US. and more importantly, delay japan's plans to execute plan B<br><br><img src="http://membres.lycos.fr/cedbrain/gifs_animes/donnie_yen.gif"></div>

Below is a quote of the opium wars.<br><br><blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A Short History of the Opium Wars</strong></span><br><br>From: Civilizations Past And Present<br><br>Book: Chapter 29: South And East Asia, 1815-1914<br><br>Author: Wallbank;Taylor;Bailkey;Jewsbury;Lewis;Hackett<br><br>Date: 1992<br><br>Excerpted from Bureau Development's CD-ROM<br><br><strong>The Central Kingdom</strong><br><br>At the end of the 1800s China's four million square miles held 450 million people, up from 200 million a century earlier. The ruling dynasty was the Ching, established by Manchus from Manchuria, who in 1644 had superseded the Ming. These descendants of the Tatars appreciated Chinese civilization and adopted a conciliatory attitude toward their subjects. They refused, however, to allow intermarriage with the Chinese, for they realized that only their blood difference kept them from being assimilated and conquered. By and large, however, the Manchus gradually became Chinese in their attitudes and habits.<br><br>The Manchu emperors were remarkably successful. The reign of Chien-lung (1736-1795) was a time of great expansion. The Manchus gained Turkestan, Burma, and Tibet. By the end of the eighteenth century Manchu power extended even into Nepal, and the territory under the Ching control was as extensive as under any previous dynasty.<br><br><strong> The Western Response</strong><br><br>The foreigners were especially irritated by the high customs duties the Chinese forced them to pay and by the attempts of Chinese authorities to stop the growing import trade in opium. The drug had long been used to stop diarrhea, but in the seventeenth and eighteenth century people in all classes began to use it recreationally. Most opium came from Turkey or India, and in 1800 its import was forbidden by the imperial government. Despite this restriction, the opium trade continued to flourish. <span style="color: red;">Privately owned vessels of many countries, including the United States, made huge profits from the growing number of Chinese addicts.</span> <span style="color: darkblue;">The government in Peking noted that the foreigners seemed intent on dragging down the Chinese through the encouragement of opium addiction. </span><br><br>[See Opium Factory: The stacking room at an opium factory in Patna, India. Opium smuggling upset the balance of trade and destroyed China's economy.]<br><br>In the meantime, the empire faced other problems. The army became corrupt and the tax farmers defrauded the people. The central bureaucracy declined in efficiency, and the generally weak emperors were unable to meet the challenges of the time. The balance of trade turned against the Chinese in the 1830s, and the British decided to force the issue of increased trade rights. The point of conflict was the opium trade. By the late 1830s more than 30,000 chests, each of which held about 150 pounds of the extract, were being brought in annually by the various foreign powers. Some authorities assert that the trade in opium alone reversed China's formerly favorable balance of trade. <span style="color: darkred;">In the spring of 1839 Chinese authorities at Canton confiscated and burned the opium. In response, the British occupied positions around Canton. </span><br><br>In the war that followed, the Chinese could not match the technological and tactical superiority of the British forces. In 1842 China agreed to the provisions of the Treaty of Nanking. Hong Kong was ceded to Great Britain, and other ports, including Canton, were opened to British residence and trade. It would be a mistake to view the conflict between the two countries simply as a matter of drug control; it was instead the acting out of deep cultural conflicts between east and west.<br><br>The French and Americans approached the Chinese after the Nanking Treaty's provisions became known, and in 1844 gained the same trading rights as the British. The advantages granted the three nations by the Chinese set a precedent that would dominate China's relations with the world for the next century. The "most favored nation" treatment came to be extended so far that China's right to rule in its own territory was limited. This began the period referred to by the Chinese as the time of unequal treaties - a time of unprecedented degradation for China. The humiliation the Central Kingdom suffered is still remembered and strongly affects important aspects of its foreign policy. Meanwhile, the opium trade continued to thrive.<br><br>The British and French again defeated China in a second opium war in 1856. By the terms of the Treaty of Tientsin ( 1858 ) the Chinese opened new ports to trading and allowed foreigners with passports to travel in the interior. Christians gained the right to spread their faith and hold property, thus opening up another means of western penetration. The United States and Russia gained the same privileges in separate treaties </blockquote></div>
