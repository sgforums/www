            <div class='col-md body'>If you observe the Chinese people, you can see they tend to absorb foreign cultures and abandoning their own culture. In the past, after Buddhism was introduced into China, many Chinese emperors promoted Buddhism as state religion, neglecting the importance of Taoism and Confucianism. In the last 300 years when Christianity began spreading in China, the Chinese were abandoning the cultural wedding and adopting the white wedding gown of the West. More and more Chinese are throwing away their cultural roots and behave more like westerners. They consider this modern.<br><br>In the past, emperor Chin Shi Huang burned a collection of books. He did not want Chinese to express their views so that future generations will not engross in unnecessary argument. This action curtailed the development of individual expression and achievement of many scholars and writers. This stupid act thwarted the flowering of intellectual development in China for many years.<br><br>By looking at the whole world and its past history, you can see many countries after getting strong they started to conquer the neighbors. China is the only exception. India at one time controlled the whole of South-east Asia. Hindu culture was imparted to the locals, whereby Ramayana dances are still performed in Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Bali etc.<br><br>I want to show you how stupid Chinese are. When strong the Chinese did not conquer all the surrounding countries. Their own cultural roots are discarded and many Western cultural practices are absorbed. The modern Chinese is no different from a Caucasian, only in the skin color. Just look at Singaporean Chinese. Many are so Westernized, they consider themselves Singaporeans only. They are shy to call themselves Chinese. Some might be disgraceful of their cultural roots, they can be considered WOG.<br><br>Lee Teng Hui of Taiwan prefers to acknowledge Japanese as father rather than calling himself Chinese. He thinks Taiwanese are not Chinese but another tribe of race coming out maybe from the vagina of Ang Mo. It is because he wants to follow the English Americans to be called Americans rather than English Americans ignoring their English roots. Also Chen Shui-bian of Taiwan dare not classify himself as a Chinese. He wants independence for Taiwan as his party DPP stands up for. So you see Chinese want to change their own race to suit their own interest. See how stupid they are.<br><br>Chopsticks are Chinese cultural tools for eating. In Singapore many Chinese homes are using fork and spoon. In the future chopsticks are no more to be seen except may be in restaurants.<br><br>The Christian Chinese are the worst for discarding Chinese roots. Those second generation Christian and after are so Westernized that some donÂ’t have Chinese names or donÂ’t know how to write their Chinese names. I went to Malacca in 1970. In Peranakan home, the main hall had an altar for the Taoist deity for prayer. The furnishing is Chinese with some Malay flavoring. But if you go into any Singapore Christian Peranakan home, the furnishing is modern, way of life like any western home. Only some keep antique of Peranakan furnishing. Most of these Peranakan Chinese donÂ’t behave as Chinese. They try to establish themselves as another race. They forget their Chinese roots.<br><br>The Chinese government send many students to the West for further study. Not many return to serve their country. Those oversea took up foreign citizenship. Some criticize ChinaÂ’s human rights abuse. They forget who brought them up and gave them education. These are Chinese traitors.<br><br>The Chinese leaders are wearing western tailored suits. They are disgracing the Chinese people. If they wear Maoist suit or Â‘chang powÂ’ for official duty, they are showing to the world they love Chinese things. As leaders they have to lead as an example for the Chinese to follow. Also the popularity of Maoist suit or Â‘chang powÂ’ will reduce the import of western tailored suits. This saves money. But it seems these Chinese leaders are aping the West. May be they think they look smart wearing western tailored suits. To lead you have to be different. DonÂ’t follow the crowd. Country leaders are not fashion followers. How is China going to lead the world if these Chinese leaders pander to the western ideals?<br><br>The Chinese dumpling festival is a stupid festival. Suicide is stupid, but the Chinese honor Chu Yuan in this festival.<br><br>Christmas is becoming a favorite festival for the Chinese even though many are not Christians. This is a commercialized festival engineered by the businessmen, but the Chinese are stupid to participate in this festival not knowing they are throwing away their roots. In a way this is a form of converting the young Chinese to become Christians.<br><br>In Malaysia the MCA is always in trouble because of rivalry. As a minority the Chinese have to be united, but it seems Chinese are stupid to quarrel among themselves because of position and diverse policy opinion.<br><br>In China, the government is not promoting the old scriptures to the population. Many of them are costly so laymen hardly get hold of them. Taiwan has some publications. I bought the Chinese I-Ching and Tao Te-Ching. More of the old scriptures should be published in paper-back so the average population can afford to buy them. These scriptures are in Classical Chinese texts. Therefore modern texts of simplified Chinese have to be printed side by side with the classical texts. I am looking for Chinese Chuang Tzu, English/Chinese Book of Songs, English/Chinese Spring and Autumn etc.<br><br>The Chinese do not have a standard to regulate the cultural and religious activities. Most are mixture of Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism. Taoism allows Chinese to burn paper money and other articles. Pure Buddhism does not allow these burning but at some Buddhist temples you can still see this practice. DonÂ’t you think the Chinese Buddhists are stupid. Also Monkey God is suppose to be Buddhist but you can find this deity in mostly Taoist temples. So are Chinese praying to the right deity. In Singapore I do not find the Monkey God in any Buddhist temple. Therefore Chinese Taoists are stupid to pray to the Monkey God in their temples.<br><br>Chinese build temples to pray to their heroes. The latest addition is Mao De-dong. Chinese also pray to their ancestors. Moreover Chinese believe reincarnation. DonÂ’t the Chinese think it is stupid to pray to these people if they are reincarnated again. So who are they praying to when the dead persons are reborn as humans or animals? Stone? Wood? Paper? Metal?<br><br>Some Chinese food cause cancer; food like salted vegetables, salted eggs, century eggs, salted fish etc. The Chinese government should discourage the Chinese to produce these items for sale and consumption. More fresh vegetables and food should be eaten.<br><br>Taiwan Chinese are playing games with the mainland counterparts. By relying on America, they think one day they can achieve independence. They must be naÃ¯ve or stupid. One solution for China to press Taiwan is to give them 5 years to declare Taiwan is Chinese or else on the 1st of January 2006, China will ban Taiwan investment in China and present investment not allowed to expand. This is a way of sanction against Taiwan. Just like what America does to Cuba.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pal, every culture moves on and absorbs new things and discards.That is called human progress, why not put aside cultural differences and look at it more objectively, you will realise that we as humans have a genetic disposition to try out new things which we may not have tried and we will be atatched to things that appeal to us and seem relevant to us.This is common to all cultures.Move on and stop yearning for the days where change was a foreign term and everyone lived the same way for generations.You call that heritage, I call that impediment to progress.How we define a Chinese is not for us to define, it's for our children.No one can impose a single definition on a race across time and space.</div>

Want me to mention a few?</span><br><br>By looking at the whole world and its past history, you can see many countries after getting strong they started to conquer the neighbors. China is the only exception. India at one time controlled the whole of South-east Asia. Hindu culture was imparted to the locals, whereby Ramayana dances are still performed in Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Bali etc.<br><span style="color: blue;">Conquering other country is great?</span><br><br>I want to show you how stupid Chinese are. When strong the Chinese did not conquer all the surrounding countries. Their own cultural roots are discarded and many Western cultural practices are absorbed. The modern Chinese is no different from a Caucasian, only in the skin color. Just look at Singaporean Chinese. Many are so Westernized, they consider themselves Singaporeans only. They are shy to call themselves Chinese. Some might be disgraceful of their cultural roots, they can be considered WOG.<br><br>Lee Teng Hui of Taiwan prefers to acknowledge Japanese as father rather than calling himself Chinese. He thinks Taiwanese are not Chinese but another tribe of race coming out maybe from the vagina of Ang Mo. It is because he wants to follow the English Americans to be called Americans rather than English Americans ignoring their English roots. Also Chen Shui-bian of Taiwan dare not classify himself as a Chinese. He wants independence for Taiwan as his party DPP stands up for. So you see Chinese want to change their own race to suit their own interest. See how stupid they are.<br><span style="color: blue;">So? There are also many stupid cases for the ang mo  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </span><br><br>Chopsticks are Chinese cultural tools for eating.

By the way, you know how to use chopstick?</span><br><br>The Christian Chinese are the worst for discarding Chinese roots. Those second generation Christian and after are so Westernized that some donÂ’t have Chinese names or donÂ’t know how to write their Chinese names. I went to Malacca in 1970. In Peranakan home, the main hall had an altar for the Taoist deity for prayer. The furnishing is Chinese with some Malay flavoring. But if you go into any Singapore Christian Peranakan home, the furnishing is modern, way of life like any western home. Only some keep antique of Peranakan furnishing. Most of these Peranakan Chinese donÂ’t behave as Chinese. They try to establish themselves as another race. They forget their Chinese roots.<br><br>The Chinese government send many students to the West for further study. Not many return to serve their country. Those oversea took up foreign citizenship. Some criticize ChinaÂ’s human rights abuse. They forget who brought them up and gave them education. These are Chinese traitors.<br><span style="color: blue;">How about those ppl who stay in power but yet is corrupted? These ppl are even worse, than those who emigrate. If those who emigrate are traitors, how about those who stay in the country but are corrupted?</span><br><br>The Chinese leaders are wearing western tailored suits. They are disgracing the Chinese people. If they wear Maoist suit or Â‘chang powÂ’ for official duty, they are showing to the world they love Chinese things. As leaders they have to lead as an example for the Chinese to follow. Also the popularity of Maoist suit or Â‘chang powÂ’ will reduce the import of western tailored suits. This saves money. But it seems these Chinese leaders are aping the West. May be they think they look smart wearing western tailored suits. To lead you have to be different. DonÂ’t follow the crowd. Country leaders are not fashion followers. How is China going to lead the world if these Chinese leaders pander to the western ideals?<br><span style="color: blue;">There are good things from the west that we can learn from.</span><br><br>The Chinese dumpling festival is a stupid festival. Suicide is stupid, but the Chinese honor Chu Yuan in this festival.<br><span style="color: blue;">You clearly dun know what is happening in the history.</span><br><br>Christmas is becoming a favorite festival for the Chinese even though many are not Christians. This is a commercialized festival engineered by the businessmen, but the Chinese are stupid to participate in this festival not knowing they are throwing away their roots. In a way this is a form of converting the young Chinese to become Christians.<br><span style="color: blue;">I am not a christian; I enjoy the public holiday like I enjoy the other festival. It show that the chinese are tolerance. Btw, not all chinese are taoist, confucanism, buddhist. </span><br><br>In Malaysia the MCA is always in trouble because of rivalry.
