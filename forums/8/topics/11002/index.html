            <div class='col-md body'>Almost everyone knows what it feels like to fall in love. There are the shared hidden glances in crowds; the inability to get her (or him) out of your head; the unquenchable longing to be with them; the wish for time to stand still when you are together so that you may never have to part; the flutter in your stomach as you kiss. Falling in love is great. The emotions run high. Adrenaline and endorphins fill your blood tinting the rest of the world with passion and promise. And setting you up for the cold hard slap of reality's hand.<br><br>Let's face it. In the beginning of a relationship everything is perfect and nothing can go wrong. Our attentions are misdirected from all the niggly, mundane little details that may annoy and irritate us by the overwhelming press of hormones. We don't notice that she never seems to stop talking, not even for a second. We delude ourselves and say "She is very outgoing." You ignore the fact that he calls his mother three times a day, every day. Instead you say "He's sensitive and cares about family." Even sex at the beginning of a relationship is deceptive.<br><br>Think about the person you are with now, or the last person you were with. Remember the first time you had sex? Think about taking each others clothes off? I'm willing to bet 99% of the women were wearing very sexy underwear. The bra's and panties most likely matched and were lacy and, statistically, either black or red. And 99% of the guys were wearing their new pair of underwear, with no holes or skidmarks yet, and maybe even put on some cologne. The fantasy continutes and the infatuation is fed and we plunge headlong into a relationship based on misperceptions. The misperceptions our own fantasies create.<br><br>You see, the care and attention we pay to those details early on in a relationship usually fade away. As we grow more comfortable with each other, we allow more of our true selves to show. We get closer and eventually the real facts of life, people, relationships and reality slap us in the face. And we wake up one morning wondering how we got here. What happened to the way things used to be? Reality, that's what.<br><br>The fantasy can't really last forever. It takes too much planning. Too much forethought. There is no time to relax at the beginning of a relationship and it is mentally and physically exhausting. I'm conviced many relationships became relationships simply beaucse their participants were too worn out from the infatuation, that when it fades, they don't have the energy to do anything but stay put. It becomes a relationship by default. And even though you discover most of her bras are very plain and functional, and most of her panties are plain white cotton (though I do find those sexy myself, call me crazy); and even though she finds out most of your underwear is stained and torn and barely holding together and that you hardly ever rememeber deodorant, let alone cologne; you stay together and wonder where the sense of wonder in your relationship went.<br><br>The reality of relationships can be a harsh truth. We rarely, if ever, see it coming. But one day we wake up lying in bed next to someone wondering what ever happened to that sense of wonder and excitement. What happened to talking until 3 AM and then making love until sunrise every night? What happened to coming home from a long day at work to find her in a sexy, see-through something-or-other and a michevious gleam in her eye? Or him arriving home from work early with a giant bouquet of flowers for no reason at all and whisking you out to a fabulous dinner at the trendiest new restaurant in town? Reality, life, and our own biological inability to maintain the levels of endorphins and adrenaline we're flooded with when we first fall in love. That's why relationships that last are work. It takes an effort to keep doing all those things that made everything so magical in the beginning and the effort has to be mutual. If it is one sided, or no sided, when the passion fades the relationship will become a battleground from which no one will escape unscathed. It's not pretty, but the truth is often annoying.<br><br>by Gabriel Bell<br><br></div>
