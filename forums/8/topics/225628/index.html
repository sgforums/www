            <div class='col-md body'>the below thread is actually in the PRC orginal thread but i decide to create a new thread to ensure more people will read it cos i wanna educate more people<br><br>'''''''''<br><br>i dunno abt u all<br><br>looking at the stabbing incidents makes me scared.....<br><br>although i can still gain back my composure, its still not easy to really understand what it implies or what can we learn from the news.<br><br>first, i am 24 yr old liao... so i am quite mature and experience to handle such violent and scary incidents of life.<br><br>however, for our teenagers and children, they are not well equppied to manage the fears they experience when they see such things.... so my advice for those young people is to study more about emotion skills through books primarily so that you are can better handle cruel and scary realities of life.<br><br>another advice for teenagers or younger people is to stay away from watching these videos so that you will not suffer the fear.<br><br>to teach you all how to handle the fear, i would like to teach you all some tips. i shall talk about the physiology of fear. basically when you experienced bouts of fear, the sensation will occur at regions somewhere in the throat region. hence by seeing it as a physical condition, you can separate this feelings from your thoughts faster.<br><br>what happens in general is that your thoughts of the issue and feelings of discomfort in the throat region and imagination will occur simultaneously and because human sees casuality in terms of space and time, they will conclude that the stabbing video = fear = imagination = scary.<br><br>as such, they will feel fear for sometime and you cannot stop thinking about it. for a moment you feel that life is so scary and your mind may panic abit.<br><br>you therefore need to stop this series of events from mixing together and try to achieve calmness as fast as possible by unconditioning the fear process. because of the intricate nature of emotions in that it happens in milliseconds, human are therefore not good at unconditioning negative emotions and anaylse it.<br><br>the second solution is to have right understandings and knowledge of stabbing incident, and about other realities in life. if you have wrong understanding and faulty beliefs, you will get confused about life.<br><br>for example, you may believe that life is safe for you because you have never met with dangers in life. therefore, when you see the stabbing incident, your mind begin to realise that your life is not very very safe actually. you begin to feel fearful because you cannot accept the fact that your life is not safe.<br><br>therefore the right beliefs are this. you need to remind yourself that life can bring dangers and misfortune to you. and you have to accept this reality. as what buddhism teach, acceptance is an important attribute. when you are more prepared for bad things in life, then you will be less fearful when you see violent and dangerous things in life.<br><br>so finally, in order to ensure you guys can understand realities and react with more calmness, you guys have to learn how to be calm and also accept that pain can occur to you. the solution to pain, is simply to endure.<br><br>Endure, endure and endure. its not perfect but it is the best you can do. therefore, we can see that emotion skills are very important in life if you want to live well. so you have to learn them, you will not learn them by experience alone. its faster if you study them.<br><br>as i said before, there is no god and you have to depend on yourself to learn about life and become a more mature person. those just play and enjoy life all the time. spend much time about reality and improve your intelligence and emotional skills.<br><br>to further support my atheist stance, you should realize that no amount of praying, hoping, and speaking to god will imrpove the safety and peacefulness of the world. it will not make the world a better place even by one cm.<br><br>reality is that crimes, homicides, fatal fightings, natural disaster, accidents and disease takes life and harms life and it always has a chance to befall onto me and you. not that i want to curse you but that is the reality.<br><br>stop praying and hoping. if you want to make the world a safer place. we need action. action from man, not from god. we need to learn and improve our knowledge continuously.<br><br>with more knowledge , we can cooperate more and assist the police, government, and scientists to come up with better ideas on how to solve problems in life. be proactive, and not just shift all the responsiblity to police and government to make the world a safer place.<br><br>if you wanna make the world a safer place, everyone has to chip in. well you can sit back and relax and leave it to government and police to solve problems in society. but i rest assure you that with the number of people they have, social problems and other kinds of problems will be more than they can handle.<br><br></div>
