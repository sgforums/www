            <div class='col-md body'>Usual suspects make the list<br><br>by: Syahirah Anwar<br>- newspaper.asia1.com<br><br>Who are the most beautiful women in Asia? We asked 100 Singaporeans - 50 men and 50 women - to pick five Asian women whom they considered beautiful and sexy. And no surprises as to who nabbed the top spot.<br><br>Almost two thirds of the the respondents put former Miss World and Bollywood starlet Aishwarya Rai in their list.<br><br>At a distant second, with less than half of the votes, was Chinese actress Gong Li, who starred in the recent Hollywood flick Miami Vice opposite Colin Farrell.<br><br>The rest of the top 10 list was made up of the usual suspects - actresses Zhang Ziyi and Shu Qi and Malaysian pop princess Siti Nurhaliza.<br><br>But some Singaporeans threw up lesser-known names, such as Polish-Javanese actress Tamara Bleszynski and American-Chinese actress-model China Chow.<br><br>Local babes were not left out, with some mentioning MTV VJ Denise Keller, actress Wong Li-lin and host Andrea De Cruz. Even The Link owner Tina Tan-Leo and Haach CEO Ponz Goo were picked.<br><br>And as for the Queens of Caldecott? Fann Wong beat Zoe Tay, with with nine votes to one.<br><br>1: AISHWARYA RAI<br>Number of votes: 60<br><br>No stranger to the beautiful women rankings, this ravishing beauty was Miss World in 1994 before becoming a Bollywood A-lister with movies like Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and Devdas. The 32-year-old actress has also appeared in Hollywood productions like Bride And Prejudice and Mistress Of Spices.<br><br>'Aishwarya's name has somehow become synonymous with the word beautiful. Her features are also very striking because of her sharp nose and greenish eyes.'<br>- Nur Aqilah Tahir, 25, administrative officer<br><br>2: GONG LI<br>Number of votes: 43<br><br>After forging a career in critically-acclaimed Chinese movies like Farewell My Concubine and Red Sorghum, Gong Li, 40, is now inching her way into Hollywood conciousness.<br><br>She tantalised Western audiences in Memoirs Of A Geisha, and will romance Colin Farrell in Miami Vice, which opens in Singapore later this month.<br><br>'There are other Asian actresses in Hollywood but the majority of them are of mixed-blood. So when you compare Gong Li to them, she definitely stands out because she is 100 per cent Asian.'<br>- Aaron Tang, 39, businessman<br><br>3: MAGGIE Q<br>Number of votes: 38<br><br>Maggie Denise Quigley, 27, started with an under-the-radar career in Hong Kong movies like Gen-Y Cops and Naked Weapon. Then this year, the Vietnamese and Irish-American actress nabbed a plum role in Tom Cruise's Mission: Impossible III and has become next big Asian babe in Hollywood.<br><br>'She may not be as busty or as tall as the Caucasian models and actresses but I think she is capable of turning heads in Hollywood.'<br>- Chen Hui Ling, 19, student<br><br>4: AYUMI HAMASAKI<br>Number of votes: 35<br><br>The Empress of J-Pop burst onto the music scene in 1998 and catapulted to No. 1 with her hit album Love-Destiny. The 27-year-old popster and former model is also hailed as a fashion icon, with teenaged Japanese girls emulating her sexy, spunky style.<br><br>'Ayumi has the perfect Japanese look and she always manages to look sexy on all her album covers and her pictures.'<br>- Joanna Teo, 26, civil servant<br><br>5: ZHANG ZIYI<br>Number of votes: 31<br><br>Thanks to 2000's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and last year's Memoirs Of A Geisha, Zhang Ziyi has been one of the few China-born actresses to break into the Hollywood market. The 27-year-old beauty, who was nominated for a Golden Globe award for Memoirs, plays an empress in the upcoming The Banquet.<br><br>6: KURARA CHIBANA<br>Number of votes: 27<br><br>Better known as Miss Japan 2006, Kurara Chibana wowed the world when she came in second in last month's Miss Universe contest in the US.<br><br>The 24-year-old reporter was dubbed the 'Miss Universe in ninja high heels' for the eye-popping samurai warrior outfit she wore during the national costume category.<br><br>7: KELLY HU<br>Number of votes: 26<br><br>Hawaiian-born actress Kelly Hu, 38, got her big break opposite Sammo Hung in late-90s TV series Martial Law. The former Miss Teen USA, who has Chinese-Filipino-Hawaiian-English blood, then steamed up the screen opposite The Rock in The Scorpion King and clashed claws with Hugh Jackman in X-Men 2.<br><br>'I found her sexy when I saw her movies X-Men 2 and Cradle 2 The Grave and she was kicking butt. A girl who can fight the way she does is certainly hot.'<br>- Mahesh Singh, 31, general manager<br><br>8: SHU QI<br>Number of votes: 24<br><br>Taiwan-born Shu Qi started out as a model and soft porn actress before hitting Hong Kong screens in movies like So Close and A Man Called Hero.<br><br>She almost nabbed a role in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon but ended up settling for a part opposite Jason Statham in the action flick The Transporter.<br><br>9: SITI NURHALIZA<br>Number of votes: 23<br><br>Malaysia's undisputed Princess of Pop made headlines last month when she married Datuk Khalid Mohamed Jiwa, a man 20 years her senior. The 27-year-old has sold millions in albums in the region and performed at London's Royal Albert Hall last year.<br><br>'She has got this wholesome look about her. She is very sweet and pleasant looking. She also has got a nice smile.'<br>- Salma Bee, 41, housewife<br><br>10: LUCY LIU<br>Number of votes: 22<br><br>Lucy Liu catapulted to fame when she appeared as the icy Ling Woo on TV series Ally McBeal.
