Her ebullience and zest for life won her even more fans as she crossed over to Bollywood and became India's most prized Jewel.Though initially she made a couple of movies which bombed at the box office, she's became  most sought after actress in India today.<br><img src="http://php.scripts.psu.edu/dept/history/images/photos/faculty/Sen.jpg"><br><span class="large"><strong>SUSHMITA SEN</strong></span><br>She is the first Indian model to win a Miss Universe Title in the early 90s.A leggy Delhi belle with the most compelling personality, towered over 76 other beauties in the most viewed and talked-about international pageant in 1994.She brought to her duties as ambassador of beauty and purpose an irresistibly cheeky grin and a now well schooling led sense of etiquette.Her decision to join movies was well accepted and Bollywood welcomed her with open arms<br><img src="http://www.despardes.com/pakistan/newsbriefs/2006/mirza-aslam-baig.jpg"><br><span class="large"><strong>DIYA MIRZA</strong></span><br>Her confidence belies her status in the industry.

The films was also dubbed into English and other languages. The movie stars Ajith,Mammootty,Aishwarya Rai and Tabu. The film is a contemporary Indian take on Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility.<br>Kandukondain Kandukondain,directed by Rajiv Menon, comes across as a refreshing change from the formulaic films churned out by Bollywood week after week. The film, a major improvement over his previous film Sapnay, looks at the trials and tribulations of a family consisting of a mother and three daughters and about the men who walk into the lives of the elder two girls of marriageable age. In a cruel interplay of destiny and betrayal, the family stripped of their house and belongings sets out to the city to build a new life. How they eventually find success and love and learn to live a life of dignity is what the film is all about.<br><img src="http://www.rai-reiten.de/Ausritte/ausritt_bild3.jpg"><img src="http://www.rai-reiten.de/Ausbildung/ausbildung_bild1.jpg"><br>Music for the film is composed by A.R. Rahman and the movie is said to have the most unique sound of his to date in the millenium. He has undoubtedly infused a whole new different sound in this one.<br>A.R.Rahman's music score for this film fetched audio rights worth Rs2.2+ crores. This record still remains unbeaten as the film audio market has gone into recession since 2000.The music by A.R. Rahman goes a little innovative on his usual heavy use of synthetic sounds and a lot of it is, in fact, based on ragas of Carnatic music<br><img src="http://www.reitferien.de/deutschland/sy01.jpg"><br>The film works quite well even if some of the problems faced by the characters and their solutions appear a little too pat and predictable like Tabu solving the computer programming glitch in the office and immediately being promoted. The contrast between the two elder sisters - the elder one (Tabu) sober and cautious, the younger one (Aishwarya) vivacious and passionate is well brought out and the unique bond they share among themselves is truly heartwarming. However the narrative flow of the film could have been smoother. At times the story follows the travails of one sister for far too long before suddenly coming back to the other. Also, the faithful servant who follows the family to the city is never established earlier so her decision to do so comes more as a bolt out of the blue.<br><br>The film is aided by two strong central performances by Tabu and Aishwarya Rai and they are more than ably supported by Mammooty (who is as usual outstanding), Ajith and Abbas though admittedly the latter is handicapped by a sketchily underwritten role. His flamboyance and sweeping Aishwarya off her feet doesn't quite come off.<br><br>The film is well shot by Ravi K. Chandran with an appreciable aesthetic sensibility and visual sense barring a couple of tacky special effects as in Tabu's flat with the fireworks in the background. . Among the songs, Aishwarya's song in the village fields stands out for its innovative picturisation.<br><br>A couple of technical flourishes stand out like the lead into Aishwarya's first song and the cut from the train to the tracks in Egypt to the song between Tabu and Ajith.<br><br>What is interesting is that instead of dubbing the film in another language, the makers have had the film subtitled in English. According to Rajiv Menon this helps the film retain its 'very Tamil' flavour yet be understood perfectly by outside viewers. Also since the film is a story of relationships and focuses on performances with lots of close-ups, dubbing into another language and mismatched dialogues would take away from the film. Though the subtitles work well and the film is enjoying a good run at the box office, albeit in a limited release, this restricts the audience to a minority who would understand and appreciate a good effort like this.<br><br>Menon acknowledges the role of Sringar Films who picked up the film and hoped this would start a new trend like Hyderabad Blues did. One could thus break down language barriers while retaining the authentic flavour of the original film. And after all, isn't Cinema a universal medium?<img src="http://www.scultura-italiana.com/Galleria/Messina%20Francesco/images/Messina%20-%20Cavallo%20morente%20(Roma,%20Palazzo%20della%20Rai,%201966).jpg"></div>

THink she was younger than . Taal was in 1999. TAAL PICS:<br><img src="http://www.rediff.com/entertai/1999/aug/13tal7.jpg"><br><br>actually some of these bollywood storylines are pretty good and i really LOVE their songs (most of them). they have the good sound in them.<br><br>The music for the Bollywood movies are very good, I TAAL really got very good music in it. must say! The instruments and vocals they used... hypnotic!<br>State of the ART sound. Awesome.<br><br>And frankly, other than Lot of The Ring, and Cave of The Golden Rose and some other wonderful movie soundtracks, I haven't really found any movies with music as amazing as the Bollywood movies especially TAAL.<br><br><img src></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.indolink.net/PB/images/taal.jpg"><br>"Taal" is a mega musical  starring Aishwarya Rai RELEASED IN 1999 by techy Indian composer A.R.RAHMAN . Anyone who has heard the music is raving about it to the skies. A lethal combination of technology, sound, notes and instruments brings about some rich and superhit music for the music lovers. . Taal's sound is based on an ingenious fusion of electronic beats and breaks with an audaciously original arrangement for symphony orchestra<br>Taal is a celebration MUSIC AT ITS BEST<br>The added dimension to the music are the computerised sound effects using fully state of the art sound technology.The best Bollywood music today uses multitrack engineering and sophisticated arrangements that can hold their own with the slickest hits at the top of the Western pop charts<br>Each of the songs in the album oozes so much rich sounds  it awes the world and sold a record number of copies abroad as well.<br>Taal was in the making since 1995 and the prehype with the rise of the internet, generated considerable exposure to the project.Taal was originally conceived by AR Rahman to be a mainstream commercial music project, but production went back to the drawing boards to be a mainstream and broadway musical hybrid....Hence, its supposed release date got delayed as  the soundtrack was originally slated to release in 1997.<br><br>However, everyone else who'd heard the music of Taal even before the sondtrack released, was saying that Rahman is at his best in Taal, and has reached the pinnacle in his career since his debut in 1992.<br>That's the charisma of 'Taal''s music. AR Rahman and his TAAL created music so melodious, so lyrical that it will be a milestone for decades to come.<br>It will be ranked among the great musical scores.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you watched her TAAL movie, in which she plays this villager in which she was talent discovered and grew to become a singing pop sensation, you'll be exposed to the most pretty sides of her. THink she was younger than . Taal was in 1999. TAAL PICS:<br><br><img src="http://www.millikin.edu/Music/images/Rai.JPG"><br><br>actually some of these bollywood storylines are pretty good and i really LOVE their songs (most of them). they have the good sound in them.<br><br>The music for the Bollywood movies are very good, I TAAL really got very good music in it. must say! The instruments and vocals they used... hypnotic!<br>State of the ART sound. Awesome.<br><br>And frankly, other than Lot of The Ring, and Cave of The Golden Rose and some other wonderful movie soundtracks, I haven't really found any movies with music as amazing as the Bollywood movies especially TAAL.<br><br><img src="http://www.societacivile.it/img/copertina/rai.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[b]<img src="http://img.2dehands.nl/f/normal/13022285.jpg"><br>"Taal" is a mega musical  starring Aishwarya Rai RELEASED IN 1999 by techy Indian composer A.R.RAHMAN . Anyone who has heard the music is raving about it to the skies. A lethal combination of technology, sound, notes and instruments brings about some rich and superhit music for the music lovers. . Taal's sound is based on an ingenious fusion of electronic beats and breaks with an audaciously original arrangement for symphony orchestra<br>Taal is a celebration MUSIC AT ITS BEST<br>The added dimension to the music are the computerised sound effects using fully state of the art sound technology.The best Bollywood music today uses multitrack engineering and sophisticated arrangements that can hold their own with the slickest hits at the top of the Western pop charts<br>Each of the songs in the album oozes so much rich sounds  it awes the world and sold a record number of copies abroad as well.<br>Taal was in the making since 1995 and the prehype with the rise of the internet, generated considerable exposure to the project.Taal was originally conceived by AR Rahman to be a mainstream commercial music project, but production went back to the drawing boards to be a mainstream and broadway musical hybrid....Hence, its supposed release date got delayed as  the soundtrack was originally slated to release in 1997.<br><br>However, everyone else who'd heard the music of Taal even before the sondtrack released, was saying that Rahman is at his best in Taal, and has reached the pinnacle in his career since his debut in 1992.<br>That's the charisma of 'Taal''s music. AR Rahman and his TAAL created music so melodious, so lyrical that it will be a milestone for decades to come.<br>It will be ranked among the great musical scores.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I *personally* feel Ms Japan is a poor representative of an Asian country.  Her smile does not look natural.. it takes on a very painful look.  A case of bad botox?  Her face greatly lacks symmetry - her left eye is very visibly smaller than the right one.<br><br>I'd vote Gong Li for no 1 spot for these reasons :<br><br>1 - She has class, poise and smarts.. she carries herself like the Asian equivalent of Audrey Hepburn.. and the way she turns gives her movie roles a 3D depth speaks volumes of her intelligence.  Hollywood critics were amazed at how she outclassed the main female lead when she played Hatsumomo in "Memoirs of a Geisha".<br><br>2 - Dark asian features set on flawless Porcelain skin - makes her look exquisite, radiant and youthful.  Like a pearl of the orient.  She stands out from the other beauties sporting fake tans.

She seems to age gracefully. Her porcelain silky smooth complexion and volumptious figure are her best features. Too bad, she's not up to my liking.<br><br>As for Miss Japan, I think Kurara Chibana is one of the best-looking Japanese I've seen so far. Okay maybe her face is not perfect, she has a slightly bigger eye than the other but she still looks like a beauty.<br><br>I don't assume she had botox plus there's not confirmation report on it. But I think her smile is beautiful.<br><br>But what I like most about her is that she had put up her best behaviour during the pageant. Her poise was elegant. She could speak 4 languanges: english, japanese, spanish and french and that's pretty amazing. (considering she's still in her 20s).<br><br>Her answers to the final question was up to standards but unfortunately, her intepreter missed some points from her. That cost her defeat to become Miss Universe but no matter what, she has done her best and she accepted it gracefully.<br><br></div>

The film that stars Aishwarya Rai in lead seems to be inspired by the 1981 hit with same title. The original Umrao Jaan which had Rekha play the role of a singer/ dancer who sells her body was mainly an Urdu film. The film had a 'Nawabi' touch which also seems to be the case in this Aishwarya Rai starrer. J.P. Dutta however claims that the film isn't a remake of the old Umrao Jaan but is based on the story which was written long back by his father O.P. Dutta.. For the 2006 film with the same title and subject directed by J.P. Dutta starring Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan, see Umrao Jaan (2006 film</div>
