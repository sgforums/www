Her ebullience and zest for life won her even more fans as she crossed over to Bollywood and became India's most prized Jewel.Though initially she made a couple of movies which bombed at the box office, she's became  most sought after actress in India today.<br><img src="http://bollywood.allindiansite.com/g/img/2005103001.jpg"><br><span class="large"><strong>SUSHMITA SEN</strong></span><br>She is the first Indian model to win a Miss Universe Title in the early 90s.A leggy Delhi belle with the most compelling personality, towered over 76 other beauties in the most viewed and talked-about international pageant in 1994.She brought to her duties as ambassador of beauty and purpose an irresistibly cheeky grin and a now well schooling led sense of etiquette.Her decision to join movies was well accepted and Bollywood welcomed her with open arms<br><img src="http://www.diamirza.com/gallery/cache/Dia%20Mirza/Dia%20in%20Deewanapan_640.jpg"><br><span class="large"><strong>DIYA MIRZA</strong></span><br>Her confidence belies her status in the industry.

She is the second Indian contestant to be crowned Miss Asia Pacific and the first in 29 years.Her first film, did not make a big splash.

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://img210.imageshack.us/img210/5151/aish276jr.jpg"><br><br><strong>Kandukondain Kandukondain</strong> <span style="font-style: italic;">(also known as I Have Seen it in English)</span> is a 2000 Tamil film directed by Rajiv Menon. The films was also dubbed into English and other languages. The movie stars Ajith,Mammootty,Aishwarya Rai and Tabu. The film is a contemporary Indian take on Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility.<br>Kandukondain Kandukondain,directed by Rajiv Menon, comes across as a refreshing change from the formulaic films churned out by Bollywood week after week. The film, a major improvement over his previous film Sapnay, looks at the trials and tribulations of a family consisting of a mother and three daughters and about the men who walk into the lives of the elder two girls of marriageable age. In a cruel interplay of destiny and betrayal, the family stripped of their house and belongings sets out to the city to build a new life. How they eventually find success and love and learn to live a life of dignity is what the film is all about.<br><img src="http://img210.imageshack.us/img210/9425/aish171lh.jpg"><br>Music for the film is composed by A.R. Rahman and the movie is said to have the most unique sound of his to date in the millenium. He has undoubtedly infused a whole new different sound in this one.<br>A.R.Rahman's music score for this film fetched audio rights worth Rs2.2+ crores. This record still remains unbeaten as the film audio market has gone into recession since 2000.The music by A.R. Rahman goes a little innovative on his usual heavy use of synthetic sounds and a lot of it is, in fact, based on ragas of Carnatic music<br><img src="http://img205.imageshack.us/img205/73/aish180wk.jpg"><br>The film works quite well even if some of the problems faced by the characters and their solutions appear a little too pat and predictable like Tabu solving the computer programming glitch in the office and immediately being promoted. The contrast between the two elder sisters - the elder one (Tabu) sober and cautious, the younger one (Aishwarya) vivacious and passionate is well brought out and the unique bond they share among themselves is truly heartwarming. However the narrative flow of the film could have been smoother. At times the story follows the travails of one sister for far too long before suddenly coming back to the other. Also, the faithful servant who follows the family to the city is never established earlier so her decision to do so comes more as a bolt out of the blue.<br><br>The film is aided by two strong central performances by Tabu and Aishwarya Rai and they are more than ably supported by Mammooty (who is as usual outstanding), Ajith and Abbas though admittedly the latter is handicapped by a sketchily underwritten role. His flamboyance and sweeping Aishwarya off her feet doesn't quite come off.<br><br>The film is well shot by Ravi K. Chandran with an appreciable aesthetic sensibility and visual sense barring a couple of tacky special effects as in Tabu's flat with the fireworks in the background. . Among the songs, Aishwarya's song in the village fields stands out for its innovative picturisation.<br><br>A couple of technical flourishes stand out like the lead into Aishwarya's first song and the cut from the train to the tracks in Egypt to the song between Tabu and Ajith.<br><br>What is interesting is that instead of dubbing the film in another language, the makers have had the film subtitled in English. According to Rajiv Menon this helps the film retain its 'very Tamil' flavour yet be understood perfectly by outside viewers. Also since the film is a story of relationships and focuses on performances with lots of close-ups, dubbing into another language and mismatched dialogues would take away from the film. Though the subtitles work well and the film is enjoying a good run at the box office, albeit in a limited release, this restricts the audience to a minority who would understand and appreciate a good effort like this.<br><br>Menon acknowledges the role of Sringar Films who picked up the film and hoped this would start a new trend like Hyderabad Blues did. One could thus break down language barriers while retaining the authentic flavour of the original film. And after all, isn't Cinema a universal medium?<br><br></div>
