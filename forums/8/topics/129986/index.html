            <div class='col-md body'>My ex-manager was a good friend but a very bad boss. She joined the company slightly later than me but I have no idea why she became a manager when both of us did not have the relevant certs. Her husband is very loaded and earning a 5 digit salary and they each have their own cars.<br><br>She brings me clubbing when I got to know her and I tot she was a good person. She wear branded stuff head to toe and is very rich. She brings me to boutiques and teaches me all about branded stuff.<br><br>But slowly she started giving work, which is under her scope.<br>She told me that she is pushing me for promotion and wanted to expose me to managerial work.<br><br>But I found out that she only made use of me to do her work. She modified the work I did for her to look like it was her work. I got no credit. In the end I could not complete my own work well and my boss's boss chide me and praise her. As a result my ex-manger got a pay raise.<br>My ex-manager flirts very well and tells me that I have to flirt with my bosses to get into their good books for promotion.<br>I am not ready to degrade myself.<br><br>Then I found out later my ex-manager was having an affair with her boss. I noticed it when they were having the same watch and handphone, which was expensive stuff. Her boss comes down from HQ to visit her often...too often. They went out often after our overtime at night and my ex-manager will come in late the next morning. I was asked to cover her whenever she is absent for work.<br><br>Then in the midst of all the frustration, there was a turn of events.<br><br>My ex-manager got pregnant. She insist on an abortion and not let her husband know. She cited her career shd come first. I duuno what she is talking about when she already have two kids who are always with her mother and the husband and her never worry about their children.<br><br>She goes for abortion. She even asked me to introduce a gynae &amp; appointment as she dun wanna let her gynae know, who may alert her husband. I cover her while she was on MC. Then the following week after MC, she told me that she is going on a holiday in Indonesia. I told she was going with her husband but the husband was going overseas for business trip. She book the tour in between her husband's trip. She says she is going with her friends.<br><br>When she flew, I thought her boss will come to monitor me, as the boss felt that I am incompetent (Thanks to my ex-manager whom I covered). But he did not appear at all. I called and found that he too had taken leave, same days as my ex-manager, and also to Indonesia. I then knew, who is responsible for my ex-manager latest pregnancy.<br><br>Now that I am transferring, my ex-manager insist that I am not allowed to hand over any of my work which she asked me to do. She ia very afarid I will give her what she asked m to do. Her boss insist I do a declaration of my work before I leave, which was never done before by any previous staff.<br><br>In the midst of anger, a thought came up. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Sent an anonymous letter to my ex-manager's husband and tell him the affair. My ex-manager will be screwed for good. She will get hell from her husband. If it blows big, the company knows and both her and her boss will be the talk of the town. Both will get into hot soup.<br><br>I know it could be cruel, but this is the only payback time. Both could gang up against me again as we are still in the same company, and they suspect that I knew what is happening between them.<br><br>Should I or should I not? Someone guide me, pls.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, I know how it feels to be sabotaged, backstabbed, shot down. It sucks. But hey, most people experience this at one time or another.<br><br>From my own experience, my humble opinion is this: Since you are already transferring, I feel it's better to put all that in the past. Because if you take steps to blow up the matter, it would not look good for you as well. Besides all the trouble of a company investigation, I would be more concerned about what your new bosses and colleagues think of you when they learn of this. Would they think you are untrustworthy, a trouble maker, someone who spends more time setting people up than actually doing your work? Unless you plan to leave the company, this is the immediate baggage you'll carry into your new position. I don't think it's a good start. It's better to treat this as a new beginning, and carry on with your life.<br><br>Anyway, your ex-boss has created alot of trouble for herself already. So caught up in the rat race that she's willing to sacrifice her dignity and integrity... well, she sucks.</div>
