            <div class='col-md body'>which was ur fav character?<br><br>i have NEVER played paladins and barbarians coz their skills are damn ultra boring. Especially paladin auras, oni can on one at a time, den obviously everyone will go for the thorns, is like they create the other auras for nothing.<br><br>i think assasin was very well created, i had alot of fun with this char and it really is one of the best assasin representations amongst all the games i've played.<br><br>druid was fun too, but den when u reach duriel.......nabe fukkin hell mus die 100 times before can kill lol. Hurricane is a fukkin jian banana skill, totally owns mobs, jus on it and run thruout the map haha so shiok.<br><br>necro is very fun, but i once tried to play PURE summoner, lol fuk man reach duriel totally cannot make it.<br><br>amazon....once was interesting...but den sian liao<br><br>its a close call between necro and sorc, but i think my fav is sorc! even if u choose to do a pure fire/lightning/ice skill tree, u still can survive. I used to think lightning skills sucks coz the base dmg always start from 1. But WOW MAN lightning/chain lightning totally owns mobs!!!! I din try b4 until now haha abit too late =/. Firewall is too overpowered in my opinion  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>ok i think i better go back to sleep lol  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Basically, the TP was to head home to get some skellies from outside of town. Iron Maiden + Iron or Blood or Fire golem. So it was more of an endurance battle. And of course the occasional lame bone spear from my wand.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Anyway you are using necro and you shouldn't even get up close enough for him to use the lightning.</div>

Skeleton mages are better - but I only use them as support fire.<br><br>Anyway, your main focus should be the golems. Pump points into golem mastery if you can spare them.</div>
