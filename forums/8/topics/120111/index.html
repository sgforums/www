            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Has anyone heard of Affiliated marketing? A business relationship with a merchant or other service provider who allows you to link to that business. When a visitor clicks on the link at your site and subsequently makes a purchase from the merchant, you receive a commission based on the amount of the sale, a referral fee or a pay-for-click fee.<br>THink this isn't that huge in Singapore. But I heard from my Friends in US, that this is one of the fastest way to earn cash by doing affiliated marketing. Any comments?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there!!<br><br>The more commonly used terminology is actually "affiliate marketing".<br><br>It is indeed the new "trend" these days, and yes it is very popular in USA, and here in Canada it's started to gain some popularity as well.<br>Let me emphasize this from the beginning: there's actually no way you can make money quickly. Anything worthwhile will take some commitment, dedication, perseverance, and the proper knowledge.<br><br>There are a lot of ways by which you can get involved in affiliate marketing. One of the most common ways is to build up some affiliate websites that are content rich, specifically optimized for the search engines. The single, most prominent search engine nowadays would be Google.com undoubtedly, and if you do wish to take the plunge and get involved in affiliate marketing, this is the search engine that you should put all of your focus on.<br>So, the purpose of having content-rich sites is simply because Google likes it. In the old days, all people did was simply they put a bunch of affiliate links, throw out some important keywords, make them invisible (i.e: making the text colour identical with the background colour), and boom, money would start coming in!<br><br>Nowadays, those tricks won't work at all, as Google constantly improves its algorithms. It simply gets more and more intelligent.<br>Of course, not only should you put worthwhile contents on your website, but if you also wish to make money, you should sign up for some affiliate program, write up some endorsement about it, and hopefully people will make a purchase from your website.<br>A common practice these days is putting what's called the Google AdSense on your website.<br>If you do a search at Google, you'll notice that on the right hand side are some ads. Those are actually ads that people pay to get promotion noticed. They're called Google AdWords. Google AdSense is essentially similar to Google AdWords, except that you put them in your website and get some commission everytime people click on any of the ads.<br>The ads themselves are displayed completely automatically, so you don't have to decide which ads to put. What I mean by this is that Google ha sa sophisticated algorithm which allows you to just type your contents, and from there it'll put the appropriate ads. All you have to do is simply paste some HTML code.<br>I've heard about so many people who have greats results with Google AdSense. I believe, that as long as you are willing to take the time to write useful articles and take time to maintain your site, the money will follow.<br><br>Another common practice is to make some money from the Google AdWords. I could write pages if I were to explain every little detail about it, but to put it simply: you find some merchants, then sign up for their affiliate program (usually free), sign up for Google AdWords, start bidding for some keywords, write your ads, and if people purchase from your link, then you get the commission; simple as that. When done properly, this approach can generate you money in as little as one day, but if you're not trained to do this properly, it will cost you a fortune, so be careful.<br><br>The first approach that  I mentioned (building some content-rich websites) takes more of your time since you'll be writing lots of articles. In addition to that, it'll also take between 1 to 4 months for the search engines to index your webpage, so you can't expect to make money quickly. Its advantage, however, is that, provided you design your website carefully, it should constantly make you money and stay that way for a considerably long period of time.<br><br>Go to forums, sign up for free newsletters, ask people about this, and soon you'll see how worthwhile this is. My favourite Affiliate Marketer is this Australian gentleman named Phil Wiley. I always go to his discussion forum and read all the posts there, since they're all mostly about affiliate marketing, and I find them very educational. The link to his website is<br><br>You should also learn how to properly optimize your websites. For that, without doubt I can recommend you Dr. Andy Williams<br>Just sign up for his free newsletter and download his free reports (and yes, they CAN help you make money!)<br><br>Another useful resource would be James Martell's "Affiliate Marketer's Handbook" ==&gt;&gt;<br>This one is not free; it actually costs $US 167 but it's really worth it. This is actually an ebook which literally describes you the step by step process to create affiliate websites. Many people have created really nice income stream after applying the techniques described in this ebook, and some even became financially free.<br><br>I think that's all for today. I hope this'll enlighten you!</div>

So we can't complain that we do not have business to do venture out in Singapore. Because we don't even broaden our prespective.
