            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Straits Times - Tuesday, July 16, 2002<br>Slim 10 Lawsuit - Actor named as fifth defendant</strong><br><br>Mediacorp actor Rayson Tan is being sued by his colleague Andrea De Cruz in connection with the weight-loss pill Slim 10 which was found to contain banned substances.<br><br>Rayson Tan Tai Ming has been named as a fifth defendant in the Slim 10 lawsuit. De Cruz's lawyers yesterday obtained an order from the High Court to include Tan in the civil action over the diet-pill product. He is the husband of actress Chen Liping, the poster girl in advertisements for the Slim 10 pill when it was launched here last December. De Cruz's lawyers declined to say why Tan has been brought in as a defendant. Mr Tan's lawyer, Mr Lawrence Lee, also would not comment on the case as he said the matter was ongoing.<br><br>At yesterday's hearing, lawyers Raj Singam and Wendell Wong informed the Assistant Registrar that they would be applying for leave to serve the writ on the manufacturer, Yuzhitang Health Products, which is based in Guangdong, China. The three others being sued are the importer of Slim 10, Health Biz; its president and director Semon Liu, 32; and distributor TV Media.<br><br>De Cruz, 27, suffered liver failure after taking Slim 10. Her boyfriend Pierre Png, 28, donated part of his liver to her in May, saving her life.<br><br>The television artiste is seeking damages for injuries and for her liver-transplant operation, which was the first such transplant from a living non-related donor here. Meanwhile, more criminal charges are expected to be filed against TV Media when its police summons case comes up for mention in the Subordinate Courts today.<br><br>It already faces three charges of selling the weight-loss pill to other retailers without a licence. Health Biz and Liu have also been charged in court. The company and Liu each face 17 similar charges, including not keeping proper import records. Liu is accused of selling 28,969 bottles of allegedly tainted pills to TV Media between December last year and March this year. The Health Sciences Authority ordered that the pills be pulled off the shelves in mid-April as they were found to contain fenfluramine, a banned substance known to cause swelling of the thyroid gland, heart-valve disorders and, recently, liver toxicity.<br><br>At the time when Rayson intro the drug to her, there were no documented proof of the dangerous side effects. That in a sense is not an offence if he endorse it. This is providing he really do not know of the side effect. Furthermore, his wife was taking it also and we all know that Chen Liping is really fat.<br><br>It is because of Andrea's own vanity that nearly killed her.<br><br>She should be out there speaking to the public about the dangers of trying untested slimming drugs or procedures without first consulting their own doctors.<br><br>The slimming/beauty centresÂ’ or pharmaceuticals companiesÂ’ main priority is to get people to use their products. Personally I do not think they would look deep into your medical history in order to ascertain the suitability of the programs/drugs they can put you on.<br><br>If one wants to pay a low price to slim downÂ… one better do one's homework. Because the choice is yours, your life is yours to waste.<br></div>

I mean put yourself into Rayson Tan shoes, do you think you deserve to be sue, he might just told her to try slim10... that is nothing wrong, just like i ask you to try m&amp;m new flavour... if something happen to you, will you sue me... what your take?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i don't know what to think, but to a certain extent the people who got affected by this slim10 thing, to a certain extent deserved it. first they were greedy and ate too much, then became overly vain and wanted to slim down, but were lazy about it and instead of exercising and adopting a healthy diet, tried to take the easy way out and eat slimming pills.<br><br>sure, the company selling the slim10 pills should be held responsible for putting a harmful product on the shelves, but the people who took the pills should also be responsible for their own actions. no one forced them to take the pills; they took the pills out of their own free (&amp; lazy) will.<br><br>also, these slim10 pills weren't a daily necessity such as milk, eggs, vegetables, etc, so i think that should make the people who took the pills even more accountable for their own actions.<br><br>come to think of it, the actions being taken against the slim10 company are fair and just, and the people responsible definitely deserve it, but in my opinion no compensation in any form whether monetary or not, should be doled out to the people involved. they should pay the price for their own actions.</div>
