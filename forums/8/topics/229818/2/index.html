            <div class='col-md body'>sure about 4 time when I am still young.the first time is when I step out of shower and it is raining heavier with loud thunder roaring.I was just moving my feet for the third step,when a freak bolt of lightning just miss the back of my feet by two cm or so.<br>the second time when I was swimming in kallang swimming pool during the lunar 7th month period,I was pull down by a cold hand under the water.but  it let go of me when I kicked heavily for my life.<br>the third time is when I cross the road absent minded,when a car came out of nowhere and nearly knock me down.<br>another strange but true incident but not life threathening one, I rubbed myright eye because it is very itchy,eveything is going fine when suddenly I felt something is wrong.TO my horror,when I open my right eye,I saw it becoming something like when you stir a hard-boiled eyes,it is in a mix of black and white with no sight of a normal.<br>In a panic state,I continue to rubbed even more,and all of a sudden,I felt a sensation of a rotation feeling in my right eye,it snapped back to normal.<br>Another timme is when I was happily jumping on a bed,I was caght onto the wire of some lighting or something like that,luckily the wire break loose under my body weight.But I was hang for ten seconds.<br>Can you imagine that,maybe I REALLY LUCKY.THANKS GOD!</div>
