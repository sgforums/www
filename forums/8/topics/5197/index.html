            <div class='col-md body'>Real/eternal love is often misinterpreted as love between a couple that will last for at least a life time.<br>That's wrong. In real love, the other's well-being is more important than yours, and as this world isn't prefect, you often find yourself stuck in a situation that you loved someone but that someone don't love you. Most would give up the other to save themselves from hurt, a few will get more hurt from regret that they gave up, the rest will realised that actually they didn't like the other enough to call it love.<br>There have been many cases where people settle for second best,(because of family pressure, peer pressure, age, financial problems, gratitude) and sometimes you wonder if that marriage is a transaction itself. And can you fault it? (especially when it's a case of survival?)<br><br>But if the love is so strong that the well-being of the other is all that matters, and you'll find yourself lending a helping hand to him/her regardless of whether he/she appreciates it or not.<br>If he/she also loves you in the same magnitude, it's a bonus.<br><br>People is often searching for true love, not knowing the true love is actually to be given to others by themselves.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bishamon...you give me too much vredit for what I am worth man...but thanks anyway...<br><br>Puppy love and real love....There is a difference but do I know what it is? nope...It encompasess so many examples of what puppy is and what is love...so I won't list them down...<br><br>True love is something that you grow into and you love the person for the person. Puppy love is an emotion that produces feelings similar to love but you love the idea of the person or a specific element of the person or personae of.  It's like if u have a crush on a teacher...we all know the difference that it is a crush and not real love...the same way we know it is puppy love and not real love.<br><br>We just know instinctively...noone really ever told us what crushes were or what puppy love is..at least noone told me...but we still know or at least many people know the difference without specifics.<br><br>and it's true that it can lead to true love also if you find that ur characters are a good match...etc etc...<br><br>but the puppy love will fade quite quickly and if reallove isn't there, then u won't want to be with the person anymore...period...<br><br>Just a short of it...It' such a big subject we couldn't do it here in just a few posts..<br><br>hope it helps a bit..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Puppy Love? Ah... this topic brings back memories when I did my School Exchange Program at Japan about 4-5 years ago.<br><br>This gal (I've forgotten her name as it was Damned Long!) invited me to stay at her home with her parents. Although their English was terrible (I mean REALLY), but somehow there was something that drew both of us together. She showed me around Okinawa and all those temples. Though I am not very superstitious, I do believe it was fate that brought us together.<br><br>But time passes really fast and soon I had to go back. She gave me a paper crane (plain white, but full of memories and Japanese words) which I did not threw it away until now. One thing, I couldn't dechiper those words as my Japanese was equally bad and could only speak smutters of that language - Broken Japanese, I would say.<br><br>We kept constant contact for a year or so before all letters between us stopped. Went to Japan for my meeting a few days ago and hopped over to Okinawa and it turned out that she'd shifted. Sigh... But I hope I've seen wrongly as I thought I saw her on one of those porno mags. Hope my eyes are playing tricks on me.<br><br>I didn't dare tell my current GF about this 'Overseas Puppy Love' as she would surely kill me.<br><br>Well, teenhood I've passed. Those crushes and puppy love stuff. Sigh, guess Puppy Love is one thing everyone would experience when they are passing teenhood.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's very difficult. Usually the only way is to go through difficult obstacles, or even a long period of time. My parents always tell me that my relationship might not last and I tell you it's a nightmare. Usually it is very difficult to distinguish, but the most effective method I've known is going through tough times together.<br>Even minor incompatibilities manifested in the lack of conversation is a test in itself.<br><br>Even then let's not forget this: that love can grow (or diminish). What may be puppy love now might end up as real love... you have to feel for yourself, what is your possible future with this or that person.</div>
