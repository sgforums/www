There was this famous doctor who worked wonders at that time (since it was TCM, herbs and such.) Cao cao had serious migraine, and summoned that doctor. the doc said something along the lines of " You got a tumour in ur head. i gonna operate on you and take the tumour out". But Cao cao thought the doc wanted to assasinate him and had him beheaded.<br><br>And another story from the chinese textbooks. Guan Gong kana shot by poisoned arrow in the arm. and i think that same doctor (not very sure) came and had to use a knife to scrape off the poison. No anaesthetic. And Guan Gong nv flinch, juz relac and play chinese chest. =D<br><br>All this coming from a guy who scored C6 in O lvl Chinese.. not bad?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </div></blockquote>ya but guan yu is probably jus enduring, maybe acting tough in front of him haha</div>

I am referring to the time near the end where Liu Chan stopped Zhuge Liang's and later Jiang Wei's plan to attack the Wei country so many times although Zhuge Liang is winning.... Somemore Liu Chan always stopped him becos of crappy reasons, for example the servant to Liu Chan says tat Zhuge Liang is going to rebel against him then he ordered Zhuge Liang to come back....

            <div class='col-md body'>Fav character Lu Xun aka Lu Boyan.<br><br>Main reason why Guan yu died is coz of Lu xun strategy to understand Guan yu weakness. He mentioned to Lu Meng..."No matter how great a person is, he still a human, every human has a weakness. Guan yu is too proud and arrogant......." This is the main root to guan yu's downfall as Lu Meng burnt the "Huo Feng Tai".<br><br>He aso the one tat owned Liu Bei's ass ....<br><br>Side info....San Guo Zhi which is the original novel is written by Chen Shou..who is from Shu kingdom at tat time. San Guo Yan Yi aka Romance of 3 kingdoms is written by Luo Guanzhong in Ming dynasty. He altered the main novel to make the whole thing more dramatic.

I used to like Ma Chao because of his spear of justice and wanting to slain cao cao for killing his father.<br><br>Now, I like Zhou yu aka mei zhou lang. Really like his quote " Ji shen yu, he shen liang?"<br><br>Btw, i think the most funny part when watching the drama is sima yi. He test liu chan if he is ambitious about over-throwing Wei. Although his advisor ask liu chan to 'act' and cry for the return of Shu. The dumb-a$$ liu chan told sima yi that it was the other guy told him to do. Upon seeing that, sima yi died laughing! Lol!! Really died of laughing and his son was appointed the next ruler.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>dude..tbhat is not sima yi...that is sima yi's son..and btw..he dun die laughing...if u remember correctly? his son is beside him? his son pour the wine for him..than after he drink le he die? ...it his son who poison..him</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I prefer Lu Bu Best. According to the novel, if i not wrong he is the best fighter. Took liu bei and his brother just to fight him.<br><br>Another one is of course kong ming. He stole all the limelight bcos he is one of the good guy. But what impress me is the ability to create a kingdom of their own with limited strength. He deserve to me one of my favourite.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
