'jiao wo fu tian xia ren, xiu jiao tian xia ren fu wo'</div></blockquote>I think cao cao is kinda ruthless. i remember in the secondary 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 texbk  (4got already lar  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> ) got 1 lesson. There was this famous doctor who worked wonders at that time (since it was TCM, herbs and such.) Cao cao had serious migraine, and summoned that doctor. the doc said something along the lines of " You got a tumour in ur head. i gonna operate on you and take the tumour out". But Cao cao thought the doc wanted to assasinate him and had him beheaded.<br><br>And another story from the chinese textbooks. Guan Gong kana shot by poisoned arrow in the arm. and i think that same doctor (not very sure) came and had to use a knife to scrape off the poison. No anaesthetic. And Guan Gong nv flinch, juz relac and play chinese chest. =D<br><br>All this coming from a guy who scored C6 in O lvl Chinese.. not bad?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
