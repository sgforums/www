              <p>English names got meaning one,  I quote from my 2 books here:</p>
              <p><strong>Alexandro  <span style="font-weight: normal;">(from spanish: Alejandro)</span><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">-From the Greek, meaning 'defending man'. Bestowed upon many saints, martyrs and kings, it has been a popular name for over 3,000 years.<br>-Greek name derived from the Greek <em>alexein</em> ('to defend') and <em>aner</em> ('man') and thus interpreted as meaning 'defender of men' that has been in widespread use among English, German, Dutch and Hebrew Speakers since the medieval period.<br>-Among the many diminutive forms of the name are ALEC, ALEX, SANDY and SASHA<br>-Variants in other languages include the Scottish ALASDAIR, the French ALEXANDRE, the Italian ALESSANDRO (and its shortened form SANDRO), the Spanish ALEJANDRO, the Polish ALEKSANDER, the Hungarian SANDOR and the Russian ALEKSANDR.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>André ,  Andy</strong>  (from: Andrew)<br>-From the Greek, meaning 'manly'<br>-English, Russian and Greek first name derived from the Greek Andreas, itself from the Greek <em>andreia</em> ('manliness') and thus interpreted as meaning 'manly' or 'brave'. It appears in the Bible as one of the apostles, subsequently venerated as St Andrew and adopted as the patron saint of Scotland, Greece and Russia - hence the name's particular popularity in those countries. It was established in regular use among English speakers by medieval times and has remained in currency ever since, with a recent peak in popularity in the 1960s and 1970s.<br>-The most common of the name's various diminutive forms is ANDY. Among less frequent familiar forms are ANDIE, ANDI and the Scottish DREW.<br>-Variants of the same name in other languages include the Scottish ANDRA, the French ANDRÉ, the German ANDREAS, the Dutch ANDRIES, the Spanish ANDRÉS, the Italian ANDREA, the Scandinavian ANDERS and the Russian ANDREI.</p>
              <p><strong>Alvin<br><span style="font-weight: normal;">-English first name descended from the Old English Aelfwine, itself derived from the Old English <em>aelf</em> ('elf') and <em>wine</em> ('friend').<br>-Commonly abbreviated to AL or ALVIE, ALWYN and AYLWIN are variants of the name.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Aaron<br><span style="font-weight: normal;">-From the Hebrew, meaning 'high mountain'.<br>-Biblical name of obscure origin, possibly Egyptian or else derived from the Hebrew Aharon, variously interpreted as meaning "bright' or 'high mountain'.<br>-Also encountered as AARAN or ARN.<br>-Other variants include the Arabic HAROUN or HARUN.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Adeline<span style="font-weight: normal;">   (from: Adela)</span><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">-French first name that developed as a variant of ADELA and has been in occasional use among English speakers since the 11th century. It came to England with the Normans, appearing in the 'Domesday Book' of 1086, and enjoyed a modest vogue towards the end of the 19th century, but is very rare today.<br>-ADDI, ADDY and ALINE are diminutive forms of the name.<br>-Variants in other languages include the Italian ADELINA.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Henry<br><span style="font-weight: normal;">-From the Old German, meaning 'home ruler'.<br>-English first name derived from the German HEINRICH, itself from the Old German HAIMIRICH - from <em>heim</em> ('house' or 'home') and <em>ric</em> ('ruler' or 'owner') and thus meaning 'house owner' or 'lord of the manor'. It was taken up by English speakers in the medieval period and became firmly established as a royal name, being borne by eight English monarchs - although HARRY was the more common form of the name in vernacular use before the 17th century. It was also a frequent choice of royal families elsewhere in Europe and as HENRI was borne by six kings of France. It became less frequent among English speakers in the 20th century, but enjoyed a revival in the 1990s partly in response to the name's reappearance in the royal family, as borne by Prince Henry (b.1984) - although it was announced at the time of his birth that he was to be known as Harry.<br>-As well as HARRY, other diminutive forms of the name include HANK and HAL.<br>-Variants in other languages include the German HEINRICH, the Italian ENRICO, the Spanish ENRIQUE, the Portuguese HENRIQUE, the Dutch and Scandinavian HENDRIK, the German and Scandinavian HENRIK and the Polish HENRYK.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Laurence<br><span style="font-weight: normal;">-From the Greek, meaning 'laurel'.<br>-English first name derived ultimately from the Latin Laurentius, which means 'man from Laurentum' (Laurentum being a town in Latium that probably took its name from 'laurel'). It was borne by a 3rd-century Roman saint who according to tradition was burnt to death on a gridiron.<br>-Also appearing (since the 16th century) as LAWRENCE, it was revived in the 19th century and became increasingly popular in the 20th century on both sides of the Atlantic.<br>-The usual shortened version of the name is LARRY (or LARRIE).<br>-Other abbreviated versions include LAURI, LAURIE, LAWRIE (or LORI) as well as LOREN, LORIN, LORRIN, LOL, LAZ and the Irish LANTY.<br>-Variants in other languages include the Irish Gaelic LABHRAS, the Scottish Gaelic LABHRAINN, the French LAURENT, the Italian LORENZO, the Spanish LORENCIO, the German LORENZ (shortened to LENZ), the Dutch LORENS and LAURENS, the Russian LAVRENTI, the Finnish LASSE (or LASSI) and the Scandinavian LARS.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Janice<span style="font-weight: normal;">   (from: Jane)</span><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">-English first name that evolved as a diminutive form of JANE. It may have made its first appearance with the publication of Paul Leicester Ford's novel <em>Janice Meredith</em> (1899) as was subsequently taken up by English speakers with some enthusiasm early in the 20th century. The name enjoyed a peak in popularity in the 1950s, but has since suffered a sharp decline and is now rarely encountered among the young.<br>-Commonly shorted to JAN.<br>-Also spelled JANIS.</span></strong></p>

              enjoyed a modest vogue towards the end of the 19th century, but is
              very rare today.<br> -ADDI, ADDY and ALINE are diminutive forms of the name.<br> -Variants in other languages include the Italian
              ADELINA.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Henry<br> <span style="font-weight: normal;">-From the Old German, meaning
              'home ruler'.<br> -English first name derived from the German HEINRICH, itself from
              the Old German HAIMIRICH - from <em>heim</em> ('house' or
              'home') and <em>ric</em> ('ruler' or 'owner') and thus meaning
              'house owner' or 'lord of the manor'. It was taken up by English
              speakers in the medieval period and became firmly established as a
              royal name, being borne by eight English monarchs - although HARRY
              was the more common form of the name in vernacular use before the
              17th century. It was also a frequent choice of royal families
              elsewhere in Europe and as HENRI was borne by six kings of France.
              It became less frequent among English speakers in the 20th century,
              but enjoyed a revival in the 1990s partly in response to the name's
              reappearance in the royal family, as borne by Prince Henry (b.1984)
              - although it was announced at the time of his birth that he was to
              be known as Harry.<br> -As well as HARRY, other diminutive forms of the name include HANK
              and HAL.<br> -Variants in other languages include the German HEINRICH, the
              Italian ENRICO, the Spanish ENRIQUE, the Portuguese HENRIQUE, the
              Dutch and Scandinavian HENDRIK, the German and Scandinavian HENRIK
              and the Polish HENRYK.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Laurence<br> <span style="font-weight: normal;">-From the Greek, meaning
              'laurel'.<br> -English first name derived ultimately from the Latin Laurentius,
              which means 'man from Laurentum' (Laurentum being a town in Latium
              that probably took its name from 'laurel'). It was borne by a
              3rd-century Roman saint who according to tradition was burnt to
              death on a gridiron.<br> -Also appearing (since the 16th century) as LAWRENCE, it was
              revived in the 19th century and became increasingly popular in the
              20th century on both sides of the Atlantic.<br> -The usual shortened version of the name is LARRY (or
              LARRIE).<br> -Other abbreviated versions include LAURI, LAURIE, LAWRIE (or LORI)
              as well as LOREN, LORIN, LORRIN, LOL, LAZ and the Irish
              LANTY.<br> -Variants in other languages include the Irish Gaelic LABHRAS, the
              Scottish Gaelic LABHRAINN, the French LAURENT, the Italian LORENZO,
              the Spanish LORENCIO, the German LORENZ (shortened to LENZ), the
              Dutch LORENS and LAURENS, the Russian LAVRENTI, the Finnish LASSE
              (or LASSI) and the Scandinavian LARS.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Janice<span style="font-weight: normal;">  
              (from: Jane)</span><br> <span style="font-weight: normal;">-English first name that evolved
              as a diminutive form of JANE. It may have made its first appearance
              with the publication of Paul Leicester Ford's novel <em>Janice
              Meredith</em> (1899) as was subsequently taken up by English
              speakers with some enthusiasm early in the 20th century. The name
              enjoyed a peak in popularity in the 1950s, but has since suffered a
              sharp decline and is now rarely encountered among the young.<br> -Commonly shorted to JAN.<br> -Also spelled JANIS.</span></strong></p>
