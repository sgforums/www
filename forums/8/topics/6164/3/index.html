            <div class='col-md body'>Well, colette,<br><br>What a wonderful imagery of yourself you painted when you are stranded in the island. However, there is an fundamental difference between hollywood and reality. For once, we don't live in a story where there is a nice MTV of "My heart will go on" because people don't say things like "if you jump, I jump.". I have repeated stressed that maturity includes the skill to fend for oneself and live independently. Let me repeat one more time, Maturity is a state of mind where a person learn to live independently and be sensible. Before I am going to start to sound like Jack Nicholson in "As good as it gets" on my views of women. I would not say all but some woman are just "When I think of some men, I take away reason and accountability."<br><br>I find the interpretation to my story very true. Frankly I did think of that possibility when I was being commented that I am aggressive. Unfortunately, that woman is definitely not the kind of woman I am looking for in my life. It was merely out of friendship. I am looking for someone who is mature enough to know what she is doing, and understand the ways of the world. It does not matter how intelligent she can be, as long as she can be understanding and sensitive to the feelings of other people. She is the example of a typical Singaporean woman whom all the guys are complaining about. I don't decline the irony of my situation in any light. Well, at least, I learned something from the process.<br><br>You have totally miss the point for this time, regarding finding a wife who can engage in intellectual discussions. I have used a similar analogy on the situation, that I am not condemning a woman who have no idea of worldly affairs, or don't know Shakespeare to any other authors in the world. Maturity is something which we should seek. Let me give you a thought, if you are immature, you are liable to get into a r/s and then leave that guy at the end of the day with another man without thinking of your commitment.<br><br>And regarding the theme of the post, obviously you do not like the subtlety of an issue dressed in a common day sense. Like the way, you commented that I should see beyond maturity and intellectual discussions, I clearly return the favour back to you, by telling you to look beyond the theme behind this post.<br><br>Yet still, behind all these discussions which possessed the potential to turn into personal attacks from the way it is going, I still wish that you would have a good day, and do take care.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>prodigal,<br><br>It has never been my intention to turn this discussion into a personal attack against you or anyone else. Obviously my views differ from yours, if not, I would have simply concurred with you. Don't read my posts as if I'm attacking you because I'm not, we're perfect strangers, so why would I want to do that? Er, I have enemies for that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> It's just that I disagree with some of your views and I hope that through this forum, I can air my views without fear that you may feel I'm attacking you or something. I'm not forcing you to accept my views, I'm  just sharing my perspective on the matter.<br><br>I was just surprised that most of the postings here seemed to define sg girls as being immature if we can't hold our own when discussing world affairs or if we were a little short on the housekeeping front, I find that too narrow a scope for defining maturity.<br><br>If you could refer to my first posting here, I wrote that maturity goes beyond that. Maturity usually comes with experience and I wrote that maturity would be the ability to treat people with fairness, kindness &amp; compassion at the appropriate moments. The ability to handle difficulties &amp; hardship with calm &amp; composure would also be signs of maturity. Ditto for dipolmacy, empathy &amp; tact. The list is endless.<br><br>My other point was that if you're looking for a wife, maturity is but one of the qualities you should be looking for, it's not the major deciding factor.<br><br>I wasn't being sarcastic when I wrote about the possible reason why the gal whom you invited several times for coffee finds you aggressive. Rejecting another person is no fun &amp; the more often I'm made to do it, I tend feel resentful that the other party cannot take the hint &amp; for making me feel bad &amp; guilty about the matter. As long as I don't like the guy as a potential boyfriend or if I have no wish to further the acquaintanceship, it doesn't matter to me whether the guy is inviting me purely out of friendship or even if I'm not his type, I just wouldn't want to go out with him alone. This is just my view, I can't comment on your situation as I do not have the facts. What I'm trying to explain here is one reason why sometimes gals keeping rejecting someone, rest assured that we don't feel good doing so.<br><br>Okay, I've got to rebut you again on that maturity will keep one committed to a relationship. That's so not true, if it were, the divorce rate wouldn't be climbing yearly. Nowadays, people leave for the most trival reasons. I can't think of all reasons but I can offer two. Some people leave when they find a better catch, some people leave when the feelings are not there anymore. Don't ask me why one day, they could be in love &amp; the next, they just don't love their partners anymore. However, I believe that prior to breaking up, they would have considered the pros &amp; cons and it also depends on how you define love. It is most fortunate that sg girls are given the chance for higher education &amp; as such, we have economic power, we no longer need to stay in a relationship for financial security if our partner has been unfaithful or abusive 'coz we can bring home the bacon too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Of course, some people's capacity to forgive &amp; their tolerance for their partners' behaviour are exceptional, so they may stay in the relationship &amp; try to work at it. In this instance, I can offer three reasons. Firstly, they love their partners very very much &amp; they would rather suffer than to be living without them because living without them would be a greater suffering &amp; they see that their partner is very sincere in changing their faults. Secondly, people stay together because of money which is pretty sad. Thirdly, some stay in a relationship because of their children. In the end, it is the maintenance of the relationship that ensure it's longevity, not just maturity.<br><br>And I don't like you taking potshots at me being not able to appreciate subtlety. Just imagine you're writing a thesis with this title &amp; you (we) end up discussing maturity, would you tell your professor that you're being subtle? I was just merely pointing out to you that you can't fault us if we thought this thread is about finding a wife, this was in response to your reply to twinkle when he asked about the topic title.<br><br>Again, here's wishing you a good weekend.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi colette,<br><br>Please do not get me wrong, because I am not going to turn the discussion into a personal attack. Well, your views have obviously been different from mine. But I think a mutual understanding of what each other are saying is important at least for a proper discussion to carry on.<br><br>In any case, I think that you are shielding away from the main issue here. If we do not agree that maturity is one of the factors which could contribute to Sg gals being myopic, spolit and clueless, then there is no case at all. You put up the argument that people break up these days for various reasons and I agree with some of them fundamentally, but it voices to one single point : irresponsibility. Irresponsibility is an anti trait against maturity, and hence people are not responsible for their own actions. People have no idea of what committment is all about in these days. I have no qualms against your argument in principle, but I think you have not properly clarify the issue or put forward a proper argument against my point, if maturity is not a criteria of judgement of the Sg gals, tell me what other possible criteria you have, since you have asked me to look beyond maturity. We can always argue all day here, condemning about the maturity of Sg women because it is primarily induced by our artificially created environment which turned people into demanding and materialistic people.<br><br>I don't think that I am taking any potshot on you by pointing out to you that you can use your reasoning to look beyond the subject. It is perfectly valid taken from your argument.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Genie, Worm and Firewire,<br><br>All of you make sweeping statements by thinking of SG women as a collective whole instead of individuals. Unless you come up with justification for your statements (and claiming that is your experience is not valid) or reveal a sequence of logic for your conclusion, they are very suspicious.<br><br>For example,<br>Genie: ALL S'poreans and NUS students are objects and only do what they are told? ALL? Have you met everyone in S'pore? What if I tell you I know of NUS friends who buck the trend? Also, the British students are not all navigators of their own destiny. Some of my Brit friends here are happy just to be in a good university and look forward to an automatic job offer. That is the sum total of their dreams. Its certainly not a case of West good/East bad.<br><br>Firewire: All SG women look at your wallet size? Hmm, so explain to me again why there are poor couples and poor families around?<br><br>Worm: You delude yourself if you think all women go through that kind of selection process.<br><br>cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi prodigal,<br><br>What can I say except that you seemed quite unlucky to be saddled with myocpic, spolit &amp; clueless sg gals as friends? hahaha<br><br>Anyway, I do agree that some sg gals are spolit, materalistic &amp; maybe a little clueless on the world affairs front but this is quite true for gals from other countries as well, it just seemed to me that you're a little predjuiced against us.<br><br>Personally, I would find talking with foreigners pretty fascinating 'coz I'm learning something from them about their countries &amp; cultures, whereas when we're talking to our own compatriots, it's not so fascinating 'coz we know same culture &amp; lingo.<br><br>I guess a lack of exposure could also be a cause, as far as I remember, not a lot of my friends are really keen on discussing current world affairs. That's why the assumption that seems to suggest here that when sg gals can't discuss world affairs equal a lack of maturity, well, that ticked me off.<br><br>I guess it depends on the crowd you mix with, some prefer to discuss 'cheem' topics while some prefer to discuss about things that affect their lives directly &amp; I guess most S'poreans are only interested in discussing topics that have a direct bearing in their lives. Some are willing to listen &amp; learn while others will try to brush you off whenever you introduce a topic which they don't find interesting, it would be up to you to get them interested. I don't mind listening in on a discussion that's 'cheem' (ie, out of my interest &amp; knowledge) &amp; hope to learn something from it but if the group that I join in is forever discussing 'cheem' stuff, one of two things will happen. One, I'll leave them &amp; join them once in a blue moon or two, they'll kick me out &amp; invite me only when they've no choice.<br><br>On being spolit, I'll admit I'm guilty of that - hey, I rather be spoilt by my family living in safe S'pore than learn to survive or be independent in war torn countries or countries with unrests, not that I'm not independent. On being materalistic, I guess that's almost universal in rapidly developing countries 'coz everyone is trying to keep up with the Jones {there's that 'face' factor}, what they get out of it, I haven't got a clue. That's one of the stress of living in S'pore, if you don't have the latest gadgets or keep up with the trends, you won't be part of the 'in' crowd, that's if you wanted to be part of it in the first place. As you're well aware, we S'poreans are known to be 'kiasu' among other not so pretty traits, so once the chase for materialism is on, it's hard not to join the bandwagon 'coz you'll start wondering if you're missing out on some things. It all depends on what you value most &amp; want out of life, most S'poreans aspire for the affluent lifestyle, perhaps that's why we appear more materialistic than most.<br><br>On your complaint that sg gals are myopic, again I would be guilty of that. I can't change the world &amp; I have no desire to do so. Thus, when a topic that has no relevance or immediate impact in my life or something which I know fully that no matter what one tries to do, it can't be changed, I do switch off. My logic is this: since it's going to be done &amp; I can't change it, just let it go or think of a way out. Why bother to rant &amp; rave &amp; upset myself when it's not going to help?<br><br>Now, a sense of responsibility &amp; accountability, these are what make up a person's character, to me, they don't fall under maturity. If they do, there won't be cases of adulteries &amp; what nots.<br><br>Human beings are governed by emotions, sometimes, one is seized by an emotion so strong that one'll do something totally wrong &amp; evil &amp; until one has experienced that kind of emotion, you'll never know what you're talking about, experience have taught me that. Sometimes when we are young, we are very confident that we will never fall into certain situations and during discussion with friends, we may expound on what we'll do or not do with absolute certainty but until that temptation stares at you in your face &amp; you're required to make a choice, you'll never know what you'll do. Thus, good upbringing &amp; strong moral character help.<br><br>On committment during courtship, yeah, this is a difficult one. We are so inculcated by the notion that we only live once &amp; our happiness is more important than others &amp; there are other 'fishes' in the ocean, relationships tend to be rather shaky whenever a better third party enters the picture. I think most people tend to make decisions based on how they feel - some value feelings more, eg: if they prefer to be wowed &amp; pampered &amp; the current parnter is lacking in this area, then there's a chance a gal may leave if she loves the 3rd party too. Some value money more, so if the 3rd party is stinking rich &amp; even if the gal loves you more than him, you still get dump 'coz she loves the money more. Some value physical appearance &amp; if the 3rd party is drop dead gorgeous, you still get dump. The list is endless but I think one main reasoning is that "since we're not married yet, I have the right to choose the best among my options", this line of thinking is not exclusive to us gals, guys think that way too. Er, were you dumped recently? I'm not trying to be offensive here, you can ignore this question if you don't wish to answer.<br><br>You asked me what other criterias I have in judging sg gals? In what context do you mean? Generally or as a potential wife? Generally sg gals are caring, helpful, gentle &amp; funny, well at least a few of my gfs are. If you're looking for a wife, only you will know what attracts you.<br><br>Maybe you just haven't had the good fortune to meet really good, intelligent &amp; not so materialistic sg gals yet, I wish you all the best in having the luck to meet these people the next time you're back in S'pore or when the new uni term starts.</div>
