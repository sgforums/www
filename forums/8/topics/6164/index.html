            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>I was on a coffee table chit chat with a few fellow Singaporean men, and it turns out that we have one of the most interesting conversations of all time : women. Of course, someone popped the question to us that whether we would want Singaporean women for wives.<br><br>It turned out that out of a few of us, at least four of them have girlfriends from Malaysia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and even Vietnam. So, out of curiousity, I asked,"why not Singaporean gals?" So, one of them put forward his stand, that he considers Singaporean gals too picky, too ambitious, sometimes being too materialistic and too demanding. Another added that the Singaporean gals who study in my university are slightly immature. Of course, there are always the nice and sweet Singaporean gals, but they belong to the minority or rare species who have been taken up by their NS bfs back home. Then they justify their reason for taking an overseas gal for a courtship. Most of these overseas gals as compared to Singaporean gals are more  sensible when it comes to being sensitive and understanding to someone's feelings. They are more mature because of the kind of the environment which they were made to grow up from, for example Hong Kong and Taiwan. I don't wish to say for all, but some, because if I engaged in immature generalizations, then I would be talking rubbish.<br><br>So, what is my criteria for finding a girlfriend now? I was wondering for a 25 year old bloke like myself, studying in overseas for almost 2 years and another 2-3 years to go. Then I realized that it becomes impossible for me to find a gal who spent her entire life studying in Singapore and get indoctrinated by the rules and regulations, and plus that nice side of them that "if you don't buy a Hello Kitty doll, I am angry with you". And I realize that after studying in overseas, the Singaporean gals who study in overseas as well developed independence and become more mature compare to the counterparts who are still pampered by their papa and mama, and of course boyfriends if any. An Irish friend even wagered with me over a pint of beer recently that I would eventually end up with a Causasian girlfriend because of the kind of values I have, being too westernized. I will presume I will prefer a overseas educated Singaporean gal, otherwise a Chinese gal not from Singapore, then finally, a Caucasian woman (hmmm, still waiting for my American galfriend to invite me for her place for coffee *evil snigger*, why so hollywood?)<br><br>What do you guys and gals think? I would like to see how Singaporean educated gals defend themselves...<br><br>Anyway, Happy's Valentine day</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, generalisation time. Not very PC but what the heck. (Proddy, drop me a line if ya wanna compare notes on Asian women. IÂ’ve got a few pet theories to why Singapore girls compare poorly with the rest of the Southeast Asian region but will share them with you when/if I see you.)<br><br>Its not uncommon for Singaporean guys to see women of other nationalities. IÂ’m currently seeing a Japanese girl, and before that a Taiwanese. Life is too easy for SÂ’porean girls (and guys in general), as such they take things for granted. Without hardship, political uncertainty, economic instability, they grow up with a rose-tinted view of the world while girls from other countries do not have this luxury and learn to deal with life. They are more aware and worldly-wise, this as consequence makes them more interesting to talk to. Talk to the average girl from Japan, Taiwan or Hong Kong about Singapore and chances are they can give very informed views, but ask the average SÂ’pore chick about these countries and they return a blank face. And if we deem SÂ’pore girls to be immature then we have to realise that they are fresh out of JC and ARE actually quite young. They are also not very adventurous and still cling to familiarity Â– witness the large number of undergrads who fly back every XÂ’mas, Easter and Summer hols when they can go backpacking in Europe.<br><br>Lest I get crucified, I hasten to add IÂ’ve met some very intelligent and world-conscious Singaporean girls but they have mostly been the overseas scholars I come in contact with at functions so they are more exceptions than norm.<br><br>cheers<br><br>[This message has been edited by Terence (edited 14 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting topics we had here!<br><br>I was talking to a friend who has just graduate from a university in Australia, coming back here to work. She just got a job and her superior told her that she was employee becoz of her oversea education! She was told that they (American ISP company) wanted someone from educated from overseas coz they feel that local university students ain't as independent, mature, and better as overseas students.<br><br>I was really surprised! I did not realise that one could have such thinking? It's not those top universities but it is like ALMOST any overseas university! If we were to put it in another sense, manys can't get into the local university, that is why they went overseas. So I don't see why they may be better! hahaahaha...I think this have nothing to do with the singaporean girls topic.<br><br>Anyway, there is quite a number of discussion on local girls. Terence, I'm sure Rinoa will change your mind about local girls!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> In fact there are even discussion of this matter in the newspaper, on singaporean girls being too demanding and materialistic. Probably we can wait for some ladies to speak up!<br><br>------------------<br>why, bishamon? why bish?<br>coz he's God of War!!<br>But I'm a peacelover! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I find it kinda funny.  The Singapore men complain about Singapore girls.  The Singapore girls complain about Singapore men.  So everybody should stay away from each other's path, no?<br><br>I don't know, it's like the generalizations made are a bit unfair.  as Terence has said in another thread, personal experience is just a drop of water in a big big sea (awfully paraphrased).  Well, I have done some generalizations myself but now I feel that I've been so smartass about it, as if I' met the whole of Singapore!<br><br>And Bish, if someone sed so doesn't mean that that person is correct, right?<br><br>------------------<br>Power = Work/Time<br>Time = Money<br>Knowledge = Power<br>===&gt; Knowledge = Work/Money<br>Making money the subject<br>Money = Work/Knowledge<br>To gain infinite amount of money, we ought to have knowledge aproaching zero (???)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree totally on the part that goes that people who studies overseas are moe independent and mature. It's always the case .. if you throw a 12 year old kid here to live on his own and stuff like that .. same thing will happend . However keep in mind that this dosen't apply just for girls .. it applies for us guys too .. that's why sometimes you see one of those " hey you never buy me a hello kitty " girls . But their boy friend isnt far off ... be it behind of ahead. well that's why they say birds of a feather flock together. !<br><br>But then again the ratio of girls is higher then guys in singapore (must be the NS fear .. parents have that promotes this) thats why you see more spinsters nowadays.<br><br>------------------<br>ZeroS</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Terence<br><br>Well, I am at all ears to hear about your theories about Singapore girls, and why they are compared poorly to other Asian women. Post them here and we can exchange notes on them. Well, soon, we will meet and discuss about these theories in the streets of London behind the Sg gals back *evil snigger*<br><br>After reading your reply, I have also developed a slightly different theory in the process. The problem is that Singaporean women are suffering from the problem that they could not handle the power which they are given after the women's sufferage movement came to Asia. Let me develop my theory a little bit more detail, with any loss of generality, you see, in the West and far East, we have the liberation of women movement, and the rise of feminists in the politics of country. However,  the feminists encountered with enough opposition coming from the other sides of the house in the country. In Singapore, the feminist movement went right through without any resistance, and the Singaporean women suddenly realized that they have so much power that they don't know how to use it. Well, I illustrate this with a very simple example : men in Singapore learned to humble themselves after going thru that 2.5 years of NS, and then go to the University with a different perspective. Here is a real life story from my friend who is an engineer. He was attending a meeting with his manager and a fresh woman Singapore engineering graduate. The manager asked for proposal to certain problem posed in the company. The Singapore educated gal gave her proposal, and subsequently, others gave their proposals as well. At the end of the meeting, they did not come to a decision, and they did not scrutinise each of the proposals in detail, and the Singaporean woman suddenly said something, "why did you not consider my proposal?" with the notion that her words should be taken into account.<br><br>I am not taking one big pole and sweep all the Singaporean gals into the water, but what I would like to point, thru the awareness of the Sgforums, since there are ladies listening to this. Please understand that you people are very fortunate and do not take this fortunate state for granted. Anyone has the right to demand and choose anything they want. I suppose that you people should be sensitive to people's needs.  At least, the good thing is that some Singaporean gals become more mature after they were in overseas, and similarly some of them who are still Daddy's gals.<br><br>Similarly, I share with Terence's sentiments about very intelligent and world-conscious Singaporean gals. However, they still do not possess that EQ thing in themselves, which I find it very sad.  This is of course, before I get sent to the gullotine by the women here for condemning them.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To the god of war, bishamon,<br><br>Well, you are really right, and you are giving an example that is relevant to the subject. Well, I agree with you that Rinoa is different from the all the Singaporean women which I have met, and I think she has good taste and ideas. Anyway, we will wait for the replies. Meanwhile, life is bored in the creative forum, and I understand that the viewership is dropping. Maybe you can spice up things there, otherwise, Terence and I would start our tirade of cheem discussions with our selection of bombastic words and flowery grammar from the Webster or Oxford dictionary here. *evil laughter* The last thing I would like to tell Bengboy is that the word Gullible is not found in the Webster dictionary.<br><br>Hey MayaJade, my gorgeous babe,<br><br>Well, Singaporean men complain about Singaporean women and vice versa is just like Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus... Have you finished the love-making scene with Terence? Please do it fast.. Otherwise I would not be writing the next episode, since it is so quiet on the Creative forum.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dun totally agree that overseas students tend to be mature and independent. I myself am in UK and I still see a handful of immature kiddies here. However I feel that to be able to perform well here you have to be an indepent and mature enough to handle the situations that arise in a sensible way.<br><br>I think what has been brought up about Singapore girls has been relatively true to a point. But if I am not wrong, we are generally referring to those that are still studying in JCs, Polys, or Unis. I think there are plenty of mature girls around. But maybe they are mainly found in the workforce rather than in the schools. I observed that generally when they start to work, their perspective of life changes and that's where the butterfly comes out of their cocoons.<br><br>Anyway, it would be great to have mature ladies around... but a little bit cute innocence is still a great thing too!! i'm sure i dun want to marry a "Margaret Thatcher"<br><br>[This message has been edited by iamsilly (edited 14 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ahem.  I am surprised too that there seems to be no girls clarifying the matter???<br><br>preface:  before I lose sight of my goals I would like to state my protestation here.<br>First, it's not fair to compare the average girls home with other Asian countries girls studying overseas.<br>Second, the things said above make me think that you think many singapore girls are worthless.  You are being too harsh.<br><br>Guys, when you talk about Japanese, Taiwan, Hongkong girls, I take it that you are talking about those girls who are there at your studying place, right?  I believe the rating won't be so high if you go all the way to their respective countries and talk with the average gals there.  The way I see it, since those girls have bothered to go overseas, they are interested in something outside their world already and the ones who cannot stand the pressure of being alone in a foreign country (because of lack of EQ) have been weeded out by 'natural' selection.<br><br>I hope this illustration helps, I thought that foreigners, in the form of tourists, visiting businessmen, have better world consciousness than Indonesian/Singaporean men.  Now that I've seen Americans and Brits exposed in their homeland by the Net I can see that many are as bochup as men over here.<br><br>I think all nations have their share of the village idiots.  And it's not surprising either that girl whom you fancy have already had a boyfriend, that's usually the case with a wonderful person (guy or gal), isn't that?<br><br>Now back to Singapore.  I swear I've seen girls who are not prone to Hello Kitty attacks and are so matured even when in secondary school.  I will also swear I know some men are collecting the toys not for girlfriends or selling them again.  I am not painting a rosy picture of the girls here, but the things you say are too thorny.  You don't tell me the whole nation have been condemned to complacency and being spoilt for the rest of their lives?</div>

Perhaps its just that due to your higher education level and supposedly more westernised values that you have cultivated while overseas that are your stumbling blocks to finding a mature,indepedent and intelligent sg woman?<br><br>Perhaps sometimes u may have failed to look beyond the superficial cover of the "I love hello kitties" mantra of the sg woman?<br><br>Hmmmmm...

            <div class='col-md body'>I think we're drifting from the point.<br><br>Maya: When I compared Sg girls with girls from other Asian countries I was comparing those who were overseas. I know both Sg and non-Sg girls overseas here and have seen a stark difference. This is another generalisation but it illustrates my point. Whenever there is after dinner conversation, when topics turn to politics or economics or anthropology or something deemed 'cheem', a lot of the overseas Sg girls mentally switch off. (For them the unfamiliar and disinterestedness go hand in hand). When asked their opinion, they just grin sheepishly or act irritatingly precocious and say its too 'cheem'(As though acting like a little girl while absolve them from the need to know). On the other hand, overseas Japanese, Hong Kong or Taiwanese girls, while they may not understand the technical terms or jargon used, will try to contribute to the conversation. They have no qualms about asking you to explain something, thinking about your explanation and then telling you if they think you are right or wrong based on their own experiences. There is no sense of shying away from mental activity.<br><br>And the sad thing about some S'poreans (both guys and gals but more so for the gals) is the way they don't seem to benefit from the overseas experience. Its true that most are here only either because they couldn't get into NUS or want a part of the 'glamour' of studying overseas, or even both. When they arrive here, they just go through the motions, hibernate in a circle of friends from the same country and very rarely mix with the locals or international students. (The Sg guy is more prone to mix). As such they take the first plane home every holiday. What a waste of money and experience. So yes, I agree many Sg guys and girls, go back no-better for the overseas experience.<br><br>Worm: You wanna make your case clearer? What are you saying?<br><br>cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, EcK,<br><br>I was just back in Singapore for the New Year, from 1999 to 2000. Well, I guess, I would be away from Singapore for a long long time, because I want to travel around on my side of the world and perhaps across the Atlantic, since fare tickets from UK to US are like flying from Singapore to Malaysia. Maybe it is just me.<br><br>Of course, I am not trying to use the simple case of Hello Kitties to look at sg woman. I think that I would quit using that sarcasm, or else, I would be accused of using that as a mantra to accuse Sg gals for their immaturity.<br><br>Well, unless, I find the right crowd, otherwise, I find it safer to stay in UK for the next two years to 5 years of my life or even in NY or Seattle (the place where I wish to work in later)....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Terence:<br><br>Well, you have certainly put your points clearly, and I think I need to clarify some issues here :<br><br>1)My definition of gals being immature and pampered consists of the group from JC, poly to Uni years, before they enter into society to work. The environment in my opinion does help to shape them.<br><br>2)I am making 2 comparisons here<br>(a)Singaporean women studying in overseas uni vs Singaporean women studying in Singapore unis<br>(b)Singaporean women studying in overseas uni vs other Asian women studying in overseas uni.<br><br>The first set is illustrated by the worldview that they adopt once they have to fend for themselves alone. I illustrate my point about the immaturity of Singaporean women on an isolated incident which I observed last year. Most of my Singaporean uni eduated lady friends found "Austin Powers II" very offensive and repungant because of all the crude jokes (femmebots) and poking at men. Except for one or two of them who appreciated the humor. Then I have the chance to go out with this lady friend of mine who was educated in US, and she is a very strict Catholic, and she simply liked it. See the major contrast here. This is really strange. I was trying to figure out what is so offensive in the movie...<br><br>The second set is clearly illustrated by Terence. I have a better example to illustrate this case. I was in the bar with a Singaporean gal who did her law degree in Oxford and then a postgraduate degree in my uni. It so happened that she was dated by some guy who claimed to be some big shot whose father is the sultan of one of the Malaysian states. Someone told her that the guy was a prince, and she was suddenly scared because she criticised the guy during their dinner date. For a period of time, we tried to calm her down and she started to get paranoid. I was really impressed by her immaturity, and I have nothing more to say after that, because we were discussing something important, and this gal, all she cared was whether the "prince" would send guards to harass her. Similarly, a HK friend of mine was dated by this same guy, and she also did the same. And I was wondering whether she was scared or not, and she said, "what is there to be feared if I have told the truth to this person? If he is petty about it, let him be. I have no time to waste on worrying on such trivial matters." See the difference.<br><br>Actually, I think Worm needs to elaborate her side of the argument before I could point out anything..<br><br>Btw, where are your theories, Terence?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"Life is too easy for SÂ’porean girls (and guys in general), as such they take things for granted. Without hardship, political uncertainty, economic instability, they grow up with a rose-tinted view of the world while girls from other countries do not have this luxury and learn to deal with life. They are more aware and worldly-wise, this as consequence makes them more interesting to talk to. " (Terence)<br><br>Just wondering.  Isn't that the ideal?  Children grow up in affluence and no war whatsoever to give them "experiences"?  Isn't that what all those prosperity wishes in CNY about, a lot of money?  I'd rather not have known that somebody back home could molest me without being penalized, that someone might open the gates and take the motorcycle and beat my family up when they try to stop him and he could get away with it?  I said the above not to get pity or to show off my scar, I just want to illustrate that maybe living in Aceh with war threatening to erupt anytime <strong>doesn't worth</strong> escaping the lure of Hello Kitty.<br><br></div>
