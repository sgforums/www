            <div class='col-md body'>I'll try me very best to follow the thread here. To confess, I was tempted to just leave it but then again, I guess I'll seem like one of the bimbotic girls that Terence described.<br><br>Anyway, since we're already in the business of generalizing and what have u, it would seems that a certain percentage of people would be able to attend overseas universities and to be able to do that, your family/you should be rather financially stable. Perhaps then these girls are rather sheltered and seems shallow in certain eyes.<br><br>What is your definition of maturity and all? Is it the ability to be wide read etc? I mean I can discuss anthrolopogy with you but I draw the line at economics. Does that make me immature? I sure hope not. Although if anyone offers me a chance to increase my maturity and all by going to an overseas university, I'll jump at the chance.<br><br>But on the other hand, I do agree to some extent that some Sg girls are "immature" in that the everyday issues around them seems more of a paramount importance than worldly affairs. Perhaps it has to do with the state of Singapore? It's easier to think using the dominant discourse that has been socialised into many of us and to actually think otherwise, to ponder the happenings around us, seems redundant.<br><br>I don't really know if all these actually make some kind of sense.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maya:<br><br>Of course thatÂ’s the ideal. But IÂ’m afraid youÂ’ve taken my comments out of context. I offered those as possible reasons why non-SG Asian girls were more interesting to talk to. IÂ’m definitely not saying that only a harsh life and bad experiences make one an interesting dinner partner. Rather, IÂ’m saying that the good and Â‘safeÂ’ life in SÂ’pore has placated and desensitised many SÂ’poreans (more so girls) from the benefit of a broader perspective and thus, consequently constricting their opinions of the world.<br><br>An example to prove that I wasnÂ’t advocating standpointalism: Look at the female scholars that I mentioned earlier. Both they and myself have never experienced extreme poverty nor hunger, but we are able to hold informed and informing conversations, conversations that do not revolve around Hello Kitty dolls and Who has the Sexiest Arms. Why? Because as scholars  (IÂ’m not blowing my own trumpet here, just illustrating a point) we have certain literary habits, keen interest in current affairs and constantly putting our opinions to the test against each other for validity. In other words, we are in an environment that cultivates intellectual probing instead of decrying it as Â‘arrogantÂ’ or Â‘showing offÂ’. Again, none of the SG scholars have been through political/economic turmoil, THE SAME WITH NON-SCHOLARS, so why is it that the TYPICAL female scholar is more interesting to talk to than the TYPICAL female non-scholar?<br><br>cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Terence:<br><br>Perhaps one reason why a typical female scholar is more "interesting" to converse with than a typical female non-scholar is because they have a reputation of sorts to maintain. I mean you can't really act all girlish and all that when people around you know that you're a scholar.

            <div class='col-md body'>whatever it is, my friends.....<br>I have seen it with my own eyes that S'porean gals here in my uni are hopeless. Do they cook? NO!!!! Gosh, one would expect them to be able to take care of themselves and all, but sadly that is not the case here. The guys do most of the cooking and the housekeeping, believe it or not. It is also the guys who "invent" dishes and cook hawker food style (i am getting homesick here...). I dunno about other gals in other universities...<br>I guess that's why S'porean gals here are not "hot"... hahaha...<br>I'd say go for Hong Kong gals, Thai gals, or Vietnamese. They are more hospitable. Our gals are just too pampered and materialistic.<br>Ang mo gals?? hmmmm...... well, i know of a few who are very nice and some like S'porean guys. Why?<br><br>It's called the NS factor.. tell you ah, chicks dig this shit about NS... they kowtow to you when you tell them you were FULLTIME military guy for 2 1/2 years before college! They love it.. it gives them a sense of security... A MAN IS WHAT THEY WANT! Of course you gotta prove it to them lor.. leadership skills and our quick-thought process are the best in keeping them attentive to the man in you.. hahaha....<br><br>c'est moi</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Terence<br><br>Well, I have nothing more to say but to wish you good luck in working for the government, while I will have my fun in America after getting my degree here. *evil snigger*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Luckily, I saw the light since my youth that I should never sold my freedom to any organization, and do what I want... Btw, which organization are you bonded to?<br><br>Well, I think that the female scholars are quite intelligent in my uni. I guess that they have to be, otherwise, they won't be scholars. However, I have encountered both male and female scholars who are totally unaware of what is going in the world and sticked to their own cliques. Still, I think the whole idea of overseas education is to experience the different culture from what you experienced back home. I find it dumb that some Singaporeans only sticked to their own people instead where they can learn or hear about other people's cultures and views.. Some of the female scholars I knew are highly intelligent, and they have a different kind of world view because of family background (a more educated one I suppose). But nevertheless, I don't think that they are very much different from the immature Singaporeans I met when witnessing some of their behaviour.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi boilermaker:<br><br>Well, what to do? Our government like to make the guys go thru NS, but they do not want the gals to go into similar version of that. Otherwise, without any form of exposure, they cannot respond to the environment around them. The Singaporean gals in overseas are mostly and always the Papa-Mama gals. Of course, there are always nice Singaporean gals but they are far and few between or they have already found themselves a good bf or husband...<br><br>Of course, I think that the other Asian gals have a better perspective in life compare to the Singaporean gals, because of the environment factor. We can't blame the poor Singaporean gals whom we have been condmenning on every account of their immaturity. But seriously, I think that this issue should somehow be brought to light. I use a specific example of a Hong Kong gal, who have already decided that since "I am in UK for an education, I am thinking of working maybe in US or London, because there are more opportunities there compare to where I come." When asked about what happens to their families, they would say that their careers are important and they would visit their families once or twice a year back in HK. Then I probed the same question to a Singaporean gal, and she told me,"I wanna go   home because of my papa mama, my dog, and the food my mom cook..." For Heaven sake, I would ask that the Ministry of Education to revamp the home economics policy as it seem to me that a lot of Singaporean gals don't know how to cook....<br><br>The way I see it, most of the replies I heard was from guys.. We need more gals to add to the discussion..</div>

Not many overseas female students in this forum, or they agree with what has been said here.

            <div class='col-md body'>As Terence said that there are lacks of female voices in the thread, I have to write something here even it is so late for me now and I spent so much time on reading all the posts after did my boring assignments.<br><br>I am glad to hear that some ppl here have such good impressions to our hong kong girls who study at overseas even I am not one of them in oversea. No wonder my friends who studying at uk told me that they have so much followers there  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Before I share my opinion on this thread, I wanna know that do u guys agree that MOST overseas students are come from rather rich families, not mater the students form Malaysia, India or hong kong. err, at least it is yes for the students form hk. After all, only very low % of students can get the scholar to support their huge tuition fee and living spending in oversea, right? but I am not sure the situation in sg, it may be easy for them. So it is hard for me to totally agree with Terence's saying. "  Life is too easy for Sg girls (and guys in general), as such they take things for granted. Without hardship, political uncertainty, economic instability, they grow up with a rose-tinted view of the world while girls from other countries do not have this luxury and learn to deal with life."  The ppl can go study oversea, they usually are the lucky group and don't need to worry too much about their living no mater which countries they come from. Not sg gals only. Agree??<br><br>I have three friends who are studying in UK now, they couldn't go to local universities and then just went aborad to further their studies. I only can say that they are lucky enough to have rich families to support them even they failed in the exams. and they told me that they have some friends who came form Malaysia and Indonesia also have good family background and they can spend a large amount of money per mouth. Especially for the one form indonesia, her family sent her aboard for the political uncertainty in her own country and she has a wonderful life in uk. Do u think that they are more lucky than their fellow who may have hard life in their own country? ( as Prodigal quoted some examples above, may I? Even it may be individual cases <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>So I want to say that if u want to compare Sg girls with girls from other Asian countries, it may be kinda unfair to say that because sg girls are have good life if sg and cause they are not as mature as other gals form other countries.<br><br>If u want to compare two ppl, one studying oversea and one studying at their own country, I would say that one studying oversea is luckier to have a chance to be more independent and increase her maturity from the environment. They go to a strange country and without families there, they have to be mature to adapt the new environment and take care of thmeselevs. if someone who spent a few years on studying oversea, they are still as dependent as they leave, then, they are definitely waste of time and money for further their studies oversea.( even no doubt that these people exist <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Finally, I want to say that the examples other ppl and I quoted above are quite independent and not enough to support to generalize all the ppl. It is unfair to evaluate all gals form different countries depends on a few cases.<br><br>I would like to apologize if I made any mistakes above because of my poor english command and I don't want to read it again coz it is damn late or damn early now :p and pls feel free to correct if my points are not make any sense.<br><br></div>

Can someone without ambition be mature? I'm sure there's a lot of less-educated people around here would say, "Yes, of course."<br><br>If she isn't able to share the same views of life. If she isn't able to show interest in your discussion. If she isn't able to come to your level of intellect. If her needs and objectives of life is different, eg. family above career.

Amazing how ideologues filter through the general populace so thoroughly? Blame ST?! Blame Sumiko Tan?! Blame Chua Lee Hong?! Ow Wei Mei?!<br><br>Sorry to go on a tirade against those people I could happily live without.<br><br>Anyway, I agree to the last point made by iamsilly on terence's post on "maturity". I understand Terence's gist as suggesting that SG girls tend to be sheltered but iamsilly was right in pointing out that the criteria Terence used was not appropriate to the agreed dedfinition on "maturity". It could very well be that an inward-looking nature be not indicative of an immature mindset. The register of a careerist should not be placed alongside any "maturity" scale.<br><br>My opinion on this whole issue is that ... people are people (DM?!). It is impossible and irresponsible to pickle and label every individual to a "type" or a "category". To do that is to buy into a pedagogical Faustian pact with the political ruling class. Treat everyone you meet as an individual. Because you find that every one is irrational and selfish. All the bad traits ascribed to a "type" is all too easily applied to the your "type". All the good attributes are evenly shared too. Lest I sound as if I am espousing a Millenarium (nuthin to do with Y2K) state, I'll like to tint my remarks with the colour of irrationality ; that the society is easier to predict than the individual.<br><br>cheers.<br><br>------------------<br>This guy walks into a bar with a duck on his head.<br>The bartender, who's seen just about everything says, "what can I get you?"<br><br>To which the duck replies "you can start by getting this guy off my ass."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After reading Terence, iamsilly and barclay's reply on the issue, I have realized that all of us have not properly agreed on what we meant by maturity. In this topic, most of us are arguing on the context of examples which most of us have encountered in our common life or hear about tales where this is discussed. Now, let steered this discussion in a proper light, by first explaining what I meant by maturity.<br><br>One can view maturity in a few perspectives. For example, I use the issue of some Singaporeans women in overseas do not know not how to clean the house, cook or even do chores. Well, they have relied on their papa, mama and possibly Philippino maids.. Well, I do not agreed on the argument which most of you brought, on the point about most Singaporeans who manage to go to overseas are all rich people. Well, if that is the case, then it becomes very plausible to reason out something like "since these gals who go to the overseas come from rich families, therefore they are spolit.". Because this plausible reasoning can be countered easily by a counter example which I can immediately find a few in my home uni.<br><br>Maturity is a state of mind, in my definition, where the human being is able to fend for himself or herself in any change of environment, is like you gain independence from your family, and you learn to take care of yourself. By no means, it is about whether the person is intelligent or not, or either be a heartlander or a cosmpolitan, because everyone has his or her choice. Despite that, I would also be inclined to add that maturity also includes a world view of things. For example, I would think of a woman during a discussion with guys always think about how pretty she is or her kind of mundane problems like what makeup to wear, and constantly interrupting a discussion among people about what is happening in Kosovo, or what is the meaning of life (something philosophical), by declaring that it is too difficult for her. You can argue that this is a personal choice, but I beg to differ. She could have just listened to  what people said and learned something, but instead choose to flaunt her immaturity upon others.<br><br>Hence, I would like to hear your views and we can see where the next train would take us.<br><br>Have a nice day   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by prodigal (edited 18 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>prodigal,<br><br>It's not very mature to measure one's maturity level on whether one knows how to clean the house, cook or even do chores, these are just skills of daily living. Of course, it's sad that some girls these days don't know how to cook (myself is a case in point) but what has maturity got to do with it?<br><br>You've got to be kidding, you mean there're girls who don't know how to keep a house clean? Kindly specify what chores? Other than not knowing how to cook, I can keep a house reasonably clean, I can change a lightbulb when it needs changing, but I don't do plumbing or electrical wirings.<br><br>I must admit that I'm very lucky to have parents &amp; siblings who are great cooks &amp; to be living in foodie paradise S'pore, the way I see it: even if I don't know how to cook, I won't starve 'coz there's always the hawker centre. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Yes, I know. What happens when I become a mother? Come on, obviously I would learn how to cook before then &amp; yes I know that the food may taste terrible but practice makes perfect. I think the situation with most sg girls would be that they would learn to cook once they're married or when they've a boyfriend. Yes, I would admit it's a shallow attitude but hey ...<br><br>I think some of you guys are picking on sg girls 'coz we don't care two hoots about you guys which is detrimental to ourselves because then you guys go after foreign girls, marry them &amp; leave us high &amp; dry. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I think when you're looking for a wife, give the girl a few chances, the first time you meet &amp; interact with her may not impress you much but try to understand, sometimes, we say things which we think are the thing you guys want to hear which may backfire on us.<br><br>We are often told that guys do not like gals far more intelligent than them &amp; so sometimes we act stupid. Some dodo advised that it's the smart gal who acts stupid at the right times who gets the guy. See the predicament we're in?<br><br>Even when the guys protest &amp; say that they don't mind their girlfriends being smarter than them, how many of these guys are there? When a man voices his opinions &amp; asserts his rights, he's knowledgable &amp; assertive, when a woman does the same, she's too manly &amp; aggressive.<br><br>Don't write a girl off after a couple of dates which are not that great, take the time to know her better, when you're more at ease with each other, you'll be more honest &amp; open about your views.<br><br>I must admit that if you're having a discussion on the atrocities committed in Kosovo &amp; the girl interrupted it with a inane question on what makeup to wear, well she's a little ... Guide her gently how to behave but don't run her down. Could it be that most of the topics you like to talk about are too worldly &amp; depressing? And do you like to discuss them in depth which can be really daunting.<br><br>Wars are never pretty &amp; for me, I ask myself what could I have done to help the situation? Nothing. Nothing at all. So why discuss it? I can only pray to God that such senselessness will stop soon &amp; peace will reign. I could talk about it &amp; hope to learn something from it but to discuss it in depth? Not unless I'm with the Foreign Service Department, otherwise, whatever bright sparks that come up in the discussion remains as sparks that never will catch fire.<br><br>The meaning of life? That's an interesting one, would you like to start a new thread on that? Maybe you'll be surprised at the posts you'll get &amp; realised that sg girls aren't as immature as you think.<br><br>Maturity goes beyond the ability to hold a reasonably intelligent discussion on current affairs. Maturity for me is the ability to treat people with fairness, kindness &amp; compassion at the appropriate moments. The ability to handle the difficulties &amp; trials that life throws at them would seem pretty mature to me.<br><br>Ah, just a few tips for you when you're looking for a wife:<br>1. besides maturity, go for compatibility too<br>2. a good moral character &amp; with strong personality traits like integrity, honesty, compassion, etc, etc<br>3. someone whom you can envision spending the rest of your life with &amp; who loves you too<br>4. someone whom you can put up with her repeated faults &amp; still not hold grudges<br>5. someone who can still make your heart smile when you think of her (after the first flush of love)<br>6. someone whom you will willingly give your most treasured possession to.<br><br>That's all the tips I've for now, am too tired to think of more. If you think of any good tips for looking for a life partner, post them here so that I can learn from you too.<br><br>Best of luck in your search for a wife!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know what the problem is. Why is it 'finding a wife for someone studying overseas' instead of just 'finding a wife'? Unless of course people who have studied overseas consider themselves superior and have greater problems in this area than the average man?

            <div class='col-md body'>Prodigal: I was trying to find fault with your definition of maturity, but I realized that that was your own view, which means I have no right to discredit it. It is your own criteria on something that you want.<br><br>Much of the discussion (other than you and terences) seemed to stem from whether someone is immature if they have no interest in worldly stuff.<br><br>I would have to agree that its nice to be aware and care about what is happening outside of our own short and inconsequential existence. But I just want to point out that you are talking about a WIFE i.e. someone you want spend time with, do the hokey pokey with, have kids with etc. Its would be perfect if she could stimulate you physically and intellectually at the right times, but it will have to take work from both of you.<br><br>Yes, she (I'm cool even if its a he) should have an interest in things other than what we guys frown on most of the time. But in a relationship, you probably shouldn't be looking for a full time intellectual sparring partner.  Once in a while you have to take it easy and just enjoy the company, regardless of whether you are exchanging sweet nothings or exchanging views on whether Shakespeare is overrated. Imagine looking at a sunset, in a remote beach, just the pair of you, and you start talking about whether the electromagnetic spectrum appears red or blue shifted. Lighten up. Even I would have trouble enjoying the moment like that, and I do wish you luck in looking for someone who will be happy to do that.<br><br>I would love to give examples of ladies who don't fit the description of "immature" girls that you have given. But I suspect with the vast number of women you have been with, you will be able to quote enough anectodal evidence to sink the aircraft carrier in my private bay (that was a joke,) so I won't try.<br><br>So, instead, I'll say that some girls would have to learn develope an open mind through whatever means is available, but you can help by meeting them halfway.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, colette:<br><br>I think that you have not understood me properly in my earlier post. I have defined at the last paragraph of my last post that maturity is a state of mind where a person has acquired the tools to live a life and gain independence to live a life in the midst of struggles and adversity coming from the external environment.<br><br>I never claimed that maturity is based on just knowing how to clean the house. That is preposterous, as I merely used the analogy of knowing how to cook to illustrate how it differed from that perspective. Why don't I take the analogy further and you would answer me by the following example : suppose you can't do your chores properly, and somehow, you got yourself landed in an island by some accident, and you need to survive, and I am sure that you would have to find a way to survive. You can attempt to counter my argument by saying that it's irrelevant because survival has nothing to do with maturity and then I would just tell you,"Please think carefully about what you say."<br><br>Since you can't do your household chores, it is your future husband who is going to suffer and not me. (This last two lines here is of course sheer sarcasm  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">)<br><br>I have to confess that I am not nitpicking on you women because there are always two sides of the coin. Similarly, I do believed that there are nice Singapore gals, and they are far and few between, or if not, already attached by now.<br><br>Yes, on the issue of finding a wife, I appreciate your kind advice to me. Not that I am being sarcastic to myself, but I simply reach the state of saying that I belong to the class of guys who are simply not who women are looking for. In my social circle, the women who find me attractive are all attached women and they hardly find it difficult to talk to me, and they loved asking me out for coffee. Well, when it comes to an unattached women, for some unknown reason, things just don't mix. Of course, that is a personal opinion of myself. I can imagine myself in a American sitcom called "The Single Guy", being the good and nice family friend but just failed miserably when I come to finding a wife, and I simply don't care... The irony is that the attached women thinks that I am desired by many women for my stupidity and frank and direct nature, and experimental observation of my life simply indicate the opposite to their nice theoretical predictions.<br><br>Let me tell you a really funny thing that happened in my life recently, one of the gals mentioned in my example of immature women has commented to a friend that I was an aggressive person because I invited her a few times out for a drink and she declined. I was thinking whether the criticism being valid, when my ex-students for a course last term came into my office to visit me for a cup of coffee. So, I just popped the question to them,"Well, do you find me aggressive?" Guess what they say,"You are the last person in this laboratory we know are aggressive." Of course, the reply was similar from all my lady friends. They knew that I am a frank and direct person, by no means I am an aggressive person. I find it very amusing in the end.<br><br>In the words of an alien from Omicron Persei 8 from the latest series of Futurama commenting on the problem of why both sexes don't seem to understand each other,"The male aliens are from Omicron Persei 7 and the female aliens are from Omicron Persei 9." (Sound familiar right)<br><br>What about the meaning of life? Hmmm, I would think of a new thread later, when I have some insight on my life. Somehow, I shared Virginia Woolf's comment about philosophizing our own lives, "Why do they all elaborate philosophies and religions outside the real life we live? Why not fuse them with our life on Earth? Life, life is what we are here for and to live it well, not to go into a room and think about it all."<br><br>Anyway, live well and prosper... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok...Let me tell you my observation...<br>When you leave overseas there are two kinds of scenerios<br>1)You live in a homestay where U are taken care of by the family and you just have to concentrate in your studies.<br><br>2)You live in your own apartment and you have to do all the housechores and cooking, well you have not much of a choice.but as time goes by, all these seems to be a routine more than a chore..and yes practice makes perfect.<br><br>The reason why some woman are more capable of housechores than others is due to the fact how they are brought up...For me in all my living years in Singapore I was brought up by my nanny...due to the fact , that I am not the apple in her eyes...I have to do housechores, marketing with her and carry all the stuffs..and I am only in my primary school years...<br><br>But I have learnt in the midst, on how to choose a fish..and seafood...knowing the difference in prices in wet market versus dry market...<br><br>This is all about nurturing...The generalisation that SG woman are "immature' is also the government' fault in emphasizing too much on education and career putting it in the first priority...SG woman can't make good wives..??Again you have to see the ultimate goal in a woman's life...Is it a good career or a successful family...? A mature woman does not mean that she wants to have the best out of her family, she might think that it is a bother to have kids and as such...<br><br>My mum knows nuts about cooking before she marries my dad but now her chicken rice and as such are really fabulous....~~it is thru all the years of trial and error that she achieve this level of good gourmet...Well of course since I am the first child I can get to eat all the crappy food before she becomes the chef.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>All and all, whatever you see now may not be a representative of the future...</div>

First of all, I wouldn't be too thrilled about it but I would rack my brains to recall all the survival skills I know or saw in the movies before to help me get through the ordeal. It would be too long to go into details here but what's has maturity got to do with it? In cases like this, it is prior similiar experiences that count, not maturity even though it helps.<br><br>I only can't cook {though I can fry an egg, cook instant noodles, toast a pizza, fry prawns - hmm, it would seem I can cook a little after all  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">}, I can keep a house reasonably clean - please read my earlier post. So who says my husband who's going to suffer?  As I've indicated before, when the time comes, I'll make the effort to learn more about cooking, a man should feel lucky that a woman is going to all that trouble for him.<br><br>I don't get this, your attached female friends think that you're desired by many women for your stupidity &amp; frank &amp; direct nature? If you're stupid or act stupid over in the UK {I think that's where you're studying} and I know you're not stupid from the posts you post, it's no wonder you're still single. I, for one, don't like stupid men, I prefer someone with a little IQ, EQ &amp; AQ.<br><br>Alright, let me give you a female's perspective on why the gal you invited a few times for coffee finds you aggressive. If she's has been declining every invitation you extended for coffee with just the two of you, it simply means she's not interested in you as a potential b/f &amp; she may not want to lead you on. If she joins you in a group outing, it would mean that she don't mind having you as a friend but not as a boyfriend with the potential to be her husband. So, to her, she'll think: "Don't you get it? I'm not interested in you, why are you making life so difficult for me by asking me so many times, thereby making me reject you equally so many times &amp; make me feel so guilty?" So, naturally she'll finds you aggressive. I could be way off the mark, but that's just one scenario that flashes through my mind now.<br><br>The other thing is, could it be that you're sabotaging yourself without even knowing it? I see no reason why attached women are able to enjoy your company but not the single ones. Do you behave differently when you're with single gals? I know that I behave a little differently with guys I'm really interested in, I get tongue-tied when normally I can chat non-stop.<br><br>pacman is right, if you're looking for a wife, you should see beyond maturity &amp; the ability to discuss world affairs. She's someone you're going to spend your life with, not an intellectual sparring partner. If you're overly intellectual, it can be intimidating although some other intellectuals may find it stimulating, some gals' mind will keep thinking: how can life with fun with him? So, there goes your chances with these gals &amp; you'll never even get a chance to find out if they're mature or if they can hold intelligent discussions on a wide range of topics.<br><br>Lastly if the main theme of this post is not about finding a wife, you shouldn't have post the title as such, you can't blame us for keying our mind to it.<br><br>Have a good weekend.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bar and iamsilly,<br><br>IÂ’m not sure I accused overseas SG girls of immaturity except in the natural context of age. The subjectivity of maturity might make for problematic definition; I never thought otherwise. From personal experiences to semantic differentiation to etymological genealogies, any word, let alone something as highly subjective and conceptual as Â‘maturityÂ’, will be contested on some level or another. However, any attempt to define it will require some sense of objectification. A generic definition will do for this purpose. (If not, we run into all sort of problems, define a SG girl, define drive and ambition, define cosmopolitan, define intelligence, define Â‘handle a situationÂ’, define irrational and selfish etc. We run into a cull de sac.)<br><br>By addressing a heartlanderÂ’s capacity for maturity, iamsilly is enlarging the debate, de-centering the crux of argument from its loci which is of course the contrast of overseas SG girls and overseas non-SG girls. Of course the heartlander is capable of mature displays, just as the cosmopolitan is capable of immaturity, but that doesnÂ’t address the question the original post set us.<br><br>By comparing SG and non-SG girls, I was deliberately specifying a particular situation with very rigid regulations in order to prepare as narrow as possible the margin for speculation. In other words by comparing the two groups with general knowledge, intellectual curiosity and wider life experience as yardsticks I proposed that non-SG girls were more interesting. As yet, no one has confronted my observation with contradiction based on these yardsticks.<br><br>cheers<br></div>
