            <div class='col-md body'>Just my thoughts on Taiwanese.<br><br>Taiwan is going through a unstable political moment(Taiwan President constituitional crisis &amp; Chinese aggression), the crash comes in at the same time.<br><br>Unstable political conditions already warrant the decrement of tourist and yet now an air disaster. Taiwanese government would most likely not want it's airport to be involve in this incident.<br><br>Situation as news report in <strong>Singapore</strong> shows that the Taiwanese are definitely trying to shift all responsibility to SIA.<br><br>As quoted from CNN news.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Yong said the pilot, C. K. Foong, knew which runway he was supposed to be on, and that he had not been misdirected by the control tower. However, Yong said there was no indication why Foong was on the wrong runway. </strong><br></blockquote>Plain accusation even before real investigation starts? What are the Taiwanese side trying to prove?<br><br>FYI: Kay Yong is managing director of Taiwan's Aviation Safety Council.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>If both sides of the runway -- which was filled with construction equipment -- were illuminated, the pilot could have mistaken it for a clear airstrip, said Kay Yong, managing director of Taiwan's Aviation Safety Council.<br><br>"If the lights of the runway were not on, then the runway would not look like a runway," Yong told reporters after a briefing with legislators.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>Contradictions against his words earlier on? Your call.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Investigators have said that visibility was poor late Tuesday night when the plane crashed, and air traffic control -- which didn't have ground radar -- had no way of knowing the pilot was on the wrong runway, which was parallel to the one he was supposed to use.<br><br>Although the pilot told air traffic control that he thought he was on the correct runway, pilot error could not immediately be confirmed as the cause of the crash, Yong said.<br></strong></blockquote><br>Is he trying to say, CKS Airport have no way to inform SQ006 and hence forth CKS Airport control tower has no responsibility in the crash <strong>at all</strong>.<br><br>Further on, as I said before, any <strong>SANE</strong> pilot will not even consider risking his own and the lives of many? Not to even mention there are total of 3 pilots.<br><br>A pilot would risk running into a "unlighted" runaway?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Some Taiwanese relatives, however, have demanded U.S. dlrs 600,000 from the airline since the preliminary findings of the investigation were released<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>As directly quoted from CNN, <strong>Taiwanese relatives only.......</strong><br><br><blockquote><strong><br>The pilot was supposed to take off on the runway marked with a big red sign saying "5L-23R." The strip was next to the closed runway, "5R-23L." The runways were also marked with an "05L" and "05R" painted on the airstrip's surface.<br><br>American attorney Gerald Sterns, who specializes in representing air crash victims' families, said the airport might have been able to avoid confusion by altering the "5R-23L" sign on the repaired runway.<br><br>"The best defense is to put up a sign that says, 'Runway Closed.' It's no big deal," the San Francisco-based lawyer said.<br><br>He also said that during big storms the control tower, which doesn't have ground radar, should use its radio to warn pilots about the closed runway to make sure they aren't using it. The "black box" cockpit recorder indicated that wasn't done with the Singapore Airlines flight.<br><br></strong></blockquote><br><br>A quote a lawyer from <strong>neither of the 2 nations</strong>. Unbiased and fair. More could have been done.<br><br>Not forgetting as far as news had said, locally or from other nations, it will take 1-2 years to fully investigate the air crash.<br><br><strong>1-2 years</strong>, delaying to tide the storm?(Politcal stability in Taiwan and further involvement in air crash would result in decline of economy?)<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>The recording begins from 18 seconds after 11:15 p.m. (1515 GMT). Runway 5L was open; runway 5R was closed for repairs.<br><br>11:15.18 - ATC (tower) said to SIA 006: "Singapore 6 runway 05 left (5L). Wind 020 (degrees) at 28 (knots). Gust to 50. Clear for take off."<br><br>11:15.26 - Captain: "Clear for take off. Runway 05 left. Singapore 6."<br><br>11:16.19 - Captain: "We can see the runway not so bad. OK, I am going to put it to high first."<br><br>11:16.51 - First Officer: "80 knots."<br><br>11:16.52 - Captain: "OK, my control."<br><br>11:17.08 - First Officer: "V1." (Speed of 142 knots/hour, at which take-off can no longer be aborted)<br><br>11:17.12 - Captain: "(Expletive). Something there."<br><br>11:17.13 - Banging sound.<br><br>11:17.14 - Captain: (Unintelligible words).<br><br>Followed by a series of crashing sounds.<br><br>11:17.18 - recording stopped.<br><br></strong></blockquote><br><br>No comment<br><br>Links:<br><br>Air crash information from CNN<br><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/ASIANOW/east/11/05/taiwan.plane.ap/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnn.com/2000/ASIANOW/east/11/05/taiwan.plane.ap/index.html</a><br><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/ASIANOW/east/11/04/taiwan.plane.ap/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnn.com/2000/ASIANOW/east/11/04/taiwan.plane.ap/</a><br><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/ASIANOW/east/11/03/taiwan.crash/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnn.com/2000/ASIANOW/east/11/03/taiwan.crash/index.html</a><br><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/ASIANOW/east/11/06/taiwan.crash.ap/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnn.com/2000/ASIANOW/east/11/06/taiwan.crash.ap/index.html</a><br><br>Taiwan political situation information  from CNN<br><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/ASIANOW/east/11/06/taiwan.politics.02.ap/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnn.com/2000/ASIANOW/east/11/06/taiwan.politics.02.ap/index.html</a><br><br>[This message has been edited by tango (edited 08 November 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>final conclusion&gt;&gt;&gt;jus my views both te pilots n the control tower have their own mistakes. but the pilots having admitted their mistakes should br forgiven( goin to the wrong runway is a common mistake pilot make n it also happen in Singapore aiport ) as for taiwan puttin the full blame to the pilots, i think its rather unfair n they are still demandin compensation to their relatives!! for your info, a person died in an air accident are eligible for onli $75000 but SIA are givin as much as $400000 which is so many times the normal situation..<br>as for taiwan's airport, statistics have shown that it is one of the most dangerous airport n they have a record of as much as 6 accidents occuring this year&gt;&gt;dun this thing tells alot?<br>i am als glad to hear that if the three pilots are bearing all the responsibility, pilots all over the world are promising not to land on taiwan airport!!</div>

Indeed the money could probably tide some families over for a while but honestly, it really isn't the issue for the moment as much as I thought.<br><br>So far, corpses have been retrieved and funerals for most have been held but the dragging of the "truth" of the accident is what really hurt and bother most victim's next of kin and the public.<br><br>Let's just imagine you are one of the victim's next of kin. Would you really be after the money more or the truth to why your next of kin died?(Unless you hate your next of kin or you are particularly in need of help financially.)<br><br><strong>As much as I know</strong>, Singaporeans are particularly concern not because the amount of locals who died in this accident.(Just take a look at the Silkair/Indonesia accident.) Much more action was taken for this accident. Why? Simply because it is a SQ/SIA plane. Did Silkair received as much publicity? As good as my memory served me, no and the death rate was higher than this SQ 006 accident. Again, because SIA carries the name, <strong>Singapore</strong> and CKS airport carries the name, <strong>Taiwan</strong>, much has become a pribe of 2 nationalities. Comments have always been differentiate by either Singapore side or the Taiwanese side most of the time.<br><br>Whether or not SIA propose the total amount of 425K USD compensation as a move to stop further claim of compensation and to stablise their stocks, they did and really handle the situation well as of this moment.<br><br>No amount of compensation could really be adequate. Opportunity cost is a good example by Illegal Operation.<br><br>Now back to the main question,<br>I am pretty baffled by the fact they have to take 1-2 years to investigate this?<br>Are the Taiwanese public not really blaming SIA for the accident just like the direct opposite of the (generally)Singapore public blaming CKS airport traffic tower(representing Taiwanese side) for the accident?<br><br>[This message has been edited by tango (edited 09 November 2000).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by tango (edited 09 November 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, getting back to the discussion on speculating/thoughts on the truth, I think Taiwan side is hiding a lot of things. There is a lot of speculation going on among the officials. Despite being a keen follower on news of SQ006, I know, for sure, that the officials have not revealed some of the most important evidence that will reveal the truth.<br><br>As for my speculation on the truth, reports on feelings of pilots towards the safety of Taiwan airport has caused me to sway my support towards SIA. If pilots and stewarders themselves are hesitant and unsure when flying to Taiwan airport, it definitely means that something is wrong with that airport.<br><br>Initially, I considered that the pilot should be held 70% responsible for the accident. Now, I lowered it to 60%, and I believe it might go even lower.<br><br>AND... if I have to fly to US and have to transit, I will never choose a plane that transit at Taiwan...not until there is evidence that they have improved their airport safety level.</div>
