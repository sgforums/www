            <div class='col-md body'>The recent announcement tat student no longer need to count on the grade of their Chinese language subject when applying for University here is now the biggest concern, Singaporean Chinese language standard r poor n yet they drop the standard of Chinese.... Now, the global fever to learn Chinese r increasing n it will produce a growing number of people who r proficient in Chinese in other countries. Singapore in the other hand has very little advantage over its compeititors in the future if Singapore can only speak English, Singlish n improper Chinese... As a saying goes : " YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE LOST UNTIL YOU HAVE LOST IT" Hence i dunno why the MOE is trying to do by bring about the changes in Chinese langauage subject...</div>

The few english elite u mention also include those prime ministers in the parliament... Tats why they agree to tat, if not their children will have trouble going into University... Its very unfair to the other party especially those who put in a lot of effort into their English subject...</div>

We place a high premium on racial harmony now... Why?? Becoz of the racial riots in the early years... The present crisis over the Chinese language in Singapore(esp among the young generation) may perhaps be another example...</div>
