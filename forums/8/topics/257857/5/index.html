            <div class='col-md body'>Coming back to topic, what the driver did was right nor was it nice. But everything points towards it being an accident. The incident being an accident does not make it right, but it's a different thing altogether to compare him/her (the driver) with someone who intentionally makes animals suffer.<br><br>If the driver had known what he/she had done to the kitten, the driver might have stopped and at least try to do something. I know I would, but I strongly feel the driver might not even have been aware. TS able to confirm this?<br><br>As to why the driver was not able to see, a lot of it points towards the kitten being too small and so small that driver does note even know what happened, ie; accident, not intentional animal cruelty. It's really hard to explain any further why the kitten couldn't be seen but I would figure that drivers would understand better.</div>
