            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, we do not know the road condition. Whether the driver notice there was a kitten on the road nor notice that the car actually run over something as usually small animals and birds would run or fly away for safety as the vehicle approach.<br><br>Anyway, do you seriously think that the driver actually hit it deliberately? Think about it.... he will need to wash his vehicle or possibly cause a dent on his vehicle even though none is able to hold him responsible for running over a kitten on the road.<br><br>A life inferior to that driver might not mean anything to him but the damage might be.<br><br>And also. TS did not actually stated the situation clearly.
