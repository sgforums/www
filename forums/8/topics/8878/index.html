            <div class='col-md body'>i read somewhere that love usually lasts a mere span of 4 years (if you're lucky) before it begins to pall and the people involved begins to stray or love just simply dies, that's you fall out of love with your partner. if that's true, why do people even bother with LOVE?<br><br>what makes you fall out of love? personally, i think i'll fall out of love when my partner begins to take me for granted, our communications breaks down and/or our interests have grown too far apart for the chasm to be bridged.<br><br>what about you?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not sure whether there is an answer. Personally, I think there are 2 possibilities. The first one is that humans crave novelty. Novelty can come in the form of excitement, chemical rushes, etc. The time that people get to actually craving something new varies.<br><br>The second reason is perhaps that love is not forever after all, or maybe what you know as love is just attraction, which is transient.<br><br>Well, I'm just saying anyway, wasn't saying as though you are falling out of love. I meant "you" as in the general people.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually why think so much? Whether its permanent or temporary, just live in the bliss that loving someone or being love brings. I have fallen out of love myself just recently actually. But not because I stopped loving her, but rather because she told me its not possible for us to be together.<br><br>My feelings for her are still as strong, but I realise there is no way I can be with her, no matter how badly i desire it. So am i in? or am i out of love? I am definitely out of HER love but I am most definitely still IN love with her.<br><br>So don't think too much lah, if the feeling of liking or loving the person brings joy and bliss to yourself, why even bother pondering over all those questions? Of course, must be man or woman enough to handle the pain when she/he goes off with another lah.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As we step into the next millenium, human are putting more emphasis on feeling. One particular feeling, which we always think about, is love.<br><br>Finding the other half and spending the rest of your life with him or her is no longer a ritual that every human being must perform just to get on with life. Nowadays, marriage or even relationship formed must consist of love. A gal might indicate that she do not mind if the guy is poor or not good-looking, just as long as both of them have love for each other. Same to the guy, beauty or hourglass body is not the top priority.<br><br>Its not that relationships build on love is not good. But come to think about it, do our grandparent have love before or after their marriage? Back in their time, there is no doubt that some may marry due to love. But most of them are match-make by their parent. They do not have any say in their life-long partner. They don't even know what's love is all about. They only know that they must marry and give birth to a boy in order to continue the life-line.<br><br>If the matchmaking is successful, they will marry and live together for the rest of their life with or without love. In most cases, they learn to love and care for each other.<br><br>Is love just a feeling or a process that we can learn? In our present society, it seems that we are stereotyping love as a feeling? "Oh, there is no love in us" or " I have no feeling for you" a guy might said just to cover the facts that the gal is not up to his standard or the society standard of a perfect wife. Vice versa, a gal might also do the same.<br><br>However, if we are going to argue that love is a process, one might ask how we choose the one whom we can carry out the process. It's all boils down to feelings again. Feelings that are create by beautism.<br><br>For a marriage or relationship to work, one must learn to love and care. If we are going to depend on feelings of love, you will never find the one whom you can spend the rest of your life with. The reason is simple. Feelings will fade as time passes. But with a little creativity, you can re-invent the process of love with magical touch that will last you for life.<br><br>------------------<br>Gerald<br>SinglesONE.com</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>RedBean,<br><br>i know that such a question has no answers, i ask because i would like to know what possible causes there're and perhaps learn to be satisfied with who i'm with or who i'll be with and stop yearning for newer pastures. when i know what makes me lose the loving feelings for the one i love, i hope that i'll be able to stop those negative feelings in time and recapture the love again. i would like to learn to still my searching heart and to love for a longer period other than the initial rush of a new love or passion which may lasts no more than a year or a month or even a week. and no, i don't want to just enjoy the moment, i want the love of the older generation, the kind where it grows and grows, not the type that most of us have now, which often starts off as a white hot burning passion, only to die out just as quickly or worse, where it simmers off so slowly that your life is in limbo. and i can do without the pain of heartaches too.</div>
