            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, wonder anyone encounter such superior/colleague b4.<br><br>I have a colleague/superior who like to stay back and do work everyday even the work can be done over the next few days.<br><br>One trait of him is he like to start teaching/guiding/telling/working with me in the late afternoon in the name of work and drag all the way to nightime (10~11pm+).<br><br>Another trait of him is he like to stay back everyday after office hour. He is almost the last one to leave the office. Understand from others that he seldom leave b4 8pm every working day.<br><br>Actually, we dun mind him staying back, but he always like to drag or make some ppl stay back late with him base on some not urgent, "valid" reason (e.g. work, teaching, guidance, discussion, meeting).<br><br>Got one time I told him I have an appointment with friends and I need to leave early (although I already stay near 8pm and was late for my appointment, somemore the work can be done over the next few days), he stared at me and tell me off that "so you will know how to do tomorrow" (tone not good). Felt so demoralised then.  Worst thing is the FTs in the company always knock-off office on time, and this colleague/superior is a Singaporean and the ppl he drags to stay back with him are Singaporean colleagues most of the time. No wonder my company's Singaporean got no time to socialise. He is a damn stupid Singaporean.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Anyone can advise how to handle such colleague or superior?<br><br>PS: this may happen to me or any colleague everyday. I even have experience staying in office up to 10+++pm everyday for 3~4 weeks.<br><br></div>

Not sure whether he is the cause of it, but definitely part of it. Always on alert for late afternoon and demoralised after he went past 6pm and continue and I will know "oh gone today.. have to reach home by 11pm+ again"... Not as enthusiastic and interested in work.. but just endure... but I always try to start a fresh new day with a fresh new hope or feeling. Like I said, if really cannot tahan... will say bye bye to the rest of my good colleagues over there.</div>

Tat bloody colleague of urs is just an old bird trying to exert his seniority on u!  C'mon lah, u shd protest and just leave if u had u job done.  Maybe the rest of ur colleagues will follow suit.<br><br>Just show results to ur management, there shdnt be any questions.  I know of bosses who give lots of freedom to their staffs as long as they produce results.  If ur management is deceived by such low acts, its not a company worth staying as i doubt there will be any prospects.  Everyone should enjoy and love their job.  Then they dont have to work a single day cos everyday is a enjoyable day.<br><br></div>
