            <div class='col-md body'>What's the best way to find out if fat people are ostracised? It's to experience it <strong>FIRST HAND</strong><br>I was 97 kgs before I entered the army. During JC time, I had "suffered" a bit, especially from strangers more than close friends(friends who know you won't mind, but strangers always go by looks first). Girls would hesitate to dance with you during orientation dance. Some will call you names.<br>I noticed also in terms of bgr I was severely disadvantaged. (although I'm not saying all girls go for looks).<br><br>I trained up before going to the army and lost 10 kgs, and during bmt time I lost about 13kgs, thus my current 74kg weight. I'm glad to say I'm slim looking now.<br>And I DO notice that people who don't know you talk and treat you differently. I can tell from their body language and the way they talk.<br><br>It's understandable that people do judge by looks, but then again it's a sad part of life. We all just have to live with it. I know, I myself, for one, will not look at fat people differently.<br><br>------------------<br>"If a picture paints a thousand words, then why can't I paint you?

            <div class='col-md body'>I suppose appearences matter more in fast relationships, character matters in long term ones. Someone already pointed out that some girls, yes, the hot ones, like those people who look athletic. I really have to agree that you can argue that looks shouldn't matter till the cows come home but the fact still stands: looks do matter.<br><br>I don't like the way some not- slim people are treated. Back in Sec school I was one of the members of the Fatty Club in Chinese High. Those that are forced to skip rope a thousand times every monday and have to have your before and hopefully, after, picture taken by the PE head. Doing this for a few years is NOT good for your ego man. Health problems and all that... there are better ways to address that.<br><br>Personally I think people who don't look like models in the size department are not looking for sympathy, they just want equality. But, I don't think that is an easy frame of mind for people who don't have problems in the weight department to hold. In other words, unless you have problems with your weight, you will have a hard time understanding what kind of problems they face.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Pacman..<br>Didn't know you were also a fellow sufferer under the Foo regiment and Dynasty! Who are you? email me your info and maybe I will find out if I do know you. I wonder if you're in the same batch as me, I'm in NUS year 1 now.<br>Glad that you also know we have to experience it before we finally understand it. Not many people realise that though. Oh btw here's my secret code verification:<br>Hai Tian Liao Kuo Yun shu cang long blah blah blah blah blah...<br>Oh btw I forgot to respond to those who insists they believe "Looks will not last and I'm one who believes that"<br>Well let me ask all you insistors a question. Will you consider a guy who is fat as a future boyfriend the very first time that you see him?(and that you're not fat yourself firstly) Do you feel perfect/happy/comfortable walking with him side by side in Orchard Road? Can you say no to the above questions and not blink and eye or sneeze or betray how you really feel?<br>Take note that I refer only to when you just know him, not after a long time of understanding each other. IF you can say yes to the questions, then congrats, you are one of the first few people I have come across who don't give a damn about people being fat. A rare breed indeed. Yes, I do speak in anger because as I write this I am thinking back at all that's happened before to me, and many of my slightly larger friends.<br>------------------<br>"If a picture paints a thousand words, then why can't I paint you?

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmmm.... well funnily most of my good frens tend to be on the fat side. Most of them are good natured and humorous... but they also suffer from problems of getting gfs....<br><br>I guess its a sad fact that is true... unless they happen to be both fat and rich which might make a difference.<br><br>But for fat guys to get gfs is not entirely impossible either. Some of them who are very smooth talkers with girls will have no problems getting the girls... I guess in the end it boils down to their self confidence... which appearance plays such a great part in affecting in our society.<br><br>------------------<br>Why? Why me?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wah lau...i dun want to say so much about character...i say also noone will believe me...but i must at least say that it is too idealsitic to think character above all else...how many here have really gone and tok to strangers or new acquaintences becasue they had character....As far as i can see the better looking person isthe one people flirt with and tok to most...so what's the use of having character if noone wants to bother with you in the first place. (sorry I'm in my negative phase right now...should pass in a few days).<br><br>Just something i encountered before that really put me off.<br><br>Not that I have anything against fat people, but i try not to sit next tiom them most time snow because of a few bad experiences i had on the buss with them.<br><br>First of all, I sit next to anyone who I think doesn't stink.<br><br>this one time I went to sit next to this really fat girl and she stank so badly i had to move or else puke....no joke and i dun claim that all fat people are like this but that was straw number 1.<br><br>This second time i was sitting on the outside of this fat guy and he fell asleep next to me...and his body kept leaning over tio mine and i had to fight for 45 minutes on the 16 bus going home to stay on my seat...a very difficult maneuver to say the least...<br><br>the last straw was when I was sitting on the ionside seat of the 16 bus and this really fat guy comes and sits next to me...he barely fit the seat and pretty much coccooned me to the wall of the bus...which was ok...fine by me because he didn't smell and it's inevitable when he's this big....<br><br>But then a few minutes later he starts to doze off and then the worst thing from a nightmasre happened...his body leaned onto mine and I could barely breath...and I am a very sturdy guy ok...if this guy can onli slightly lean and cause this problem it's really bad.<br><br>I was truly sandwhiched between him...and my head was barely above his fat....it was the only thing that wasn't covered by his body mass....<br><br>i was truly scare dand thought i was going to die if he really fell asleep and fell over me...<br><br>that was it...from then on i just dun even bother,.....but it has nothing to do with a prejudice toward sthem...iw ould come to the smae conclussion if I sat next to old men and they kept farting...after  af ew time si would justy avoid sitting next to them...<br><br>In this society, it is difficult for them to live a normal life because all the scale is done to measure to "smaller" weighted people...so we have problems with seats and stuff like that....<br><br>but then again there is no alternative...Unless they make a ruling that super fat people are handicapped then buildings and vehivles and services will not cater to them...sad case but what can anyone here do...<br><br>Again i am not anti fat....by george i am getting there myself...<br><br></div>

He left in 1995 I think. KS Ang took over. Oh and they scrapped the Saturday runs(which really made me slim down temporarily). Nowadays also they don't really care about hair length cos I see some students with hair that Foo will definitely not approve in his time. hmm..<br><br>Back to the topic, indeed, Fat people are discriminated. But it's even sadder that some people insist and claim that they go for character more. I have to commend Firewire for being frank about his personal confession and experience with fat people(yeah, I stank bad too during my fat sec school days...it's a physical thing I think...).

            <div class='col-md body'>In society, no matter how confident a person is or how well he/she carries him/herself, some people cannot get over the fact that he/she is fat. Granted not everyone has this kind of mindset but I do believe quite a number of people do.<br>There are some misconception about fat people that are very hard (for some people) to dismiss. There is this tendency in society to see fat people as lazy, unhealthy, unfit, etc. It doesn't matter if the person is actually healthy and fit, as long as he/she is fat, he/she is, kind of, branded as lazy.<br>Moreover, nowadays slimness is viewed as an asset. Slim people surely look better than fat people, I do agree with that. However, this is carried away to the extent that fat people are sometimes looked upon as weirdos. This may sound far-fetched if you have no such experience.<br>A person may look confident, self-assured, etc. at the outside but there is only so much one can take. If and when he/she breaks down, it will be in private and nobody will ever see the pain and the hurt that he/she is going through.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dakar<br><br>yes, Moses Lim is rich, and it brings me to another observation.  Fat people are expected to be funny and jolly.  If they are feeling taciturn, many will be offended and become very rude.  This sentiment is shared by that Malay actress, what's her name, the one who plays in Under One Roof, I think.  The only way she could get into acting was by being a comedian.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Someone forwarded this to me and I think it illustrate the point that you have no idea how it feels until you experience it yourself.<br><br>A store owner was tacking a sign above his door that read 'Puppies for Sale'.These signs had a weird way of attracting children. And sure enough, a little boy appeared at the sign. "How much are you going to sell those puppies?" he asked. The store owner replied "Anywhere from $30-$50." The little boy reached into his pocket and pulled out some change. "I have $2.37, can I have a look at them?" The store owner smiled and whistled and out of the kennel came a lady, who ran down the aisle of his store followed by five teeny, tiny balls of fur.<br>One puppy was lagging considerably behind. Immediately the little boy singled out the lagging, limping puppy and said "What's wrong with that little dog?"<br>The store owner explained that when the puppy was born, the vet had said that the puppy had no hip socket and would limp for the rest of itslife. The little boy got really excited and said "That's the puppy I want to buy! "The store owner replied "No, you don't want to buy that little dog. If you really want him, I'll give him to you." The little boy got quite upset. He looked<br>straight into the store owner's eyes, pointing his finger and said, "I don't want you to give him to me. That little dog is worth every bit as much as the other dogs and I'll pay the full price. In fact, I'll give you $2.37 now and 50 cents every month until I have him paid for."<br>The store owner countered, "You really don't want to buy this puppy. He is never gonna be able to run, jump and play like other puppies!" To this the little boy reached down and rolled up his pant leg to reveal a badly twisted, crippled left leg supported by a big metal brace. He looked up at the store owner and said softly, "Well, I don't run so well myself, and the little puppy needs someone who understands."<br><br>IN LIFE, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO YOU ARE,<br>BUT WHETHER SOMEONE APPRECIATES YOU FOR WHAT YOU ARE</div>
