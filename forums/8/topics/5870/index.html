How, chat both of them up?<br><br>I told a friend of mine the above and he said:  "yes, I will talk to them.  ask them how are you's, give them my number etc etc.  "I believe him cos he's a canadian and usually ang mohs "get away" with being so friendly (please don't dispute the get away part)<br><br>I think it's more than look over character.

I dun understand why some ppl simply think they are fat just becos they are slightly more overweight then their skinny counterparts...Gosh!!I keep telling them...U jusy have to eat healthy..not diet..It is really bad for ur health...ANd they are really not FAT!!<br><br>There is once..I was in a dbl decker bus...the upperdeck is simply fully filled except I saw a seat empty...and there is one extremely big gal seating alone...She is about the three of me...but I just smiled to her nicely and said excuse me..and she looked stunned...I was thinking she might have not expected anyone to seat beside her FAT self at all.....<br><br>I think it is quite unfair to just judge ppl by sizes...Just treat them like u treat anyone..Judge and u shalt be judged one day!<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 02 February 2000).]</div>

Yes I agree, first impression does count, but did we forgotten about the 2nd 3rd and so on? If you feel that by going into obscurity you are gonna help you improve your social life, you got to be kidding. why do you think that the guy from the local group "Construction Site" (the big guy I meant, 4got his name something Hidek  I think)can have A babe like Annabelle Francis as his gf? Becuase he is fat? Nah, I think it is more of his talent and condfidence that he has. And being fat definitely has nothing to do with talent.<br><br>I learnt from my other friends who are in the same fat league  as me. So what if I am fat? Ask yourself this question, does it mean that I do not have the right to the happiness as the bamboos out there? Does it meant that I have to become a monk, and not get married for the rest of my life? Does it mean that I am suppose to stay away from all the chio bus out there? WELL NO! Confidence is what I feel you need to have right now, and not just feeling good alone, but to know that you can still have what others have.<br><br>I am still considered on the heavier side of the scale now, but I tell you, I did not give up, I still carry on with my life, I still had my gfs, I still want my big ambition to realise, I still have tons of friends. And most of all, I know that all those did not matter if I am fat or not.<br><br>Train your mind, and polish your character, that is what I always say, They will be your more lasting asset in life. And trust me, if the gals are looking for a husband, then I think these are the things that they look for more, unless you are talking about the childish15-29 yrs old who only knows how to admire the bod of Stallone, the baby face of Leonardo and whom I do not have any interest in.<br><br>I always thought that those beautiful women who choose the fat guy with the mind and character rather than the himbo have a special something in them, now these are those with depth and these are those who see far ahead. Learn to think like these women and you know where to head to.<br><br>Now I am not trying to raise any fire with all the women out there with the cute guys as their partner in life here. I am just stating a point saying that, fat guys do have their value too if they  want to make themself so.<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 worth</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guess Fat Ppl do have disadvantage. But still, characters stand out from the internal to the external. I am sure with a kind heart, u r able to surpass those with slim n nice figures but black heart. I will rather have a gf who has more weight but with a gd heart than a gal with gd figure but black heart.<br><br>I agree that 1st impression is always to the external but how long can that last. When u got to know the person better, the external will not b that important anymore agree?? 4 those ppl with slightly more weight, dun feel down, i m bery sure that 1 day u will find ur love ......<br>trust mi<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>cheers<br><br>------------------<br>One line has no meaning, another line is needed to give it expression.<br><a href="http://zhaoyun.cjb.net" rel="nofollow">zhaoyun.cjb.net</a><br><a href="mailto:zhaoyun@onebox.com" rel="nofollow">zhaoyun@onebox.com</a><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Callan: You know what?? i am the same age as what you said were... i am 17 now. I really hope NS would cut some fat off me... I agree with what you said, but at my age, you can't help but looking around you, seeing your friends all attached, or have been attached b4. No one has ever said you are handsome or anything. that kinda of lowers your selfesteem right?? But i will go ahead and chase the gers i like anyways..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">well, thx guys.. ^^</div>
