Their real estate isn't exactly what we'd call a prime location.<br><br>So their army's backbone are the conscripts, just like Singapore's. What would conscripts feel if they knew when they got kidnapped no one would go looking for them? If you were kidnapped and put under threat of death, which would you want? Even if they didn't say "We'll kill your guys if you don't concede to us", I doubt their intention was along the lines of, "Back off Israel, or we'll subject your kidnapped soldiers to a lifelong hell of manicures and spa treatments."<br><br>1: A bunch of suits negotiating for your release, making concessions on your behalf and when you go home you found that Sentosa was given to the kidnappers in order for your safe return.<br><br>2: SWAT, HRT, Delta, SAS and the like plus our very own SOC blazing in on armed terrorists, not civilians, the very same ones pointing guns at your head, and when they take off that balaclava and look at you to say, "Hey, we're Singaporeans, and we're here to take you home to your family"<br><br>Both has its plus points. I'm not in favor of violence, but sometimes I guess a hard strike is needed when soft approaches have been failing. I do agree with you that hiding behind innocent and untrained civilians is very cowardly.</div>

They pressured the Hamas government to negotiate for their release but felt it was taking too long and hence went on the warpath and sent in their army.</div>

If the party is not so warring in nature, the civilians won't get hit by others as their party will practise a non-violence policy. Whoever say US muz step into every single conflict in this world? They view themselves as world policeman? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Now question is who have more say? US or UN ? Note that UN is made up of a lot of nations whereas US is just one. Are multiple nations no match for one single nation called US?
