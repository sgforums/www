            <div class='col-md body'>I also don't know why the Hizbollah pick a fight with Israel... For 6yrs the Israel never bother them, Beirut was prospering. Israel also never go and intentionally provoke Lebanon butt they still want to attack Israel.<br><br>The Hizbollah know that they attack Israel sure lose one and most probably be at the wrong end of a Israeli missile. So, coward as they are, they choose to hide behind civilians and use them as shields. And when the Civilians die, they scream and shake their fist at Israel then go on TV crying and kpkb.<br><br>So funny, when Israel assassinate the leaders of the enemy alone, they kena so much flak from the UN, say its unethical. But when they bomb enemy troops, they say don't bomb coz will affect the civilians. I wonder how the countries that kpkb the Israel will say when their own city kena suicide bomber. They will so kind say lets sit down and talk ah.<br><br>If your platoon under attack by some enemy hiding in a crowd of civilians, would you order your troops to fire knowing that you will kill the enemy as well as some civilians or, would you for the fear of hitting the civilians ask your troops to hold fire and looking at your platoon mates die one by one under enemy fire....
