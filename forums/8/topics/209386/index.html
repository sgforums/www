            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps you can also consider moving your sleep schedule a little forward/ earlier. Maybe in this way you can spend more daytime period with your kids on the weekends.<br><br>Meanwhile on weekdays when you work, do you stay late and work because you are a hard worker? If you are able to go home at 5pm or 5.30pm that will be better. Some people just stay late and continue to work although officially they can go home and continue the next day. Perhaps you can try and see whether you can set a tighter schedule, stop at 5pm or 5.30pm. If you think it's needed you can talk to your boss and tell him you want to spend more time with kids, and tell him you promise to maintain work standards.<br><br>Maybe you try to workaround through these issues first...then see how it goes for you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What I'm curious about is what job are you in that makes you so tired after work / on weekends that you have to sleep all the time and can't even talk to your kids ?   And is your job paying you enough for the time and effort it takes from you ?<br><br>Maybe you should find an easier or less stressful job, or one that's nearer to home.</div>
