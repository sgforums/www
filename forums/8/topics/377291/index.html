              <p>I have a friend who is currently studying in one of the school in the east. He was being unfairly treated by the teachers in his school. Just yesterday, he was being punished and <strong>indirectly</strong> stripped off his post as a Vice-chairman of his CCA due to an incident. I felt that this matter is not directly his fault, or I can simply say its not his fault at all.</p>
              <p>Ok, it happens that my friend gave his classmate the DM's phone number. Then, his classmate for no reason went to prank call his DM and somehow she got caught. She sabotaged by admitting that the number was given by my friend. So my friend gt called up and severely punished by the DM. The DM did not gave my friend any chance to explain himself. He said he does not want any explanations.</p>
              <p>Thus, as said above, my friend got severly punished and also indirectly causing him to be demoted from his CCA without getting a chance to explain anything.</p>
              <p>Firstly, I think that its definitely the classmate's fault. My friend is not the one prank-calling. I don't think he should be punished. One should not be liable for an offence made by someone else. Secondly, I don't think passing a phone number to others is an offence too.</p>
              <p>I felt that his DM was getting too personal, and did not settle this in an unbias and logical manner. In conclusion, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the main point here is that students were not given any chance to explain themselves</span> due to educator's impulsiveness.</p>
              <p>Add on: My friend got the number from somewhere else, not by the DM himself. So i think this is the explanation for the issue in "Abusing of trust".  If you were to ask if he was wrong in passing it. I would say not really.</p>

              <p>Yup. Fortunately TS's friend learnt it the hard way in school instead of in the corporate world. By then it will be too late already. </p>

              <p>Not so easy lor.</p>
              <p>The victim have to make police report and the police will tell him that this is not a criminal case so he have to make magistrate complain.</p>
              <p>After he have made the magistrate complain, the court will order the police to investigate and than the police will get the service provider to trace the call.</p>
              <p>When they find out who the person is, the police will only give the person a warning.</p>
              <p>I know this because I made prank call before and after the victim went throug all the hassle to make magistrate complain I only get a warning <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><strong>his classmate for no reason went to prank call his DM</strong> Where got no reason and suka suka prank people wan, somemore this is the DM! your friend not telling the whole story.</p>
              <p><strong>somehow she got caught. She sabotaged by admitting that the number was given by my friend</strong> stupid enough to get caught, and then sabotaged yr friend! hello, why you blame the DM and not the girl? actually she just admitted the truth, sabotage means she said your friend did it when he didn't.</p>

              <p>1) My friend got the number from somewhere else, not by the DM himself. So i think this is the explanation for the issue in "Abusing of trust".  If you were to ask if he was wrong in passing it. I would say not really. And sry for the misunderstanding, but fyi the DM is not in charge with that his CCA at all.</p>
              <p>2) I don't think we need a reason to prank call someone? If not that wont be call "prank", dun you tink so?.</p>
              <p>3) ok thats call backstab den.</p>

              <p>To me, give out DM personal phone number is not wrong, you can say you thought your friend has something really important to call.</p>
              <p>The DM wants to 'scare' everyone, so he/she tries this method so that students will feel scared.</p>
              <p>Must make one thing clear. Your friend give out the DM's number out of good will. He/she did not organise the prank call. Even if your friend did, die die dont admit.</p>
              <p>DM not giving chance for students to explain is very common. I believe most DM think that they are 'powerful', and have the temptation to abuse abit. In my school, i dare to say sometimes even teachers dont give their students a chance to explain, even if they do, they don't want to lose face and will insist that they are correct.</p>
              <p>Remember, in a school, other teachers are like collegues to the DM. You never know if they can work together to kick your friend's ass just to 'prove themselves right' or to 'show to the whole school they are tough'. Teachers are older, more experience, smarter, more power, and they can be corrupted themselves also. I am not trying to say they are corrupted, bt from your post it seems like the DM is not a very nice person to play with, and if i put myself in the DM's shoes and i can think of corruption, i think they can too.</p>
              <p>What i suggest you can do is to write a letter to the school's principal about the incident</p>
              <p>If you are writting a letter(which i tink you should),try to be a little 'forceful' and serious, using firm language like:</p>
              <p>I am not going to let my friend take the punishment because he is being wrongly accused, thus i wish the school would investigate the matter deeper, and not make my friend a 'scrapegoat'</p>
              <p>instead of writing:</p>
              <p>I really hope that the school would try and find out who is at wrong, and hope appropraite measures can be carried out</p>
              <p>Both meant the same thing but the 1st one seems more impactful</p>
              <p>Maybe you can send a copy of this letter to MOE<br><br>The above may only work if your friend really have no plans of prank calling and is only helping out of goodwill</p>
              <p>but it is just about the vice president position right?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
