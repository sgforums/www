              <p>If there is a fight in school, and the DM is in the office, is it wrong to ask some one else for the DM's number and call him to inform him about the issue?</p>
              <p>Did the DM give out his/her number to person 1?</p>
              <p>if yes, further question by saying if you are the DM, and based on your experience in dealing with students, why did you give it out without thinking that it will cause this?</p>
              <p>And then after that ask what happened to person 1 again.</p>
              <p>And then say "i believe my friend is not so stupid and immature to give out the DM's number for prank calling". [In directly saying the dm is not very wise in his actions]</p>

              <p>Is the phone number an office number or house or handphone?</p>

              <p>If he is a teacher, and u wan to win, you can use the bear's method of betrayed by a person who is entrusted with responsibility. You can say the teacher should be more responsible etc etc, why did the teacher give it out?</p>
              <p>If he/she is a student, and she gave it out of good intention, why is it wrong</p>
              <p>Did the DM say ' do not give out number?', if yes, need to think of another solution<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>And since it is the case, the DM should also be responsible for his stuff, and by giving out his number, he can be making a mistake himself.</p>

              <p><br>Your friend is holding a position of authority, if he himself don't behave as though he is one, then he should definitely be strip off that post. There is something called privacy, and he as a leader, should know it better than any of your fellow schoolmates. I believe the DM number was there so that he could give a helping hand in times of emergency.</p>

              <p>And there is a reason behind everything. Prank calls cause you were bored? How about people use your number and prank call on you, I believe you would flare your top much more than the DM.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think its time that you reflect with your friends on who is in the wrong. Your DM is a figure of authority, by stripping your friend off his post, its already considered pian yi ta le.</p>

              <p>Firstly, I think that its definitely the classmate's fault. My
                                      friend is not the one prank-calling. I don't think he should be
                                      punished. One should not be liable for an offence made by someone
                                      else. Secondly, I don't think passing a phone number to others
                                      is an offence too.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>1) Why would the friend even give out the phone number when the DM is not related to anything he/she or his/her friend is doing in school other than disciplinary issues?</p>
              <p>2) Making prank calls without knowing there's such a thing as caller-ID and hence not taking precautions for it?</p>

              <p>1) My friend got the number from somewhere else, not by the DM himself. So i think this is the explanation for the issue in "Abusing of trust".  If you were to ask if he was wrong in passing it. I would say not really. And sry for the misunderstanding, but fyi the DM is not in charge with that his CCA at all.</p>

              <p><br>even if trust abuse is a non-issue, it still doesnt justify how one can give away the DM's number just like that.</p>
              <p>Wrong alrdy admit mistake and move on la.....still wana argue. So what if DM made a fuss and refused to listen to explanations? If ur fren had followed basic principles on privacy of mobile numbers, this day wouldnt have come.</p>

              <p>Even if we don't talk about prank calling. You said about the chance of explaining, your friend can always write a letter to the principal to explain his/ her actions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chances are, the letter should be on the apology side, not trying to push the blame away. Even if your friend get back to the position of VP, would his teacher ic still trust him on the private and confidential information concerning the cca?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are already in the wrong, why bother to explain. Trying to reinstate your friend? Or trying to say to appeal for that action? Pretty clear cut uh.</p>

              <p>actually. it is certainly wrong to give out other's numbers without consent. but i suppose in a school, exceptions have to be created. one cannot totally deem the giving out of a teacher's number in a school without consent as downright rude.</p>
              <p>this exception especially applies if the student knows the teacher(and of course needs the number for schoolwork consultation purposes etc). how many times do you want the subject representative to sms the subject teacher asking if his/hers number can be given to a classmate? wont sian? if you teach 200 students, are you going to reply 200 of those smses?</p>
              <p>i guess what the ts's friend did wrong is that he gave the number out to a student whom the DM does not know(and probably has no business with). unless if you know the person ure giving the number to needs to settle some important stuff with the DM(at least you have a valid reason + the DM knows of this person + hence prank calls unlikely), youre much better off keeping the DM's number to yourself. DMs arent usually much fun to play with. </p>
              <p>and your friend should have denied all the accusations made by the person whom he gave the number to. just deny everything, no proof anyway, simply let the other shit friend kenna all the hot soup(: </p>
