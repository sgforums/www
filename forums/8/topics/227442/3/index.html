She promise to wait for me. My bmi is only like 18, and i m quite tall than most ppl here.<br><br>However i had a really tough time as i got a part time waitering job and sch, beside training in the gym. Due to the eagerness to achieve fast results, i overtrain and therfore after each session, i will be so freaking tired and muscles sore for days, and my underpaying waitering job is devoing me of my energy.<br><br>2 weeks later, which is around one week after my birthday, i just could not mentally cope le. I ask myself why she cant accept me for who i am, she has being with skinny pierre for 4 yrs le, nw suddenly cannot stand the old myself. When she commented why am i so skinny in april, i was really hurt though i keep it to myself.<br><br>i replied to her by sms, that i am letting her go, i am giving up on training.<br>Great sia, a few days later, she go steady with this quite fit guy like marco_simone size, and is younger by 2 yrs than her. Also recognise that it was the same guy with her for the part time job she got during her holidays in may<br><br>I blame myself, why am i so Bu Shan Jing<br>Why do i give up a person who basically is the person who understand me the most, she noes what am i thinking even though i nv say anithing<br><br>I am angry at myself<br>So i began go to gym again, the fuel that keeps me going is a chance to see her again, to impress her for a last time. Even if alone, i also go myself without my fren who gave up halfway. It goes abit out of hand that i started going on the 1st opening hours like 7am, 8.30am once every 2 days.<br><br>I resist ani chance to contact her ever since she del me on msn. I told myself until i achieve some results, i wun see her.<br><br>I lost a lot of frens in the meantime, coz mostly i kept to myself, and pretty quiet too.<br><br>It has been around 4 mths le. my bmi is close to 22 le. Though i think i am considered only as lean, still manage to put a shock look on my uni classmates faces as i gain like 10 kg, thus looking like a before and after pic.<br><br>I have been patiently waiting for a chance to see her again in the old me with a new body. Nw my dreams are shattered. And my stupid brain is nt giving me a break, on average i dream of her once a week.<br><br>Tell u one funny thing, there was once i dreamt of her 3 times in a row in the same nite (i woke up 3 times)<br><br>To love someone is to let her go.<br>I am not going to kick a fuss or criticise her or act anithing like a sore loser<br>Rather i am wishing her to be always happy and hope her bf treats her better than me.<br><br>I am a lousy bf who take things for granted last time, always quarrelling with her over stupid thing<br>honestly she deserved a lot better. She is not to blame for our breakup, i accept the fact that i am just not gd for her.<br><br>Do i still love her? i guess so ba but it will be just a feeling in a corner of my heart. But i m not going to be a third party in their relationship, and i wun want to see them quarrel over me either.<br><br>I am not ready for any relationship yet, to be truthful, i am rather scared to be hurt again. Give me more time to recover ba<br><br>=)<br><br>feels a lot better nw le.<br>xie xie for listening to my whinings<br>omg why a guy so luo suo one<br><br>Dun worry i am ok le<br>yea yea<br>I dun have a blog so sometimes i make sgforum like a personal blog, i noe some ppl complaining already haa<br><br></div>
