College, girls,<br>&gt;<br>&gt;career, and life itself got in the way. In fact, Jack moved clear across<br>&gt;<br>&gt;the country in pursuit of his dreams. There, in the rush of his busy<br>&gt;<br>&gt;life, Jack had little time to think about the past and often no time to<br>&gt;<br>&gt;spend with his wife and son. He was working on his future, and nothing<br>&gt;<br>&gt;could stop him.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Over the phone, his mother told him, "Mr. Belser died last night. The<br>&gt;<br>&gt;funeral is Wednesday." Memories flashed through his mind like an old<br>&gt;<br>&gt;newsreel as he sat quietly remembering his childhood days.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"Jack, did you hear me?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"Oh, sorry, Mom. Yes, I heard you. It's been so long since I thought of<br>&gt;<br>&gt;him. I'm sorry, but I honestly thought he died years ago," Jack said.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"Well, he didn't forget you. Every time I saw him he'd ask how you were<br>&gt;<br>&gt;doing. He'd reminisce about the many days you spent over 'his side of<br>&gt;<br>&gt;the fence' as he put it," Mom told him.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"I loved that old house he lived in," Jack said.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"You know, Jack, after your father died, Mr Belser stepped in to make<br>&gt;<br>&gt;sure you had a man's influence in your life," she said.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"He's the one who taught me carpentry," he said. "I wouldn't be in this<br>&gt;<br>&gt;business if it weren't for him. He spent a lot of time teaching me<br>&gt;<br>&gt;things he thought were important...Mom, I'll be there for the funeral,"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Jack said. As busy as he was, he kept his word. Jack caught the next<br>&gt;flight to<br>&gt;<br>&gt;his hometown. Mr. Belser's funeral was small and uneventful. He had no<br>&gt;<br>&gt;children of his own, and most of his relatives had passed away.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;The night before he had to return home, Jack and his Mom stopped by to<br>&gt;<br>&gt;see the old house next door one more time.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Standing in the doorway, Jack paused for a moment. It was like crossing<br>&gt;<br>&gt;over into another dimension, a leap through space and time. The house<br>&gt;<br>&gt;was exactly as he remembered. Every step held memories. Every picture,<br>&gt;<br>&gt;every piece of furniture....Jack stopped suddenly.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"What's wrong, Jack?" his Mom asked.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"The box is gone," he said<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"What box?" Mom asked.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"There was a small gold box that he kept locked on top of his desk. I<br>&gt;<br>&gt;must have asked him a thousand times what was inside. All he'd ever tell<br>&gt;<br>&gt;me was 'the thing I value most,'" Jack said.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;It was gone. Everything about the house was exactly how Jack remembered<br>&gt;<br>&gt;it, except for the box. He figured someone from the Belser family had<br>&gt;taken it.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"Now I'll never know what was so valuable to him," Jack said. "I better<br>&gt;<br>&gt;get some sleep. I have an early flight home, Mom."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;It had been about two weeks since Mr. Belser died. Returning home from<br>&gt;<br>&gt;work one day Jack discovered a note in his mailbox. "Signature required<br>&gt;<br>&gt;on a package. No one at home. Please stop by the main post office within<br>&gt;<br>&gt;the next three days," the note read.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Early the next day Jack  retrieved the package. The small box was old<br>&gt;<br>&gt;and looked like it had been mailed a hundred years ago. The handwriting<br>&gt;<br>&gt;was difficult to read, but the return address caught his attention.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"Mr. Harold Belser" it read. Jack took the box out to his car and ripped<br>&gt;<br>&gt;open the package. There inside was the gold box and an envelope. Jack's<br>&gt;<br>&gt;hands shook as he read the note inside.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"Upon my death, please forward this box and its contents to Jack<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Barnes. It's the thing I valued most in my life." A small key was taped<br>&gt;<br>&gt;to the letter. His heart racing, as tears filling his eyes, Jack<br>&gt;<br>&gt;carefully unlocked the box. There inside he found a beautiful gold<br>&gt;pocket watch.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Running his fingers slowly over the finely etched casing, he unlatched<br>&gt;<br>&gt;the cover. Inside he found these words engraved:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"Jack, Thanks for your time! -Harold Belser."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"The thing he valued most...was...my time."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Jack held the watch for a few minutes, then called his office and<br>&gt;<br>&gt;cleared his appointments for the next two days. "Why?" Janet, his<br>&gt;<br>&gt;assistant asked.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"I need some time to spend with my son," he said.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"Oh, by the way, Janet...thanks for your time!"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take but by the<br>&gt;<br>&gt;moments that take our breath away,"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Think about this. You may not realize it, but it's 100% true.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. At least 2 people in this world love you so much they would<br>&gt;<br>&gt;die for you.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;2. At least 15 people in this world love you in some way.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;3. A smile from you can bring happiness to anyone, even if they<br>&gt;<br>&gt;don't like you.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;4. Every night, SOMEONE thinks about you before they go to sleep.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;5. You mean the world to someone.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;6. If not for you, someone may not be living.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;7. You are special and unique.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;8. When you think you have no chance of getting what you want,<br>&gt;<br>&gt;you probably won't get it, but if you trust God to do what's best, and<br>&gt;<br>&gt;wait on His time, sooner or later, you will get it or something better.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;9. When you make the biggest mistake ever, something good can<br>&gt;<br>&gt;still come from it.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;10. When you think the world has turned its back on you, take a<br>&gt;<br>&gt;look: you most likely turned your back on the world.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;11. Someone that you don't even know exists loves you.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;12. Always remember the compliments you received. Forget about<br>&gt;<br>&gt;the rude remarks.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;13. Always tell someone how you feel about them; you will feel<br>&gt;<br>&gt;much better when they know and you'll both be happy.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;14. If you have a great friend, take the time to let them know<br>&gt;<br>&gt;that they are great.</div>
