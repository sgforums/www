            <div class='col-md body'>It is fated that the first relationship had to come to an end.  Since there's two more new relationship, I don't think that it is fair to those two who are innocent to this case.  However, I am not saying that the couple are at fault too.  It is all fated.  To love a person is to set the person free.  If I m the one who has lost memory, since the memory is lost, and I had chosen the current one as partner, even if I regain my memory, I shouldn't just leave that person.  I will be hurting him/her.<br>All things comes to an end.  No doubt sad, but this is life.  Nothing is permanent and once things had changed, nothing can be done to bring it back to past.</div>
