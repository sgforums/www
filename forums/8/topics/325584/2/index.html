              <p><br>chibet, better if you read the firearms act before u start using ball bearings. using ball bearings will add to ur criminal intent. and getting caught wif using ball bearings on ur hi-powered airsoft(if modified) is as good as getting ur ass charged under the firearms act.</p>
              <p>clat, the abnn will send the parcel to u, knowing already wats the contents. once u sign the package, u'll see two officers walking to u with cuffs. this is not a hypothetical situaltion, but actual procedures. oh, expect a raid too.</p>

              <p><strong>He and his friend was arrested at the custom and his friend has 2 set of disassembled airsoft weapon.</strong></p>
              <p>wrong idea to bring all the disassembled parts through customs at once as customs officers can reassembled it to know what you are trying to get through.</p>
              <p>put it this way, if the guy was caught with 2 parts of the dissassembled set, would the customs guy know what is the assembled item.</p>

              <p>The idea of ownign firearmsn,be it airsoft or real weapon has the same charge of a death sentence for Singapore.  Especially if the weapon was  misused at any criminal situation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since ChiBet took the risk of keeping weapons at home or even at a locker, we can only assume that ChiBet would not mind one day being persuecuted.  So its frankly none of our concern.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am personally not really upset about it since I known a lot more friends keeping such airsoft or messaged me about disposing their airsoft.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I should also mentioned that I've been to a friends home with his about 15 &amp; growing real firearms and was very impressed.</p>

              <p>As an airsoft skirmisher and owner in UK, I cannot stress the importance of understanding the rules and regulations associated with owning realistic imitation firearms (RIF), understanding the safety procedures and the responsibility of owning one.</p>
              <p>As the owner of a RIF, it is your responsibility to ensure that your RIFs are only used in a responsible manner, and remain covered up at all times when transporting them in public.</p>
              <p>If stopped by police(this applies only to countries where airsoft is legal), be open, honest, upfront, and cooperate fully with them.</p>
              <p>Finally, in UK to buy a RIF, you need to provide proof that you are a skirmisher, military re-enactor, work in the film industry or in the security/police/military industry and have a valid need to buy and own RIFs.</p>
              <p>Personally I own about 10 RIFs. even when plinking into my own yard I make it a point to never have even part of the weapon sticking out into the yard.</p>

              <p>As the owner of a RIF, it is your responsibility to ensure that your RIFs are only used in a responsible manner, and remain covered up at all times when transporting them in public.</p>
              <p>If stopped by police(this applies only to countries where airsoft is legal), be open, honest, upfront, and cooperate fully with them.</p>
              <p>Finally, in UK to buy a RIF, you need to provide proof that you are a skirmisher, military re-enactor, work in the film industry or in the security/police/military industry and have a valid need to buy and own RIFs.</p>
              <p>Personally I own about 10 RIFs. even when plinking into my own yard I make it a point to never have even part of the weapon sticking out into the yard.</p>

              <p><br> chibet, better if you read the firearms act before u start using
              ball bearings. using ball bearings will add to ur criminal intent.
              and getting caught wif using ball bearings on ur hi-powered
              airsoft(if modified) is as good as getting ur ass charged under the
              firearms act.</p>
              <p>clat, the abnn will send the parcel to u, knowing already wats
              the contents. once u sign the package, u'll see two officers
              walking to u with cuffs. this is not a hypothetical situaltion, but
              actual procedures. oh, expect a raid too.</p>
              <p>fyi, an old chap was fined sgd50k for bringing in 10pcs of china

              <p>Ever since I discovered this wonderful sport.(Loved guns when I was small) and seeing that SG ban it,I tend to look at my country in a negative light.Not to say the country sucks but I think it is a safe and good country to be in.But look what the Government handles things like this.They never consider about their citizens.As long something causes harm /problem/unrest in the nation like chewing gum,they just completely ban it.Case closed.No exceptions.KPKB does not help.It is a safe and nice country,but freedom is restricted.No freedom of speech.Assemble outside Istana lands you in in a police station.If other countries have no/little problems with Airsoft,I don't understand why we can't play it too.Plus,we are a police state so it should pose no problem.Remember when it first came in SG.Kids can buy it(NO AGE RESTRICTIONS???) and play biang biang at the void decks.Judging by this,the gahmen can be considered sleeping.Playing at the local community centres is a waste of time.IMO:<br>1.Expensive(courses,guns)</p>
              <p>2.We shoot paper targets.And what i heard the ISPC thingy?Join the Olympics then.</p>
              <p>3.Airsoft was created to emulate combat.Skirmishing.Singapore has jungles we can put to good use.</p>
              <p>4.Buying guns for twice the price and keeping it with them?That's very DISGUSTING,to be frank.Can't blame them though.Blame the gahmen!License problems.</p>
              <p>We have to thank the CCs though for trying to promote this sport,but then it is not working at the moment.Airsofters over the world play this sport discreetly,like a taboo stuff because of it's vulnerability.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Gahmen,don't laugh when you see me with one of the 1000 people that imigrate every year move to another country that has Airsoft.</p>

              <p>I'm pretty sure threadstarter meant to have airsoft rifles.</p>
              <p>And I have to say I am glad I do not live in Singapore. Although I did not move to another country due to airsoft. But the ban on airsoft is just one indication of our government's stance and attitude, and thats one of the reasons I left.</p>
              <p>Anyways, dump pouch as promised. I wear it in front of my drop leg. The belt buckle is meant to sit dead center at the front of the waist so you can estimate where the dump pouch would be given its relative position to the drop leg. It's easy to just bring my weapon close-in to my body and hit the mag release. After a few practices on a soft carpeted floor, you'll have no problems making sure your mags drop automatically into the dump pouch. Some other people prefer wearing it on the left side or behind, and manually grab their ejected mags and drop it into the pouch.</p>
