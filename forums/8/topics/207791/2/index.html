            <div class='col-md body'>but the thing here is, does he even have the quality to make it as 1 of the heavenly kings in HK? his singing as of compared to aaron and leon is better, but for andy, i beg to differ. u see the difference in the kings that we know of, are each of their individual talents, something which i cant find in leon but at least he got some looks. If eason becomes a king for his singing then i would have cried foul. Why not let Justin take the place? dragg have u ever heard of Justin's songs b4? if u have, i'm sure u can tell which is better. if u have not, i'll be glad to give u a link to go listen.<br><br>and even andy does not have a 1 yr promotion on his album and yet eason expects to have a 1 yr promotion on his album. dun u think this is abit crazy?<br><br>lets not talk about this king issue for awhile, and get back to the 1 yr promo thingy he wanted,  given an asian artist who is well known in the asian market and the US market, take Jay for example, even Jay also nvr expect to have a 1 yr promo on his own album, so what reason does eason have to get himself a 1 yr promo?  and promos doesnt come cheap u know.<br><br>Yes i admit i'm a Jay fan, but i'm speaking about popularity lvl of eason here, and his expectations. He shld really drop that idea and start thinking of how to gain his popularity lvl back up b4 he really have to stop singing or cutting any albums.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Think he never mention anything about himself taking over as the one of the Kings of stuff like that.<br><br>Andy Lau's or anyone's vocal is subjective to anyone's liking. Personally, I do not think that Andy is a great singer. Jacky Cheung is the one that wins with both hands down. Again, that is subjective.<br><br>Of course, pertaining to the 1-year-promo thingy, I believe his point across is, there is no sincerity in the music industry, especially in the Mandarin music scene.<br>Take for example, S.H.E. They can cut like, 2 to 3 albums in a year, and guess what, a Best Of S.H.E at the end of the year. Obviously, those are sub-standard productions. Their promo is definitely insufficient, and I need not spell out what and how are they being marketed.<br><br>Again, my views are my views. Subjective.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>By having a concert in less than a year into the music industry tells you what actually. Firstly, he or she does not even have enough songs to last 2 hours. So probably, he or she will have to just rip songs from others.<br><br>Unless you telling me this artiste composes his/her own music, and he will perform all the works he has composed for others during his concert, then maybe that is something different.<br><br>My point is, you must have at least some years of experience in the scene, along with at least a few albums, which he will pick out only the best songs, to hold a concert. Obviously, you will only pay to enjoy 2 hours of the best songs he or she can provide.<br><br>Other than that, is pure marketing antics, pure ridiculous.</div>
