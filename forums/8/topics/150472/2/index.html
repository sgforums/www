Up until 1977, the only space movies to look truly realistic were 2001 and Silent Running, thanks to fx wiz Douglas Trumbull.  But he was still moving models and cameras by hand, and compositing layers of effects inside the camera.  It took a team (called Industrial Light &amp; Magic) led by John Dykstra to introduce cameras that could repeat a particular motion over and over again, with precision.<br><br>Each X-Wing, each Tie-fighter, each explosion was filmed separately over a blue background, with the camera moving.  Later, the blue was used to create a "matte" that was a punch-out of each ship; the many layers (sometimes dozens) were finally overlaid to create the final shot.<br><br>Although this was a breakthrough procedure, it was still tedious, time-consuming and limiting.  Foreground elements were physical models, built by hand and blown up by hand too.  Background elements were paintings, without movement.  Lucas' frustration with the limits imposed on him for Star Wars, Empire and Jedi led ILM to push the boundaries of computer special effects.  ILM did the first "morph" (one shape changing to another) in 1988's Willow, the "pseudopod" in The Abyss (1989), the liquid metal robot in Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991) and the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park (1993).<br><br>For ILM, the 1999 Phantom Menace was the culmination of more than two decades work.  The vast majority of the effects in the film have been created digitally, on a computer.  "Effects" is perhaps the wrong word, since many of the sets and even characters are now computer-generated</div>
