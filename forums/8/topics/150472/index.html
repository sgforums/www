            <div class='col-md body'>My list will be:<br><br><strong>Back to the future series:-</strong><br>I think this series is long dead as Michael J fox had become too old for a new role.The series was great for its humour, enigmatic characters and exciting scenes which kept the viewer on their edge of the seats with a dfferent twist to time travel movies<br><br><strong>Indiana Jones trilogy:- </strong><br>A true classic adventure series. A sequel is planned to be released in 2006 2 decades later. Whether Harrison Ford will be in it is a different matter. Much can be said about this series which dwelled on the line between the intellectual and the barbaric kind. Dr jones, both an intellectual respected archeology professor and someone who doesnt give up on himself that easily for the quest of the unknown.<br><br><strong>Star Wars trilogy:-</strong><br>Saw a revival in the 2000s. Same style nothing had changed.A great epitome of special effects of the new age. The first Star Wars in 1980 was a great breakthru in Hollywood special effects technology. It was a marvel at the time and people were raving about the movie. As the sequels were released, to surpass the movie before it getting better and better. The series was dead in the 90s only to be revived in the 2000s with the newer CG based effects.In all the series kept true to its roots.<br><br><strong>Die Hard series:-</strong><br>The smart cop, John Maclane will be back in part 4 after the 3 movies. The movies had a new concept of a superhero who is just as normal &amp; vulnerable as the rest around him. What sets him apart  was his determination to survive. Die Hard 2 was released 2 years later in 1990  Christmas and ran with some success with a more dramatic story and action.Die Hard with a Vengeance in 1995 cashed in on the "Bomb fad" movies of the early 1990s.<br><br><strong>Rambo series:-</strong><br>Nobody knows where is Stallone nowadays. But there had been rumours that he will be back in a 4th movie for  one last time. The first movie was a hit and Rambo 2 was an even bigger success set in the vietcong jungle where captive POWs were still being held. The last sequel being Rambo 3 in 1988 was a moderate success and set in the backdrop Afghanistan Soviet conflict. The movies had a concept of "smart action" using both wits and brains. The epitome of excessive violence in war movies as well. An idol for the restless young men of the '80s<br><br><strong>ALIEN series:-</strong><br><br>It is a terrifying landmark trilogy in the sci fi horror genre  and  had the longest running revival period from the 1980s to the 1990s.For the first time the movies painted a bleak possiblilty of hostile lifeforms outside our own planet. The first 2 movies were handled by famous directors like Ridley Scott and James Cameroon. Both were classics one cant forget who grew up in the period. The followup Aliens in 1986 laden with much improved full blown special effects by Cameroon was a box office successor and technically brilliant for its time. The 1993 followup, Alien 3 directed by the present cult director David Fincher was too underrated and artistic and dealt with religious themes to gain the attention of the fans of the previous 2 installments. It was  box office flop as well as a critical success.<br>The last being Alien Resurrection in 1997 received mixed response.<br>Presently there are being talks from Fox Studious about a 5th movie in which Sigourney Weaver returns as LT. Allen Ripley<br><br><strong>Predator Movies:-</strong><br><br>An undeniable classic was the 1st movie with the muscle bound actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. When first released in 1987, it showed the first glimpse of what the future of special effects will be like in the following decade by employing state of the art effects to give the near CG quality "invisible predator scenes". The heat photography and well choreographed smooth flowing action scenes was another highlight. The widely underrated followup Predator 2 released in 1990 shifting focus to urban violence with more mindless gore and violence but had a more Tv like episode feel and didnt go down well with the fans of the original movie. Nevertheless it had the same thrill and excitement only to be let down by the poor amatuerish performance of the cast, lacking the charisma and team spirit of the original Predator. No sequel at present is currently being planned as of now but the consensus show that many will be eager to have one more outing with Arnie.<br><br><strong>The Terminator movies</strong><br><br>What's there to say., a very futuristic movie for its time. The first one in 1984 was a an action classic, the sequel T2 released in 1991 and directed by Cameroon set an all time box office record with its then new CG effects. One of the best movies ever created in modern cinema history. The movie propelled CG Based special effects to a whole new level.<br>The last sequel Terminator 3 was released in 2003 to lukewarm response</div>

The followup Aliens in 1986 laden with much improved full blown special effects by Cameroon was a box office successor and technically brilliant for its time. The 1993 followup, Alien 3 directed by the present cult director David Fincher was too underrated and artistic and dealt with religious themes to gain the attention of the fans of the previous 2 installments. It was  box office flop as well as a critical success.<br>The last being Alien Resurrection in 1997 received mixed response.<br>Presently there are being talks from Fox Studious about a 5th movie in which Sigourney Weaver returns as LT. Allen Ripley<br><br><strong>Predator Movies:-</strong><br><br>An undeniable classic was the 1st movie with the muscle bound actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. When first released in 1987, it showed the first glimpse of what the future of special effects will be like in the following decade by employing state of the art effects to give the near CG quality "invisible predator scenes". The heat photography and well choreographed smooth flowing action scenes was another highlight. The widely underrated followup Predator 2 released in 1990 shifting focus to urban violence with more mindless gore and violence but had a more Tv like episode feel and didnt go down well with the fans of the original movie. Nevertheless it had the same thrill and excitement only to be let down by the poor amatuerish performance of the cast, lacking the charisma and team spirit of the original Predator. No sequel at present is currently being planned as of now but the consensus show that many will be eager to have one more outing with Arnie.<br><br><strong>The Terminator movies</strong><br><br>What's there to say., a very futuristic movie for its time. The first one in 1984 was a an action classic, the sequel T2 released in 1991 and directed by Cameroon set an all time box office record with its then new CG effects. One of the best movies ever created in modern cinema history. The movie propelled CG Based special effects to a whole new level.<br>The last sequel Terminator 3 was released in 2003 to lukewarm response[/b]</blockquote>What about <strong>Robocop</strong>? I remember I had the video of the series up to the 4th part. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

He looks very young for his age because of his body building. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> He still look as good in T3. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Later, the blue was used to create a "matte" that was a punch-out of each ship; the many layers (sometimes dozens) were finally overlaid to create the final shot.<br><br>Although this was a breakthrough procedure, it was still tedious, time-consuming and limiting.  Foreground elements were physical models, built by hand and blown up by hand too.  Background elements were paintings, without movement.  Lucas' frustration with the limits imposed on him for Star Wars, Empire and Jedi led ILM to push the boundaries of computer special effects.  ILM did the first "morph" (one shape changing to another) in 1988's Willow, the "pseudopod" in The Abyss (1989), the liquid metal robot in Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991) and the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park (1993).<br><br>For ILM, the 1999 Phantom Menace was the culmination of more than two decades work.  The vast majority of the effects in the film have been created digitally, on a computer.  "Effects" is perhaps the wrong word, since many of the sets and even characters are now computer-generated.<br><br><a href="http://www.exn.ca/starwars/culture.cfm?ID=19990412-55" rel="nofollow">http://www.exn.ca/starwars/culture.cfm?ID=19990412-55</a></div>
