              <p>If the teacher did something wrong,like hitting the child etc
              then its ok to make a police report, but <span>CUTTING

              <p>dude noone said you cant be creative. If youre still at primary level of your education and your parents have already started pampering you like that, its definite that you wont grow to be a good person. you gotta be disciplined at that level so that when youre at your tertiary stage, you will know how to keep yourself balanced between looking cool and being disciplined at the same time. the rest is up to you. Singaporeans are easily influenced by western culture, we try to be like them, look like them. always comparing asian and western cultures. with proper discipline, they would know how to balance it off rather than going off track.</p>

              <p>Your point of reference is unacceptable, if only you had put in more effort in doing your research. prove us that this kid is not a child model, not at all involved in any type of media industry and that he was just walking in the park where someone decided to snap their picture and upload it on the web. and please its not for nothing that our country's education is one of the best. schools were much more strict last time, they are already giving students alot of freedom and yet they look for something to complain about. now they will let them keep stylish hair, next they will complain about above ankle socks. this will never end.</p>
              <p>Oh btw, foreign MNCs give better benefits and salary compared to local MNCs. and again, do your research properly.</p>

              <p>1. PSLE oral score <em>can</em> be affected if the examiner has a poor first impression of you. Seriously. We expect examiners to be fully objective, but they are also human.</p>
              <p>When teachers tell you to make sure you dress properly and have a proper haircut before your oral exam, they are not doing it to tekan you. They are trying to prevent you from getting tekan-ed by their colleagues.</p>
              <p>2. Looks are not part of the grading system, but again, refer back to point 1. Also, one can say that this is also part of a child's education; if you show up for a job interview with a sloppy hairstyle, then you don't deserve the job.</p>
              <p>3. Sigh.... the so-called 'creativity' argument. If your level of creativity is determined by the hair on your head, then you seriously don't have creativity to begin with. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>For point 2: The boy cannot be defined as 'sloppy'. It didn't meet 
              the school standard(which is too strict for me), does not mean he looked
               sloppy. Furthermore, in job interviews, looks are 
              part of the consideration. Your potential employer is looking for charisma - 
              beauty will be part of the 'x factor'. If u look at some HR papers, u 
              might find looks are indeed part of the grading.</p>
              <p>For point 3: Shor
               hair is one obvious instance of our rigid system. While it appears 
              insignificant, creativity cannot be nurtured in an intolerant 
              surroundings - if  ur society cannot even tolerate longer hair, what do u
               expect? Creativity requires you to question the tradition, recreating 
              the norms. Can we do that? Let's look at an extreme example - North 
              Korea. Their school requires them to have very short hair. Their 
              dictatorship continues to instill fear in their people. Are they 
              creative? My answer is no. Are they unintelligent? Again, no. Why are 
              their neighbour - South Korea - much are sucessful(both people have the 
              same genes)? It's the way they are brought up.</p>
