If not, what is the likehood that they fcuk around. Then after they decide not to be together, they go their own ways?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>As I have mentioned in an earlier post, if someone is ok with sex before marriage, what is the likelihood of him/her having sex with others after marriage? This will lead to problems and isn't a good practice to promote family well being.<br><br>Do they really have to live together before marriage to understand each other?<br>No need to live together, visit his/her family often. Get answers from their families members. Cos they know the best. See how they treat each other.<br><br>Also see how your gf/bf treats those whom they dun love, n you will know how your gf/bf will treated u after marriage, when their love dies.</div>
