              Special needs education - especially in the field of communication - fascinates me, since I'm an undergraduate in English. Plus I plan on taking a Msc in Communications disorders and linguistics. 
              I will be graduating with a BA in English this August. However I'm not sure if I could apply for a special needs teaching position with moe because my degree is foreign. Also, I do not have a Singaporean polytechnic diploma or the A levels. I have a university foundation diploma in English and my O levels however. 
              I love working with disadvantaged children. 
              I've experiences in teaching in Germany and Singapore. I hope that helps. 
              So can i still apply to become an allied educator (lbs)? I dont mind what theyre going to pay me. I just want to get myself educated more on special needs education, so serving a bond or a DISE would be nothing short of being rewarding and great. Any suggestion?

              <p>why  not apply to NIE with your cert and be bonded to them,  you will have a course by NIE which will bond you to NIE for an estimate of 2-3 years but the course will be fully paid by NIE. </p>

              <p>i believe the above website which u access before will help.</p>
              <p>the 2nd link will be more closely related to what you wanted and the details are as followed by the chance of you getting it are pretty high if you bond yourself, sign up as a relief teacher within some of the school and ask for referral letter from the principal, that will help more after you finish your relief teaching </p>

              I do plan on signing a bond, and I've been working with kids ever since I entered the workforce alongside my studies. 
              I used to work as a student care teacher at a primary school in Singapore, where I had been in charge of a few autistic and dyslexic kids if that helps. Haha.  I had also tutored students in Germany before and worked as a chat moderator in Berlin.
              Ultimately I do plan on taking up a bond and getting my diploma in special needs education at NIE. that would also complement my further Msc studies in communication disorders.
              Problem is, I do not have an A level cert or local diploma, but a Foundation uni diploma in English studies and i will graduate this august with a degree (Hons) in English. 
              Would that be a problem for me? 
              I don't wanna just  "help out"; I intend to create individual lesson plans and be actively involved in the special needs community in school. Would the absence of an a level cert or a local polytechnic diploma bar me from taking up a job as an allied educator?

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for the advice guys. To know that the education system here is biased is very demoralising to say the least. For MOE to reject applications solely on the basis of international qualification seems trivial, and that really does not help benefit those with special needs and especially educators who have strong and true passion in helping them. It's really sad to see most of these students get left behind in mainstream schools. I used to work as a student care teacher at a local primary school, and I'd seen some terrible attitudes coming from a few AEDs who were clearly in this job for the money. Sorry for the digression, but I've such strong passion in teaching and helping students with dyslexia, hearing impairment, and a variety of communication/speech-language disorders, that to see that passion die here is really depressing.</div>

              I don't know about voting them out. Haha, I'll try to steer clear from politics in this thread. 
              Well that's nice to know :) Wish your friend all the best. Is she working as an allied educator (teaching and learning) or (learning and behavioural support)? 
              I'm going to hand in my application once I graduate. I hope they'll take me in. 
              Otherwise, I'll just apply to a SPED school.  
              
              By the way, I wasn't dissing the educational system here. That's kind of a strong word to use, don't you think? I was merely pointing out some areas that I believe need improvements. Just saying.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>jovi, i believe that there is no clear priority in giving to local diploma or university, in singapore we practise meritocracy, so you definitely can consider submitting your application but do ensure that your university is one of those recognise overseas university by NIE, for more information, call them up, they should be able to help you. from what i understand of those information that you mention, alot of your job experience is not useful in your application to NIE as private tutoring and chat moderator definitely do not help in application with NIE, as for being an allied educator, i hope you take the time to read carefully the job scope with NIE, its is definitely not of a fully fetch teacher of creating lesson plan and etc, so its would be good if you exercise pre-caution and do your research instead of relying on us to help you more, we can only help you that much.</p></div>
