            <div class='col-md body'>This was touted as "<span style="font-style: italic;">Perhaps the most disturbing video you will ever see in your life</span>".<br><br><a href="http://forum.ebaumsworld.com/showthread.php?t=87408" rel="nofollow">http://forum.ebaumsworld.com/showthread.php?t=87408</a><br><br>It is not the video that is of interest here, but the 11 pages of comments that follow.<br><br>The video itself is in no way disturbing or upsetting to a balanced, mature soul* (see end of post).<br><br>The video shows a transvestite (who sufferred from polio when young, thus the physical deformity) tap dancing, and as those familiar with tap dancing can tell you, that's some pretty good tap dancing.<br><br>The 11 pages of comments express a variety of emotions, from horror, to disgust (at either the transvestite, or the imagined-to-be-callous production crew, or both), to "WTF ", to laughter (mocking?), to feeling sorry for the transvestite ("I felt so bad for the transvestite that I couldn't stop crying..." and "U callous morons! that's a diseased condition that deserves our pity!" ), etc etc.<br><br>Now, we (of course) do not pronounce judgement at any of these comments, or the people behind the comments. The ones who mock, mock only themselves. Those who feel revulsion, are only feeling revulsion for the darkness (they imagine to be) within themselves. The ones who feel pity or compassion, are only showing what is in their nature (which is of their choosing, of course. All of these different reactions and emotions, are all by *choice*. Your free will determines your nature.)<br><br>On the contents of the video itself, there's nothing to be disturbed or horrified by - it shows a transvestite putting sincere effort into something he enjoys, tap dancing. And there's no terrible 'injustice' here either, the transvestite himself looks comfortable with himself, and respects himself. So why do you need to feel horrified by, mockingly towards, or even pity for, the transvestite?<br><br>He's a human being, and as with all human beings, the only emotion he/they deserve, is love. Not fear, not revulsion, not mocking, and not pity. Only love.<br><br>With *all* situations, express only love and assistance (whenever appropriate or possible. Always work closely with your guides &amp; helpers).<br><br>So the point of this post (which is about the 11 pages of comments, rather than the video itself) is twofold - to remind the reader that<br><br>1) Only express love (and assistantiality whenever appropriate/possible). Everything else is but a reflection of an inner quality or issue. Turn all emotions around, to within yourself, to further understand yourself. Clarification task.<br><br>2) Do not judge others, not even those who appear to judge others. Understand that these people (in fact everyone) are only ever judging themselves, only showing what is within their *own* nature. See the people around you clearly, in understanding and in love. (So *never* get upset by what others may say about you, or about anything). Clarification task.<br><br>(*Note that nothing disturbs or upsets the ascended masters, the Serenissimus, etc, who feel only love and act only out of assistance at all times. For instance, any video or news of any events of an extremely 'injust' or unfotunate nature, such as atrocities of mass genocide, terrorism or torture, would be understood with clarity (and not emotional ugliness), and with love. And only positive feelings of assistance and love (as always) would be expressed. No anger, no outrage, no revulsion, disgust or any of these fear based emotions. Only love. And these guides &amp; helpers, beings of higher vibration, who are in the capacity to help directly or indirectly in some way, would do so. And they invite you to be &amp; do the same).<br></div>
