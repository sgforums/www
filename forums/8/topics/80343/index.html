            <div class='col-md body'>MAY 22, 2004<br>Our Columnist<br>The real deal on deals<br><br>Paying more and getting less. And paying more for stuff I do not want in the first place. What's the deal?<br><br>By Sharon Loh<br><br>ALL I wanted was a large bag of popcorn, sweet and salty mixed.<br><br>'I can't sell it to you, ma'am,' said the sales assistant behind the concession counter. She pointed to the combo being advertised. 'The large popcorn comes with two drinks.'<br><br>I had taken the children to Great World City to catch a movie. They love going to the cinema, and part of the fun is scarfing a huge bag of popcorn in the middle of the day.<br><br>This was the first time anyone had refused to sell me just the snack. And apparently, the regular-sized bag also had to come with a drink.<br><br>But I didn't want a combo, and I sure didn't want the sweet fizzy drinks that went with it.<br><br>Can I at least trade the sweet drinks for bottled water, I asked? The seconds ticked by towards the start of the movie.<br><br>She looked at me sternly. 'We can't do that.'<br><br>I glared back as I handed over $8 for a bag of popcorn and two diet Cokes, and made a mental note to myself: Next time bring own bag of microwaved popcorn.<br><br>I don't know if all Golden Village concessions are equally inflexible but purveyors of goods and services should take care not to lose the plot.<br><br>Not all customers will appreciate being forced into buying packages that claim to be value for money but actually just make people pay more.<br><br>The new memberships to Wildlife Reserves parks are another example.<br><br>We are Friends of the Zoo and Friends of the Birds, which means that for a flat fee paid every year, we get unlimited entry to the Zoo and Jurong BirdPark.<br><br>This is very useful when you have small children who constantly want to go there. Sometimes we go just to enjoy their very nice playgrounds.<br><br>But last week I received a flyer informing me that membership fees had gone up to $100 for each park, for two adults and three children.<br><br>Price increases are part and parcel of life, but my eyes popped at this one.<br><br>The old charges were $87 and $81 for the zoo and bird park respectively.<br><br>Overall, it is a 20 per cent increase. Rather hefty, no?<br><br>Wildlife Reserves says that it has to raise membership fees, which have not gone up since - wait for this - 1974.<br><br>Wow. It must have cost a small fortune to be a friend of the zoo 30 years ago. Is it now making up for lost time?<br><br>Price rise aside, I took umbrage at being cheerily informed by the flyer that I would 'save $110' by signing up as a member of the zoo, bird park and Night Safari - for $240.<br><br>The company is starting a membership scheme for the Night Safari for $150. You save only if you subscribe to all three attractions individually, which you can't do anyway, since the package would automatically kick in.<br><br>And since my membership to two attractions cost me $168 in total, I would have to spend nearly $80 more to get all three, and at least $32 just to maintain my current status.<br><br>What am I, stupid?<br><br>I called the BirdPark to complain. My $81 membership now grants entry to my family of four, plus two grandparents.<br><br>The new package excludes grandparents altogether. So, you want me to pay more for less, I asked? Why would I do that?<br><br>The girl who took my call was very apologetic.<br><br>'Write in, ma'am,' she said, fervently. 'I agree with you.'<br><br>I'm still trying to decide if I should renew my membership or wean the children off the parks.<br><br>I know $200 is not going to break the bank, but I don't relish feeling sold, when I am a faithful customer. We go often, and each time we spend freely on food, drink, animal rides and train and tram rides.<br><br>Wildlife Reserves may have good reasons for raising prices by 20 per cent - for instance so there is a more equitable distribution of charges among regulars and casual visitors.<br><br>If so, I would welcome an honest justification over the attempt to sell me a 'deal' that is no deal given what I now pay.<br><br>Marketing is a mystery to me, and I'm sure that price formulas are complicated, taking into account a myriad of factors.<br><br>But from a consumer's point of view, more flexibility is preferable to less. Even at snack concessions.<br><br>That was the approach taken by the new Sentosa management which seems to be paying off. They dropped the entrance fee to a nominal sum and let visitors choose what to spend their money on instead of bundling unwanted attractions into a fixed package.<br><br>Last week we were informed by StarHub that the Disney Channel, which we subscribe to, will migrate its preschool programming to a different channel, Playhouse Disney, in June.<br><br>The main Disney Channel, which is aimed at the whole family, will be included in the kids' tier with Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon.<br><br>Since we don't subscribe to the kids' tier, we now have to, if we want to keep the Disney Channel. Or I can drop Playhouse Disney if I don't want to have to pay more.<br><br>Now, here again was a choice being foisted on me that I didn't ask for. But I can appreciate that there may be people who want only the preschool channel, and now can opt just for that. And vice versa.<br><br>Either way, it gives people choice, and consumers appreciate more flexibility and choice, not less.<br><br>In the meantime, I have been advised to invest in a good home entertainment system.<br><br>That way, there will be no need to go to the cinema. You can easily recreate the experience at home, with a good DVD and microwaved popcorn.<br><br>Hey, and Coca Cola which doesn't cost $8. The kids could invite their friends over. We'd have a great night in.<br><br>Send your comments to stlife@sph.com.sg<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Copyright @ 2004 Singapore Press Holdings.

            <div class='col-md body'>Quite a lengthy expression of that encounter.<br><br>To a certain I agree with that, to add on, 'you' forget about paying $10 bucks for a little bucket of pop-corn during the Beauty and the Beast show, or $10 for that Hi-5 balloon when they were in town.<br><br>All these price hikes are neccessary to ensure a healthy profit margin.<br><br>As for entrance fees charges, the marketing team is always ready to strike, especially when the iron is hot.<br><br>Lesson learnt: if you can't beat them, and you can't join them, go for cheap alternatives...least that's what I do.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Curious.... will you buy this kind of "deal"?<br><br>MAY 22, 2004<br>New deal offers unlimited visits to 3 wildlife parks<br>WILDLIFE Reserves, the company that manages the Singapore Zoo, the Jurong BirdPark and the Night Safari, is looking to boost the number of visitors to these attractions.<br><br>It has launched a new membership package called Wildlife Unlimited, which covers all the three parks, and those who are already members of one of its annual plans can upgrade to it.<br><br>It hopes to sign up one million members in the next three months.<br><br>For an annual fee of $240, two adults and three children under 12 years old can get access to all the three attractions any number of times.<br><br>The one-time entry fee to the zoo and bird park is $14 for adults and $7 for children. For the Night Safari, it is $18 for adults and $9 for children.<br><br>Each year, the zoo has an average of 1.5 million visitors, the bird park, 900,000, and the Night Safari, 850,000. They bring in an estimated $60 million in revenue.<br><br>Wildlife Reserves has increased the family membership fees of its existing Friends of the Zoo and Friends of the Birds packages from $87 and $81 a year to $100 each. A new Friends of Night Safari package has also been launched, which costs $150.<br><br>The hike is the first since the Friends of the Zoo and Friends of the Birds family packages were launched in 1974 and 1978 respectively.<br><br>Wildlife Reserves is offering a six-month PacNet dial-up usage package and a two-month extension to each annual membership that is upgraded to Wildlife Unlimited by July.<br><br>Ms Fanny Lai, the company's director of marketing and communications, attributed the increases to the cost of upgrading and introducing new facilities at the parks.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Copyright @ 2004 Singapore Press Holdings.
