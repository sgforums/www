              <p>Gotta agree with you about SG being too stressful. It's ranked the most expensive city to live in, Paris comes in next, can you imagine!</p>
              <p>Retiring at 50... wah. Abit tight I'd say.Unless we gather a pile of moolah, like quarter of a mill, then go migrate to NZ or Canada or something, do plumbing job(which pays LOADS I tell ya), then retire there at 50.. swee.</p>

              <p>Totally true... there would be some who aspire to retire early, only to find themselves caught in a situation where they can't keep up with either their own expenses, policy changes implemented by government, even the cost of inflation plays a huge part.</p>
              <p>Would our $1 today be its same worth in 20-30 years time? That's the question to ask.....</p>

              <p>Random - took a quiz on Facebook haha and it said that I would be able to retire at 53 years old. That is 23 years time! </p>
              <p>Well I don't really have a specific age to retire (as early as possible), so I am taking this facebook quiz result as a reference. </p>
              <p>Its true that SG has one of the highest standard of living, and also true that our pay can never outrun/ exceed our expenses especially if we only rely on one stream of income.</p>
              <p>If you want to retire early, get out of the rat's race, and fulfill your dream - you need to get <strong>OUT OF YOUR COMFORT zone</strong> and do things you have never done.</p>
              <p>1. Have you ever saved money before or do you spend all of your salary?</p>
              <p>2. Study different financial instruments and choose one that suit your risk style/ lifestyle.</p>
              <p>If you are 30 now and start investing in shares as low as $1000, depending on the dividend and shares you pick, even a 2% dividend is better than the paltry bank interest rate. Investment requires time horizon, so earlier you start, the more money you build.</p>
              <p>3. LEARN as much as you can! Never stop learning </p>
              <p>4. Plan and take action! </p>

              Here are some quotations for those of you who are about to go or already gone into Semi-Retirement or Full Retirement.
              
              "In character, in manner, in style, in all things, the supreme excellence is simplicity"
              - Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
              
              "One ought every day at least to hear a little song, read a good poem, see a fine picture, and, if it were possible, to speak a few reasonable words."
              - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
              
              "I am searching for that which every man seeks - peace and rest."
              - Dante Alighieri
              
              "I have found that if you love life, life will love you back"
              - Arthur Rubinstein
              
              "Most of man's trouble comes from his inability to be still."
              - Blaise Pascal
              
              "The reason worry kills more people than work is that more people worry than work."
              - Robert Frost
              
              "Nothing can bring you peace but yourself."
              - Ralph Waldo Emerson
              
              "The best doctors in the world are Doctor Diet, Doctor Quiet, and Dr Merryman."
              - Jonathan Swift
              
              "The best and most efficient pharmacy is within your own system."
              - Robert C. Peale, M.D.
              
              "Worry affects the circulation, the heart, the glands, the whole nervous system, and profoundly affects heart action."
              - Charles W. Mayo, M.D.
              
              "I said to that high-strung patient, 'Practise the peace of God which passes all understanding and you will be well."

              <p>The cost of living is so high that we can't afford to stop working.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Medical bills and dental fees are high and we can't get dental subsidized treatment  soon enough.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Their national dental centre gives out 4 months waiting time for subsidized appointments!!!  If we need earlier treatment, we must be able to afford private rates. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bus and public transport fees only rise. Food costs also rise because of rental rates escalating.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Rising costs of living is very real and we may have no choice but to work till we drop dead. This is the gratitude the govt gives its citizens for all the nation building efforts to its pioneer generation.</p>

              Hmmm...you have to plan your own retirement....if you depend on the government to plan and help you when to go into semi-retirement or full retirement....you life will be full of frustration and probably miseries...
              
              I'm going to be 53 years young this year...I had decided to go into semi-retirement somewhere in 2012 I think and I'm very happy and really have more time to do what I want in my life. However, I'm able to do this because I live in JB and work on assignment basis in Singapore. 
              
              Last year 2015, in March I stopped work and went for short travelling. Then I start work again in September to October 2015. Then I went for short travelling again. 
              
              It's a choice for you...how you intend to retire, when and where...
              
              Cheers!

              If you are going to migrate abroad or go abroad to go into Semi-Retirement or Full Retirement in a Big Country, learn to live in a Big Country. Open your mind and don't start comparing the country that you are residing with Singapore. Don't only mix around with your own kind only (e.g. Singaporeans or Asians if you live in a Western country). If you do that you are going to feel lonely and miserable. Blend in with the society (locals), learn their cultures, traditions and languages. 
                      
              My eldest brother and his wife that have migrated and retired in Canada with his wife told me that if any Singaporeans who live in Canada and they only mix around with Singaporeans, most of them feel lonely and miserable.
                      
              My second elder sister, her husband and daughter that have migrated to the U.S. Dallas, Texas; my second elder brother, his wife and daughter that have migrated to Thailand, Chang Mai; my third elder sister, her husband and daughter that have migrated to Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur; all say the same thing. You must learn to mix around with the locals and learn to live in a Big Country. And myself with my wife, now living in Malaysia, Johor Bahru, say the same thing too. Don't compare it with the tiny island of Singapore. You do that you will feel lonely and miserable.
                      
              THEN YOU WILL BE FINE AND YOU WILL BE HAPPY.
