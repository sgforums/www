            <div class='col-md body'>I was reading in a magazine an article about inter racial relationships.<br><br>I thought that people today will be openminded about these sort of things, but apparently many aren't. Especially parents. But I realized that I often take a second look as well. So much for my own open-mindedness.<br><br>Like the author said, its about "2 people bumping into each other at the right place at the right time, producing chemistry that most people can only dream about." Wahhhhhh, so nicely put.<br><br>So do what do you think of these couples? Any personal views as to why this happens? Heart warming stories? Flames?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>pacman! kekekeee<br><br>Well, for one thing I have nothing against inter-racial relationship.<br><br>I have once asked my parents "if i like/marry someone from another race, would they mind?"  Their reply made me very proud of them.  "It's your happiness, altho we are your parents, we have no say in who you can marry and who you can't.  We don't mind you marrying some other race, the most important factor of all is that you are happy..."<br><br>My parents are very open-minded...maybe because we live in the US.  I was born and raised here...<br><br>Personally, (not to be rude) but I only get attacted to Asian...and it's not just any asian...only chinese! =P errrrrrr...what's consider as chinese?!  doesn't mean you have to be from china! DOH!  it means you gotta speak/understand cantonese/mandarin etc...(hope i am not offending anyone here, i DO apologize if i did...)<br><br>------------------<br>*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*<br>Float like a butterfly...Sting like a bee...<br>*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</div>

Unless you actually talk to them, like naivegirl did, you never know.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 03 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not sure if any of you have noticed... But it seems like the majority of inter racial relationship with one party being a Chinese are usually those whereby the male is of another race. Seems like girls are more receptive towards the idea of having a foreign race b/f, hubby. Chinese guys seldom enter into a relationship with girls of other races unless a Jap or Eurasian, rarely Indian or Malay. Got a few malay and indian friends who have chinese g/fs but none the other way.<br><br></div>
