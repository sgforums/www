            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously lor, sometimes it's damn hard to differentiate between fat and pregnant... Girls can differentiate better becos they understand but you have to agree with me that for some cases, it's damn hard to tell, especially when the mother herself is already a fat piece of lard... For slimmer mothers, it's easier to notice the bulge in her tummy...<br><br>So sometimes, it's really unfair... We would gladly give up our seat for a pregnant lady but how the fock would we know whether you are pregnant or just fat? We wouldnt want to embarass fat aunties too right? And embarass ourlselves in the process... So maybe the pregnant ladies might wanna do something on their part as well... When no one is giving up their seat for u, just go up to them and tell them politely that you are pregnant... Someone will give up his/her seat for sure...<br><br>The same goes for old peeps as well.... Some old people are focking grumpy.. When you give up your seat for them, they dont wanna sit.... And sometimes, it's damn hard to judge whether this particular person is really "old".... so how old is considered old? Once again, you wouldnt wanna give up your seat to some auntie who doesnt want to be identified as "old" and then get scolded by her right?<br><br>Sometimes, it's seriously damn hard to decide... Agree?</div>

Her head turned quickly, ready to pounce like a spitting cobra but she was too late. I thought to myself, she really looked desparate for a seat. But what if she's not pregnant? What if she's just a greedy pile of lard with weak willpower and just ate and ate then uses deceptive means to get a seat on trains? Well I cast the doubt away and stood up. Its still a kind gesture to offer your seat to a lady. She pounced on it like it was her long lost bean bag.<br><br>A hint of regret crossed my mind, accompanied by that feeling you get when you sign on the dotted line with a 2nd hand car dealer.
