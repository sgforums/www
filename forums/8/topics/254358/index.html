This is a public service. Not some luxurious ride you are exclusively paying to get top class treatment. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Ladies who are not heavily pregnant but just pregnant also need seats. We don't give them seats because they are heavily pregnant or can't stand much. We give them up so as to avoid unfortunate incidents such as the lady losing balance and falling due to the train jerking. This can be very dangerous for the baby in them. Same goes to old people. An injured young person (like urself) can recover faster when compared to an old person (fragile or not).<br><br>Peace.</div>
