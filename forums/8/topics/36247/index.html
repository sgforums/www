In my option, he had failed when he popped the questions OR hinted it. In this emptiness of his heart, he chose to go with other girl using that text of excuse saying that it was to forget you. Come on! If you want to forget someone, you *don't* go with another person... you take some *QUALITY* time to sort out your thinking and move on with life. There is obviously a gnawing inferiority in him, which creates this emptiness in his heart.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Another point I would like to point out: He got himself a gf - he choose to go with her. Then, he is not happy with her, he comes complain to you and tells you he loves you, etc. Isn't he using you as a substitute of love when his present love is like trash? Remember he does that to others girls, chances are, when you are with him, he will do that too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Let me give you a word of warning - messaging impression and intention lies in the eye of the beholder. With a message, you cannot know how someone could still care or love another deeply etc. Anyone could message for the sake of messaging and put lovey words and it seemed very loving to the other party. I am not saying he is doing that, but it seemed to me that what he is trying to do is seeking for a gap in your relationships and after when you present relation dies - he will seize the chance and proclaim the king.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>*BUT* the key essential is to keep you liking him. You miss him, it natural, but have you both really met and do some real talking? No? Its only messaging and already feel your hidden passion bursting.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>After all these analysis; I still feel that you should tell him one thing seriously. 'I guess things are better the way it is now, perhaps we should just leave things be.' Many times, what you desire and what reality gives to you is hell of a difference. At least, both of you once loved each other and that's enough.<br><br>Remember you have a bf (you din't really complain about him here, which shows that he is quite a decent guy), therefore you have to be responsible to your choice until your fates ends with him. And remember - it has been so long since the both of you met - you never know what he could and may be doing outside. Times change - so does people.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers<br><br></div>

'I guess things are better the way it is now, perhaps we should just leave things be.' Many times, what you desire and what reality gives to you is hell of a difference. At least, both of you once loved each other and that's enough.<br><br>Remember you have a bf (you din't really complain about him here, which shows that he is quite a decent guy), therefore you have to be responsible to your choice until your fates ends with him. And remember - it has been so long since the both of you met - you never know what he could and may be doing outside. Times change - so does people.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers<br><br></div></blockquote>thanks for yr reply..i've tot it over maybe sm things r juz better in the way that is....how u noe i dun really complain abt my bf here?i juz duno wat 2 complain...coz after these 7 yrs 2gether,he still duno how 2 be a bf...is it coz i'm his 1st gf?</div>

Then most probably yes. People grow after each relationships. First relation is often the relation that people made the most mistake bah.
