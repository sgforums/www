I seek God!"<br>As many of those who did not believe in God<br>were standing around just then,<br>he provoked much laughter.<br>Has he got lost? asked one.<br>Did he lose his way like a child? asked another.<br>Or is he hiding?<br>Is he afraid of us? Has he gone on a voyage? emigrated?<br>Thus they yelled and laughed.<br><br>The madman jumped into their midst and pierced them with his eyes.<br>"Whither is God?" he cried; "I will tell you.<br>We have killed him---you and I.<br>All of us are his murderers.<br>But how did we do this?<br>How could we drink up the sea?<br>Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon?<br>What were we doing when we unchained this earth from its sun?<br>Whither is it moving now? Whither are we moving?<br>Away from all suns?<br>Are we not plunging continually?<br>Backward, sideward, forward, in all directions?<br>Is there still any up or down?<br>Are we not straying, as through an infinite nothing?<br>Do we not feel the breath of empty space?<br>Has it not become colder? Is not night continually closing in on us?<br>Do we not need to light lanterns in the morning?<br>Do we hear nothing as yet of the noise of the gravediggers<br>who are burying God?<br>Do we smell nothing as yet of the divine decomposition?<br>Gods, too, decompose.<br>God is dead.<br>God remains dead.<br>And we have killed him.<br><br>"How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers?<br>What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled<br>to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us?<br>What water is there for us to clean ourselves?<br>What festivals of atonement, what sacred gamesshall we have to invent?<br>Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us?<br>Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?<br>There has never been a greater deed; and whoever is born after us -<br>For the sake of this deed he will belong to a higher history than all<br>history hitherto."<br><br>Here the madman fell silent and looked again at his listeners;<br>and they, too, were silent and stared at him in astonishment.<br>At last he threw his lantern on the ground,<br>and it broke into pieces and went out.<br>"I have come too early," he said then; "my time is not yet.<br>This tremendous event is still on its way, still wandering;<br>it has not yet reached the ears of men.<br>Lightning and thunder require time;<br>the light of the stars requires time;<br>deeds, though done, still require time to be seen and heard.<br>This deed is still more distant from them than most distant stars -<br>and yet they have done it themselves.<br><br>It has been related further that on the same day<br>the madman forced his way into several churches<br>and there struck up his requiem aeternam deo.<br>Led out and called to account, he is said always to have replied nothing<br>but:<br>"What after all are these churches now<br>if they are not the tombs and sepulchers of God?"<br></blockquote>	-- Friedrich Nietzsche[/quote]</div>
