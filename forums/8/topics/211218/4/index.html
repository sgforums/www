            <div class='col-md body'>Mr Kaister, it must be your first time arguing with a christian. The problem with these people is that they have a very narrow mind. Their mind is already fixed on the notion that god exists. No matter what you say, they will argue otherwise, even when their arguments don't make sense. They also think they know the truth and that nobody else knows. How do they know the truth? This is something really nobody knows.<br><br>The problem with their arguments is that they are sometimes logical and sometimes illogical. Whatever suits their agenda will be used. So, sometimes they get confused and accidentally fall into the realm of logic. For example, in the following post, davidche came to a logical conclusion:<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by davidche:<br><br>here is some logic use.<br><br>He said that you cannot say God doesnt exist because you cant prove God doesnt exists<br><br>This statement doesnt mean that anything cant be proven not to exist has to exist.(in any case, inclu big foot)<br><br>say, a grape is a fruit, but a fruit is not grape.<br><br>which means that A=b is not equals to b=A<br><br>strange but thats logic for you.</blockquote>Then he double confirmed the logical conclusion:<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by davidche:<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Originally posted by kecang_puteh:<br><br>Bravo, you have just said it yourself. It doesn't mean that god can't be proven not to exist, has to exist. <strong>To put it another way, it doesn't mean that god has to exist if he can't be proven not to exist.</strong><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>ya lah!! duh..... </strong><br><br>happy that you understand  </blockquote>But later, he made a conclusion to the contrary:<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by davidche:<br>This is also your post<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Originally posted by kecang_puteh:<br>Davidche, we are good friends right? <strong>We both agree that it doesn't mean god has to exist if he can't be proven not to exist.</strong> So, we share the same view on god.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>actually no</strong>, your view on God is that God may exist.<br><br>I believe that God exists and isnt limited by evidences or human's mind esp when he is the creator which makes him have the power to limit the human's mind to be limited. </blockquote>After which, he tried to argue that both conclusions are correct.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by davidche:<br><br>yes, is there anything wrong???<br><br>God cant be proven to exist.<br><br>I believe that God exists because...(important point here).....God doesnt have to abide by the rule of evidences.<br><br>Anyways, God can never be proven to exist. NEVER, if you dont understand why, read by upper post.</blockquote><blockquote>Originally posted by davidche:<br><br>erm...<br><br>God cannot be proven to exist doesnt mean he cant exist right? simple.</blockquote>Finally, he says that the first answer is correct.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by davidche:<br>oh, so you mean i shldnt answer no??<br><br>sorry then. </blockquote>Let me repeat. He says that he agree, disagree, both agree and disagree and then he says that he agree. Christians are a confused bunch.<br><br>Then he says something like god is not bounded by evidence, that's why he exists. But the very reason why god cannot be proven to exist or not exist is because he is not bounded by evidence. So, why does this make him definitely in existence?<br><br>Things that don't make sense or go round and round suddenly become the reason why god definitely exists. Yup, that is christianity for you.</div>
