              <p>Hi</p>
              <p>I was visiting Singapore and bought 2 sets of Panasonic Lumix FS3 cameras on Nov 29, 2008 from a shop in funan digital mall near city hall - "Bally photo electronics". When i returned to my country and checked the contents of the camera box, cables to connect camera to laptop and TV were missing from the box. I promptly called up the shop to ask for that but they simply denied any cheating and put back the blame on me.</p>
              <p>The problem is I have nothing to prove that the cables were actually missing from the box. Can I do anything about it? It would probably cost me about $50 to buy new cables but more importantly, such crooks have to be taught some lesson. Otherwise, the impression of singapore (which is otherwise a very nice city with honest people) will be clouded in tourist minds. </p>
              <p>If anyone can advise on what action i can possibly take, please share. Is there any govt agency that can help me?</p>
              <p>Thanks</p>
              <p>Prashant </p>

              <p>If you had bought one for me or one of us, we would've been able to help you to redress your injustice suffered.</p>

              <p>so sorry for ur bad experience in singapore.</p>
              <p>i'm afraid u'll probably have to fork out extra for the cables, since u're not even in the ctry now. but if u wanna teach the shop a lesson, just try reporting it to the authorities tt the others have suggested.</p>
              <p>by the way, isn't it generally gd practice to buy appliances and things tt require warranty fr the ctries where we live? :/ even if it's an internationally known brand, it's also better to buy fr the bigger stores.</p>
              <p>small businesses like those in funan, or even sim lim square in singapore, are nt a good idea. some of the shop keepers there are nt tt ethical, and if u dunno the unspoken "rules" very well, it's v likely tt u'll meet with such circumstances...</p>
              <p>some shops here are less reliable than others.. they will do the same, even to unwitting singaporeans.. so it's really not smth tt targets tourists. :x</p>

              <p>Mate, you should always check before buying. Don't always trust the storekeeper, that already shows how simple minded you are.</p>
              <p>Next time you buy something in Singapore or any other countries, remember to check that all items are there. You didn't check whether the items were there in the first place, so it was your fault.</p>
