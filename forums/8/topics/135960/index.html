            <div class='col-md body'>If u can afford, pls go 2 Poly, as the cert more recognised. MDIS is more for those who did not do well in their GCE or oversea students.<br><br>I've attended their Professional Cert in Marketing &amp; Comm Management, not Diploma. Maybe it is Pro Cert level, so the lecturers not so gd, or they really r not up to standards.<br><br>I heard their Day program are full of foreign students and most r rich brats. Noisy n din really interested in studies.<br><br>I attended their night class, not so bad. But it is like crash course, within 10 lessons u hv 2 learn Basic Econs... Lecturers gave lots of tips lor, if not how 2 pass? Gd n bad lor: Gd as in easy 2 pass, short duration &amp; very very lag. Bad as in u learn not much from the course.<br><br>I am considering taking a Dip in Mass Comm, but try not 2 continue wif MDIS.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Nikar<br><br>sometimes I think who is the lecturer you end up with. This can be controlled.<br>MDIS is definitely more recognised out there compared to many pte schools. Having been through a few jobs, I guess I am pretty much certain about it.<br>It's not a sure thing that ppl who go there have bad results (i know mostly do la) but in some cases, like me, I seriously am not keen on the course I was pursuing in poly, my parents are against me pursuing arts and since the lecturers advised me it's almost impossible to transfer within poly, I left. Naturally I went for diplomas on subjects I did well at. I went for one dip (more on advertising &amp; PR) at Thames and another Mass Comm dip a MDIS.<br><br>POly lecturers give hints too (not just pte schools, dun remem at MDIS that they gave direct hints though). MDIS course structure is pretty good for Mass Comm. Maybe we had great lecturers in my year whom are working as consultant in Mediacorp hence there were more exposure , hands on. Like all lecturers, the more responsive you're, the more they'll provide for you. Be it more notes, answering questions on your projects, I haven't met a bad lecturer at MDIS (for my time at least la)<br><br>- If however you can go to a poly and do the course you want with your grades, then by all means do so.<br>- But if you can't get into the course you want, just do well in MDIS and you will get good testimonials too (just be punctual for your projects, put more effort to impress your lecturer, do more research etc etc)<br><br>So not to worry, MDIS diplomas and degrees are not questionable as compared to many other pte schools. That's at least from the interviews I have so far. Now I'm happily working in an international movie organisation. For me it's a sad thing no money, or else I would have pursue the arts or a degree,<br><br>All the best to you!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MIS. Marketing Institute of Singapore. A not for profit school, private, but considered more of an educational organization instead of a commercialized business.<br><br>I'm graduating from the Sales and Marketing course in 2 weeks time. The thing about this, even SAF recognize their accreditations, just in case you haven't enlisted for NS yet..<br><br>You can go to <a href="http://www.mis.edu.sg" rel="nofollow">www.mis.edu.sg</a> for more information... But I think they've ended the Diploma in Sales &amp; Marketing course to form a dual Diploma Business Management/Diploma Marketing Management that you can finish in like 18 months if you go part time.<br><br>They just shifted to our new campus. I think we're next to the new SMU or SIM campus I'm not sure..but it's like a 10 min walk up from the Dhoby Ghaut station underneath Plaza Singapura, and you even walk past MDIS when going there, so might as well walk the extra distance to check out another option for yourself... Good hunting!</div>

I guess MDIS people will say it's theirs and MIS will say their own of course.. But I did go through some tours of MDIS and I find them much more commercialized.. And I'm not going to say a 'friend's friend' but my own friend failed a subject, appealed and paid a sum of money then he got an A for that paper, and that kind of drops the credibility in my eyes..maybe it was embellished, but *shrug* in the end I think it depends on whether you want a cert for the sake of a cert, a good cert, learn something, or a combination out of the 3.. My class has 26 people in it, this is the make up of it:<br><br>1 Cambodian<br>1 Malaysian<br>1 South Korean<br>2 Singaporeans<br>2 Vietnamese<br>Rest all are PRCs.<br><br>PRCs form the bulk of the failures for exams.. Singaporeans generally top or make up the upper half of the grades. age ranges from 16 to 27. But the mean age is still around 22 I think.. not very sure.<br><br>Supposedly we won the 2005 best marketing school in Singapore award or something to that extent..not very sure, you can check it out. The non educational facilities are crap though, you won't find any sororities, clubs, societies in it like you would in a regular college. It's a place where people go to study or use it to enter the country to have fun, you will not find people playing basketball or soccer in the back.<br><br>Best is go there, get a feel for yourself...try it both with MDIS. Fortunately (or not), I've not lost my ethics and won't try to push you to go with MIS, besides, I stand to gain nothing from it..<br><br>As with every school, there are some systems you won't like, some staff or situations that you will not look fondly upon, but I can't tell you how to go through that without being in the school itself.</div>

Most of them went on to the Curtin program. Once you graduate from the DSM program, you can choose either to go to Curtin Australia or Newcastle Business school in Northrumbia England.<br><br>If you want to take the Curtin Australia route it can be done between 1 year and 4 months to 18 months. This will give you a Bachelor of Commerce degree.<br><br>If you opt for the Northrumbia route you'll take a 6 month advanced Diploma course, then a 1 year program to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree.<br><br>Or if you don't want to go to a degree course but more of a professional certificate qualification first.. you can go and take the Chartered Institute of Marketing, CIM (UK) paper that gives you the highest professional qualification available in marketing.<br><br>Generally those who take the CIM (UK) paper take 2 subjects I think...because you get exemptions from your DSM course. But the failure rate is high, about 70%-80% failures per batch and you just pay your exam fee, they give you a case study a month before the exam and you go in and write rubbish.. But I have to warn you CIM is usually only taken by those who have working experience, without it my lecturer said that it's quite difficult to pass, unless you have really good marketing ideas. I heard from him the markers mark your paper based on a "Would I hire this guy to run the marketing program for this case study's company?" That'll earn you either a pass or fail. Note that this CIM (UK) tie up is no longer existent in MIS, so you'll have to do your independent agency who can sign you up for it.<br><br>Hope all this stuff helps<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

I think if you do well in MDIS, still able to carve out a career for yourself.<br><br>Ppl in night classes - from what I see are usually not the rich, spoilt brat types. They're usually in the working class. In my classes, never seen bangladesh workers <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">....but people from all walks of life : Policemen (who want to change careers), ppl in ad agencies, creative line or even ppl in the 40s who want to upgrade themselves. Pretty much ok bunch of ppl, you will surely meet ppl who er, can't stand it when you score more than them despite putting in less effort....yes even among working class adults...so try not to be overly "happy" when you do well for a subject....(quite strange but this exists even among working adults, competitive I guess). So the best is, do well, but remain low-key so ppl will still share notes and questions with you.<br><br>MDIS has a credit partner whom we can take loans for very minimal interest. You can find out more.<br><br>You can always keep your options open by checking out other schools too. But if you want to do a Dip in Marketing, don't go to Thames. I learnt it the hard way. Course structures are not fantastic and honestly when I asked lecturers in poly and all, MDIS is more recognised as compared to Thames.<br><br>hope this helps!<br><br></div>

But if you want to do a Dip in Marketing, don't go to Thames. I learnt it the hard way.
