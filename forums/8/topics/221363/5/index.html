            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SexyChin:</div><div class="quote_body">Passive or involuntary smoking occurs when the exhaled and ambient smoke (otherwise known as environmental or secondhand smoke) from one person's cigarette is inhaled by other people. Passive smoking involves inhaling carcinogens, as well as other toxic components, that are present in secondhand tobacco smoke. Carcinogens that occur in secondhand tobacco smoke include benzene, 1,3-butadiene, benzo[a]pyrene, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone, and many others.<br>It is confirmed that, in adults, secondhand smoke causes lung cancer, nasal sinus cancer, breast cancer in younger women, heart disease, heart attacks, and asthma induction. Secondhand smoke is also known to harm children, infants and reproductive health through acute lower respiratory tract illness, asthma induction and exacerbation, chronic respiratory symptoms, middle ear infection, lower birth weight babies, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.[15]<br>In June 2006, US Surgeon General Richard H. Carmona called the evidence against passive smoke "indisputable" and said "The science is clear: secondhand smoke is not a mere annoyance, but a serious health hazard that causes premature death and disease in children and non-smoking adults.".[16] Passive smoking is one of the key issues that have lead to introduction of smoking bans, particularly in workplaces.<br>The composition of Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is similar to fossil fuel combustion products that contribute to air pollution, and has been shown to be responsible for indoor particulate matter (PM) levels far exceeding official outdoor limits.[17]</div></blockquote>Maybe you should read the reply I posted above your reply.<br><br>Only in random controlled trials , you can prove something has caused cancer. All drugs have to go through randomised controlled trials to make sure they are truly effective.<br><br>Smoking has no human random controlled trials because of the ethics involved. The evidence they taken are mostly  from cohort studies which in epidemiological terms will only prove an association <strong> NOT a causal relationship </strong>. From there, the conclusion is open to interpretation and some studies are flawed. There are effect modifiers in them such as genetic predisposition (i.e. BrCa mutations which put some women at higher risk of breast cancer) , dose-response,  lifestyle choices and even environmental factors.<br><br>They permitted smoking in the past in poorly ventilated buildings . It's like having a fire and you breathing in the smoke from the fire constantly - of course the lungs of second hand and first hand smokers go kaput. It's similar to eating - you eat too much - you become fat - you have clogged arteries and heart problems. Even too much pure oxygen is toxic for the brain.<br><br>However in an open space , it is a different story - similar to smelling BBQ smoke while you are BBQing food. No doubt smoking lacks the aromatic smells of a food cooking but most smokers are not always smoking constantly  . Open space = open ventilation .That is a reason why kitchens have to be well ventilated as well , just in case the food burnts and the smoke from burning food is more acrid than the cigarette I smoke.<br><br>As for environmental smoking pollution, well excuse me if you sniff at the car's exhaust only without ventilation , you die from carbon monoxide poisoning. Cars emit the more than a smoker does. All the comparisons to smoking are based on predictive mathematical modelling which means shat to me - it may be happen but it cannot be <strong> proven </strong> it actually happens .... they cannot actually estimate how the force of an individual's inhalation at a go or the temperature of the smoke going in - hence dose response issues. No freaking experimental box on a substitute for a lung is going to be like my lungs or anyone elses.<br><br></div>

The evidence they taken are mostly  from cohort studies which in epidemiological terms will only prove an association [b] NOT a causal relationship </strong>. From there, the conclusion is open to interpretation and some studies are flawed. There are effect modifiers in them such as genetic predisposition (i.e. BrCa mutations which put some women at higher risk of breast cancer) , dose-response,  lifestyle choices and even environmental factors.<br><br>They permitted smoking in the past in poorly ventilated buildings . It's like having a fire and you breathing in the smoke from the fire constantly - of course the lungs of second hand and first hand smokers go kaput. It's similar to eating - you eat too much - you become fat - you have clogged arteries and heart problems. Even too much pure oxygen is toxic for the brain.<br><br>However in an open space , it is a different story - similar to smelling BBQ smoke while you are BBQing food. No doubt smoking lacks the aromatic smells of a food cooking but most smokers are not always smoking constantly  . Open space = open ventilation .That is a reason why kitchens have to be well ventilated as well , just in case the food burnts and the smoke from burning food is more acrid than the cigarette I smoke.<br><br>As for environmental smoking pollution, well excuse me if you sniff at the car's exhaust only without ventilation , you die from carbon monoxide poisoning. Cars emit the more than a smoker does. All the comparisons to smoking are based on predictive mathematical modelling which means shat to me - it may be happen but it cannot be <strong> proven </strong> it actually happens .... they cannot actually estimate how the force of an individual's inhalation at a go or the temperature of the smoke going in - hence dose response issues. No freaking experimental box on a substitute for a lung is going to be like my lungs or anyone elses.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Where is your proof?<br><br>Mine got source one.<br><br>Yours is just plain blabbering.</div>
