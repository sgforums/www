Here are the reasons given by employers...<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In USA</span><br><br>"In our smoking cessation program, staff are required to have been tobacco-free for at least six months, because this relates directly to fitness for the job: how can you give smoking cessation advice credibly with a pack of cigarettes in your pocket? Many US hospitals and other health care providers have such a policy."<br><br>"In recent years, US employers (for example police and firefighters) have decided not to hire people who use tobacco, because of their belief that their staff need to be tobacco free to operate optimally, and to save money on health costs and pensions. Many have offered cessation help."<br><br>"My employer does not hire smokers. I am pleased that we have this policy because it shows commitment and integrity in support of our public health positions. It is also good to be employed in a smoke-free workplace where my fellow employees do not smell of tobacco and are not sick from tobacco."<br><br>"The US Constitution and federal and state civil rights legislation protect against discrimination based on race, gender, age, and disability. There are cogent reasons why some employers might wish to refuse to hire smokers. I don't condone or condemn such hiring policies, but I support the employer's right to adopt a policy to hire only nonsmokers if the employer so chooses."<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In UK</span><br><br>"It is a requirement of their job that our staff be non-smokers for the duration of their period of employment with us. Since we lobby for public health and against tobacco they could not expect to convince others of the merits of our case if they weren't convinced enough themselves not to smoke or to give up."<br><br>"The stance I've taken and publicized in job advertisements is in view of the nature of the work involved, employees are required to be non-smokers. Interestingly we get applications from smokers who seek the job as a cessation aid."<br><br>"We had a firm that, as part of an international organization, had a non-smoking policy. It was challenged in a lawsuit, but the conclusion was that the owner of the firm sets the rules for the company not the employees."<br><br>(Extracted from https://www.srnt.org/pubs/nl_02_05/policies.html)<br><br>In such scenarios, the best solution for smokers is to kick their habit and stop smoking, for the sake of their own employability, their own health, and other people's health.<br><br>If smokers cannot kick the habit, maybe they can consider looking for a job in a tobacco company, which is the least likely place that discriminates against smokers. Haha.</div></blockquote>They forgot about the greatest tobacco smokers  who ever existed like Albert Einstein , Winston Churchill , Thomas Edison , Alexander Graham Bell, Robert Oppenheimer (one fo the scientists who worked on the atomic bomb) , Edwin Hubble ( Hubble telescope fame), George Orwell, Oscar Wilde , Jean Paul Sarte, JRR Tolkien, CS Lewis, Elizabeth Taylor , Frank Sinatra etc ...<br><br>Then we have politicians such as Bill Clinton with his cigars, Helmut Schmidt ( Chancellor of Germany,  Franklin Roosevelt.

People get famous because of their contribution to the society and not because they smoke...<br><br>Smoking is just a matter of personal choice. You choose to smoke and you have your rights. I choose not to smoke and I have my rights. As long as we are considerate and respect each others' rights, we can live in harmony. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>
