Ask any statistician if there is irrefutable proof that smoking causes cancer in terms of your so called sources. Any good statistician or epidemiologist in their right mind will tell you that those studies are just show a strong association but still cannot be truly proven that smoking  causes cancer . Political groups and media exploit the associative linkage and call it a causal link to implement health programs and increase taxes on a substance they call dangerous but refuse to ban.<br><br>Remember to also ask them for confounders and effect modifiers. I am sure you are going to have some fun with that when they tell you there are other missing variables. I know the famous study by Hall that shown the association with smoking and lung cancer (note association NOT cause).<br><br>And by the way , I refuse to have some result of some  experiment on mice  to be applied to me as an individual.  Give me your source ( the full article with data methods and analysis)  and I guarantee you that I can take it apart in terms of its weaknesses.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, in some countries, companies actually discriminates against smokers and they are more likely to hire non-smokers. Here are the reasons given by employers...<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In USA</span><br><br>"In our smoking cessation program, staff are required to have been tobacco-free for at least six months, because this relates directly to fitness for the job: how can you give smoking cessation advice credibly with a pack of cigarettes in your pocket? Many US hospitals and other health care providers have such a policy."<br><br>"In recent years, US employers (for example police and firefighters) have decided not to hire people who use tobacco, because of their belief that their staff need to be tobacco free to operate optimally, and to save money on health costs and pensions. Many have offered cessation help."<br><br>"My employer does not hire smokers. I am pleased that we have this policy because it shows commitment and integrity in support of our public health positions. It is also good to be employed in a smoke-free workplace where my fellow employees do not smell of tobacco and are not sick from tobacco."<br><br>"The US Constitution and federal and state civil rights legislation protect against discrimination based on race, gender, age, and disability. There are cogent reasons why some employers might wish to refuse to hire smokers. I don't condone or condemn such hiring policies, but I support the employer's right to adopt a policy to hire only nonsmokers if the employer so chooses."<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In UK</span><br><br>"It is a requirement of their job that our staff be non-smokers for the duration of their period of employment with us. Since we lobby for public health and against tobacco they could not expect to convince others of the merits of our case if they weren't convinced enough themselves not to smoke or to give up."<br><br>"The stance I've taken and publicized in job advertisements is in view of the nature of the work involved, employees are required to be non-smokers. Interestingly we get applications from smokers who seek the job as a cessation aid."<br><br>"We had a firm that, as part of an international organization, had a non-smoking policy. It was challenged in a lawsuit, but the conclusion was that the owner of the firm sets the rules for the company not the employees."<br><br>(Extracted from https://www.srnt.org/pubs/nl_02_05/policies.html)<br><br>In such scenarios, the best solution for smokers is to kick their habit and stop smoking, for the sake of their own employability, their own health, and other people's health.<br><br>If smokers cannot kick the habit, maybe they can consider looking for a job in a tobacco company, which is the least likely place that discriminates against smokers. Haha.</div>

Without any ppl smoking, there will be a loss of significant tax from tabacco and there will be little subsidy on healthcare and normal ppl like you will then kpkb.</div>
