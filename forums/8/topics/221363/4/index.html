            <div class='col-md body'>Smoking has <strong> never </strong> been uniequivocally proven to cause cancer. There were no random controlled trials to prove it , the studies done on smoking just show an association with cancer - not the strongest in health studies. Not every smoker gets cancer. Even non-smokers get cancer. Cancer is like this big lucky draw and the risks increase with age. No government has banned smoking outright - if it was so bad , it is on the onus of the politicians to ban it INSTEAD of earning revenues from taxing it.<br><br>How about food sold in the supermarket - some contains carcinogenic substances which cause cancer too , i.e. preservatives , your salted egg, salted vegies? They are also associated with risks to cancer too.<br><br>How about the foods like char kway teow and macdonalds ? Should they paste a warning on those food stalls that if eaten too much , it can cause diabetes? How about your coca cola softdrinks? Diabetes can kill and they add more economic cost because it is  a chronic illness and it is worse than cancer in terms of slow degeneration of health (diabetes can affect feet, eyes , kidney) . Cancer kill faster and lessen the economic cost from trying to pump too much costs into the person's treatment.<br><br>There are alot of factors to unhealth which does not include only smoking but other lifestyle choices. Even if you are not a smoker, by chosing to eat too many fastfood , char kway teow  , and not exercise at all - you might die younger than a smoker who choses to smoke but also at the same time , choses to eat healthy and exercise daily.<br></div>

Starting with blocked arteries , diabetes , heart disease ...then you move to the complicated stage where cardiac bypass , foot amputation, renal failure comes in, hypertension related stroke etc  ...That is why I am pasting cigarette warnings ( scratch out "smoking" and replace with "diabetes" kills)  on my friend's krispy kreme donut each time she talks about how bad smoking can be.<br><br>Alcohol is another one - it breeds social problems like fights (sometimes people do get killed in drunken fights, plus wife battering ) and it also  cooks the liver inside while you are alive and you end up getting liver cirrhosis or other liver diseases. Howabout drunken driving - it kills innocent people. It creates alcoholics who cannot function properly unlike smokers who can function without creating a problem . Smoking don't do that much compared to alcohol's social problems and after effects .  Why doesn't anyone condemn alcohol?<br><br>Everything nowadays kills. You walk across the road - you have the risk of getting knocked down by a car or hit by a falling branch.  At the end of the day, we all die still after avoiding all that kills.<br><br>Life is about moderate enjoyment ....you enjoy things while you have time on this existence ....<br><br>If you daresay you never got drunk before , never touched a cigarette and never eat unhealthy food , then go advise the world .

Passive smoking involves inhaling carcinogens, as well as other toxic components, that are present in secondhand tobacco smoke. Carcinogens that occur in secondhand tobacco smoke include benzene, 1,3-butadiene, benzo[a]pyrene, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone, and many others.<br>It is confirmed that, in adults, secondhand smoke causes lung cancer, nasal sinus cancer, breast cancer in younger women, heart disease, heart attacks, and asthma induction. Secondhand smoke is also known to harm children, infants and reproductive health through acute lower respiratory tract illness, asthma induction and exacerbation, chronic respiratory symptoms, middle ear infection, lower birth weight babies, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.[15]<br>In June 2006, US Surgeon General Richard H. Carmona called the evidence against passive smoke "indisputable" and said "The science is clear: secondhand smoke is not a mere annoyance, but a serious health hazard that causes premature death and disease in children and non-smoking adults.".[16] Passive smoking is one of the key issues that have lead to introduction of smoking bans, particularly in workplaces.<br>The composition of Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is similar to fossil fuel combustion products that contribute to air pollution, and has been shown to be responsible for indoor particulate matter (PM) levels far exceeding official outdoor limits.[17]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Eating junk food and getting diabetes or high-blood-cholesterol is your personal choice and personal responsibility. But breathing 2nd-hand smoke is not a choice... Non-smokers are forced to breathe in 2nd-hand smoke.<br><br>If I eat McDonalds or KFC, it's my own problem. I'm harming myself only and I don't affect you... But if you smoke, not only you're harming yourself, you're also harming everyone else around you.<br><br>The 7th lunar month is also quite irritating... Why can't all the people who burn paper money gather somewhere in Tuas or Senoko? Instead the people burn paper money everywhere (the space in front of my block is a popular place to burn stuffs).

Howabout drunken driving - it kills innocent people. It creates alcoholics who cannot function properly unlike smokers who can function without creating a problem . Smoking don't do that much compared to alcohol's social problems and after effects .  Why doesn't anyone condemn alcohol?<br><br>Everything nowadays kills. You walk across the road - you have the risk of getting knocked down by a car or hit by a falling branch.  At the end of the day, we all die still after avoiding all that kills.<br><br>Life is about moderate enjoyment ....you enjoy things while you have time on this existence ....<br><br>If you daresay you never got drunk before , never touched a cigarette and never eat unhealthy food , then go advise the world .
