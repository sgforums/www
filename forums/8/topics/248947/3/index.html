Those weren't enough to fulfill your hedonistic needs. You had everything."<br><br>Cho, it seems, had nothing.<br><br>He had no friends, no normal college life, no reason to live.<br><br>Just a death wish.<br><br>And a desire to show the whole world his disturbed heart.</blockquote>u feel sorry for this kind of person? looks like he is full of jealousy, full of hatred. He refused helps...if he wants to die..why is there a need to massacre ppl?<br><br>his older sis is a princeton graduate, she can make it..dont understand why he hates ppl though<br><br></div>

You forced me into a corner and gave me only one option.</span></strong> The decision was yours. Now you have blood on your hands that will never wash off."<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cho repeatedly suggests he was picked on or otherwise hurt</strong>.</span><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But Ed Spencer, assistant vice president of student affairs, would not comment on any disciplinary proceedings</span></strong>, saying federal law protects students' medical privacy even after death.<br><br></blockquote>Maybe he was gang-raped repeatedly by a bunch of white boys <span style="font-style: italic;">plus</span> the school administration refused to do anything about it because he was chinese?  To add insult to injury it seems that Cho was even disciplined by the school for voicing out his problems.  The last line suggests that the school was trying to cover up what they did.  That would explain the hate and motivation behind the killings.<br><br></div>
