            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, only fanatics buy Oakley and Oakley lenses. Other brands are actually just as good, if not better. Brands like Rudy Project, Tifosi, Maui Jim, even adidas are more value for money than Oakley. If you have money, tag heuer is way better.<br><br>I work in the optical industry and can honestly tell you that Oakley lenses as much as they would have you believe, do not have better optics than other brands. They are just very good at marketing and giving fancy names to thier process and material parts. Plutonite is basically just polycarbonate lenses which are treated with layers of hardcoat. Many companies exist which supply military equipment also can provide these polycarbonate lenses. Plano lenses are not calculated for wrap distortion in the industry, only RX lenses. Their XYZ optics is more a psychological thing. Vision is very sensitive to autosuggestions on the mind, if I tell you something is good what you see actually becomes clearer because your mind reinforces that. People who like Oakley thinks that only Oakley is good, so their mind shuts out other options.<br><br>Just to quote a few cases of Oakley's problems, their iridium lenses which is mirror coated with metal oxide is one of the worst by industry standards. The scratch easily compared to other brands. The reason is that the control for their mirror coating is not impressive. Other European companies can do thicker mirror coats much better with more vibrant colors. Note that Oakley always stress their impact protection, but these lenses are not produced exclusively for them or by them, many companies can do it, not just for the 102 mph test Oakley did but in actual bullet shots test. So called independent test on lenses cited are still affliated to Oakley in some way and in everyway American biased. These test can be easily manipulated.  That is one reason why they cannot afford to give consumers warranty on lenses. If they are so good, why worry about giving a replacement guarantee like Rudy Project.<br><br>Another thing is that the frames also exhibit defect even when it's new. Take for example the X metal range, you will find that the gasket can be loose on one side and the other side is very tight. Also, I had to on many occasions help customers to add nylon strings between the lenses to stop them from moving in the frame. O matter frame once slightly scratched will start to peel off. The lenses will also peel off once the iridium coating is exposed to long period of sweat, salt water and sun.<br><br>I did a little experiment (blind test) on a so called die-hard customer once, he's got a collection of over 20 pairs of Oakley. Brought him outdoors and gave him a tray of 15 pairs of lenses to look through. Apparently, those he identified as protecting his eyes best and most comfortable are not Oakley!! To make it worse, he compared a pair I got from a pasar malam to being about the same quality as an actual Oakley lens.<br><br>My point is that you may want to be more open and consider what will give you the best comfort and protection and not be swayed by brand names and fanciful marketing.  A lot of Oakley fans tend to look down on others and other brands so when you see one, you know a red flag coming. These people don't work in the industry and are usually brainwashed from the truth.<br><br></div>
