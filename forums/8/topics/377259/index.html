              <p>She's not going to jail, so technically she doesnt qualify for

              <p>Dear Veggie,</p>
              <p>I can understand your frustrations and feelings. But on her own accord, and freedom, she had chosed to step down. It is the end of the story, and others, who do not live her life, have no right to further comment on it.</p>
              <p>I personally would have supported her if she had stuck to her guns, and prove beyond words that she deserve a second chance. But she did not, throughout her interviews, only proving she is nothing more than a cheating , materialistic bimbo.</p>
              <p>I would not have minded her english, for i find it creative and cute, as well as unique, but her boomz bimbo ways are hard to forgive. Is that the kind of woman that you want represent what your mom was, your female relatives or sisters are today? It carries the precious representative 'Ms Singapore' tag, of what our precious womenfolk are.</p>
              <p>She failed in her test in her time. She had fail to fight and prove herself beyond the animal instincts still adherent in her, as well as giving up the fight to convince others she deserves that precious 2nd chance that is NOT an automatic right.</p>
              <p>Better that chance be given to someone else, whom can represent the best of our womenfolk, at least in outward beauty without the criminal flaws, of which i am sure there are many more others.</p>
              <p>I am a staunch supporter of the yellow ribbon project, for I believe no person is without flaws. No one must be left behind in our society.  But they must pay the price for their mistakes, and change their ways so as to be able to contribute back to society whom had nurtured them and given them opportunities to excel legally.</p>
              <p>I would plead all to give them a second chance, but those who made mistakes must truly change their ways, or they will be left on the wayside. My fellow citizens are truly a forgiving lot, for i had experience amongst family, relatives and friends whom had given them a second chance inspite of what they had done, and chosed rehabilitation for their mistakes as our prison service had done its best for them.</p>
              <p>If I were to have personal contact with Ms Ris Low, I too, would give her a chance, but if she continues her materialistic ways to get ahead, then I would have to ignore her, and hope she will never be in another position to represent womanhood, let alone nation, for she would put many millions of our other citizens to shame by her unremorseful ways.</p>
              <p>No one will be left behind in our society, for we are an educated, cultivated, and egalitarian society. It is only the choice they make, on their own free will and freedom, that will separate them from us.</p>
              <p>Peace.</p>

              <p>.....a reality nevertheless, or do you want others to prefer demoralizing blame game fantasy sour graping such as yours?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My concerns are not for the petty personal hatreds you have for the ruling party, but only and solely for the aims of our civilised yellow ribbon project, and that it should be continued on, even if i only manage to convince one person in my lifetime.</p>
              <p>Reformed criminals are still our own citizens, and should be given the chance to contribute, if not at national level, at least on their personal level, and not discriminated against, BUT only if they truly reform and change their ways.</p>
              <p>Oh grow up, dont just grow old, and discard your petty feelings. You want change for a better society, its gotta begin with you and me.</p>
              <p>Cynicism may make you look cool and get you laid, but it will get us eventually nowhere in terms of progress for ourselves and the next generation..</p>
