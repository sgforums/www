              <p>There you go beating around the bush. Now its my responsibility to change the hiring policy for private companies. In your eyes, everyone else is responsible except the fucking Government. i dont have to lead by example, i am not part of the Government!</p>
              <p>Continue riding your moral high horse. Or perhaps one of these days it will ride you instead.</p>

              <p>Dear Veggie,</p>
              <p>I can understand your frustrations and feelings. But on her own
              accord, and freedom, she had chosed to step down. It is the end of
              the story, and others, who do not live her life, have no right to
              further comment on it.</p>
              <p>I personally would have supported her if she had stuck to her
              guns, and prove beyond words that she deserve a second chance. But
              she did not, throughout her interviews, only proving she is nothing
              more than a cheating , materialistic bimbo.</p>
              <p>I would not have minded her english, for i find it creative and
              cute, as well as unique, but her boomz bimbo ways are hard to
              forgive. Is that the kind of woman that you want represent what
              your mom was, your female relatives or sisters are today? It
              carries the precious representative 'Ms Singapore' tag, of what our
              precious womenfolk are.</p>
              <p>She failed in her test in her time. She had fail to fight and
              prove herself beyond the animal instincts still adherent in her, as
              well as giving up the fight to convince others she deserves that
              precious 2nd chance that is NOT an automatic right.</p>
              <p>Better that chance be given to someone else, whom can represent
              the best of our womenfolk, at least in outward beauty without the
              criminal flaws, of which i am sure there are many more others.</p>
              <p>I am a staunch supporter of the yellow ribbon project, for I
              believe no person is without flaws. No one must be left behind in
              our society.  But they must pay the price for their mistakes,
              and change their ways so as to be able to contribute back to
              society whom had nurtured them and given them opportunities to
              excel legally.</p>
              <p>I would plead all to give them a second chance, but those who
              made mistakes must truly change their ways, or they will be left on
              the wayside. My fellow citizens are truly a forgiving lot, for i
              had experience amongst family, relatives and friends whom had given
              them a second chance inspite of what they had done, and chosed
              rehabilitation for their mistakes as our prison service had done
              its best for them.</p>
              <p>If I were to have personal contact with Ms Ris Low, I too, would
              give her a chance, but if she continues her materialistic ways to
              get ahead, then I would have to ignore her, and hope she will never
              be in another position to represent womanhood, let alone nation,
              for she would put many millions of our other citizens to shame by
              her unremorseful ways.</p>
              <p>No one will be left behind in our society, for we are an
              educated, cultivated, and egalitarian society. It is only the
              choice they make, on their own free will and freedom, that will
              separate them from us.</p>
              <p>Peace.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I agree with you, for the most part (the educated....egalitarian society part in doubt). Ris Low is not fit to be Miss Singapore because she is still immature. Shown by her bad handling of the issue( hiding the fact that she was convicted, telling multiple versions of the story, and bringing up excuses).</p>
              <p>But otherwise, she is still a human being like us, error-prone and imperfect. My heart goes out to her for being attacked by everyone. She deserves a second chance (just not as Miss Singapore 2009!), like the prisoners. TS isn't off-topic afterall.</p>

              <p>There you go beating around the bush. Now its my responsibility to change the hiring policy for private companies. In your eyes, everyone else is responsible except the fucking Government. i dont have to lead by example, i am not part of the Government!</p>

Ask the so call forgiving governor if they themselves allow people with criminal records more then 10 years ago to hold on an employment licesene or operate an employment agency!!! Let me tell you, the answer will be NO. Even after multi appeals from every assistance you can try and the final answer will still be NO. They will force you to resign from the directorship, give up all the effort you have put in the company &amp; transfer to other people just to save the rest of the staffs. They are all so discriminating and they will not even give you a second chance to live on.</span></p>
