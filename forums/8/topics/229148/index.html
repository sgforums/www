            <div class='col-md body'>which ps2 games are you trying to play in com? im happily completing my final fantasy 10 on my com, and heres how :]  everything you need to get the emulator working, optimal configurations, and how to get optimal speeds for your game AND cpu. with this info you can get and play just about any game you want. even if you dont game i wrote cpu speed increasing and cleaning up tips for your com below. *try googling stuff if you can't find it.<br><br>1. dl PCSX2 (ps2 emulator) version 0.9.2 with virtual memory option. it comes with all 100s of plugins n stuff in 10+ folders, including sound and memory card saves etc.<br>2. for graphics plugin the best and fastest is ZeroGS KOSMOS 0.96.0. it requires a graphics card that supports pixel shaders 2. if it isnt the default, dl it and replace the older version zerogs file in the graphics plugin folder.<br>3. under pcsx2's configuration, use the Set Plugins Directory and Set Bios Directory to the folder where your download is. then choose and set which of the multiple plugins for sound video cdrom etc you want to use. then set controller keys. qewsad uiopjk is good.<br>4. hard part: to get it to work you need the BIOS / BINARY FILE. i think im using scph54000.bin (europe). there are a few others you can use. good luck finding a working scph*****.bin, its really hard to find + illegal so no one or forum will post it. after you got the scph*****.bin you have to configure it in your pcsx2's bios directory. legal way of getting it is to dump your ps2's bios. (Dont).<br>5. dl utorrent. if u want to know how to get much higher dl speeds and best advanced configurations with utorrent, ask me.<br>6. use thepiratebay.com or isohunt.com or google to find torrents of the game you want<br>7. check the description to find out if its PAL or NTSC n what country.<br>8. dl one that has more seeders (ppl hosting it) and comments about it working, utorrent will dl it<br>9. extract the game's iso img, COMPRESS for speed. (btw this is how ppl make pirated games)<br>10. in PCSX2's cdvdrom configuration, use linuzapps's, set the folder with your compressed game iso.<br>11. go to file, run cd.<br>12. keep everything in the same folder and dont drag your emulators icon out seperately onto desktop.<br><br>GETTING YOUR COM AND GAME TO RUN MUCH FASTER:<br><br>check specifications of your com by going to &gt;start &gt;&gt; run &gt;&gt; open cmd &gt;&gt; type dxdiag<br><br>1. if your com is dual core processor, under ur PCSX2 0.9.2 VM 's cpu config, enable multi threaded GS mode and dual core mode. this will make your game much faster, same speeds or faster than real ps2.  (mine is single core so cant :[ )<br><br>2. go to start &gt;&gt;control panel&gt;&gt; performance&gt;&gt;system&gt;&gt;advanced&gt;&gt;virtual memory&gt;&gt;see maximum size that can be allocated and set your initial size to that max. run the pcsx2 virtual memory version instead of nonVM.<br><br>3. if your com is single core, you need at least 512 mb ram and 2.93 ghz.<br><br>4. ur game will run slower on single core so use VU frame skip and off billinear filtering.<br><br>5. OVERCLOCK YOUR COM ram AT YOUR OWN RISK. Starting up your system holding down the Â“DELÂ” delete key will bring the system into the BIOS. At the frequency screen set the frequency adjustment to manual, this unlocking the FBS multiplier usually on the far top of the screen. The frequency adjustment also usually has the clock speed reading as hundreds or thousands. if you using a Pentium 4 it is, then the next frequency level would be 134, then 135, and so on. For every upgrade to the frequency setting restart the computer noting if the startup was successful. If yes, then follow the same instruction to raise the level again. If not then raise the voltage of the processor in the smallest increments available. Restart again and note if it was successful or not. Ideally you should not raise the voltage of the processor more than .2, if you do then you MUST invest in better cooling such as liquid filled heat sinks. Once you have raised the frequency till it crashes and voltage no more than .2 then retain the previous successful frequency, and raise the voltage another .05 to add stability. Restart and run an application such as Si-Sandra to monitor the temperature of the processor, running the application for several hours at full stress. If the temperature rises more than 20% then enter the BIOS and drop the voltage and frequency. Repeat the process until your processor temperature is within the 20% threshold. this is brief, if you want more details pm me.<br><br>6. If your cpu is HP or dell and you cant overclock that way, do it by dl ATITOOL and increase your core and memory by slight increments, show 3d view and make sure no white spots on the block after 5+ mins. u can increase core from default at least 130 more and memory at least 80. save profile and set clock.<br>if you set it too high and colors all go crazy n hang, reset cpu and try again.<br><br>IF your cpu is cluttered and slow you can do the following:<br><br>7. dl free up ram, cookie cleaner, ad-aware.<br><br>8. go to start &gt;&gt; search &gt;&gt; type in .mp3, included hidden files, all the mp3 etc you have deleted and emptied recycle bin will resurface, even all the folders of documents and pics from other XP user accounts that have been deleted + xp account deleted will all resurface. manually delete all those and empty bin to free up a LOT of space.<br><br>9. go to start &gt;&gt; control panel &gt;&gt; performance, compress old files n clear temp/bin files etc, then adjust visual effects for best performance.<br><br>10. ctrl alt del then end processes u dont need like atiptaxx.exe, itunes, limewire, msn etc. then let your pcsx2 run at 98% usage.<br><br>* If your com has trojan horses / virus / malware / spyware, i'll try to help, i can and have removed dif trojans which dump hundreds of malware n viruses into the com. including those that norton cannot remove or touch. you dont have to post me a hijackthis log either, if your com has any little icon saying the name the trojan you have. tell me the name and i'll tell you what to do to remove it and all its processes and all other malware that came with it. (eg. trojan-spy.win32@mx n its whole bundle of is common for ppl who dl movies games metal albums n porn like me. jk ; )  you will probably never have to bring ur com to repair or reformat.<br><br>*worldwide almost all ppl with single core mediocre cpu and my specs run ff10 at about 15-30 fps (frames per second), which is 2-3 times slower than real ps2. on my single core 512mb cpu i got ff10 running at average 55+ fps, perhaps mainly thx to overclocking + many other things.<br><br>*if its ps1 games you want to play instead, dl pcsxe emulator instead, all its plugins, and search hard for the sph1001.bin instead.<br><br>*any other qns just ask instead of trial and error with ur cpu<br><br>have fun and happy gaming!</div>
