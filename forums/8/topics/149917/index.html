            <div class='col-md body'>i was on a bus a few days ago and was sitting at the back of the bus. then, at a bus stop, three malay guys came on the bus, carrying their big radio set, sat at the very back of the bus and began blasting out their music.<br><br>why they like to disrupt the peace in the bus? i wanted to confront them but i am so small sized and these 3 are quite big-sized, so i end up tahan their music until i reach my destination. nobody confronted them as well.<br><br>why do young people nowadays like to do that? don't they have some sense of proper behavior?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>But to say a word of fairness, some elderly are unappreciative of these acts of courtesy. They just take it for granted, don't even bother to thank you. These kind account for 50% of those elderly whom I gave up my seat to. Students most likely would not give up their seats(in fact I have never seen any female students doing that before, once in a blue moon,only one or two male students) becuase they are very tired and want to sleep. While this may not be an excuse for not being civic-minded, students who are standing are also less likely to fight for seats with other passengers.<br>I know of this women whom I nicknamed "seatgrabber". I don't personally know her, but I have seen her many times because she takes the same bus as me every morning. What makes me very peeved is her behaviour. From the very front of a very crowded bus, she would bulldoze(not exxagerating) her way through to the middle and stop beside any Assumption English student and refuse to budge even when other people are moving towards the rear. So now people have to squeeze past her. Then when the student allights, she will immediately "grab" the seat. What is worse was that I observed that she does this almost daily and once even pre-empted an elderly woman who was most likely hoping to get that seat.  Such ungracious behaviour is really deplorable.</div>
