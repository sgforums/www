            <div class='col-md body'>Waterfront homes are popular and usually command a price premium. However, they face the risk of losing the sea view or access to the sea whenever there is any new development between the existing property and the sea.<br><br>Over the past three decades, land reclamation has expanded the coastal land mass and changed the coastline of Singapore significantly. So what is the impact on the price of a waterfront property when the sea view is lost?<br><br>A recent example is The Bayshore, a 30-storey condominium development located near the East Coast Park. Residents in the 1,038-unit project used to enjoy sea views. However, when the 30-storey Costa del Sol - a came up next door, The Bayshore lost its views. As a result, prices of the units have since dropped.<br><br>From 1995 to 1999, homes in The Bayshore had an unobstructed view of the sea. The rate of change of the transacted prices of units in The Bayshore was an average 5.5 per cent higher than the price index of condos in the eastern region of Singapore.<br><br>From 2000 onwards, when it became clear that The Bayshore would lose its sea view as the construction of Costa del Sol proceeded, the transacted price of units in The Bayshore began to drop at a faster rate than the price index.<br><br>From the first quarter of 2000 to mid-2004, the price index of condominiums in the eastern region fell 25.5 per cent, while transacted prices of The Bayshore dropped by a steeper 35.7 per cent. Correspondingly, the average rate of price decline of The Bayshore is 7.2 per cent greater than the fall in the price index over the same period.<br><br>Therefore, based on the The Bayshore example, it appears that condominiums with a sea view enjoy a price premium. But if the sea view is lost, not only is the premium wiped out, the price of the property suffers a greater rate of decline than the average market prices of other condominiums in the area.</div>

Like i said nobody will want to stay in a ulu place like there. It will remind u of the first appearance of HDB alongside kampunmg in the 70s and 80s.</div>
