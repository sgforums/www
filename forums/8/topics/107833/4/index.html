            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Free market principle and sheer scale of its market alone does not encourage innovation. And what is the definition of engines of innovations; arenÂ’t they comprised of founders and inventers; their ideas and determination to succeed? And by that, wouldnÂ’t their education count? </blockquote>What you find is that the global characteristics of business schools mean that European biz schools invite people from all over the world to teach, mentor &amp; talk about their experiences / successes.  The accessibility and contact with a huge network of people means it doesn't matter where you're based, your education and your scope takes you to whichever part of the world you want.  There are countless exchange programmes or gap years in MBA schools, where an INSEAD graduate can, if he really thinks so, travel to the States to see if the "entrepreneural backdrop" really is so vital in today's globalised nature of business education.<br><br><blockquote>While I cannot qualitatively prove the link between the learning environment and number of innovations/successful startups, there must be a link between inventorsÂ’/foundersÂ’ education and their success. </blockquote>Only a small faction of businesses in the States were founded upon formal education.<br><br><blockquote>A hypothetical question, if ten years ago, the USÂ’s strips its business education environment of internships, mentorship, or any other real business involvement, would the free market principal alone be able to produce that many innovations, ideas and startups this past decade? Surely it would be much less and if anyone answers the same, wouldnÂ’t it be agreeable that all schools being the same, US internships, mentorship and business community involvement are better since they help produce more? </blockquote>Nope.  European ones offer just as well in every aspect.  3M, Google, etc. all are operating worldwide.  This is clear top-down analysis, the US seems to be emphasized when I say as in repetition that Europe can give you the exposure if you want it.  Imperial College's 2003 business winner has a Harvard MBA grad on its team.  If you really think contact with the US entrepreneural backdrop is essential, European schools can offer that to you.  Geographical location is not vital.  Even within America, some places are more accessible to startups than others.</div>
