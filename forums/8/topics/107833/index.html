But it was the 3rd  time bfore you get the hang of it. Most successful businessmen build 2-3 biz b4 they get successful....we see the glamor side but we always overlook the tough side. Knowledge is also important...Learn form failure becoz success comes only after failure.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've just won an entrepreneural idea's competition at my university (Imperial College, UK).  The most important thing is planning/strategy to make it feasible/effective, &amp; to getting funding/investment.  That's what allows a business to take off.<br><br>What makes a business successful includes how you time your entry into a market, the macroeconomic trends is where opportunities are affected.  Is it an emerging market/industry?  What are the social/political/legal factors?<br><br>Then there's the quality of the idea, whether the technology/service is truly brilliant, whether it can be protected (patented, copyright), and whether it can fight off competition.  That's the microeconomic strength.<br><br>And I always hear, is "a 2nd class idea in the hands of a 1st class person, is better than a 1st class idea in the hands of a 2nd class person".  The team is essential.  Who forms the company, why are they the right people, the right mixture, you need to convince people that you're talent.  Very often you need an advisory board, of experienced professionals who can give invaluable guidance.<br><br>Finally, it's about how you plan/balance the risk-benefits, &amp; pitch/sell the idea.<br><br>How you use talent/ideas, &amp; connect it with investment/spending is what managing and growing the business entails.  Where will you be in 5 years time?  Most companies really pay off when they go public (IPO), or get acquired/merged with a larger company.  Who forms the management?  Will you put yourself as a CEO or invite a Harvard MBA?  Will the core team stay with the company in the years ahead?  Will there be a need to do R&amp;D or cut back the scale?<br><br>If you want to start, it's all about networking.  Putting the right combination of minds together can make eureka!  If you walk to Topshop/Topman, you may see a label there called "Raygun".  Simply by walking in London's Convent Garden I actually met the boss!  He's taken my contact details and seems interested in seeking proposals for his growing business.  That's what I networked simply by talking to someone in a retail shop.  I might end up one day in London's creative fashion niche, though it seems unlikely at present.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by thoreldan:</div><div class="quote_body">nah....u really think business school produce businessmen??</div></blockquote>50 years ago you could quit school, start a business and be successful. given the complexity and sophistication of today's business world u can't enter business without recieving the proper training. dont tell me you want to put a drop out at the head of a top investment company. george soros has a Yale MBA. warren buffet may not have gone to a top school but at least he went to Nebraska-Lincoln. nearly all of the successful businessmen went to college. bill gates may have quit harvard but before that he was already writing complex math stuff and if he made it to harvard, damned he must be good! and its not me who said this.i've asked many experienced adults and this is the answer that all of them gave me. well unless u wanna start a small low profit business like a confectionery shop then thats a different case.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Successful business people are very mean. They dun teach you that in the MBA course do they?<br><br>The 3 traits I observed over the years that successful people have in common are charisma, ruthlessness and highly unethical sharp practices and you wont  learn all these things in school.<br><br>One of the early companies I worked for as a small junior employee had such a big boss, a university dropout but already a highly successful multi millionaire by 35 and also highly unethical slave driver to emloyees and sharp  business practices to partners. A real puppet master who knew how to use deceit, fear and motivation to run his business.<br><br>He knew how to manipulate people esp young 20-30 something career hungry people looking for quick advancement up the corporate ladder. And these people are not your stupid kind, they are the intelligent ones with the double degree, MBA's or what not. It was really their bad luck to have met such an employer. He would suck them dry and spit them out.<br><br>First he gives them fabulous titles like senior manager, project consultant or project director and promises of pay increment and further promotion at the end of project completion, and so they would worked their butts off to do the things that he asks. But the work never ends they finish one project there's always another 2-3 new projects for them or something else that needs to be changed. Finally they give up and leave in a hurry.<br><br>Or he forces them out by appointing a manager to report to a subordinate within his own team. A lot of them cried when they left, But despite being so mean there were always a train of career hungry people at his doorstep always trying to win his favor and he played them all incl some of his own relatives which he employed.<br><br>In one other project he owed a very substantial amt to a business partner which was a large american IT MNC but he refused to pay a cent and led them by the nose for nearly a year before they found out his game and threatened to sue, then only he grudgingly paid.<br><br>On other times to make everyone toe his line, he'd sack people for lame reasons. During a recession year a few employees were just asking their managers abt year end bonuses and he overheard. So he randomly sacked 3 employees on the eve of christmas and another 4 on eve of CNY. After that nobody asked why that year got no 13 month or variable bonus.<br><br>That company today listed on stock exchange ... ironic.</div>
