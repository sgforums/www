They dun teach you that in the MBA course do they?<br><br>The 3 traits I observed over the years that successful people have in common are charisma, ruthlessness and highly unethical sharp practices and you wont  learn all these things in school.<br><br>One of the early companies I worked for as a small junior employee had such a big boss, a university dropout but already a highly successful multi millionaire by 35 and also highly unethical slave driver to emloyees and sharp  business practices to partners. A real puppet master who knew how to use deceit, fear and motivation to run his business.<br><br>He knew how to manipulate people esp young 20-30 something career hungry people looking for quick advancement up the corporate ladder. And these people are not your stupid kind, they are the intelligent ones with the double degree, MBA's or what not. It was really their bad luck to have met such an employer. He would suck them dry and spit them out.<br><br>First he gives them fabulous titles like senior manager, project consultant or project director and promises of pay increment and further promotion at the end of project completion, and so they would worked their butts off to do the things that he asks. But the work never ends they finish one project there's always another 2-3 new projects for them or something else that needs to be changed. Finally they give up and leave in a hurry.<br><br>Or he forces them out by appointing a manager to report to a subordinate within his own team. A lot of them cried when they left, But despite being so mean there were always a train of career hungry people at his doorstep always trying to win his favor and he played them all incl some of his own relatives which he employed.<br><br>In one other project he owed a very substantial amt to a business partner which was a large american IT MNC but he refused to pay a cent and led them by the nose for nearly a year before they found out his game and threatened to sue, then only he grudgingly paid.<br><br>On other times to make everyone toe his line, he'd sack people for lame reasons. During a recession year a few employees were just asking their managers abt year end bonuses and he overheard. So he randomly sacked 3 employees on the eve of christmas and another 4 on eve of CNY. After that nobody asked why that year got no 13 month or variable bonus.<br><br>That company today listed on stock exchange ... ironic.</div></blockquote>...man.... cannot believe such coy still survive...<br>this man must be quite a bastard...<br>i believe such people exist...<br><br>cos I worked for similiar coy b4... a 'local MNC' infact... after i left...<br>many people resigned too...<br>they r like slave driver... setting ridiculous schedules...<br>most employees wan to be responsible n had to work lik slave to<br>meet them... which ofcos is often not possible...<br>most wanted to resign early... but r tied by their<br>seemling baised contract terms tat says employee has to pay<br>back 6 mths if he resign within 1st 6 mths....whereas company<br>only pay 1-2 mths if they sack u...<br>theres more of cos....<br><br>The experienced left a mental scar in me...<br>n many of my former colls also felt working for such coy 'spoilt' their mind quite badly n many felt the need to re-adjust n rest their mind after such bad experiences...<br>now even if they pay me double, i wont work for them...<br><br>I feel the government / MOM is only concerned abt employment rate...<br>n protect employers too much...<br>whereas alot of mal-practise in the industry often go unnoticed/unreported...<br>or some of these employers play around w the fine lines of law...<br><br>They shud have a list of blacklisted companies and publish their names<br>on newpaper...<br><br>which is why a recent article shows many sporean unhappy<br>abt their job....<br><br>Man... someone shud bring such issues out to government....<br>i feel employment rate is only too superficial....<br>too many autocrats slave-driving bosses in Spore....<br>I must say that i myself am too disappointed w such...<br>n will never work for a local coy anymore....<br><br></div>

It does not prove you need a busiess degree. You use a true statement. But it is irrelevant to what you are trying to prove - you need a business degree. In fact, you just prove otherwise. The people you quote, except soros, did not have a business degree.<br><br>Also maybe the adults you talked to are all employees. Talk to those who have done it, not those who did not.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A lot of those universities in the UK are lower-tier.  If you ask me, I suggest studying in London.  It's too cool!  City University is alright, their business school is famous so it should be a good option for business management.  Apart from that, the best on that list is probably Warwick.  One of the UK's top 20 universities.  The rest I'd cast aside, not worth it for the fees you pay.  Of the American ones, nothing seems to stand out, but state universities may be cheaper than private ones...Not sure about foreign student fees over there.</div>
