            <div class='col-md body'>If you are really interested in getting an education about entrepreneurship, I would suggest coming to the US, the most entrepreneurial country in the world. And I am talking more than just the degree in college, you get education from interacting with CEOs and owners of big and small businesses, who readily provide you with support and  mentorship. There are vast resources and programs to help you succeed. Many Americans eat, breathe new ideas and entrepreneurship. You will be in a learning environment that cannot be found elsewhere. Here, a good education isnÂ’t just from the classroom. It is a combination of experiences, connections, inspirations combined with the classroom that gives you the best education. That is the mentality of many US schools and it is under this kind of environment and culture that allows the US to produce some of the best entrepreneurs in the world if not the most.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A military experience is still an experience. In the US, one puts that on the resume with pride. People here respect you when you have done some kind of military stint, especially since they are voluntary and the service is longer. I still get some kind of respect when people know that I was in the military even though it is a military stint in another country.<br><br>In Singapore, it might be superfluous to put military experience on your resume since everyone did military service. It should be given credit for educating young minds in discipline, teamwork, leadership, initiative, and shouldnÂ’t be discounted as a waste of time. It is a pity that just because everyone serves, its value diminishes as one of the most useful experience you can use throughout your life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For those who are  interested,<br>Here are the top 25 America's Most Entrepreneurial Campuses for 2004 according to Forbes/Princeton Review, based on the emphasis for <strong>mentorships, internships and experiential learning.</strong><br><br><blockquote>The emphasis in these programs is on the entrepreneurial spirit, and students are encouraged to follow their own path. Mentorships, internships, and experiential learning are emphasized. Students are encouraged to major in other disciplines, like biomedical science, where tomorrow's great innovations might be born. And prominent entrepreneurs serve on the staff, not just ivory-tower academics, helping students get a feel for what the challenges of the business world are really like. </blockquote>That is what a solid entrepneurial education should really be; <strong> interconnected with outside classroom experiences, internships at successful companies,  supportive business community, startup programs that partner with real businesses whether it is Inc 500, fortune 500s and small business alike </strong>, which I think the US backdrop readily provides.<br><br>1. University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill<br><blockquote>This year's winner, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, already offers an undergraduate business degree with a concentration in entrepreneurship, and next fall will allow students in its College of Arts and Sciences to minor in entrepreneurship. The school recently used a $3.5 million grant from the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation to create the Carolina Entrepreneurial Initiative, a campus-wide program that focuses on creating entrepreneurs. Students are encouraged to participate in a variety of extracurricular activities, including The Carolina Entrepreneurship Club and Students in Free Enterprise, and to exploit school-sponsored programs like The Carolina Launch Program, designed to guide students through the process of starting up their own venture. The school also partners with a number of prominent companies, including Ernst &amp; Young, which hosts the Master Panel of Entrepreneurs, during which award-winning entrepreneurs share their stories with students. </blockquote>2. University of Notre Dame<br>3. Louisiana State University and A&amp;M College<br>4. Northeastern University<br>5. Indiana University - Bloomington<br>6. Carnegie Mellon University<br>7. Syracuse University<br>8. University of Arizona<br>9. University of Iowa<br>10. University of New Hampshire<br><br>I also think that one of the most overlooked places for entrepreneurship learning is in China. China is a fast growing hotbed of entrepreneurial activities and I would imagine their universities reflecting that trend. I donÂ’t have much experience in this matter except that I do know a few Chinese graduates and they display some of the most fascination insights and discussions on new ideas and capitalism.<br><br></div>

O-P-P-O-R-T-U-N-I-T-I-E-S.<br><br>More opportunities for internships: experience working at fortune 500 companies, Inc 500, startups, even non-profits, with many great diverse companies to choose and real case studies to learn from.</blockquote>Excuse me?  I was born in the UK, so spelling the word opportunities as if to a moron would probably be more applicable from me to you.  Therefore I am disinclined to acquiesce your patronising manner.  The point is that your aggressiveness on this issue is pointless.  I fully agree that the USA has a better backdrop for new ventures, yet I am simply picking the <span style="font-style: italic;">creme de la crop</span> of Europe and stating they're just as good.  The number of new ventures in Europe are definitely lesser than that of the US, but their case studies are drawn from a global perspective, whereas the States concentrates more formally upon its domestic "backdrop".  Likewise for networking.  The US has a slightly better network, but the top in Europe are just as good, if not more international in diversity.  One point where I agree is the number of conventions &amp; forums in the States to meet people.  Europe has less, but not a poorer A-list of people.  INSEAD in fact is especially famous for its network.  LBS and IMD are outstanding for their entrepreneurship MBAs, their rankings speak volumes.  The backdrop of Europe is blatantly less colourful that the States, yet they're still up there.  European MBAs revolutionised the business classroom.  They're the ones that sparked closer contact to industry, encouraged mentoring schemes, etc.<br><br><blockquote>More opportunities for synergy: share ideas and work with liked-minded people like yourself.

But I can simply say top European schools are not outdone in entrepreneurship by American business schools.  It's not quantity, but the real issue here is quality.  Start-up guys such as from amazon travel across the Atlantic to tap into the talent in Europe.  And plenty of Americans come all the way over to study at Imperial, Oxford, Cambridge, all of which have relatively new MBA programmes.  Let's not even mention the number of Americans in INSEAD.  The "opportunity" of entreprise is in the network alone.  Being closer to existing start-ups doesn't do much.  The real "opportunity" is whether there are venture capitalists willing to give you the money to get going.  In Britain there are plenty, in Europe there are plenty more.  The States is number 1 in domination of business schools, number 1 in the seed-bed for entrepreneurs, though not necessarily top in the classroom for entrepreneurship.  You're looking for a good education at the end of the day, doesn't mean you need to rub Donald Trump's back (how's his bankruptcy doing nowadays?)<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>PS  "More opportunities to succeed" in the States?

Someone I know attended the Imperial Entrepreneurship MBA over 10 years ago.  Even in that time the class was flown out to EuroDisney as a typical case study.  Nothing in a pro-active American biz class gets overlooked in Europe.  You may have Forbes 500, but Europe collectively has something the size of a hypothetical "Forbes 400"<br><br>In Europe however, entrepreneurship is emerging in a new light that is way more aplicable to the future trend of business.  Young professionals in Europe are nowadays much more entrepreneural, and they differ from American start-ups in the sense that they're much less commercial and much more idea-driven.  A generational change in business instincts is coming through Europe's knowledge-based society.<br><br><blockquote>You are free to dissect my points as you already have, but constructively, please.

Let me state here I agree.</blockquote>The main point I make is that although America has much more entrepreneurship activity, there are sufficient and also significant enterprises in Europe that should not be discounted, and which provide every inch and aspect of a solid MBA as any American one.  There are just as many opportunities to network, just as many start-ups to get close to, just as many quality mentor schemes, everything.  The only point I decided to become more aggressive was in the last post.<br><br><blockquote>Just because I mentioned the reasons for US providing a better backdrop for a well-rounded entrepreneurial education does not mean I think all US colleges are good.

"choose US because of..."  You have still opted to mention a top-down analysis on schools selection, whereas the subtle point I make that comparable schools anywhere should be more of a bottom-up process.  Whilst you agree on this, you say that the US also has further advantages because of its wide entrepreneural scope.  My view is that although the scope is smaller in Europe, the opportunity and exposure is still just as rich.  Hence I believe a mere bottom-up process alone is sufficient.  One major reason for saying this is that different MBAs have different structures &amp; teaching styles.  You need one that suits what you're looking for, and looking at the structure of those at INSEAD for example, no one in the world could outshine them in terms of bringing in practising entrepreneurs, networks, opportunities.  The reason is that INSEAD's alumni, like all other top schools, spans the entire world.  A lot go to America for opportunity, a lot remain in Europe where there's also plenty of opportunity, and a lot go to the rest of the world.<br><br><blockquote>The other reason for emphasising on opportunities is to let people know that these are merely opportunities, where one has to sought out and take advantage of them.

Opportunities abound, there are loads of successful businesses, the new ideas coming out nowadays are screamers, the quality of people I see are undisputed.  It's the same thing here.  A wealth of resources, great network of successful people, &amp; opportunity that is only meaningful if you take them.<br><br><blockquote><br>Perhaps your definition of entrepreneurship is different from mine. Not everyone thinks that a successful enterprise involves venture capitalist funding or an IPO exit strategy. Some think non-profits. I think angel investors and private savings, of course, VC money would be good too.</blockquote>Whils I agree on other fundings such as angel investors, I see idea-driven knowledge-based enterprises as the way of the future.  This is where Europe is emerging, think silicon valley, but probably more value for money in terms of costs &amp; creativity.  The streamlining of large and small businesses together.  There are hardly any more googles or e-bays, the industry has started to focus upon medium high-tech start-ups.  Venture capital, idea/technology focused product, and finally just as you hit the nail, exit strategy (for your investor).  The new economy cluster around Nokia and Ericsson is the best example of Europe's growing strength in this trend.<br><br>It's not that America doesn't have these types, but it's not quite grown there like it has with Europe.  Europe is very strong in science/research, but less commercial.  The business schools here however have started to consolidate on technology spin-outs, (America's best school for this is probably MIT).  Europe has impressive knowledge-creating societies, but doesn't fulfil its potential commercially.  But business schools can handle that perfectly well for the relative few who do go for MBAs.<br><br><blockquote>In my case, the single most important real opportunity of my entrepreneurial education is the mentorship, internship and advice from business owners, leaders and liked-minded entrepreneurs.  Without that foundation and experience, I would have squandered VC money anyway.</blockquote>Certainly.  Still, nothing different from what you can find in Europe.  INSEAD allows its students to go freely between Fontainbleu and Singapore, depending on the regional focus of expertise &amp; experience.  Sue Birley was head of Imperial's Entrepreneurship Centre, surely you must know her as the top or 2nd top academic professor in the world for entrepreneurship.   Europe can offer the best, in every aspect, including mentorship &amp; internship, and is changing in the sense that its schools are getting more flexible, more tailored to growth trends, and in my view just as creative (if not better) in unique classroom techniques.<br><br>In a way you talk about America's fundamental strength in entrepreneurship, I'm talking about the new economy and Europe's successful path towards a new entrepreneural model.<br><br>The Silicon Valley, America's closest thing to the New Economy is still very different from Europe.  To me they seem like an aggressive get-rich-quick culture.  Job-creation alone is not the yardstick of success for Europe.  The old continent needs its own yardstick additional to job-creation, which I think are creativity, learning, discovery, social value.  The new economy will enhance Europe to become just as dynamic in business as America, but without the social cost.<br><br>Having said that, I think America still easily holds the niche of the world's most brilliant innovators.  3M for example, giving something like 15% of working time for employees to do anything they want to churn out ideas.  The company that designs logos for some of the world's biggest corporations, where people literaelly "create" their own work-space, etc.  You don't want to be doing something like "The apprentice" for Donald Trump, you want to really get into value-creation &amp; creativity.  e-bay and amazon are fantastic in my opinion, but not Trump hotels.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the point we are both really debating boils down to whether a top tier European school or a top tier US school (comparable), offers a more well rounded entrepreneurial education. I myself majored in business with marketing and psychology focus, as I do not believe that entrepreneurship can really be taught in the classroom, hence my position on the need for outside classroom learning. My entrepreneurial education is mostly hands on through internship and mentorship, therefore my insistence on finding a program with strong real business involvement. You did point out that UK offers the same if not better outside classroom education:<br><br><blockquote>Opportunities abound, there are loads of successful businesses, the new ideas coming out nowadays are screamers, the quality of people I see are undisputed. It's the same thing here.

It might very well be. I will acknowledge that pitting two educational systems/ learning environment is very subjective, as witnessed by our continuous debate, especially when there are no concrete measurements available. However, my position is based on two assumptions, which are open to debate:<br><br>First, there are more number of innovations, startups and successful entrepreneurs out of the US over the past decade.<br>Second, those innovations, ideas and successful startups are based in part on its Â‘ involving real businesses and successful entrepreneursÂ’ learning environment.<br><br>You have already question my second assumption:<br><br>Being closer to existing start-ups doesn't do much<br>and<br>That's not because of the business schools, they're not the engines of innovation. America's free-market principle &amp; the sheer scale of its market is what allows so many small businesses to thrive.<br><br>Free market principle and sheer scale of its market alone does not encourage innovation. And what is the definition of engines of innovations; arenÂ’t they comprised of founders and inventers; their ideas and determination to succeed? And by that, wouldnÂ’t their education count?<br><br>While I cannot qualitatively prove the link between the learning environment and number of innovations/successful startups, there must be a link between inventorsÂ’/foundersÂ’ education and their success.<br><br>A hypothetical question,  if ten years ago, the USÂ’s strips its business education environment of internships, mentorship, or any other real business involvement, would the free market principal alone be able to produce that many innovations, ideas and startups this past decade? Surely it would be much less and if anyone answers the same, wouldnÂ’t it be agreeable that all schools being the same, US internships, mentorship and business community involvement are better since they help produce more?</div>
