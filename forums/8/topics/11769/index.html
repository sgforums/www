            <div class='col-md body'>At bedok north ave 4, blk 99, there used to be a famous suicide case where by the boy mother threw her 3 year old sleeping child down the 25th floor. After which she fell to her death too. The police classified as as suicide and no foul play was<br>suspected. The family had problems, lots of financial problem. The husband owed the loanshark lots of money, the family was  breaking up. The father was seeing another woman and he wanted a divorce.<br><br>The wife refused and hence they quarelled everyday. What's more errie was that at her death, she was wearing a bright red dress, which was her wedding gown. Although there ws no suicide note, something weird she wrote on the wall would freak most of us out. She wrote "Its not over, darling" in chinese with her OWN BLOOD! But the truth is, she never did return at all. BUt someone else did!<br><br>THe husband wanted to sell the house but could find a buyer, so in the end, his mistress move in and got married. After a few years, they got a boy, which was by then 3 year old. One day something spooky took place. Out of a sudden, the boy who was sleeping in the afternoon, suddenly started talking and laughing in the room. The maid went in to check but found the boy<br>simply just smiling at the wall and said "kor kor" which means brother! THe maid told the events to the parents that night but<br>they simply said they he was playing by himself.<br><br>That night, the son suddenly cried very loudly and run to his father and said that Kor Kor bullied him. The father simply   scolded him and tell him not to make things up. That night, the boy refused to sleep in his room and hence the father got no  choice but to let him sleep in his room. In the middle of the night, suddenly the boy's room was filled with loud banging of<br>cupboards and loud cries of a child.<br><br>The crying seemed oddly similiar, thought the father, its as though it was his dead son. Scared, the father told his son to stay<br>in the room while he and his wife check it out. But when they open the boy's room, nothing was found. Suddenly, their maid<br>screamed! The parents rush back to the room only to find their son standing on the edge of the window. IT is not know how<br>the grilles have be pryed open, but there he was, laughing and smiling, waving goodbye to them and said that he is flying with superman, his brother.<br><br>One final flying kiss, and he leaped to the darkness. The mother and the maid fainted. THe next day, the police swarmed the<br>place once again for investigation. THe father was kinda lunatic at the point of time, the mother was still too distraught to<br>speak. On the walls of the parents room,<br>something even more creepy awaits them. The words "THis is for mommy" in chinese was scribbled on the wall in black.<br><br>The police has classified this case as unnatural death, not foul play was suspected again. Till today, the unit is still vacant as neighbours would go around telling potential buyers about the history of the house. Rumour was that the night of the incident took place, it was the little boy 3 year old birthday(the one that was thrown down by his mother) anniversary. Many neighbours that night could hear strange errie  sounds of a woman crying softly.<br><br>Many years have past, till today, the present, many people could still hear a boy and a woman laughing in the middle of the<br>night!!!<br><br>The End<br><br>* proudly sponsored by adenoma of HWZ *<br><br><img src="http://www.fantasiafest.com/images/film/99/ring.jpg"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another story to share<br><br>The MOST haunted- ECP's Yellow Tower.<br>A few years back, a couple met a group of rapists while they were having a date at the top of the Yellow Tower. In his bid to protect his girlfriend, the guy was badly beaten up and dragged to the base of the tower and his girlfriend was brutally gang-raped and killed. After that incident, it was rumoured that the girl's spirit still hang around the Yellow House.<br><br>Cyclists who cycle past there at night have heard cried and a white ghostly figure floating around the Yellow Tower.<br><br>In an email sent to xxxxxx.com:" My friends and I were having a BBQ at a chalet at Costa<br>Sands East Coast and feeling bored, we decided to take a walk along the beach. There were about 5 of us, all guys and as we were chatting and walking we neared the Yellow Tower, 2 of the guys suddenly turned pale and started running back to the chalet. I personally did not notice anything in particular but sensing something amiss, I ran with the rest as well! It was<br>only back at the chalet before the 2 guys confessed that both saw a white figure standing at the tower and they started running when it floated towards them! Another friend of mine then pointed out that a murder once took place there and it was the victim female spirit that was kind of guarding the tower. Ever since that night, I never went near the tower at night.<br><br>The End<br><br>* proudly sponsored by singalore.com *<br><br><img src="http://www.singalore.com/ecp/beacon1.jpg"></div>
