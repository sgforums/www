              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Warned 3 times</span></strong> <br>ST breaking news 11.39am 4 Mar</p>
              <p>NANYANG Technological University student David Hartanto Widjaja was warned not once, but three times, that he had to buck up or lose his scholarship.</p>
              <p>In the past year, the 21-year-old NTU engineering student received three warning letters, copies of which were sent to his parents in Jakarta, The New Paper reported on Wednesday. But Widjaja's grades did not improve.</p>
              <p>Two weeks ago, his scholarship was terminated. On Monday, Widjaja, and Indonesian, stabbed Associate Professor Chan Kap Luk, 45, in the back in his office during a discussion on the student's final year project , then slit his own wrists before fleeing and falling four floors to his death.</p>
              <p>An NTU spokesman told TNP: 'Widjaja's Asean scholarship was terminated at the beginning of this year as his grades had fallen below a Grade Point Average (GPA) of 3.5. The school had asked him to seek help for his studies when we noticed that his grades were dropping, but he didn't.'</p>
              <p>The spokesman added: 'NTU had also advised him on the various loans offered to him should he have any financial difficulties in his school fees.'</p>
              <p>The scholarship's criteria is apparently not at all stringent, and there is no penalty for termination of the study award, said TNP.</p>
              <p>Four of NTU's Asean scholars said the scholarship terms were reasonable and they didn't face major difficulties in achieving the required grade - a GPA of at least 3.5 for each semester, an equivalent of a B grade.</p>
              <p>Was it the stress of the final year project that led to Widjaja's tragic death then?</p>
              <p>Many final-year students didn't think it should have caused such a dramatic reaction.</p>
              <p>A group of Electrical and Electronic Engineering students told TNP that the stress of possibly wasting three years of hard work because of a poorly done FYP was very real.</p>
              <p>Said Wayne Lim, 26: 'Your FYP grades will eventually affect your overall results. IT's easy for your grades to slip, but harder for them to go up again.'</p>

              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">NTU prof discharged </span></strong></p>
              <p>The professor who was stabbed by a student at the Nanyang
              Technological University on Monday was discharged from hospital at
              around 9.45 am today.</p>
              <p>Associate Professor Chan Kap Luk sustained injuries to his back and
              hand and had been warded at the National University Hospital.</p>
              <p>Prof Chan was attacked in his office by his student, 21-year-old David Hartanto Widjaja.</p>
              <p>The undergraduate was said to have slit his wrist thereafter and leapt off a building in the engineering faculty.</p>
              <p>He died from his injuries.</p>
              <p>His body was cremated yesterday.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile his parents and elder brother who had arrived in Singapore
              on Monday night to help identify the body, are expected to head back to
              Jarkarta today.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I am one of David Hartanto's close friend and I am here to give you<br>some facts, assumptions, possibilities about this case<br><br><br><strong>Facts:<br></strong><br>1. Lok Tat Seng: Dean of Student of NTU gathered all Indonesian students in<br>International Student Center on evening after incident and he just said there was <br>witness on the spot who saw David's body lying on the ground, dead. <br><br>Dean did not said that witness saw David jumped from balcony.<br>And that is, according to him, all he has saw.<br><br>2. The only official statement from police is: David was found dead at<br>the crime scene, they did not mention whether he commited suicide.<br><br>The link: <a href="http://&lt;font%20color=%22royalblue%22&gt;no%20more%20pdf%20liao&lt;/font&gt;"><span style="color: #4169e1;">No more PDF liao</span></a><br><br><strong>They also just mention 'The professor was believed to be stabbed'. <br>The police did not say that 'the professor was stabbed'. </strong><br>Where this assumption come from? <br>Why they did not say about it?<br><br>3. I and some Indonesian students gather tonight, 3 March 2009, at 8 pm,<br>at International Student Center and talked to David's parent.<br>They have seen his body. <strong>There was NO WOUND whatsoever on his wrists<br>and police also has confirmed it.</strong><br>I assumed that his parent would not lie it means that all media news about<br>'David slashed his wrist' was FAKE.<br><br>4. The wounds found on David's body, according to his parents,<br>were on his head (It is assumed due to fall injury),<br>and slash wound on his neck. The wound on his neck is very suspicious, in<br>my opinion. How he received that wound?? <br><br>Again, according to his parent, police guessed that it may be happened <br>when the bottom part of his head smashed the ground. <br>In that case, his chin will have broken and it did not.<br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">My question is: WHERE DOES THAT SLASH WOUND ON HIS NECK CAME FROM?</span></strong><br><br><br><br><br><strong>Assumptions:</strong><br>1. David stabbed professor. How did you know? The crime scene is closed room,<br>only David and that professor. No one see what has happened.<br>Eye-witness only saw David run out from that room.<br><br>2. David commited suicide. How could someone who commited suicide drop himself <br>into glassed roof, instead of directly drop himself to ground.<br><br>3. David slashed his wrist. I do not know where this news came from...<br><br>4. David's motivation.<br><br>4.1. He pissed off since his prof did not give satisfactory grade<br><br>The grade has not been released and he even has not submitted the report.<br>It is also NTu policy not to inform the student about the grade which they got<br>before release of the result.<br><br><strong>4.2. He has mental problem</strong><br><br>No record in Student Counselling Centre about his attendance. For bright student<br>as him, I did not believe that he did not attend counseling if he has some<br>problems. Also, he still brought bag with usual daily stuff, on incident day,<br>such as drink bottle, towel, etc. If David planned to kill someone why would<br>he prepare to bring such things. It is easier for him to just bring one knife<br>and stab his prof on spot.<br><br><strong>4.3. He pissed off because his scholarship has been revoked</strong><br><br>I knew David since I was his roommate for 2 consecutive<br>years during Mathematical Olympiad training camp. He almost did not<br>qualify for IMO, only managed to get at 14th rank from 15 people selected.<br>He still joked and laughed to me at that time. He also did not get anything<br>from IMO and still fine, not seemed depressed whatsoever, and according to his parents, <br>he said 'At least, I managed to represent Indonesia at IMO'<br>He also still play Hammerfall game in Facebook at 2 am on the incident day. <br><br>My friend saw his Facebook account online. How come<br>a murderer played game in the night before incident? If I was him,<br>I will seriously think how would I prepare myself tomorrow<br><br><br><br><strong>Possibilities:</strong><br>1. Professor attacked David. I deduced this thing for several key points.<br>According to many reports, David's cloth was soaked on blood. If the blood is<br>the result from slashing his wrist, it should not soak his cloth since wrist is<br>far from body. If the wound is from neck, it is easier.<br><br>2. David tried to run from Professor. After he realized that he was attacked,<br>he resisted and run from that room, with wound on his neck.<br><br>3. David falled because of unconsciousness. He became panic and probably lose his common sense <br>because of terrible bleeding, drop himself down into glassed roof to escape from his Professor.<br><br>I am responsible for what I have written here, and contact me at <a href="mailto:kaminari.no.me@gmail.com"><span style="color: #9a0a0a;">kaminari.no.me@gmail.com</span></a><br>if you need any clarification. <br></p></div>

              <p>This as quoted from comments in the ST online forum.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are indeed a few dubious points. FYP so difficult meh? I heard below average students also can pass. GPA of 3.5 is not difficult at all, what's more he's a whiz kid. Even if he lost the scholarship, does it warrant a killing?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe some people are simply mentally unsound and you cant predict the shit he's gonna do. But then again, I look at all the related reports in ST, it seems eerily like they're trying to paint him as a desperado who's got the wrong person.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm not saying there is a cover up of sorts but I do smell a rat.</p>

              <p>I am one of David Hartanto's close friend and I am here to give you<br>some facts, assumptions, possibilities about this case<br><br><br><strong>Facts:<br></strong><br>1. Lok Tat Seng: Dean of Student of NTU gathered all Indonesian students in<br>International Student Center on evening after incident and he just said there was<br>witness on the spot who saw David's body lying on the ground, dead.<br><br>Dean did not said that witness saw David jumped from balcony.<br>And that is, according to him, all he has saw.<br><br>2. The only official statement from police is: David was found dead at<br>the crime scene, they did not mention whether he commited suicide.<br><br>The link: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://&amp;lt;font%20color=&amp;quot;royalblue&amp;quot;&amp;gt;no%20more%20pdf%20liao&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;"><span style="color: #4169e1;">No more PDF liao</span></a><br><br><strong>They also just mention 'The professor was believed to be stabbed'.<br>The police did not say that 'the professor was stabbed'.</strong><br>Where this assumption come from?<br>Why they did not say about it?<br><br>3. I and some Indonesian students gather tonight, 3 March 2009, at 8 pm,<br>at International Student Center and talked to David's parent.<br>They have seen his body. <strong>There was NO WOUND whatsoever on his wrists<br>and police also has confirmed it.</strong><br>I assumed that his parent would not lie it means that all media news about<br>'David slashed his wrist' was FAKE.<br><br>4. The wounds found on David's body, according to his parents,<br>were on his head (It is assumed due to fall injury),<br>and slash wound on his neck. The wound on his neck is very suspicious, in<br>my opinion. How he received that wound??<br><br>Again, according to his parent, police guessed that it may be happened<br>when the bottom part of his head smashed the ground.<br>In that case, his chin will have broken and it did not.<br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">My question is: WHERE DOES THAT SLASH WOUND ON HIS NECK CAME FROM?</span></strong><br><br><br><br><br><strong>Assumptions:</strong><br>1. David stabbed professor. How did you know? The crime scene is closed room,<br>only David and that professor. No one see what has happened.<br>Eye-witness only saw David run out from that room.<br><br>2. David commited suicide. How could someone who commited suicide drop himself<br>into glassed roof, instead of directly drop himself to ground.<br><br>3. David slashed his wrist. I do not know where this news came from...<br><br>4. David's motivation.<br><br>4.1. He pissed off since his prof did not give satisfactory grade<br><br>The grade has not been released and he even has not submitted the report.<br>It is also NTu policy not to inform the student about the grade which they got<br>before release of the result.<br><br><strong>4.2. He has mental problem</strong><br><br>No record in Student Counselling Centre about his attendance. For bright student<br>as him, I did not believe that he did not attend counseling if he has some<br>problems. Also, he still brought bag with usual daily stuff, on incident day,<br>such as drink bottle, towel, etc. If David planned to kill someone why would<br>he prepare to bring such things. It is easier for him to just bring one knife<br>and stab his prof on spot.<br><br><strong>4.3. He pissed off because his scholarship has been revoked</strong><br><br>I knew David since I was his roommate for 2 consecutive<br>years during Mathematical Olympiad training camp. He almost did not<br>qualify for IMO, only managed to get at 14th rank from 15 people selected.<br>He still joked and laughed to me at that time. He also did not get anything<br>from IMO and still fine, not seemed depressed whatsoever, and according to his parents,<br>he said 'At least, I managed to represent Indonesia at IMO'<br>He also still play Hammerfall game in Facebook at 2 am on the incident day.<br><br>My friend saw his Facebook account online. How come<br>a murderer played game in the night before incident? If I was him,<br>I will seriously think how would I prepare myself tomorrow<br><br><br><br><strong>Possibilities:</strong><br>1. Professor attacked David. I deduced this thing for several key points.<br>According to many reports, David's cloth was soaked on blood. If the blood is<br>the result from slashing his wrist, it should not soak his cloth since wrist is<br>far from body. If the wound is from neck, it is easier.<br><br>2. David tried to run from Professor. After he realized that he was attacked,<br>he resisted and run from that room, with wound on his neck.<br><br>3. David falled because of unconsciousness. He became panic and probably lose his common sense<br>because of terrible bleeding, drop himself down into glassed roof to escape from his Professor.<br><br>I am responsible for what I have written here, and contact me at <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:kaminari.no.me@gmail.com"><span style="color: #9a0a0a;">kaminari.no.me@gmail.com</span></a><br>if you need any clarification.</p>

              <p><br><em><span style="color: #333333;">I agree the statement that Rock^Star had mention is most probably true since the main focus was the final year project he was working on.To understand what has happen we need to know does the final year project got to dowith goverment involvement in it if it does it make perfect sense to do a cover up onthis incident through the media since his project i believe was a multi - intelligent video surveillience system which he was working on i stumble this info when i was browsing the web</span></em></p>
