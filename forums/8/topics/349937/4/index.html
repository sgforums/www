              <p>I think the deceased student has some personal problems, and had difficulty with his FYP. Cuz the news article says so, that there were some difficulty in his FYP. Also, judging from the time now, the FYP thesis is just going to be written (1st draft), thus what probably has transpired is that the supervisor told him bluntly that his FYP is not good enough and that he needs to retain another semester, meaning that he cannot graduate with the rest of the cohort.</p>
              <p>Seeing that the supervisor holds so many positions, it is very possible that he did not have time to supervise or mentor the student or to help or guide the student much. Since "high-ranking" Professors, normally will be very busy meeting people from overseas and going overseas for conference etc. Some unhappy conversations could have been exchanged.</p>
              <p>The fact that the student has a knife (not sure if its a stationery), means that the assault could be premediated/preplanned. Meaning that the unhappiness could have already been for some time, maybe around 1-2 months or more. The fact that the student wants/intends to stab the Professor, means that the Professor is somehow also partly responsible for this event to happen, else the student could have stab other people, not him.</p>
              <p>Having made the un-returnable decision, the student realised that he will not be able to get away from assaulting the Professor, and he will definitely be black listed now and almost assured of a sudden halt in his career, he feels that there is no way he can make it in life, and being also remorseful, slit his wrist and jumps.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you read the paragraphs, this is ultimately a case study of management issues.</p>

              <p>I think this incident will only raise awareness of the possibility of more campus stabbings to come in the future.</p>

              <p>Which lecturer or professor is going to walk around campus in peace? Students these days are not very sane, here or America. Such are societal standards and expectations in a first world nation.</p>

I didnt get his name that time but he looks a bit like this prof Chan guy, might be him. He "feel like failing me" cos he got jealous i can come up with 5 designs for a thermal suit and his whole life only got one. So let this be a warning to all professors, You Can Fail Us But We Can Stab You. LOL</p></div>
