            <div class='col-md body'>2 months ago. somebody from the net told me he could get me a laptop and handphone for a mere $800. greed over took over mind, i fell for it. He told me he needed it in cash and so i gave it to him. At that point in time he sounded sincere ( good acting perharps) Well He met me in two occassions, first time near my place second time in outram. Damn we even played Pool together.so when i handled him the money he seem to be very "busy" with his work. Actually he did give me a photocopy of his IC however due to CNY's clean up i accidentally discarded it away. I did want to make a police report but he always called me and told me he would be coming over to my place soon. and sometimes he would ask me to go over hise place n collect. i got his address and contact number too but everytime i was prepared to go down, he would call me in the last minute told me he cannot make it. I went to sim lim to wait for him too but he played me out. made me wait for bloody 2 hours plus. and he always calls me. does anyone have anyway to help me or advice to give me? I would like to get my cash back but i doubt it's highly possible but i do not want anybody else to get conned so I really need the help of the more experienced ones.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would say that this might not be a real con case until you check it out.<br>You might want to confront him at his place first before making any decisions. If it's an invalid address or someone else is staying there, then it will still not be too late to call the police.<br><br>Rather than you calling the police now and find out it's a misunderstading after all.<br>Since the guy gave u his IC details as well as contacts, it might really be just a misunderstanding.<br><br>Remember this, for now and in the future,<br>Look before you leap.<br><br>Good luck.<br><br>------------------<br>What is in a name?
