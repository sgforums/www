            <div class='col-md body'>So many asking the girls to expose the bugger but the girl keep quiet and this condone the sick actions of the real perverts. Then the girl call men = pervert. Which is not fair cause there are lots of guys where who are decent and nice chaps. Look, I had expose a pervert, look up sggirls <a href="http://sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=117098" rel="nofollow">http://sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=117098</a> And really if people wanna think I am mean b!tch, then its their problem but I feel at least I give fair warning to people about this moron.<br><br>This is real drama hor and I relate this to people. In another site, there was a bunch of girls who were harassed by perverts. All kept quiet and the pervert used this to his advantage. He went to one after another girl and the girls all thought thay suffered alone. Had they only spoke up, no one would blame them and ther pervert would be talking to the police and sent back to where they came from.<br><br>In a dating site NTU once setup (closed down now), there was this guy who kept pestering all the girls that he's a grad of some brit uni, he lived in Bukit Timah and etc. Then one of my friedns agreed to a luch appointment, at the last minute, he changed to a very late night supper. I do not know if she's come to harm cause she would not say but I know she's so shaken she would never date again. (my guess is that she might have been raped! but too ashame to tell me.) I was the only one who contacted the admin for the NTU dating site and told them about this guy. Then the NTU folks came back and said yes, this guy has been hitting on several girls after they checked with them BUT no one reported about him. So he got away doing so much harm to the women! I was THE only one who bothered to take action. Thus, the NTU admin was so sadden by these activities, he closed down the site. Had some of the girls came forward, he would have been nabbed earilier.<br><br>So let me say this, if you want to rid of pests, you do not sit down and watch it, like watching ESPN. You participate and take action, call for action and make the bugger understand his behaviour is not tolerated in our site or our society.<br><br></div>
