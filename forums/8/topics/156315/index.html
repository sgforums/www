            <div class='col-md body'>Look, if you really want to lose weight go run. Running is a highly effective way to lose weigth and running the treadmill in the gym is the most effective method to lose weigth. Nothing is more effective than this:<br><br>http://www.musclemedia.com/training/hiit.asp<br><br>You will lose weight too if you do weight-lifting in the gym, but you will need to REALLY do weight lifting if you want to see significant weight lost. If you are scared to run, I doubt you will have the ability to do enough weigths to see the effects.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are generally two types of exercises<br><br>Aerobic / Isotonic - A high energy consumption exercise, running, jogging, swimming, football, basketball, badminton, tennis, threadmills, double strollers... you get what I mean.... (Running for 30 minutes churns out the most calories in all the different types of exercise, about 1000+ kcal)<br><br>Anaerobic / Isometric - A type of exercise to tone up muscles or build up muscles such as weightlifting (there are various types of machines nowadays, I don't really remember the names of it), the small dumb-bell lifting...<br><br>So if you wanna lose weight in gym, look out more for aerobic exercises, if you wanna tone muscles (and hence gain weight - and mind you muscle weighs more than fat) go for anaerobic...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i would like to add that some of the forumites have given excellent excellent advise that hit the nail on the head.<br><br>i would like to add too that some of the forumites have given 1 liners that really make you go "........", thank you for making sgforums, a truly singaporean forum *hint hint*<br><br>--<br><br>anyway, what I would like to add on is that you can work out indoors, depending on your weight, height and body fat percentage, there can be a few workout regimes.<br><br>1st) CARDIO: This is the most important if you're looking to burn fat, if you're obese, do not even start on weights, keep running. run for 20mins, at around 65% of your heart rate, most gyms have treadmills that can help you take your heart rate. Running is the best because it will give you a total body work out. However, i would strongly advise you take glucosamine if you're like me, running everyday can take a huge toll on all your joints and cartilage. Bike riding and cross trainers don't work you out half as effectively as running does. Do not run fast for 10mins, you use up your immediate energy supply, what you want is for the body to dig into its fat reserves, so 20mins, at a good speed. an indication of this is that you can talk while running, but not sing a song.<br><br>2) WEIGHTS: If you're marginally overweight, it would be better for you to increase your metabolism, and muscle mass first WITH CARDIO - there is no way you can skip your cardio and burn fat. Doing an array of resistance training can help you in your goals. Afterall, if you lose weight and become bones you wouldn't look half as good as you do being all toned and lean. Besides the superFACIAL aspect of it, if you were to start on weights first then cardio, you can be guaranteed to be burning alot more of your fat reserves if you follow my advice in (1) because with weights, you would have used up your immediate energy reserve first.<br><br>3) TIP: There is no better time to do cardio then in the morning.<br>4) TIP: To get that same morning effect, do weights first, unless you're obese than follow (3)<br>5) TIP: You have to stick with your regime, don't be self conscious like everyone in the gym is looking at you, it's alright to run slow for 20-30mins, the gym is a very supportive place, ppl are all here for a common reason.<br>6) TIP: For the body to burn fat, you have to lower your calorie intake, and up your calorie burning. which means, eat less work more, no pain no gain.<br>7) TIP: PM me if you need somemore help, I'd be glad to give advice<br><br>Warmest Regards &amp; Best of Luck,<br>SupaFatty<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>one more thing, it is important to have that mental aspect of weight loss there.<br><br>Weight management is a lifelong objective.<br><br>Set goals, e.g. if you're 100kg now, set a goal for 95kg with a reward of a McDonalds meal.<br><br>This will help keep you motivated, and also, take your weight everyday, it will keep you motivated to see you didn't gain weight, and even better if you lose weight. look in the mirror, be proud of what you see because you've earned it.<br><br>I would like to add that someone mentioned not to eat certain things, while it is agreeable, it doesn't mean it's contraband. Have it once in a while, e.g. char kway teow, once a week is FINE. F I N E. make sure you exercise though, walking 5 blocks can help expand that little bit more.</div>
