            <div class='col-md body'>True,quite true,they sure to raise prices as games have a short shelf life,so they raise prices and there is no competition to lower prices and if they don't take the opportunity,once after a year or 2,their games will not sell,so companies will raise the price when the game is just out to capitalise on it,heehehe<br><br>------------------<br>It's take a second to look at my makan,a minute to finish my burger and a lifetime to enjoy all the food i want <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">~~~<br>Diablo 2 rockzzzzzz <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
