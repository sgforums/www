THey are selling at about US$45 for most games. This converts to about S$78 here. When I check the price out of similar games back at home, the prices were like close to S$90. Another point to note is that they have sale items for originals while we dun have it here.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, pirated games are good in the sense that at least you get to test the game at a cheaper rate. If it's worth the money for the original, I am sure those who like the game will still go and purchase the original copy.<br><br>When piracy wasn't so abundant a few years back, it was hard to decide which game to buy. Considering the fact you actually spend 50 bucks or more and if the game turns out to be a poor one, you will feel that your money could be spend in a better way.<br><br><strong><br>I was wondering....why are games and software cheaper outside of Singapore, out of SE Asia, like the States...<br><br>In the states, piracy is almost non existent, why arent the prices, like u said, jacked up?<br><br></strong><br><br>Piracy is abundant in the States and Northern America. CD burners are easily available to them and are cheap. They do need to buy from 'pirates', in fact they normally just ask their friends to burn the cds for them.<br>It still cost around 39.90 USD in America for an average game.<br>In Austrialia, it cost around 50+ Austrialian dollars for an average game.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know why PS and Dreamcast games are more expensive in Singapore than US as if you use the piracy is rampant,prices are high to cover the loss of income theory,PC games are more available pirated than PS and Dreamcast game and yet Dreamcast and PS gamers are more expensive than PC as according to the theory,PC games should be the more expensive as Dreamcast and PS games are not so easily available as pirated PC games,hheehe.So i think the prices are high becos piracy is rampant theory doesn'y hold water at all,hehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>It's take a second to look at my makan,a minute to finish my burger and a lifetime to enjoy all the food i want <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">~~~<br>Diablo 2 rockzzzzzz <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
