              <p><br>As what you mentioned, you have already got the answer. You actually have many relatives that you have from other races and countries. It is up to your interest and free time to explore all their cultures.</p>
              <p>Those who do not really care about it usually just agree/identify with what's assigned to him/her (eg. reflected in NRIC). It was for the sake of simplicity these identities were assigned in the NRIC as previously people felt that the Austronesian-Muslimspeakingsubfamily big family of people (Javanese, Malays, Bugis, Minangkabau, Acehnese, Boyanese) should be able to identify with each other much easier than say Indians/Chinese, though deviations still exist. Even within Malay-speaking communities in Malaysia, Kedah and Kelantan Malay is far from understandable to the Johor Malays who rather find communication with neighbouring Riau people easier.</p>
              <p>Ethnic classifications / Racial classifications at the end of the day, are all classified by humans, thus will be error-prone.</p>
              <p>Serbs performed ethnic cleansing on the Bosnians, whom belonged to a "different ethnic group". Linguist and anthropological experts will be quick to point out that they are one people, based on linguistic evidence. The differences emerged only late in their history when the one people embraced two different religions and developed two different set of cultures that look vastly different outwardly and thus the self-identification of different "ethnic groups".</p>
              <p>Same for the Austronesian family, no one in the right mind will consider the Filipinos in the same ethnic group with the Malays, even though they both are Austronesian speaking. Only the linguist and the anthropologist (and maybe some sort of fundamentalist) will see them as one.</p>
