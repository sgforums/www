Animal welfare groups protest the move<br><br>By Grace Chua<br><br>EXPECT to see fewer stray cats, if any, roaming the neighbourhood.<br><br>The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority has confirmed what animal lovers have suspected for the past week: that a campaign to cull stray cats is being mounted island-wide in the wake of Sars.<br><br>'We regret that the Government has decided upon such extreme measures and are disappointed that animal welfare organisations were not informed nor consulted... We appeal to them to reconsider their decisions.' - Dr Lynn Yeo, president of Cat Welfare Society<br>But the AVA spokesman stressed that the culling had nothing to do with any fear that cats were transmitting the Sars virus. There is no evidence of this, he said.<br><br>Rather, it is part of the 'Singapore's OK' programme to clean up the surroundings and improve public hygiene.<br><br>When town council contractors move in to clean food centres and markets, pest controllers would round up the strays and have them brought to the AVA to be put down.<br><br>There are about 80,000 stray cats in Singapore.<br><br>Yesterday, 30 cats were culled. The day before, the number put down was 25.<br><br>The AVA expects the number to increase.<br><br>'Food establishments should not have any animals, including cats, for public health reasons,' said the spokesman.<br><br>Town council managers contacted maintained that they were rounding up strays in response to public complaints about stray cats being a nuisance.<br><br>Cats dirty the areas with their excrement. People also tend to leave food out in the open for them, they said.<br><br>One pleased Pasir Ris resident, Harleen Kaur, 18, said: 'I'm scared of cats, so I'm glad they're going to round up strays.<br><br>'It'll be a relief not to have stray cats around getting in my way and spreading diseases.'<br><br>But the culling campaign is making animal protection groups like the Cat Welfare Society, Action for Singapore Dogs and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals see red.<br><br>At a joint press conference, they pointed out that the culling campaign contradicted the AVA's own Stray Cat Rehabilitation Scheme, a sterilisation programme started in 1998, which the groups had devoted time, money and energy to help carry out.<br><br>The Cat Welfare Society, for example, had spent $60,000 so far, money from donors and animal lovers, to sterilise about 5,000 cats.<br><br>The groups argued that sterilisation was a more humane and effective method of controlling the stray population. Left unsterilised, cats which escaped the dragnet would breed even more quickly as they would have more food and space to do so.<br><br>Madam Foo Wei Fong, 36, a shop assistant who is a Cat Welfare Society volunteer, said she had brought a stray to the AVA for sterilisation on Wednesday and was turned away.<br><br>'We are all very puzzled and scared. I have had sleepless nights because I heard they were going to cull all the cats,' she said.<br><br>The AVA confirmed that the sterilisation programme has been put on hold - as it contradicts the current public hygiene programme of removing cats from the streets altogether.<br><br>The animal lovers are not giving up.<br><br>Said the Cat Welfare Society's president, Dr Lynn Yeo: 'We regret that the Government has decided upon such extreme measures and are disappointed that animal welfare organisations were not informed nor consulted over such a drastic action that involves the lives of thousands of stray animals in Singapore.<br><br>'We appeal to them to reconsider their decision.'</strong><br></blockquote>[/b]<br></div>

Then news came that animals are a big probable carrier of the virus.<br><br>In  the face of such news, he  says that we have no choice but to clean up the environment  a t  all costs. Because we cannot take any chances. We  cant  quarantine  animals. We cant make them tak e temperatures everyday, so to  protect our well beings, extreme measures are being taken.<br><br>So pple, relax, i think we have to adjust out thinkings a bit. I love animals too but the fact is that we do not know what  80000 stray cats might carry and in a normal situation, nothing would be don e but in the face of  SARs, we just cant take any chances.</div></blockquote>But I find that this measure is too rash.Without cats, the rats in singapore will not have any natural predators.They will just breed and populate and spread all kinds of wierd diseases.At least cats could be tagged individually and tracked down, unlike rats.<br>This method is far too drastic.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm... i would think its a good idea to take out the strays.. after all. who was the one who put them there? irresponsible owners. anyway i think there are more than 8000 cats in singapore. the gov has to prevent the cats from overpopulating, besides the cats don't just feed on rats, but ppl who just drop food on the floor for them, this will prevent the cats from hunting for food. so either way its a lose lose situation. and oso cats can carry some unknown desease that may not have infected us... yet. but dun forget sars come from the civet cat, so lets not forget that.</div>
