The price range depends on the type of material used, as the previous poster stated. If you are going for tailor-made and have a higher budget, it is better to have one made of 100% wool. There are many different grades of wool, actually (Super 100s, 120s, 200s, etc; the higher, the better/softer), so you can select one based on your preferences or budget.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi!<br><br>Try Peninsula Shopping Centre - there are many tailors there and so prices are more competitive.  I've made over 6 suits from there already, but that was years ago.<br><br>Its hard to estimate the prices because it depends on what you want (material, what pattern, buttons, etc.).  Typically, costs $300 for the low end (summer lounge suit)....to over $1000 (or higher) for the high end (expensive tuxedo).<br><br>Typically, it takes 1-2 weeks to make a proper suit, so be suspicious if anyone offers you suits faster than that.<br><br>Ready-made suits are a great idea, but I prefer to custom-make my suits because they fit betterm (colour, shoulders, torso, bagginess of trousers, length of jacket, etc).  It may sound petty and unimportant now, but there may come a time when you wished your suit fits better.<br><br>By the way, try to make eat set = 2 pants + 1 jacket.  Usually, due to the careless way we use our suits, our pants will wear out faster (and the colour will change faster than the jacket).  So you need an extra pair or trousers, just in case the first pair's colour wears off.<br><br>Hope this helps!!</div>

If you wear it to the office, go for tailor-made.<br><br>WJTW</div></blockquote>Pretty much spot-on, but there's just a few points to be made here.<br><br>First, 100% wool tends to last longer than other materials.  As for the grade of wool, the "Super" numbers refer to how fine the wool has been spun - as a general rule, the higher the number, the less likely it is to crease.<br><br>Never, never EVER go for polyester - it's plain tacky.<br><br>If you're lucky to be of the right size and shape to fit an off-the-rack suit, go for it.  A size 92R fits me perfectly, and for day-to-day wear, I have a number of suits - they're all 100% wool, and cost between $350 and $500.  Currently I have no justification to go as far as getting a Brioni, although a Boss suit might be reasonable.  I'd see things in the opposite way from WJTW in this respect.  If you're using a suit for the office, go for off-the-rack because nobody really cares.  On the other hand, get a really good suit for special occasions.<br><br>On the other hand, I've just decided to try out a tailor-made suit to see how much improvement it offers.  I got a single-b reasted two-button suit made of Super 150 for $420 from York Tailors at Peninsula.  Be advised that getting a tailor-made suit may not be a straightforward process - I've just had a full fitting, and I have to make a third trip back because the tailor has to make some adjustments to make sure it sits perfectly.  From what I've seen so far, I really do like it.  That said, it'll probably end up being a daily-wear suit.<br><br>A couple of points about suit wearing:<br>- if you're heavily built, don't bother with single-b reasted suits; a good double-br easted suit will look a lot better<br>- if you do go with a single-b reasted suit, anything more than two buttons screams "I sell handphones and pork bellies"<br>- if you're starting out with buying suits, navy blue is the easiest colour to start with<br>- for God's sake, make sure the tie that goes with the suit is 100% silk, and if you do have to get a printed tie (instead of a woven one), it has to be of the Hermes helical pattern; anything else just says "I don't normally wear ties and this is making me really uncomfortable "<br>- match the suit with a proper pair of leather-soled shoes, and make sure the soles aren't so thick they look like combat boots<br>- the colour of the socks match the pants, NOT the shoes<br>- a pocket square goes a long way to spiffy up a suit, and braces don't hurt either<br>- if you're going to wear braces, make sure you don't wear braces with belt loops, or even worse, a belt - either remove the loops, or be content with the belt<br>- don't keep too much stuff in any pocket - it ruins the shape of the suit<br>- make sure you set the suit out to air the moment you take it off<br><br>On a side note, I can't believe the profanity filter objects to the word "b reast" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

If you've got wider shoulders, I'd recommend something like D'Urban within that price range.  I'd just as soon leave Armani alone - their designs can look very dated very quickly.<br><br>Going up a bit, Brioni's a good choice, although you'd probably have to shell out some more for a pile of Sulka shirts to go with them.  As for Zegna, the way they stitch their lapels always leaves them looking somewhat incomplete.</div>
