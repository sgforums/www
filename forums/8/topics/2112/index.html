It is very common that the figures and timing varies by  a certain %. But what helps them solve the case is often by the integrity of their statements (ie whether they are talking about the same thing or not).<br>Imagine 2 statements made, "I saw that robber getting into a crowded bus at 10 am" versus "I saw the thief getting into a not so crowded bus at 10 something".<br>The main facts are very visible.<br>1) There is a criminal (robber or thief).<br>2) The person is getting away in a vehicle.<br>3) It is in the morning.<br>And all these info are good enough to tell a message!!!<br>In the context of the Bible, it is not really important that whether it is 2000 or 3000 bath. You just need to know that these are a part of a building and they are big!!!<br>For King David, the point is he disobeyed the Lord and counted his men!!! Numbers in this case is quite redundant.<br>Hope this helps.<br><br>As for the drink that was offered up to the Lord Jesus, I have to dig my research materials. I am quite confuse over this one also. But hey, it is good to check out the Bible!!! I will get back on these.<br><br>Are you a christian? If Y, then keep up your search on the Lord's word. It is good to be sure of your faith. If N, you want to know Jesus? He loves you you know?<br><br></div>

I am just expressing my view as you are.<br><br>Your premise that contradictions only occurs amongst figures and numbers is once again mistaken. The Old Testament specially, is peppered with factual errors regarding, for example, the reigns, and also ages, of various kings. Although the errors are numerical in nature, it is inescapable that they are also event-related.<br><br>One telling example of an event-related discrepancy is found in the New Testament. The area which has generated the most discussion concerns the angels who were present at the tomb of Jesus. The gospels according to Mark and Matthew relate that there was only one angel in the tomb, while Luke and John insist that there were two angels.<br><br>The apologist's explanation for this seeming contradiction is interesting, but I shall leave it out because I'd like to know if your explanation for this tallies with the one I have.<br><br>As for doctrinal differences. You insist that there are none, but this is not the case. There are doctrinal differences between the various denominations. For example, one denomination's (won't mention names for fear of libel) clergy is allowed to marry, whilst another denomination's clergy is not allowed to marry. How does one reconcile the doctrinal disparity? Should we return to the Bible and see what it says?<br><br>"It is good for a man not to marry." (NIV, 1 Corinthians 7:1)<br><br>Furthermore, there are doctrines which the Church no longer practices, either because it's considered outmoded, or too cumbersome. One of this is the covering of Christian women's head and hair during prayer.<br><br>"And every woman who prays or prophecises with her head uncovered dishonors her head." (NIV, 1 Corinthians 14:12)<br><br>Brings new meaning to the 'todung' (not sure if I spelt it correctly) controvosy in Singapore, doesn't it?<br><br>The question begs to be answered. What is the difference if the errors are numerical or event-related in nature? Isn't an error still an error? The issue is that errors and contradictions exist in the Bible, a scripture that most, if not all, Christians regard as infallible and inerrant. With the knowledge that such trivail errors can occur in the Bible, how confident are we that all the teachings in the Bible are rooted in truth? Or does Christianity call for a psychological double-bind? In which, as a Christian, I am supposed to acknowledge that "numbers and figures" errors do occur, but that there are absolutely no mistakes in the Bible with regards to doctrines and dogmas.<br><br>If such is the case, shouldn't there be only one unified Bible, instead of the many versions that we find today? Shouldn't there be only one Church, instead of one that is splintered by denominations?<br><br>[This message has been edited by yidd (edited 11 February 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess these contradictions are the reasons why bible study is not recognized as a subject compulsory in our educational system.
