            <div class='col-md body'>Well... for me its usually a deep sharing when we feel something's wrong. And before we start, i'll ask myself: Do i still love her? Do i want to make this work? If i don't then there's no point rite?<br>Talking works cos u find out wat u've been doing wrong or NOT doing... and if u've the heart to do so, u can change things and stop being lazy lor... I usually find that the fault lie wif me... and my work haha...
