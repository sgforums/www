            <div class='col-md body'>ok, people, firewire is back from his outing and activities today to tell u what happened. Unfortunately, my friend borrowed my digital camera for a project so I can't provide pics for anyone.<br><br>I waited at the cafe, but in the end it was just me, 1 other guy, 1 girl , and 1 butch.  Noone from this board showed up.  I wasn't dissappointed though because I was asking at a really bad time and already knew it....it was just a friendly invite....:-)  Hope u people can make it next time.<br><br>What happened?  we went to Mandarin hotel and stayed there for a while talking and stuff like that.  Nothing much really.  just hanging out.  They play some nice instrumentals there if anyone wants to try out.<br><br>After that, at about 9:30 pm, we decided to go to LAVA LOUNGE since it was so close to us.  I was mildly surprised because I expected to pay cover charge.  I guess their business isn't so good anymore so they don't charge.<br><br>There weren't many people there at first, but the girls there were just busting my mind!!!Beautiful...and everywhere!!!  As the night progressed, it got really crowded and did I mention the girls?  Beautiful!!!!<br><br>Yahoo!!!<br><br>We were standing in the pool table area, but to my astonishment and dismay, it was the hang out of all the local models.  Charmaine Han was there and a few other really pretty girls.  Now, here I was standing there confidently scouring the pool area for nice chicks to look at(which wasn't difficult), and thinking that the few guys there couldn't be their boyfriends so i could fantasize away.  Boy, was I red-faced because a bunch of really tall, lean, and chisel featured guys walked in and gave all the girls kisses.......duhhh.<br><br>I spent most of the night sipping slowly from my drink and admiring the good looks of these guys more than I was admiring the girls.  I swear, I've never seen asian guys who looked so good before.  I'm not gay, it's just that I was wishing I looked like them.<br><br>Man, at the end of the night, I took my 1.72meter-ed height and bashfully exited the disco/pub hoping that a  nice looking girl would look at me.  Not a chance!.<br><br>Believe me, whether u are confident or not, being in the presence of so many good looking people will put a crink in your style, whatever your style may be....:-)<br><br>I came home and started designing my website again and went to sleep around 11:00am this morning only to be woken up by people who I thought had nothing better to do than to wake up too early and call both my handphone and home fone at the same time.(different people calling).  Now, i got a migraine the size of my balls, which isn't very big, but u get the idea.  and reading these posts are terror on my eyes, so i might not be up so early tonight.<br><br>Anyway, the day wasn't so bad.   I just hope that some of u people will not be so busy next time.<br><br>Ok, people, until then, ...<br><br>keep the peace and do whatever it is u do on Saturday nights....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well firewire, if you really care to arrange an outing, make the announcement more formal...because it's the first outing and people would be naturally wary and uncomfortable... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Also, it is better to meet in a very public place first before adjourning anywhere, so that cursory introductions can be made in due time. It is also important to let everyone identify everyone else and be comfortable.<br><br>I personally hope that the people from this forum will turn out to be "good" people. By this I mean that they are nice and have good hearts, not in the sense that they are guai or clean or anything. I just hope to make friends and learn more about life thru them.<br><br>P.S -- Firewire...if we really meet up, you'll be the second non-virgin guy I ever spoke to in my actual life (no kidding !).....Haha no offense just a comment - in fact I probably got a lot to ask you ! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>See you all soon and please TAKE CARE !</div>
