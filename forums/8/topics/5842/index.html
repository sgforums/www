But they tend to be pricier. I bought Nadesico from them and regretted ever since.<br><br>I loved "Lain" - it is simply the most philosophical piece of shit ever to come out, with proper respect to "Evangelion" and "Akira". "Ghosts in the Shell" was actually better in the manga form. The OST was fantastic. Esp, the Cyberia Mix version.<br><br>Check out Shirow if you can find it in SG. Dat's the artist, duh. Meanwhile, "Spriggan" and "Wolf Brigade" were both excellent but simply do not pack the emotional and philosophical baggage that Mother "Akira" provides.<br><br>Hahaha, I could go on... *slap*<br><br>Go to sleep!<br><br>cheers.<br><br>------------------<br>Cindy Crawford,<br>ON COURAGE...<br>"They were doing a full back shot of me in a swimsuit and I thought, Oh my God, I have to be so brave.

            <div class='col-md body'>Juzhappy,<br><br>It's "Princess Mononoke". Which version do you want it in? There's a undubbed but subbed with chinese, dubbed in english (ming-na wen as lead), and there's a cantonese version somewhere. Unfortunately, the US version (scripted by Neil Gaiman) is not released in SG yet - but since it's distributed by Harvey Keital (boss of Miramax) you can expect it to be screened in the cinemas.<br><br>You can get it at any "major" shop as this is quite popular. Off hand, I'd say DaDa at Funan but I never liked the "Boss Wife" there, so I dun support their business!  :p<br><br>cheers.<br><br>------------------<br>This guy walks into a bar with a duck on his head.<br>The bartender, who's seen just about everything says, "what can I get you?"<br><br>To which the duck replies "you can start by getting this guy off my ass."</div>
