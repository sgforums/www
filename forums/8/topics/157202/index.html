            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys, thanks everyone concern =) i had already bring my pet dog to vet on mon. It was a heavy heart going there, as our mind keep shifting that my dog wont survive much longer. And actually the vet did say something...like putting down...if we think he suffer a lot. Becos he is tooo skinny and is kind of wierd. My sis was so sad, n she did cry..well i did not, i try and control.... then we told the vet to do blood test on him. and c how is the result...if it is bad....i think is his time... while waiting for the result, our heart get more heavy down.=( <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> as the vet also scare it may be cancer..as tiny is very bone.<br><br>BUT  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> the test result.. IS a gd one, expect the blood ..is..low i think..n sugar level...low.. i not sure as i dont understand its too chim to explain to u all, but is all abt the blood n sugar. and others things its normal. BUT the vet did say, if she did not c the dog but the result she will say hey it is normal ...but if c the dog.. she just dont understand what happen...is unbeliver.<br><br>And now we hospital our pet, so that he can put on drip.. for the food to go in. and today the vet actually call us , and say he is actually responding to the food...as they try to force feed him...although he stuggle a bit..*<br>which he dos everytime... * but when feeding him he acutally respond it.. WE R VERY HAPPPPPPPPYYY TO HEAR THAT very very happy.<br><br>actually as part of a owner of tiny, when he first come to our hse...*we have 2 dogs inculding him* i did not really care abt him, as my sec sister brought it in...my sec sister has no paitent dealing with abused dog, and she is a piss in the family. AT first my thought is dont do anything becos if she brought the dog back she must have the responsible to take care of it... but she did not,..* my sis i think a bit mad* long story abt her.<br><br>i feel regret for not taking over to tiny in short period...but luckiy my elder sis cant stand her...so she take over tiny.<br><br>I have to tell everyone, if you wan to let human begin to learn something..and take responsibily... or other stuff, DO NOT INVOLVE PETS! As pets is very poor thing. i learn from my experience. pets is just that innocent who just can talk and make u realli understand them.<br><br>I hope tiny can live a few more yrs, and i will try everything to make him happy....or at least leave peacefully.<br><br>PLS DO NOT ABUSED PETS!<br><br>[/img]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Can I give some suggestion?<br><br>For later, I think u can try improving his health by giving him soaked dog food mixed with a bit of shredded meat. Give him good brand like Innova. And soak it for 15-30 mins so he won't need to chew so hard. The added shredded meat, or liver, is optional. If he doesn't have any appetite, the aroma from the meat can help make him start eating. After a few times u can gradually reduce the meat altogether. Or if not, u can get a half-wet or wet dog food, usually in cans. They have much better aroma than the dry ones and ur dog should like them better.<br><br>It's not so good to give ur dog table food coz it's hard to give balanced nutrition and/ or it's hard to always supply something he will always eat.<br><br>I have a very choosy dog who was very skinny and he ate very little. Gradually I found out how to solve this. By the method above. Now his weight is normal and in fact slightly above average. Also I found out he won't like to chew hard dog food.<br><br>Asides from food, u should pet him and touch him many times. And if possible don't confine him for long.<br><br>Finally bring him out for walks. A beach will be perfect. You can go in the afternoon when the sun is not so hot and walk with the dog there. Don't make him too tired (you can see from the breathing). When it's enough, go home and give him dinner. He will have much better appetite because he just did sports. And plus it's a leisure/ entertainment activity as well.<br><br>With the vet's help, plus regular eating, lotsa love and petting, and beach walks followed by meals, Im sure ur dog will see an improvement of health and happiness. Don't forget the vet too, in case he has any conditions/ illness.</div>
