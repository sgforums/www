As a result, people who have fluoridated water supplies may receive less than amounts of fluoride that fluoride proponents recommend if they choose bottled water over tap water.</strong></blockquote>Aiyoh...juz drink the water they give you lorz...The compound of Fluorine is found naturally also what...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like anything in excess fluoridation of water is dangerous only in excess. The current levels of fluoride in our water supply is well within the recommendated dosage of fluoride even after exposure to additional sources of fluoride like from your toothpaste.<br><br>Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (US) strongly supports water fluoridation:<br><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/waterfluoridation/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/waterfluoridation/index.htm</a><br><br>The controversy over fluoridation came from the vague link a study provided some years back linking fluoridation to osteosarcoma. This link has since been disproved in recent epidemiological studies.<br><br>Results of these studies and proper references done by the Australian government at <a href="http://www.health.vic.gov.au/environment/downloads/fluor_osteos.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.health.vic.gov.au/environment/downloads/fluor_osteos.pdf</a><br><br>I know most panic mongers will dismiss this as a propaganda campaign but below is a link to the organisations that strongly stand by water fluoridation.<a href="http://www.fluorideinfo.org/fluoride_whoSupports.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fluorideinfo.org/fluoride_whoSupports.html</a><br><br>Do some research on your own. If it was so dangerous, why would it take such a long time and a genius from the forums to warn the public? Is it possible that the thousands of scientists and doctors in Singapore have been paid off just to let the government poison us? Give me a break.</div>
