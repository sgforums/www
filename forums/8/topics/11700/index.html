            <div class='col-md body'>I've been to korea before, Yes i've came across of a couple of attractive girls but i would say, they are not as attractive as what you have mentioned. To me they all looked quite the same, thick make-up, dyed hair,double eyelids that looks like fann wong's(singaporeans should know what i mean).<br><br>Not an insult to them but i believe girls in every country have their own charm, we should say which country has the most beautys. Its just like you can't compare a caucasian with a asian. we are just different.<br><br>Let them come to singapore and lets see if they can maintain their nice complexion.<br><br>------------------<br>The  greatest regrets in our lives are the risks we did not take. If you<br>think  something will make you happy, go for it. Remember that we pass this way only  once.<br>Bottomline :<br>Time don't wait. If you think you might have found the  right one, treasure him/her. Don't let he/she go away. Don't let fear hold you  back.<br>Give it a try else you might regret later... No one other than  yourself<br>knows what can truly make you  happy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with RP leh.  Singapore girls got their unique kind of charm.  But must have substance otherwise when they grow old... die liao.  No looks and cannot talk to them.  Bummer!</div>
