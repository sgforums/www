            <div class='col-md body'>The Electric New Paper :<br>M'sian who applies for driver's licence told he died in 2002<br>MR Minggu Mang Madang is alive.<br>12 July 2006<br><br>MR Minggu Mang Madang is alive.<br><br>And he is having a hard time trying to prove it.<br><br>According to Malaysian police and hospital records, Mr Minggu Mang, a worker of the Samling Timber Industry Company in Sarawak, suffered serious head injuries in unknown circumstances and died on the way to Nyalau Hospital in Bintulu on 18 Jan 2002.<br><br>DEATH CERTIFICATE<br><br>There is even a death certificate, signed by Dr Faizal Ghazali of the hospital.<br><br>But yesterday, a very much alive Mr Minggu Mang appealed for help at a news conference to publicise his case.<br><br>He said: 'Please help me to convince the authorities concerned that I am not dead. I am very much alive. The going has been very tough, very stressful since I was officially certified dead by the Nyalau Hospital in Bintulu four years ago.'<br><br>Mr Minggu Mang, now 40 and a former contractor, said he found out he had been certified dead when he went to the Road Transport Department to renew his two-year driving licence on 19 Dec 2003.<br><br>Then began his nearly three-year-long fight to get back his life.<br><br>The Road Transport Department officer told him that all his records had been erased and he was advised to clarify his status with the National Registration Office.<br><br>As he no longer exists officially, he has not been able to work and has been depending on the generosity of his in-laws, relatives and friends.<br><br>Mr Minggu Mang, who is married with three children, has made police reports.<br><br>LIVING DEAD<br><br>He said: 'This is absolutely ridiculous. I have never worked for the Samling company.<br><br>'In fact, I was then a sub-contractor doing works worth about RM1 million on the Durin Bridge project (near Sibu) and later the new Sarikei General Hospital.<br><br>'I have bank statements to prove the income.<br><br>'There seems to be no clear indication when the investigations will end. I know the police are doing their best but I have a life to live.<br><br>'Now I am the living dead as I cannot work. I hope Bukit Aman and the Director-General of the National Registration Department can help. I just want my life status restored.'<br><br>WANTS EPF FROZEN<br>Mr Minggu Mang urged the authorities to investigate thoroughly all the people who had reported his death and determine who had actually died and been buried under his name.<br><br>In the meantime, he has asked the Employees Provident Fund to freeze his savings so that no one could claim to be his next of kin and withdraw the money.<br><br>He has also alerted his insurance companies. - Bernama. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
