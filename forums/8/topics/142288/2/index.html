Her source was outstanding.<br><br><strong>Durai</strong><br>Appears to be living in a world of his own. His only argument was that it was not a gold tap and that it was $990 and not $1,000. Had no clue about morality, integrity and fair play. Using the suffering of the unfortunate to feather his nest and that of his family. Had no clue that giving his wife a car whose expenses were paid by donors is inherently wrong and evil.<br><br><strong>NKF Board</strong><br>Failed as a governing body in fulfilling its mission. Mislead the public by making false and misleading statements on more than one occasion.<br><br><strong>Patron (Mrs GCT)</strong><br>Obviously had no clue what the organisation was doing at all.<br><br><strong>Davinder Singh - Lead Defence Council</strong><br>Outstanding litigator who was given a god sent opportunity to display a masterful stoke of offensive litigation while in the defendent's camp. Took the plaintiff down the garden path and made him clean up the leaves, trim the roses and bag the refuse voluntarily.<br><br><strong>Tan Lee Meng - Judge</strong><br>Screwed the !^@# out of NKF for throwing in a fresh claim for damages at the start of the trial and awarding cost.

Smart enough to pick Susan Long who has yet to write a single friendly piece on the Lee regime despite her long tenure and highly credentialled background.<br><br><strong>Mr Tan - the sub-contactor and source</strong><br>May you live a long and healthy life. Instead of taking the money for the job, your scream at Kim Keat that fateful day in 1994 took 11 long years but it did more than bunch of imbeciles in Parliament to correct a wrong.<br><br><strong>Singaporeans and Forummers</strong><br>It was heartwarming to know that the vast majority knew the difference between right and wrong. More importantly it was about transparency, accountability and looking after the patients. It was indeed outsanding in support and the views expressed.<br><br><strong>NKF</strong><br>Despite huge reserves that could take them for 30 years without raising a single cent based on current operating financials, you continued to mislead the public. You had only 2,000 patients but gave the impression that there were thousands more.<br><br>It was also sad to learn that 78% of the patients cost was paid by the patient himself with only 22 actually coming from NKF. It must be the biggest single ripoff that I ever seen.

I think they knew right from the start what they were doing and what the public would think, but didn't bother to come clean or do anything about it. Certainly they would know that after doing so much to convince people to part with their money, getting people to do dangerous stuff and exposing them to public ridicule, in the end it turns out they were trying to manipulate public opinion?
