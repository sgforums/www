              <p>Some people are worthless trash who only know how to throw names around to show how 'cool' or 'powerful' they are. For example, they will say "Hey I know XXX, we are good friends what!" but in reality, XXX do not even know of the so-called good friend's pathetic existence (I went to ask XXX about it).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So yeah, time to wake up. Power by association is just temporary and you never know the person you are bragging to may be a blood relative or a good friend of the influential person you pretend to know.</p>

              <p><br>In chess, if you only know "how to use a few chess pieces effectively and focused/depended on those few chess pieces to play a major role in the gameplan of the chess game", an opponent simply needs to sacrifice some pieces to remove those 'major' pieces of yours, and you will be left handicapped. You have to know every single piece well.</p>
              <p>Similarly, in life, depending on a few influential people whom you are closed to is only a short term, short sighted strategy; your 'opponents' in life will simply remove your support from you.</p>
