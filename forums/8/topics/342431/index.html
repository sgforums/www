              <p>Many times we have heard people around us mentioning about how powerful and influential they are, just because they know certain people in their lives and certain CEO of the CEOs of the world.</p>
              <p>So how does people around us actually displayed how powerful they are?</p>
              <p>Is it by knowing the AMOUNT of people who are influential?</p>
              <p>OR</p>
              <p>Is it by knowing the influential people themselves?</p>
              <p>For example, in a game of chess....does having multiple pieces on the chessboard makes you the winner of the game OR does knowing your pieces well will makes you as the winner of the game?</p>
              <p>It's just a wake-up call for self-"powerful" but vulnerable people out there. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>This is not nitpicking. If you want to use a bad analogy for your topic, you jolly well take responsibility for the bad analogy.</p>
              <p>Since you want to act intellectual, I give you a chance. Please tell me <br>1) how pointing out the bad analogy by parn isn't to the topic since the analogy is being used as a supporting point? <br>2) why is it that the main analogy, being used as a point of support, is a trivial detail, and only a small and unimportant part?<br>3) how this post of yours is related to this topic at all?</p>
              <p>Give a bad analogy in a paper and you will be penalised like mad. And you are telling me that this is trivial????</p>

              <p>Not on anyone's side, but despite you all saying this and that
              about parn, the fact remains you guys seem to be fascinated with
              his posts, and regardless of the barrage of insults and criticism
              you all hurl at him, you all still come back for more. Shows how
              much you're secretly fascinated with him, huh.</p>

              <p>Some people are worthless trash who only know how to throw names around to show how 'cool' or 'powerful' they are. For example, they will say "Hey I know XXX, we are good friends what!" but in reality, XXX do not even know of the so-called good friend's pathetic existence (I went to ask XXX about it).</p>
