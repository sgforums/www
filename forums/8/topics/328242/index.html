              <p>Nope... that's not what I meant by scanning the call.  I am talking about letting the answering machine take the call.  I don't think the person makes the prank calls is going to leave a message, is he?  He will get sick of it after a while.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, if the call is legitimate, the caller can easily leave a message.  We can usually hear the caller's voice when they leave a message so if it's someone you know, you can always pick up the call.</p>

              Bring to court..You have to pay money to employ your own lawyer to sue that person..and what do you think will happen? will he/she go to jail for making prank calls?
              
              Definetly not! He/she will at most apologise to you and you need to spend a few thousand dollars to sue him/her and you get an apology only!
              
              Is it worth it?

              <p>My mom dont really mix with the outside world and I'm sure there isnt any rivalry against her. However, for months, there's this person who have been calling my house every other morning after my dad left house. After my mom were to pick up the phone, that person will just remain silent and hang up. Frustrated, my family decided to change our house number and make it private as well as not releasing our number other than official matters like to the school. Suprisingly, the prank call-er still managed to get hold of our number and called without making any sound again. My mom dont think installing a caller id gonna help as the person might be using an unknown number and most of my relatives are in malaysia, when they need to contact my mom, number calling to singapore from malaysia will remain as private or unknown. Any solutions?</p>
