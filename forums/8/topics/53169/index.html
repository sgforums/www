C. Vijayan<br><br>NEW economy video pirates are resorting to parallel imports to get fake discs of movies and TV shows past the censors, and retailing them at market prices, well before their official release date.<br><br>PIRATED VCD/DVD<br><br>Despite repeated attempts to rid Singapore of video piracy, unlicensed copies of top movies are still hitting the streets -- some even before the shows are screened in the cinemas.<br><br>Click here to poll<br><br>For instance, industry detectives uncovered Lord Of The Rings - The Twin Towers in shops early this month, even though its worldwide video release date is Aug 26.<br><br>The fakes were imported directly from an overseas supplier and copies were submitted to the censors, then passed off as genuine products in legitimate retail shops.<br><br>The film's authorised distributors Alliance Entertainment took out a High Court order three weeks ago against three companies for copyright infringement.<br><br>Alliance chief executive Tan Poh Lam explained that the video pirates look to parallel importing to order their goods directly from suppliers overseas, who are not licensed to make copies.<br><br>'You can't bring in a fake Mercedes-Benz and pass it off here as the genuine product,' he said. 'But it's possible to get away with a fake disc.'<br><br>Hardest hit here are the Japanese dramas. According to a study done last year by the Anti-Video Piracy Association of Singapore, 90 per cent of the VCDs of these shows sold here are pirated.<br><br>It said there were 355 pirated Japanese drama titles on VCD on sale here then; a third of these were in packaging different from the original. It also said there were about 510 pirated Japanese animated DVD and VCD titles being offered.<br><br>These add up to a $1.7 million loss in revenue for the Government, besides hitting the bona fide owners, said the study.<br><br>Industry players want to clean up the situation, and yesterday, 19 companies, including major overseas players such as Fuji Television Networks, Nippon TV Network Corporation as well as local firms, came together to officially launch the association.<br><br>Lawyer Toh See Kiat, who was a former MP as well the anti-piracy group's president, remarked then: 'Singapore is fast becoming the headquarters for pirates of Japanese anime and serials.'<br><br>The group already has a five-year battle plan. This includes helping the public identify pirated products and working with the authorities to promote stricter controls.<br><br>Lauding the moves, Senior Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs Ho Peng Kee, who officiated at the launch, said the Government will strengthen the laws to include protecting copyright over a longer period and swifter access to damages arising from copyright infringements.<br><br>He noted that since the police formed the Intellectual Property Rights Branch three years ago, about $45 million worth of pirated items have been seized in more than 2,000 raids.<br></div>

What we see in the mkt around 2 yrs ago are those made in Taiwan. And it was supposedly that from the Japanese side, there is a crackdown and after which all these VCD are deem illegal.<br><br>From then on, the Singapore govt has banned the imports of such VCD. That is why you do not see any new titles now sold anywhere legally.<br><br>Well actually last time, i also quite like Japanese drama esp those comical in nature. Just can't stand those Korean weepy sad drama.<br>Btw anyone has this VCD title " Overtime ". Loved this the best but was not able to buy a copy last time. If anyone has it, i m willing to pay for it provided the price is reasonable</div></blockquote><span style="color: blue;">Yeah right. I think Japanese won't sell all the vcd/dvd products to all asian countries considered that their products will be pirated. So if u want to buy the original one should go to Japan lol and the price... beri expensive. Or can go to JB lol. They have almost all the Jap-doramas. But the quality.. not sure. But quite cheap. My fave J-dorama is "Ittazura Na Kiss". Very funny.<br><br>Why almost everyone (err.. maybe onli me) dislikes K-dramas and said that it's a sad one. maybe u guys only watch "Endless Love" and "Winter Sonata" which is quite sad and unhappy ending (I dun really fancy these either). but others are good. i love K-drama.  have u guys watch "Successful Story of A Bright Girl" starring Jang Nara ? and Hotelier. I think those are good.</span></div>
