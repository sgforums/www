Perhaps you need to sit down and think carefully...... are you suffering from stress, did you eat something that is causing your body discomfort?  I would suggest meditation about 20 to 30mins before sleep.  Meaning...... just sit on your bed when surrounding is quiet and just concentrate on deep breathing and don't think of anything else.  Maybe visualizing yourself to be somewhere nice or the sea or the sky...... anything to make yourself relax.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>If not, excercise in the evening (5-7pm) might also help you sleep better.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Basically, keep a healthy and active lifestyle, should be o.k.  Some people just don't need so much sleep.  Do you feel tired in the day but just can't sleep?  If you don't, then its o.k, you probably don't need so much sleep.
