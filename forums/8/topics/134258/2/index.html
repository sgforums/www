I remember even the Jap PM also respected Li Hongzhang. He said,' Lord Li was an extraordinary man, but it was a pity, he was born in a sunset country, but he himself was only an ordinary man, but was lucky to be born in a land of the rising sun, japan....<br><br>Anyway... abt Ci Xi...<br>Cannot really say she caused the downfall also... cos before she held power, china was already very weak. she was just trying to prolong china life..<br>she declared war becos the Ba Guo Lian Jun (8 united countries - consist of UK,  Italy, etc) keep asking favours from china... they wanted lands.. money..=<br>At the very last, they wanted to spread their religion christianty into china...<br>This made Cixi very furious... cos, in her mind, she was thinking that, the ang mo even want to change their culture! So, she declared war...<br>But, they sent the "Yi He Tuan" (Boxer)... how to win? Those ang mo used rifles... the chinese Yi He Tuan still use knifes and swords!!!<br>In the end, china lost miserably, even Ci Xi got to run away from capital to hide.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
