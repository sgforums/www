Well, you've added more with your reply.<br><br>My call for empathy is academic now since you have narrowed it down to Malays attending non-Malay weddings. Bringing along more people than invited without prior clearance is rude, under any circumstance.<br><br>In future. state your scenario clearly. Cheers.<blockquote>Originally posted by trendz:<br>Why are you so defensive? What empathy? Nobody asked useless, incompetent, inconsiderate and selfish parents to have so many kids when they have no means at all and even supporting themselves would be a major problem.<br><br>And in the first place, I wasn't even condemning them. Obviously, you <strong>DO NOT</strong> know how to read. And why are you so sensitive?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>The others replied with a neutral pov. But i guess it <strong>seems like</strong> it's true.<br><br>Labelling me shameless is pretty much uncalled for. Labelling an action which is unjustifiable and is simply too much IS shameless. Why?<br><br>Okay; let's not talk about the HDB cheapskate thing.<br>You see; imagine this scenario - Chinese A/ Indian A invited <strong>ONLY</strong> colleague Malay B to a posh restaurant located in a hotel. She brought along her family of 6; whacked the food and dropped only a $10 angpao. (In this case, the husband and kids are 'self-invites.')<br><br>Do you even think it's appropriate? Do you feel that it's too much? Doesn't she have any shame? Or... is it that 'value-for-money' mentality? As in.. I pay little; I want AND will get alot. Or..

            <div class='col-md body'>When I got married, my husband invited some of his colleagues who were not Singaporeans.<br><br>It was not in their culture to give monetary presents for the wedding. Instead, some of the gifts I received from them included a photo album, and a few of them gave us bibles (even though we are not christian)<br><br>If I look at the financial value of their gifts, it is below what was the so-called 'market price' for a chinese wedding. But so what? I don't think they have the 'free=loading" attitude as you call it. The gift was sincere, and that's enough.<br><br>I understand your unhappiness about people who 'free-load' At the same time, in the same wedding, I have relatives who were totally not close, who RSVPed at the last minute and came in ENTIRE families. Comparatively, I would say their 'angpows' were 'bigger' than the gifts if calculated PER person - but still I felt they were insincere (besides the point, they also created some OTHER problems) and I felt taken advantage of.<br><br>SO I think if you talk about people 'tekaning' you during your wedding, it has nothing to do with the amount INSIDE the angpow - but the PEOPLE involved.<br><br>And honestly, at the end of it all - It's ATTITUDE that matters. Not the money. And so people can  give u $100 angpow, and yes, u still feel like shit receiving that money cos they MAKE you feel like shit about it. I rather receive my $10 for an auntie who  bring her 6 kids and truly gimme her blessings, than those who totally give u shit and wave money in ur face.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>those people that invite fren/ relative to your wedding just for the money are Sibei shameless. Plz la even they dont give me a single cent, who give a damn coz i'll be more than happy that my friend or relative spare their time to attend my wedding dinner despite their busy schedule. Its a day to celebrate my wedding  not to be calculative to see which friend or relative of mine give the most/least money.  If a fren or relative of yours are poor, will they be barred from attending to your wedding dinner just because they cant afford to give you big ang pow?<br><br>And to threadstarter, not all Malays are like that. And there is nothing wrong for a family of six to give a mere $10 for ang pow even if it is held at posh restaurant/hotel. If i can afford to spend ten of thousands of dollars to celebrate my wedding at a hotel y should i be concern about a mere $10 anyway.<br><br>Talking about principle/ethicity, as u put it, isnt it unethical to literally force people to give you a big ang pow.<br><br>Just my two cent. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Yet they shamelessly bring their whole family of 4-6 to pig out on the available food?<br>If it's true; don't they know any shame? Don't they feel it's disgraceful? It's ridiculous and simply shows their lack of generosity, ethicity and principles somehow?<br>Whereas people of other races would give at least $100. And very 'paiseh' to eat the food.<br><br>Don't flame me yet; for I did not mention that it's true and justified.</div></blockquote>yea... i noe some malay families do that.. they wun give less than 20 bucks.. and they jolly well bring their whole family for a feast.. maybe that their culture. they tik that the more pple, the merrier..but for chinese, we are more concern bout face, so our hongbao will normally be "big"</div>
