Nobody asked useless, incompetent, inconsiderate and selfish parents to have so many kids when they have no means at all and even supporting themselves would be a major problem.<br><br>And in the first place, I wasn't even condemning them.

Why?<br><br>Okay; let's not talk about the HDB cheapskate thing.<br>You see; imagine this scenario - Chinese A/ Indian A invited <strong>ONLY</strong> colleague Malay B to a posh restaurant located in a hotel.

Do you feel that it's too much? Doesn't she have any shame? Or... is it that 'value-for-money' mentality? As in.. I pay little; I want AND will get alot. Or..
