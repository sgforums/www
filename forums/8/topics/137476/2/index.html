I dont exactly know who specifically did what? Is it right to blame every individual Japanese? Just because he/ she happen to be born as a Japanese and has nothing to do with the war?<br><br>I do hate SOME Japanese, but Im having problem placing the blame and grasping this 'collective' thingy.</div>

Americans killed many Indians, Germans killed many Jews, China also killed some of its own people..every country has their own faults in the past. Was there any need to dig this topic up again when you could have easily search for previous topics in the archives?<br><br>Well, since you brough it up..personally, after reading the book "Rape of Nanking" I was furious about the atrocities committed. I dont blame the Japanese people, but I blame the Japanese government. During the war, the japanese people are mostly ingnorant of what their government has committed. In addition to that this astrocities is limited to a few commanding officers and even the emperor did not know anything about it.</div>

Coz they truely showed deep remorse! Did they twist their history to their liking? No!<br><br>Many SG people dont <span style="font-style: italic;">hate</span> Japanese becoz they dont feel the effect of it. Either none of their family members suffered during the JP occupation or they dont empathize.<br><br>I myself dont <span style="font-style: italic;">hate</span> the Japanese, I juz want the JP Govt to face up to the truth and not twist the facts anymore. They've been lying for 60 years!<br><br>Many SG dont know about the JP putting lies in their history books, and now our garmen, representing the whole of SG, tells the JP that it is ok for them to continue to lie. Perhaps even agree to their lie. sheesh<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br></div>

For a start, the government officials must stop honouring Tojo's remains.</div>

Many died from radiation exposure. However, if the Japanese Army did not insist on fighting till the last drop of blood, or if WW2 had not spread to Asia-Pacific, the atom bombs would not have been deployed. In any case, the Americans' use of such weapons had the Russians on the edge of their seats in years to come.</div>
