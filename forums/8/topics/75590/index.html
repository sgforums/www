            <div class='col-md body'>People ,<br><br>I had a playstation 2 set modified with messiah 2 pro chip. Now I can't start the games at all as it showed loading... in the browser menu (Where you see the saving files in the memory card) so I went to one of the well-known game shops (which i can't wish to say) and checked. They told me is the mod chip problem but then the next day , they called me again &amp; said this time is the len problem so i can't figure out what's really wrong with my set.They said they will charge me $170 for the new len because my len is faulty. If i take my set back without repair , they will charge me $40 for service charge. Any experts can figure what's really wrong with my set ? Should i change the len there since they are giving me one week warranty ? please help... Thanks  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

Then did the shop charge u for the service charge since u figure out wat's wrong with the set by yourself. Now i think is not worth it to take back my set since i have to pay extra money for their service. My set is U/C 30001 series...<br>which means is quite old version <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

WHen I was younger and have problems with my Super famicon, I also send it to repair. They say the whole set is burnt and need $200++ to repair. Then I say I had no money and just want the set back.
