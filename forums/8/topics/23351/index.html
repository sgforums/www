            <div class='col-md body'>or how about this:<br><br>I got a friend taking 'O' level last year. He was attached to one of the girl in his same class. When the O level result came out, he failed his maths, and A2 - B4 for other subjects. He was unable to enter JC or poly, But his gerfren went to JC. She dumped him, who was currently studying in ITE. They have been together for 2 years.</div>
