            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, this list isn't as good as the first, but I'm totally shacked right now...and I'm totally shrivelled...so no imagination...<br><br>To Solaar, this list isn't meant for u to try as it's pretty demeaning to a woman...but then again, my first list was pertty dmn demeaning also...<br><br>1. try using a swing(like the playground kind)...:-)  U sit on the seat and swing back and forth while she's sitting stradling u (facing away or at u)...But kind of dangerous...what if a family comes by and the kids see...then they go home and try to play swing also...hee hee:-)<br><br>2. My friend suggested once that i try it with her ass hanging out the window while ur pummeling her from the front...:-)  I tried, but it's quite impossible...either that or I'm just too damn short(my member...oh god...I just noticed we're members also!!!)...I would prefer to think that it's impossible...hee hee...for obvious reasons:-)<br><br>3. or u could do a vertical 69...u stand up and she hangs from ur arms by her legs while she blows u and your eating the cake out of her...Then when U blow cumshots, her head very difficult to move back because of the position so all ur come would most likely shoot right down her throat and gag her ...a lot...:-)  very cruel...!!!!<br><br>4. Or u could try fisting her..'nuff said...:-)  For those who don't know what it means...obviously it must mean a lot of pain...:-)<br><br>5. Or really the ultimate....u could borrow ur neigboors dog(the big one), and tie her up while u spray whipp cream all over her puss area...tehn u let the dog loose and it will lick her cunt until she creams the dogs tongue...:-)<br><br>6. Alternately, u could tie her into a dogie position and get the neigboors dog to mount her and see if she enjoys...:-)<br><br>(this list is pretty violents yeah?)<br><br>Ok, when i have time tomorrow, I will come back and post better ones...But let me ask my classmates what they think first...:-)<br><br>[This message has been edited by firewire (edited 27-11-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, firewire's carnal suggestions are beginning to scare me. Anyway, sexual psychosis aside, I'll just summarise my suggestion (too much detail is boring, and i'll just leave it to your (&amp; her)imagination ok?)So yeah, I'm suggesting a little theatre here: Striptease, followed by a solo and then you can join in the lil play at the end as the icing on the cake. Props can range from sexy sultry ligerie to food products, there is no script, no time limit, so have fun. Who knows, if she has fun too, she might BEG you to let her do it again...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>As for Cosmo, yeah its a great mag, very readalbe, much better than playboy, which i think serves the purpose of eye candy (think centrespread). Anyway, good luck and have fuN! :] then you can share with the rest of the neanderthals here what works and what doesn't...<br><br>PS the mag also suggested doing it in the pool, app water heightens sensations, don't ask me how, but make sure you two don't drown or something stupid like that. It won't look too good on your tombstone, "Here lies Solaar, who learnt the hard way that sex and swimming were never ment to happen simultaneously"</div>
