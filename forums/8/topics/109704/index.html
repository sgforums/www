            <div class='col-md body'>Well basically you need to wear t-shirt and shorts/bermude there. You will be called to a station(in a small room) where a doctor will ask you to take off your underwear and short(with your shirt on), after that cover your mouth and cough a few times, den if your bro moves, tts means you are okay(still not sure why to do so)[the doctor basically wun touch you unless he have problem lah].<br><br>Then another station, you need to take off <strong>ONLY</strong> your shirt for them to check your heart. Other than that, you need nt take off anything le.<br><br>The IQ test, I also anyhow do de, so is okay.</div>
