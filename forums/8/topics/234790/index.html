            <div class='col-md body'>again.<br><br>isnt she hot  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><img src="http://img152.imageshack.us/img152/2242/73137111pf2.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.hindustantimes.com/wfsf/high/2007/01.29/images/high1914714.jpg"><br><br>SHILPA: MY STORY<br>NO TRICKS, NO COVER UP..WE SHOW STAR EVERYTHING FOR THE FIRST TIME.<br>By Julie Mccaffrey And Fiona Cummins<br><br>SHOCKED Shilpa Shetty yesterday saw the full footage of her ordeal at the hands of racist bullies Jade, Jo and Danielle for the first time - and gasped: "I'd no idea it was so bad."<br><br>As the 31-year-old Bollywood beauty watched the three bullies spitting out cruel taunts and foul-mouthed insults behind her back, she said: "I didn't know all that had gone on. They are so mean. Why didn't someone stop them? It hurts me deeply. Look at me . . . I am shaking."<br><br>Smiling Shilpa had still been on a high from her Celebrity Big Brother triumph as she sat down to watch the videos yesterday.<br><br>But as the film begins, her smile is replaced first by a look of bewilderment - then openmouthed horror and disgust.<br><br>She winces as ringleader Jade Goody, who yesterday booked into London's Priory clinic suffering from depression, spews out a stream of four-letter abuse during the now infamous bust-up over who used the house's Oxo cubes.<br><br>And as she watches the row escalate from a squabble about food to a ferocious personal assault, Shilpa squirms in her chair - pulling her knees to her chest and wrapping her arms around herself in a comforting gesture.<br><br>Shilpa says: "Watching this now, I can understand why people complained so much. It isn't just one or two attacks - it's incessant. I still can't figure out what I did wrong."<br><br>On the screen, Jade is now completely out of control - screaming that Shilpa is a "f*****g w****r and a p****.<br><br>As the insults flow, Shilpa gasps: "Oh my God!". When Jade yells that the Indian actress is a "f*****g liar and a fake," Shilpa closes her eyes and slowly shakes her head.<br><br>She says: "Why is there so much hate about an Oxo cube? This is so petty, so juvenile, so nasty. There is hatred there and that hurts deeply. Only now, this is sinking in.<br><br>"I am someone who has never been judgmental, but Jade's behaviour is obnoxious, very aggressive, nasty and suffocating.<br><br>"You can see in my body language how much it has hurt me. I'm sorry my family and their families had to see this.<br><br>"My mum said she was worried I was going to be attacked - and now I can see why."<br><br>BUT there is worse to come as a clearly distressed Shilpa suddenly realises that ex-S Club singer Jo O'Meara and disgraced Miss Great Britain Danielle Lloyd are actually enjoying Jade's vile outburst.<br><br>On screen, Shilpa has retreated to a bedroom to be comforted by Jermaine. But Danielle, 23, and Jo, 27, are openly s******ing.<br><br>Danielle says: "That was f******g fantastic. That made my day."<br><br>A disbelieving Shilpa raises her hands to her ears as if to block out the gloating. She asks: "Why are they laughing? Why did no one step in to help? What had I done that was so wrong?"<br><br>And when Danielle sneers: "She can't even speak English properly," an angry Shilpa points at the screen and says: "I speak ten languages and I think my English is fantastic."<br><br>Shilpa adds: "Can you believe this is the epitome of womanhood? I can't believe women will act like that. It's totally alien to me."<br><br>But there is one more horrible shock still to come - as Danielle spits out: "I wish she would f*** off home." There is silence in the room as the appallingly racist remark hangs in the air.<br><br>Shilpa slumps back in her chair. She bites her lip as she struggles for a full minute to hold back the tears.<br><br>After a supreme effort, she recovers her composure and says in careful, measured tones: "I really don't know why I was singled out for such hatred.<br><br>"Jade has had a tough upbringing but because she made her name on Big Brother she was perhaps jealous that I was diverting some of the attention away from her.<br><br>"I can see that Jade tried to intimidate me, tried to bully me, but I wouldn't succumb. Maybe that's why I annoyed her so much.<br><br>"I can see that she was playing up to the cameras and Jo and Danielle are egging her on. "Jo is perhaps driven by jealousy because she has self-esteem issues. Danielle, well, she is just young and more stupid than racist.<br><br>"I'm not excusing what they did. Not for a minute. I can see why people felt they had to stick up for me and am grateful for that. And I am proud that Asian people, Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims have come together."<br><br>WHAT those girls did was wrong but I would not like to say they are racist. I forgive them because I must. We are all human beings, we all make mistakes. I make plenty of them. What is said is in the past and I don't want to dwell on it because it is too horrid.<br><br>"But when I see the conflict played back, I must say I think did pretty well. I didn't demean myself by using horrible language like the others - there is no need to in the country that brought us William Shakespeare.<br><br>"I kept my dignity. But please, I don't want to see those tapes ever again."<br><br>Shilpa was shown only a few snippets of the bullying as she was interviewed by show host Davina McCall after her triumph on Sunday night. But she was not told that the racist bullying had infuriated millions of viewers and caused uproar back home in India.<br><br>She had no idea that effigies of Channel 4 bosses had been burned in the street - or that the row had even overshadowed Chancellor Gordon Brown's visit to India.<br><br>Shilpa was also amazed to hear that Jade's career is in freefall over the racism row - with shops refusing to stock her perfume and publishers scrapping plans for a paperback version of her autobiography.<br><br>Jade was said to be sobbing uncontrollably yesterday as she was checked into the Priory by boyfriend Jack Tweed.<br><br>The 25-year-old mum-of-two has scrapped plans to travel to India next week to publicly apologise for her treatment of Shilpa.<br><br>Jade's spokeswoman confirmed she was being treated for stress and depression. She added: "Jade is receiving treatment because she hasn't been sleeping or eating properly.<br><br>"She saw a doctor and he advised that she needed further treatment."<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dMOhNlUAXY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dMOhNlUAXY</a></div>

People have been telling you to stop spamming Bollywood and making your people look bad for over a year already. I don't see you stop posting. Even after being told off by other Bollywood fans.
