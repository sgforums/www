Does it mean u view the relationship causally consider that u viewed urself as attached even before the first date?<br><br>If u ask me as a outsider I will say u r loose and u project urself loose. No wonder the guy will do funny things to u. And I tell u one thing ur so call relationship is just merely creating other ppl attention. In a real relationship, the other side will not do things to hurt their partner. U could use other approach to tell him nicely and he could have stop. Instead, u go ahead and call the police and he might land himself in hot soup bcos he grab a piece of ur flesh. U just cannot weight the balance in the suituation, and I think u should be the one who needs the growing up process. U sound like a small kid who whines bcos he/she cant get the sweet.<br><br>Lastly if u are not a clone i suggest u stop posting to clarify cos u will surely get flame  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>And if u r a clone, I wish ur cheesepie/ lang jiao will rot  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously la. Fuzzy pooky. You protect yourself but you are really a menace to guys lor. Im a girl I can understand, but your butt has no virginity. After all he did move his hand back. This kind of thing how u control. And also its not like you have a butt to die for la.<br><br>The man may have previous criminal records, but who doesn't especially in Singapore man? Its not for you to judge. He's probably trying to turn things around. You want to contribute destroying a fellas life, if that rocks your socks it rocks your socks. But always remember something called karma. One day you really accidentally touch someone somewhere they dont like to be touch, as in really accident, you wanna be charged si bo. Without talking properly. Give the fella a chance to explain also la. Dont embarass him like that. This kind of thing, if he gets a good lawyer, its 50-50 chance I'm telling you. As long as you arent the despicable kind who purposely cry in court and all that. Seems to me like youre more out to get him. Sigh. Good luck la.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>FuzzyPookie said:<br>When I met him, he holds my hand. Then as we walk around the shopping mall, he puts one of his hand around my waist. He <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">touch</span></strong> my a-double-s and faster move back to my waist.</blockquote><blockquote>FuzzyPookie says something different:<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> Don't try to judge me<br>What's wrong with you guys? You all dare to claim yourself as an adult who think wise? Let me get it right for you all, there is no such a "nice" bf which will attempt to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">grab</span></strong> your butt on the first day.</blockquote>So you used the word "touch" &amp; "grab".<br>There's a huge difference to it you know.<br>In the 1st quote, he " touch my a-double-s and faster move back to my waist." If his real intention was to feel your a$$, he would have let his hand stay there and feel your so called curves. He probably felt ashamed to have accidentally touched your a$$ and hence pulling his hand away quickly in embarassment.<br><br>In your 2nd quote, you told us that he grab your a$$.<br>Perhaps you should stop beating around the bush and stick to your original words.<br><br><blockquote>FuzzyPookie said:<br>Before he was able to explain it, I shouted "You filthy molester!". Everyone was looking at us. I took my cellphone and make a police call. He keeps on explaining that it was an accident and no intention. I don't buy his crap. </blockquote>As you say he keeps on explaining, i believe there was lots of apologizing for something which occured to him as accidental but to you on purpose. You do not care and go ahead by calling the boys in blue. It's extremely easy to classify you under the category of species who perform acts without thinking &amp; listening.<br><br><blockquote>FuzzyPookie said:<br>After 15 minutes, the police arrived at the scene. I told the police everything. The police asked him whether he did touch my a-double-s and he admit he did it unintentionally. The police took both of us to the police station. The police asked me whether I really want to make report. I said yes without a doubt. </blockquote>When the police asked him if he touched your a$$, he admits to it and it was unintentional. He told the truth to the boys in blue. From this point, he tells the truth, i am just wondering how you can match the character of a person who openly admits to the police that he touched your a$$ but it was unintentional with the words "filthy molester".<br>Imagine if he told the police that he didn't touch your a$$. Police will still take him down town and question because you're a female and it's in your favour in the laws of this country, but don't forget if someone denies the fact or didn't do anything and decides to fight the case using a good lawyer from a respectable law firm, there's a chance to win the case against douchebags like you FuzzyPookie.<br><br><blockquote>Fuzzypookie said:<br>This relationship gone extremely fast. Because he thought I'm good at studies, innocent look and humble doesn't mean I'm a fragile girl. </blockquote>So you telling us to not judge a book by it's cover?<br><br><blockquote>Too bad for him. I'm not sure want charges he going to get. He deserves it.</blockquote>You seem worried all of a sudden.<br>You seem to be asking out of concern?<br><br><blockquote>Fuzzypookie said:<br>Why would I made up the story? This is totally genuine. Believe or not is up to you all. I swear by the name of Leonidas!</blockquote>You been watching too much of 300 the movie?<br><br><blockquote>Fuzzypookie said:<br>May I know what charges he might face? </blockquote>Once again you are asking about your "molester"?<br><br><blockquote>Fuzzypookie said:<br>I just want him to get "tina" nia. That's all. Hopefully he won't go to jail and get 10 whips of cane and learn his lesson. I'm not that cruel after all. </blockquote>So you're finally worried at this point here huh?<br><br><blockquote>Fuzzypookie said:<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>Eh, do you know what charges he might get?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  </blockquote>Are you for real?<br><br><blockquote>Fuzzypookie said:<br>My a-s-s is not lousy. It's tight and nice fyi.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </blockquote>Good for you.<br><br><blockquote>Fuzzypookie said:<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> Shock! Shock! Shock!<br>They police gave me a call. Eventually this "nice" bf I knew have 2 criminal records! He also admitted that he have the intention to grab my butt.<br><br>He charged for selling pirated cd in 2004<br>Again, he charged for attempt to steal handphone goods in 2006<br><br>For your information, he's 20 this year. Wow, absolute shocking! 2 criminal records! So, the police is waiting for my confirmation to charge him. </blockquote>Looks like you're trying to derail this thread and thinking of us as the gullible lot.<br><br><blockquote>Fuzzypookie said:<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> Bottom line<br>Should I press charges to him? Should or shouldn't him get this lesson? </blockquote>You're a real damn good story maker. You have a natural God gifted talent.<br>You should actually be asking yourself when do you want to stop telling lies.<br><br>And after 6 months of knowing this guy, it happened to be your first date with this him and in minutes, you're calling the police. Incredible.<br>You're pretty good at conserving for such a period.<br><br>Oh by the way, apart from this thread, i'd like to know, after how many years does your black mark record be erased from the time you commit your offence?</div>

You all dare to claim yourself as an adult who think wise? Let me get it right for you all, there is no such a "nice" bf which will attempt to grab your butt on the first day. He can't even learn to respect the girl in the very first date. Such guys most probably filled with lots of fantasies. If you tolerate with such guys, you might hear rape cases coming soon. Grab the girl butt on the first day is already enough to know what pattern is this guy. Either they want to attach with you to fulfill their fantasy or probably sex. You guys said I'm over-reacted, then when incidents happen, you guys blamed how stupid is the teenager. Why didn't avoid the guy or report at the first place.
