You mentioned that you have grown attached to him and were out dating. You allowed him to hold your hands and even your waist while walking.  Maybe it was really an accident and afterall, he was your friend (how else could you have grown attached to him) you should have given him the benefit of a doubt before calling the police on him.  For goodness sake, it was not as if he actually forced himself on you, he was out on a date with you.  Perhaps you did not like his behaviour on your first date, but you have already embarrassed him in public and could have just simply break off whatever relationship you were starting with him, instead of giving him a police record that will be haunting him for years to come.<br><br>By the way, looking at your nick you are using, do you actually know the meaning of "pookie"?

He can't even learn to respect the girl in the very first date. Such guys most probably filled with lots of fantasies. If you tolerate with such guys, you might hear rape cases coming soon. Grab the girl butt on the first day is already enough to know what pattern is this guy. Either they want to attach with you to fulfill their fantasy or probably sex.

Granted, his groping you was pretty disgusting, especially on a first date, but calling the police really makes a mountain of a molehill. You should have just let him know how offended you were, dumped him and then left it at that. You also (if his criminal record counts for anything) have potentially made a vengeful enemy. Perhaps you need to drop the charges, unoffend him and move on. Take it as a charity case, you might not want a ruined life on your hands. Or you could just go ahead with it if you really want to, but it probably isn't worth your time and money.<br><br>Anyway, Pookie translates to Pussy.. So.. FuzzyPookie, Hairy Pussy? Not a very good nickname to write complaints about molestations under, haha you might want to change that.<br><br>Incidentally, I'm new here so very very curious-- why did she get banned?</div>
