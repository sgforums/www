              <p>When you guys were still schooling, is there any horrible experience with your teachers, that still left a scar today? Anything that has made you still want to curse them up till today. . .</p>

              <p>Last time my pe teacher. He wanted to show his authority, and wanted to make sure that we don't go against him, and know who is the boss. He made us crawl from one end of the parade square to the other side. Entire pe lesson crawl here and there. Like dog. So degrading. Though we're just pri sch kids, but still we got our pride lo. &gt;=[ </p>

              <p>My sec 4 A maths teacher ridiculed me all the time due to my poor results.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I never passed a single A maths test or exam.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She told me this "Why don't you skip school; just stay and home and continue building computers". She knows that I build as a side job.</p>
              <p><br>That was... A little insulting, kind of hinting that I'm a lost cause at the subject.</p>
              <p><br>Either way, I passed my O level A maths with a C6.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></p>
