              <p>There was one time during sec 4 O'Levels year, me and my friends
              felt stressed up about school and we decide to pontan (skip
              school)</p>
              <p>While we are on the way out of the school gate, my math teacher
              came in by her car and she saw us. She looked at us and shook her
              head. Our natural reaction was to run away.</p>
              <p>The next day, while having math class, she made the whole class
              stand because non of us were able to solve the math equation. She
              then said "Whoever managed to solve this problem can have a
              seat".</p>
              <p>I raised my hand up high to volunteer.</p>
              <p>Being a rebel in school, nobody was expecting me to solve the
              math and they thought i must be playing a prank on the teacher. But
              little did they know something... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I walked up to the board, grab the chalk, and solved the math. I
              went back to my table and sat down confidently because I knew the
              answer was already 100% correct.</p>
              <p>Little did they whole class knew we skipped school and went to a
              nearby Mcdonald outlet and practise our 10 years series and I
              happened to solve that very same math question! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Yes when I was teenager, I remember one time I kept laughing with my friend....then the teacher came over, he checked my shoolbag......thinking something may be the cause we were laughing....nothing was found....then he used the chalk to deface my face.......</p>
              <p>Actually thinking about it now, I realize how unprofessional he is.....a teacher and an adult should have never done that.</p>
              <p>I am a little bit angry just thinking about it.</p>

              <p>Once, there was this teacher when I was in sec 2. she scolded me for talking (Like everyone was talking too). I told her that my mouth have no lock and zip cannot close . she said all who agreed with my statement can go out of class with me. And 3/4 of class went out lol.</p>
              <p>she had to buy us a cake to apologise to us. the discipline master came also nv scold us cause too many people cannot punish.</p>
