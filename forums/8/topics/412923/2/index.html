              <p>Another experience is. That time I was P4. Then having PSLE exams. So there were teachers patrolling around during recess to make sure that optimal silence is observed. I swear I just whispered to my friend while walking to the tables to sit! </p>
              <p>This teacher marched up to both of us and accused us of talking very loudly. That we don't understand the importance of PSLE, and next time when our turn, people do the same we like it or not, yada yada. The ultimatum is she whack me on my arm, causing my plate of beehoon to fall to the floor!. My food drop all over the place, and the fishball and other cai kiam all roll around <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_frown.gif" alt="icon_frown.gif"> So pai seh. </p>
