How do you expect her to react?<br><br>I always walk past and ignore, but I've been yelled at by some ah bengs for being 'dao'. There's once this Indian fella kept following me, saying 'hello, hello'. I got so scared, I ran. Thankfully, he didn't follow.<br><br>One of my friend says she always feels very offended by wolf whistles. I just don't know what to make of them. Opinions anyone?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally I wouldn't whistle. I think its rude and pointless.<br><br>But, objectively speaking, being able to attract wolf whistles means that a person must be of some standard. But that is irrelevant.<br><br>I suppose you can take it in 2 ways. Accept it as a compliment, albeit there exists much more tactful and gracious methods. Or take it as a cowardly act by him (I'm assuming that its guys doing the wolf whistles.) Why cowardly? Because they dare not come up to talk to you, or they wouldn't have the balls to do it if you had an escort.<br><br>Which prompts me to ask: If you had been having whistles all along, then you didn't, would you suspect that you have grown unattractive? I've heard arguments from friends saying that ladies like the attention. Its a sort of paradox, a desire to be lusted after but not in a perverted way. Well, I don't know how to say what I'm trying to say. Whatever.<br><br>Anyway, being irritated is one thing. Being intimidated is another. Wolf whistles are harmless, I think.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 05 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dun think wolf whistles are only for pretty girls rite? I noticed that 14 year old ah lians with rather undeveloped bodies (but in really tight tops) get them too.<br><br>I just hate it when a bunch of ah bengs start heckling passerbys with wolf whistles and stupid comments. What do they want? How are the girls supposed to act? I thought ignoring them was pretty harmless, but an ah beng once shouted repeatedly at me for being 'dao'. I was scared off by his fierceness. I prefer not to have this kind of 'attention' anytime.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I feel that wolf whistles are totally rude and degrading! It really reflects very badly on those ppl. C'mon, if a girl is pretty, you can always go up and tell her about it. You may even get a new fren. Whistling just makes u look like a jerk and puts the girl off.<br>This reminds me of an incident when I was walking behind 2 girls wearing damn short skirts. Suddenly, some #@$@#% SOB from one of the buildings besides us let out a damn loud wolf whistle. The girls turned round and I was the only guy behind them! Man, they must have tot it was me. How I wished the earth would swallow me up there and then. So malu!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heres one of another perspective: Those ppl wanted to attract your attention. One of my beng frens told me before why he did that. He wanted to have some cheap thrills. Anyway wolf whistling is a rude and negative gesture. Be careful when u meet this kind of ppl. Some juz whistled only while some might persist like following you or tried start to talk to you. Best solution is to ignore them if they persist, go to some where crowded or go and find a police post. Heheh if they see u walking to a police post, i'm sure they will freak out hehehe. Who do they whistle at? Girls who catches their attention eg those wear dress very sexily or revealing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Erm....As far as i know, There're serveral meanings to a whistle,<br>1)is "OIE!" (calling friends as so)<br>2)is "CHIO A!" (erm...u know what i mean)<br>...etc<br>But all for one motive, to get ppl's attention~<br>I can't say it's rude...they're just trying to get your attention~ not scolding or jeering at u.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Actually, I'm not suppose to judge whether it's rude or not, cos i'm not a ger~ and i don't know how a ger would react to a whistle.But the ah bengs are really rude @ calling ppl "dao" or whatever.<br>Keep it to yourself, or you're asking for a fight~ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Purr: I agree with what you say. Thats why usually there are so many good discussions in this forum. We can't see how the other one looks, so we just discuss on each others points. Most of the time anyway. I've read many many good threads, and I think this is one of the attractiveness of this forums.<br><br>I've seen some of the other forumites, and they are all easier to talk to face to face because we have already crossed words on the net.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If i were to whistle or 'click' my tongue (pop sound) at a girl it is because the girl is attractive, and, hoping for a small chance to git her attention and sometimee, for the cheap thrill of it. hehe<br><br>Its nice if the girl were to smile back, but people who wolf-whistle (or any variants) should expect that such gestures are not welcomed by the majority of the females in singapore.</div>
