                  to whities and dont mind getting
                  exploited. Everybody is too kind even when ang mor
                  steal your country ,money, and women.Should hantam them upside down
                  when they try to mess with you and that is the only commandment I

              <p>Dud, you remind me of the scores of Sillyporeans flooding this forum, who sound brave and bold online, but are meek as pussies on the street. Go re-read the 1st post in this thread. And suck on it.</p>

              Thanks COMF. I've never heard of that before. Yep- you're spot on.
              
              And you're quite right. Online, they are bold and rude. In real life, they are skinny boys easily intimidated.
              
              Having said that, I do find that does help make Singapore a safer place. Compare that to Western countries where white dudes get pissed and rowdy and you start to feel nervous when you walk by a poorly lit area at night. I mean, No one in their right mind would take their family with kids on a train at midnight in a city in a western country. You'd expose the kids to druggies, alcos, and there's a pretty good chance of being mugged, raped and killed. It's not an issue in Singapore. 
              
              So in the greater scheme of things, I think SG guys should stay "meek as pussies".

              <p>You've put it in good perspective.</p>
              <p>In my experience, what you said is quite true in many Western capitals - of drunkards roaming the streets at night, uninhibited behaviour and fights, and so on. No doubt, S'pore streets are relatively a good deal safer at night. As for your final sentence, I can't quite agree nor disagree.</p>
