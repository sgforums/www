              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>BECAUSE ... we are trying to be like them. Singapore is very very westernized and as a result, most of us are brought up with the idea that west = best.

              <p>Thats where you are wrong. Living longer with parents doesn't mean not being independent. Its simple an Asian tradition that the closer the families live together, the better so as to maintain the closeness within the families and also so that all the three generations can meet up for dinner and etc. Thats tradition of most Asian society, like it or not, we are born as Asians, so we simply follow it.</p>
              <p>Why do you think the government make flats cheaper to married couples if they are living near their elderly parents in the same area?</p>
              <p><br>In Western society, its usually this case, once the boy turns a certain age, he moves out. And when he does, its not simply moving out, he might move very far off miles away, sometimes even crossing states. But thats simply the way that is. Everyone wants freedom. For us, when we reach a certain age, our parents want us to live together but they do not meddle in our affairs, they can give advice but they dont make decisions for us. So ultimately, living together with parents isn't a very accurate gauge of a male's independence.</p>

              <p>"SG dud chats up any chick = creepy encounter, hesitant
              conversation" i guess in this case, it depends on the person's charisma n personality.</p>
              <p>"SG dud speak fluent English = banana, soon outcasted by
              Singlish-speaking friends" actually not really le, friends accept each other for who they are, not what they can be.</p>
              <p>"SG dud drive sports car = Chao Ah Beng" it depends on the person carry himself, clothing he wears, boils down to the personality.</p>
              <p>"SG dud in suit and tie = MLM" really misconception here. then all the corporate managers n CEO are all in MLM? give mi a break!</p>

              <p>Whites are not superior to me.

              <p>As for the ang moh I date , it is because they are young (nothing above 26 year olds),cute and from well to do backgrounds.  I am not getting any younger , might as well build my ego up and have some fun.</p>
              <p>Some are real sweethearts and romantic but they really can't win the Persians in terms of sweetening girls up or surprising them ( I got whole load of equations on gravity proofed by one when he wanted to impress me with his knowledge of physics - it was so sweet) .</p>

Some people are awed by certain racial characteristics.</p></div>

              <p><br>no they dont unlike oriental women, indian women dont need a white to make babies with sharper facial features, we <em>already have chiseled facial features.</em></p>
              <p> maybe they desire lighter skin, blonde hair and blue eyes but that could be said with mediterranean women as well.</p>
              <p>if an indian woman likes white men, its just her preferance. maybe she believes westerners wont be wife beaters or drunkards. I don't blame them, shame on us Indian men on that aspect. Hopefully our generation don't become like that. Thats why I still don't want to drink alcohol. I've seen the damage it has done to our society.</p>
