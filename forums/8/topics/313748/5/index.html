              <p><br>There are good and bad behaving ang mohs in SG, there are also good and bad behaving SG guy in SG.</p>
              <p>It depends on how you are comparing them, if you are comparing between good behaving SG guy and ang mohs in SG, then I would say ang mohs in SG will be so outclassed.</p>
              <p>Reason is because this is not their country of origin, not their culture, they have no traditional nor family values, they don't respect the status of parents as their elders in life, they can't share our asian jokes, they can't speak our language and dialects.</p>
              <p>You just haven't met a good behaving and charming SG guy yet, so don't compare your ang mohs in SG with trash in SG. Go compare them with trash in their home countries and you'll see the difference. Even our trash in SG will still outclassed their ang moh trash in their home countries.</p>

              <p> I honestly don't know why American born Asian females tend to date Caucasian men.It could be something as simple as there are many more white guys than Asian guys in west? Or perhaps some Asian-American females still cling to some negative stereotypes when it comes to Asian men. Including those that are born and raised in America?.</p>
              <p>Perhaps there are some Asian-American females on this forum that could contribute their opinions on this matter. Since I am not about to try and understand how any woman thinks. Or act as their self appointed spokesperson.</p>
              <p>Asian guy and ang moh girl relationships are uncommon in the US.  But are much less rare than they are in Asian countries.</p>
              <p>On a lighter note there is a popular reality show on US television about an Caucasian woman married to an Korean-American man and their eight children called  called <em>Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8.</em></p>

              <p>I believe this would fall into the category of preference &amp; demand. How many SG men would like to have a relationship with an ang moh woman as compared to asian woman from local and other parts of the world?

And how many ang moh men would actually like to have a relationship with an asian woman compared to an ang moh woman?</p>

              <p>Even as you have mentioned there aren't any post of SG men-ang moh women relationships, there aren't also many posts of ang moh men-SG women relationships either.</p>
              <p>Basically when things are going well, people just don't post in here and share. Called it anti-social if you want, but this isn't the SG culture. It's will often be viewed as boasting and there are many who will not hesitate to flame at the blink of an eye...even for those more than 120k post forumers.</p>
              <p>You will find more posts on SG guy-SG girl relationships than ang moh guys-asian girl relationship, and tell me if I'm wrong. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Is there a rule which says SG men must have relationship with
              ang moh women?</p>
              <p>I believe this would fall into the category of preference &amp;
              demand. How many SG men would like to have a relationship with an
              ang moh woman as compared to asian woman from local and other parts
              of the world? And how many ang moh women would actually like to
              have a relationship with an asian man? And how many ang moh men
              would actually like to have a relationship with an asian woman
              compared to an ang moh woman?</p>
              <p>It's in all these statistics that you will find your
              answers.</p>
              <p>Even as you have mentioned there aren't any post of SG men-ang
              moh women relationships, there aren't also many posts of ang moh
              men-SG women relationships either.</p>
              <p>Basically when things are going well, people just don't post in
              here and share. Called it anti-social if you want, but this isn't
              the SG culture. It's will often be viewed as boasting and there are
              many who will not hesitate to flame at the blink of an eye...even
              for those more than 120k post forumers.</p>
              <p>You will find more posts on SG guy-SG girl relationships than
              ang moh guys-asian girl relationship, and tell me if I'm wrong.

              <p>And you're wrong in assuming that I have not stayed in Western
              countries for a long time. Don't ask me where I've stayed, cos I
              don't plan to share with you.</p>

              <p>No there isn't a rule about SG men dating ang moh women. But neither is there a rule on ang moh men dating SG women, but we see many of these cases.</p>
              <p>Thing is, you're saying that SG men outclass ang moh men. But what we see all over the net is women from other countries not having much good to say about SG men, and even SG women themselves being tired of SG men. So far, most of the good comments about SG men seem to come from SG men themselves.</p>
              <p>It's fine if you don't want to tell me where you've stayed, but I find that a very weird answer. Unless you're a criminal, what is there to hide?</p>
