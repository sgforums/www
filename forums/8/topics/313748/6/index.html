              stories? All I see in this forum is many SG girls criticizing SG

              <p>It's just your perception. I see as many kids with AM/WF parents as WM/AF parents where I work. Both are outnumbered anyway by same-race couples.</p>

              <p>That is why I date ang moh who are 24 years and below ...hahaha. Get them young - easier to train and got trophy on the arm. Get them old - means SPG who is desperate like sh*t or maybe gold digger or maybe who knows it is love ....*shudder* .</p>
              <p> I can't deal with Singaporean guys - the ones I met want super skinnies - never mind the personality is sh*t and the face very chao .....Skinny for the Sg guys I know = chiou bu . The ang moh and other asians consider me curvy . The sg guys I know, keep calling me fat even though my weight is healthy. Some like it , some have the mentality that being a stick insect = beauty. Then when I go out with other nationalities - Sg guys say I xia sui them ... that one is winner already.</p>
              <p>My favorite got to be persians (ASIAN WOOHOOO) more. They are much more cuter  (just too much hair on some ) even when they are older.</p>

              <p>The older I get , the more younger men I attract. I am dating 2 younger men (more than 4 years younger) ...I am 29. Asians age damn well - my australian friends think I am only 24 years old.</p>
              <p>Eastern european men - no thanks. Dated a romanian , I swore off Eastern Europeans after that.</p>
              <p>I love the Persian guys I know. One of them is a real sweetheart . When he gets drunk, he goes on a mathematical solving spree.</p>

                          result, most of us are brought up with the idea that west = best.
                          Our history books and tv shows depict the west are the winners in
                          wars and the most advanced/cultured.</strong></span></p>

              <p>F*ck the shit above.</p>
              <p>Whites are not superior to me. I descended from ancient people aka Chinese.  That is why I like Persians specially - freaking Persian empire baby and they have ancient historical links to China for trade.  Indians are not too bad either - they grew side by side with the Chinese culture.</p>
              <p>As for the ang moh I date , it is because they are young (nothing above 26 year olds),cute and from well to do backgrounds.  I am not getting any younger , might as well build my ego up and have some fun.</p>
              <p>Some are real sweethearts and romantic but they really can't win the Persians in terms of sweetening girls up or surprising them ( I got whole load of equations on gravity proofed by one when he wanted to impress me with his knowledge of physics - it was so sweet) .</p>
