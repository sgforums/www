            <div class='col-md body'>Last time I went to bangkok actually to join my uncle hor for holidays leh...so we actually took a train. My uncle was very rich, he is a collector for very precious antique leh.. He like those like beautiful beautiful chinese thing that kind... once I went to his house wah kaoz... really alot of teapot bowl and etc all from the grand grand father times one.. so on the holiday he invite me to go again...... he actually book the entire vip cabin for me and his new butler whole cabin... very nice... but he be joining us on the train from KL the next morning... So there am I with the butler, his on room 5 and I'm on room 6. The butler is quite a quiet person... don't talk much... his name is lee.. anyway.. so the next day when we wake up at about 5:30am My uncle is here with a bunch of people together as we leave for bangkok... althogether 7, Another collector John who was joining my uncle for the charity bid in Bangkok, Insurer Sim who represents the company insuring the priceless items... My uncle's secretary Xiuxiu.. Another collector Travis..... Bodyguard Lam and my uncle's associate Richard.... My uncle is quite a fun guy to be with... just like my father... afterall they are brothers... but he surprised me with the box which he carried.. A wooden box... he left for his room. Which is Room 5 that previously the butler had stayed (the butler now goes to room 4). Put his things... before long my curiousity pushed me to ask him for questions about the box.  So he showed me as he open the wooden box revealing an ancient Ming dynasty Ruyi... made of pure Jade crafted from one Single Jade block.... That is beautiful.... He was preparing that to be bid in the charity auction in Bangkok.... As we leave for breakfast in the next cabin, the Xiuxiu prepares to keep the priceless treasure.. Carefully..and sliding the window do to a small gap preventing the wooden box from sliding out of the window and yet let the room be airy enough....<br>So we left the room while my uncle locked it... Only he has the keys and no one else.... Had quite a fufilling breakfast with him and his secretary... Getting ready to left for some rest in our room... I reached my room and tries to take out whatever does amuse me during that time of voidness... Not long a loud shout... from my uncle's room... Its my uncle's voice... I rush to my uncle's room and saw my uncle in an expression of shock.... the ruyi is Gone!!!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok so this is part two...<br><br>So as I ran to my uncle's room... the room wasn't in a real mess except for the empty wooden box which used to contain the ruyi.... It was actually a hinged boxed with the top.. able to be opened... its lying by the window opened..on the window side table where the ruyi originally was... Nothing much could be found in the room... the floor was neat so is the beds by the side... checking the windows... its still had the same gap as we left.... except something was found by the exterior of the panel.... a small scotch tape... hmmm? Nothing was stolen.. nothing else... door wasn't be breaked open... And my uncle only has the key.... So as I go through the step to wonder who could the thief be...? It must fit a few description.... 1) He is still in the cabin... as no one had left the cabin.. 2) he must had a way of getting into the room or getting the item out of the room... through the door or the window... hmmm who could it be.... Immediately I approach the captain of the cabin.. and enquire about any second keys for the room? He said my uncle is the only one with the keys.... the master key is in the station. No one else can open.... This guy must know how to pick the lock... "Did you see anyone suspicious for the entire day?" I asked... he replied ....Yesterday The butler did borrow some string to sew his torn jacket... errmmm this morning Lam asked for some screwdriver to repair his radio which I direct him to the train steward.... ah yes... i remember.. John was walking outside the room loitering in circles... as if he was looking for something... When I called upon him... he left in a haste..." " I see thank you" I then depart and walked to the cabin service area looking for the steward..<br><br>"Did you see anything suspicious these two days?" He replied... "Hmmm... yes... firstly I lost my brooms yesterday... then Mr. Lam came to me for a screwdriver ... insurer asked for some toothpick.... and Xiuxiu just left 2 mins ago... asked for some needle to sew as she said the butler needs it...." Hmmm... I tot to myself... could it be Lam.... open up the lock with the screwdriver and stole the ruyi... and why is John outside the room just now while we are eating.....this is so strange.... Meanwhile very soon its lunch time... everyone is gathering for a afternoon lunch....at the same time it reminds me I'm left with a day and a nite to solve the mystery before we left the train... and it will be so difficult..</div>
