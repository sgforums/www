The chemical is used to give a permanent press effect to clothes.<br><br>Consumers are advised to wash and air all clothes before they are worn for the first time.<br><br>Target producer Simon Roy said a variety of new clothes were tested, including a girl's top, school shorts, a Spiderman T-shirt, and pyjamas. Adult clothing was also tested. Roy said the results were so astounding the AgriQuality scientists thought they had made a mistake. "Our results were shocking, ranging from 230ppm to 18,000ppm.<br><br>This is almost unbelieveable. Some of the clothes Target tested have a reading 900 times the level that actually causes harm."<br><br>But the potential harm wasn't limited to formaldehyde or clothing made in China.<br><br>Four children's garments were tested for their ph level, which measures acidity or alkalinity. Levels outside 4 to 7.5 on the scale can damage skin. Two items, a pair of pants and a girl's top, had ph levels above 7.5. Roy said garments made in New Zealand with imported Chinese fabrics also contained chemicals such as harmful dyes that did not wash out or wear off the way formaldehyde did. That included clothes from top-end designer labels. Buying Kiwi-made or expensive brands was no safety net for consumers, he said.<br><br>Europe had banned 22 aromatic amine dyes which were known carcinogens. But Target investigations showed 10pc of clothes tested in China contained them and, once again, New Zealand had no regulations about what it accepted into the country.<br><br>Auckland mother Raewyn Rasch said the findings were horrifying.<br><br>She told the Star-Times her son bought four pairs of trousers labelled 100pc cotton. But even after washing, each pair caused a rash round his middle. Rasch thought formaldehyde could be a cause after she read about toxins in clothing. "What really annoys me is that, for mothers, kids are always coming up with scratches and marks and rashes. You ask them what they've been eating and where they've been. You wouldn't expect it to be the clothes they're wearing."<br><br>New Zealand consumers deserved protection and needed to know about the dangers they and their children were exposed to, she said.<br><br>Details of the unsafe clothing and its risks follow a global recall this month of millions of Mattel toys, also made in China and deemed unsafe. Sanitarium is now getting its peanut butter made in Australia rather than China because of consumer concerns, and last month a toothpaste made in China was recalled after it was found to contain a toxin used in anti-freeze.<br><br>Green MP Sue Kedgley said New Zealand risked becoming a dumping ground for unsafe imports, some of which China itself regulated against.<br><br>"I believe it is so serious it demands a parliamentary investigation of our complete lack of consumer protection for most products in New Zealand. Technically they are supposed to comply with the Consumer Guarantees Act but how would anyone know if it's being systematically breached when no one is looking or doing any monitoring?"<br><br>(source: <a href="http://stuff.co.nz/4170189a10.html" rel="nofollow">Stuff NZ</a>)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">The same news is hidden inside CNN website under the Asian segment. Unlike its previous front page handling only days ago.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;"><br><strong>Mattel takes blame for toy recall</strong><br><br>BEIJING, China (AP) -- U.S.-based toy giant Mattel issued an extraordinary apology to China on Friday over the recall of Chinese-made toys, taking the blame for design flaws and saying it had recalled more lead-tainted toys than justified.<br><br>The gesture by Thomas A. Debrowski, Mattel's executive vice president for worldwide operations, came in a meeting with Chinese product safety chief Li Changjiang, at which Li upbraided the company for maintaining weak safety controls.<br><br>"Our reputation has been damaged lately by these recalls," Debrowski told Li in a meeting at Li's office at which reporters were allowed to be present.<br><br>"And Mattel takes full responsibility for these recalls and apologizes personally to you, the Chinese people, and all of our customers who received the toys," Debrowski said.<br><br>The carefully worded apology, delivered with company lawyers present, underscores China's central role in Mattel's business. The world's largest toy maker has been in China for 25 years and about 65 percent of its products are made in China.<br><br>The fence-mending call came ahead of an expected visit to China by Mattel's chairman and chief executive, Robert A. Eckert. Following the massive recall, Eckert told U.S. lawmakers he wanted to see Mattel's mainland inspections first hand.<br><br>Mattel ordered three high-profile recalls this summer involving more than 21 million Chinese-made toys, including Barbie doll accessories and toy cars because of concerns about lead paint or tiny magnets that could be swallowed.<br><br>The recalls have prompted complaints from China that manufacturers were being blamed for design faults introduced by Mattel.<br><br>On Friday, Debrowski acknowledged that "vast majority of those products that were recalled were the result of a design flaw in Mattel's design, not through a manufacturing flaw in China's manufacturers."<br><br>Lead-tainted toys accounted for only a small percentage of all toys recalled, he said, adding that: "We understand and appreciate deeply the issues that this has caused for the reputation of Chinese manufacturers."<br><br>The slew of Chinese-made toys since June by Mattel and other smaller toy makers has resulted in many parents scouring for U.S.-made label stamped on playthings at toy stores. That is no easy feat when more than 80 percent of toys sold in the U.S. are made in China.<br><br>Mattel's mea culpa could help reshape the debate surrounding Chinese-made toys.<br><br>In fact, new research from two business professors shows that recalls due to problems with the U.S. maker's design accounted for the vast majority -- about 76 percent -- of the 550 U.S.toy recalls since 1988.<br><br>The report, released earlier this month from Paul R. Beamish, an international business professor at Canada's University of Western Ontario, and Hari Bapuji, business professor at University of Manitoba's I.H. Asper School of Business in Winnipeg, Canada, found that recalls blamed on design problems and manufacturing defects, such as lead paint or poor craftmanship, both rose in the past two years as U.S. makers have shifted more of their production to China.<br><br>But they noted that, "if shifting manufacturing to China resulted in poorer quality goods, then the number of toys recalled due to manufacturing should be greater than the number recalled due to design," the report said. But that is not the case.<br><br>"Nobody gets a free ride on this," said Beamish, arguing that toy makers' obsession to quickly get new products to market before they are widely copied has resulted in a lot of cost-cutting and inadequate testing.<br><br>In a statement issued by the company Friday, Mattel said its lead-related recalls were "overly inclusive, including toys that may not have had lead in paint in excess of the U.S. standards.<br><br>"The follow-up inspections also confirmed that part of the recalled toys complied with the U.S. standards," the statement said, without giving specific figures.<br><br>The co-owner of the company that supplied the lead-tainted toys to Mattel, Lee Der Industrial Co. Ltd., committed suicide in August shortly after the recall was announced.<br><br>Li reminded Debrowski that "a large part of your annual profit ... comes from your factories in China.<br><br>"This shows that our cooperation is in the interests of Mattel, and both parties should value our cooperation. I really hope that Mattel can learn lessons and gain experience from these incidents," Li said, adding that Mattel should "improve their control measures."<br><br>Li, the head of China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, also expressed his appreciation for Debrowski's "objective and responsible attitude toward the recent toy recall."<br><br>Chinese food, drugs and other products ranging from toothpaste to seafood are under intense scrutiny because they have been found to contain potentially deadly substances.<br><br>But China has bristled at what it claims is a campaign to discredit its reputation as an exporter. It accuses foreign media and others of playing up its product safety issues as a form of protectionism.<br><br>Beijing insists that the vast majority of its exports are safe but has stepped up inspections of food, drugs and other products in response to the concerns.<br><br>Li told reporters after meeting with Debrowski that the government had taken swift action against Lee Der, shutting down its operations and revoking its business license. Four people from the company also face criminal charges, he said, without giving details.<br><br>Since this summer's recalls Mattel has announced plans to upgrade its safety system by certifying suppliers and increasing the frequency of random, unannounced inspections. It has fired several manufacturers.<br><br>Tests had found that lead levels in paint in recalled toys were as high as 110,000 parts per million, or nearly 200 times higher than the accepted safety ceiling of 600 parts per million.<br><br>Mattel's shares fell from the mid-$23 level following the first recall in early August, reaching as low as $20.97 on Sept. 10. They have since rebounded, and rose 55 cents, or 2.33 percent to $24.11 in morning trading Friday..<br><br>China has become a center for the world's toy-making industry, exporting $7.5 billion worth of toys last year.</span><br><br><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/09/21/mattel.apology.ap/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/09/21/mattel.apology.ap/index.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One million Chinese cribs recalled in US<br><br>Simplicity Inc, a supplier of baby furniture to Wal-Mart Stores and other big retailers, is recalling about 1 million Chinese-made baby cribs which have been linked to at least two infant deaths, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission says.<br><br>The drop-side can detach from the crib, which can create a dangerous gap that leads to an infant being trapped and suffocated, the safety agency said in a statement. It urged parents to check all Simplicity-made cribs to ensure the drop-side is installed correctly.<br><br>The cribs, priced between $US100 and $US300 ($A116 and $A350), were sold by US retailers and chains including Target Corp, Big Lots Inc and family-owned Meijer Inc.<br><br>"The drop-side failures result from both the hardware and crib design, which allow consumers to unintentionally install the drop-side upside down," the safety commission said. "This, in turn, can weaken the hardware and cause the drop-side to detach from the crib. When the drop-side detaches, it creates a gap in which infants can become entrapped."<br><br>Two separate infant deaths involving a nine-month-old and a six-month-old occurred when cribs with older-style hardware had the drop-side installed upside down, the agency said.<br><br>The CPSC said it was also investigating a third death that had newer-style hardware.
