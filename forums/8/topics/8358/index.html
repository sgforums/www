            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to apologise to those people from sgforums/sgcafe who have been so worried about me when i went missing for the past 1 month without explaining anything. And to those people as in friends or teachers, who had tried knocking some senses into me, i am grateful to you all and i apologise for any harsh or rude words used towards any of you during that period of time.<br><br>For the past 1 month, life was a pure living hell for me. Life was plain miserable and i had wanted to end my life. Its stupid and selfish i know. But at that point in time, i didn't care about anyone or anything in this world. I used to say that hope exists so long one still lives, but i choose not to listen to that myself. I didn't care if anyone is heartbroken should i die, i simply was someone without a mind, without a heart and soul. More like a walking zombie in my view. I hurt a lot of people and most of all i hurt myself even more. From my parents, my relatives, my friends and my teachers. They have tried to talk to me but pretty much nothing came out of my mouth. The past 1 month was simply the darkest moments in my life, i was simply not the locutus you people know. More like a total reflection, the opposite of what locutus once was.<br><br>Some of you may think i did all these to seek attention while others may think i actually feel proud of doing all these. I can only say, i am never a person who craves for attention, and how  is it possible that i would feel proud when i felt so miserable deep inside myself hurting the various people whom i cared about. You think it was fun? How fun could it be when you are on the edge of killing your ownself for 1 whole month? And how fun could it be...when all i felt inside was so much pain from seeing so many people worried about me? Some pple. may ask, if i care so much, why did i even keep insisting on ending my own existence? I was torn between 2 sides of myself, the side who no longer cares and the part who is still the locutus you people once knew. It was plain miserable. I don't deny being totally immature, selfish, childish in thinking and doing all those things but i can tell you, at no point in time, it was pleasant for me. Life at that point in time simply has no meaning left for me.<br><br>Right now, i have given myself another chance. A chance to redeem myself, to get myself back. I don't seek forgiveness for i myself know i hurt a lot people badly. I just wish to say sorry to all of you. Im not sure whether i can still be the locutus you people once knew, but im willing to try to be a better person this time round. For now, i just want to get myself back, everything else doesn't matter to me at the current moment.<br><br>( i won't be using any names only the nicks if possible)<br><br>To the sgcafe/sgforums people, fatnugly, oldman, eastpark, atreiu, lexelle, mayajade, x_mark, among others, once again i apologise for disappearing without giving a reason and for making everyone worry for me. Ah pek and Parkie, thanks for trying to talk to me during that nite 1 month ago.<br><br>To my schoolmates, Nyxator, viceroy and co. who had constantly tried to talk to me and whom i have ignored totally, i once again hereby say sorry to all of you. No matter what, you people would still be my friends even if any of you all no longer treat me as one.<br><br>To my other Irc/Icq friends, Commodore, Se|phie and co., thanks for the effort you people put in to convince me around. I appreciated it and i hope someday i can repay what you all have helped me.<br><br>To my cousins who also make the effort in talking to me, trying to cheer me up, thanks to all of you. Also thanks for the book which did brought some senses back into me. It make me realise just how much i still do care about the people around me.<br><br>To my teachers, Mr Tan and co., as much as i still didn't like the way you people tried to help me, i still am grateful for the care and concern for me you people had for me. A sorry here for letting you people down.<br><br>And to that one very special person who was constantly by my side during this 1 month waiting for me to see the light, i am very sorry for how i treated you but at the same time i would like to say im grateful to you for being there for me during these darkest moments.<br><br>Its not very possible for me to list out everyone, but i would just like to say sorry to everyone. A thousand apologies may not matter to you people, but its the best i could do for the time being.<br><br>------------------<br>Happiness lies for those who cry, those who hurt, those who have searched and those who have tried. For only they can appreciate the importance of people who have touched their lives.<br><br>At the end of every storm is a rainbow. I hope i can find that rainbow.</div>
