            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everybody,<br><br>You all still remember Einstein? The old man with messy hair.<br><br>I remember him saying something like,<br><br>Time is relative.<br><br>Eh wait a minute, or issit place?<br><br>Well, anyway. I believe he meant to say, both time and place are relative.<br><br>He said if someone walks inside a moving train, then the train moves relative to the objects outside, and also the objects move relative to the train, and the person walking inside is also moving relative to the train and the objects.<br><br>Which is fine. That makes sense.<br><br>He also said, time is a function of the speed of light. If we move faster than the speed of light, we move backwards and can visit the past.<br><br>'Speed' means something is in motion, correct? Speed of light means the light is in motion, it is moving, the light is moving, correct?<br><br>And something which moves, will take place, correct? Also, if something moves, the other objects also move in relativity, yes?<br><br>And now,<br><br>As you notice. Kids can run very fast.<br><br>Old people cant run so fast.<br><br>So.<br><br>I conclude, to solve the problem of human aging, the key is not in biological research, or genetic engineering. The key is not in the biological field. The scientists are focusing in the wrong area. Rather, the key is understanding and applying the greater theorm from Einstein theory of time and place and movement.<br><br>Now wait. Before you say I kuku.<br><br>(Actually sometimes I am. Kuku. But not now)<br><br>As you know, when you put fish in the freezer, the fish can last longer than if you put it out in the open. I confirm this scientific principle myself, yes.<br><br>There are also people who want to be frozen, so they can be de-frosted in the future. How to say, they want to see the future.<br><br>What happens when fish or humans get frozen? The molecules dont vibrate so much anymore, correct? They become compact and still? That's what I remember reading.<br><br>So, this is further proof. Further hint.<br><br>Now I go to sleep first.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes you are kuku. However you apply the theory. If you carry a clock with you while you speed off the the speed of light, you still die at the same age. That is to say, to you, you still feel like you only lived say, 80 years. However to the other people that you have left behind, it would look as if you are aging very slowing. That is the basis of time travel if it is actually done.<br><br>And its the one way road, theres no turning back.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm.. Just something to ponder upon.. "The absence of future presence denies the theory of time travelling"<br>What exactly do you mean by time travelling? If you mean time as in the time you have on your hands like 1 hour of soccer, 2 hours of studying, 5 hours of sleeping, it sounds feasible. Have you guys slept for like 5 hours and it just seems like 15 minutes? There you go! You have just time travelled. You have pass 5 hours in 15 minutes. It is the perception of the human mind. In the time of 2 hours, A plays soccer and enjoyed himself whereas B sits down on a chair and stare at his watch. To A, 2 hours of soccer had just passed very fast whereas to B 2 hours of staring at the watch is so slow he could just die. Imagine the seconds passing by which goes to minutes then to the hour. Time travelling? In a way right?<br>Planet A and Planet B are 2 light years apart which means it would take 2 years travelling at the light of speed to reach from planet A to planet B. Ok. Now, 1 Jan 2000, an explosion occured on Planet B. On 1 Jan 2002, someone on planet A will start to see the explosion on Planet B which was supposedly to occur 2 years ago. Occurence of any time travelling?<br>Photographs of the past. Time travelling?<br>It is all the perception of the human minds. What we see is being processed in our minds to give us the verdict. We will never be physically in the past, but a machine can be built in future to tap into our minds and play around with our past experiences and make us virtually go back into our past. Sensors all over our body to stimulate our nerves in a way so as to simulate the actions we want to do and "feel" in the virtual dream. Something like the matrix. That means our nerves and mind can be stimulated such that it feels like we are eating an apple but in physical we are not. Think wet dreams.<br><br>Ok I think I might drift away a bit from the topic but what the hell haha something to think about..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>we can predict one of the many possiblities of the future...so which future will u choose to go if say we hav broken all the constraints of limited hardware and knowledge and resources availble for time travel. since the future and its posibilities are endless and u can only be in one of the many possibilities so what if u actually time travel there and witness it...coz the future may be another realm ....... the truth is only time will tell <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
