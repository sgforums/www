              <p>Please notify your parents about this debt.</p>
              <p>Debt collectors will forward your case to legal.</p>
              <p>$400 not much, better to settle before court add penalty. </p>
              <p>By then you parents will find out anyway, and they will be more upset u kept this from them when they could easily settle before.</p>
              <p>You can pay back your parents in installments later.</p>
              <p>Please exercise better financial judgements in the future.</p>
              <p>Running away will not solve any problem, only make things worst.</p>

              <p>the morale of the story is to teach you to always <strong>practise financial prudence and management</strong> at all times.</p>
              <p>the lesson you learnt is to <strong>spend below what you earn</strong> (the limit line).</p>
              <p>this served as a base for "<strong>Owe $, Pay $</strong>".</p>
              <p>if you head is not big, then don't wear too big cap.</p>
              <p>you are considered very lucky as it's a proper business-licenced company.<br>if you are to try your default payment story with loansharks/ banks, your home is either gone case with paint or repossessed by bank to auction off to repay the bank loan.</p>
