I think itÂ’s not a very nice thing to do, but then, I donno his wife, and the money is si beh solid. How? Should I do it?<br><br>Teenager<br><br>Dear Teenager,<br><br>I never understand why people want to kill their wife. Si beh leceh, one. If you not happy with your marriage, is very simpur one. Just go Geylang and find some GRO in a KTV launge, and everything is gau timm. But I agree, $100,000 is a lot of money. I have a better suggestion. Why donÂ’t you go and tell his wife abourit, then ask how much she wants for you to kill him? After all, he sounds like an asshole. If he finds out, then up the price, and say if he doesnÂ’t pay, youÂ’ll tell the police. Simpur-simpur, and you donÂ’t have to kill anybody.<br><br>Ah Beng<br><br></div>

Still, I am convinced that his beard must mean he is up to no good. Because, hor, when you watch TV or go cinema see show that time, the bad person always got beard.<br><br>What should I do? I very scared wait my MRT kena bomb. Worse, this may make my neighbourhood property price drop.<br><br>What should I do? I very scared, leh.<br><br>Chao Kay Poh<br><br>Dear Kay Poh,<br><br>Eh, not say I say what, hor, but you cannot anyhow stereotype people, okay!<br><br>Just because a person has a beard and a turban does not mean he is a terrorist! He could be a jaga, or a hockey player or chapatti cook!<br><br>Eh, you foreign talent or what? Cannot tell the difference between a bhai and a bomber!<br><br>We cannot anyhow discriminate peepur, you know!<br><br>I also empathise greatly with my Muslim friends. They all si beh cham, one. So many Singaporeans think they are Muslim only means they are terrorist. Again, I say: how can stereotype them like that? They could also be chauffeur, dispatch clerk or satay seller, mah!<br><br>Remember, we Chinese peepur also face stereotype and discrimination. Peepur think we wear singlet, got spiky dyed hair, wear slipper, squat in shopping centre and swear in Hokkien only means we must be Ah Beng! How can anyhow say we Ah Beng? We could also be Samseng, Pai Kiah, or Orh Sia Huay one, mah!<br><br>But having said all that, I think so that as citizens, we must also be on the lookout for potential terrorists. But must lookout for the right kind of signs, mah! Beard alone is not a confirmed sign.<br><br>So what are proper signs? For exampur, if he use a video camera a lot.<br><br>But must use your brain a bit, lah! Just because he use video camera doesn't mean he's a terrorist. Must see what he shoot, mah!<br><br>If he is videoing MRT station, nearby army camp or maybe community centre, then I think so you should immeelly call the police.<br><br>But if he only use the video to tape peepur having sex, or to shoot secret chao kng panty shots, then he is not a terrorist. He is a pervert. In which case, you should NOT call the police.<br><br>Instead, you should let my kakis at the Chap Sar Tiam Secret Society know, so we can go and copy his tapes and make dirty VCDs to sell at bus interchange. Of course, you will get a bit of commission, lah.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Ah Beng<br><br></div>

It seemed to be such a good deal, as just by rubbing it, the man could tell that I was an easily-influenced moron, which is exactly how my husband describes me! However, after handing over my life savings worth $20,000, I find that the stone doesn't work. Now I can't afford to pay my bills or to finance my daughter's education. How?<br><br>Stoner<br><br>Dear Stoner,<br><br>Eh, eh, eh! Be careful, leh! Like I told you last week when you bought the stone from me, you must not doubt the magic stone. You must be patient with its powers! If you get kan cheong, then it cannot work. Even worse, if you call the police, then the stone will reverse its powers and you will have incredibly bad luck for 44 years! The last person who reported me started growing pubic hair in her ears! All true, I swear! But in the meantime, if you need money, I can arrange for you to have a part time job at Neng Neng Massage Parlour and KTV at Geylang Lorong 69.<br><br>Ah Beng<br><br></div>

And what, you think we just KLKK around the shopping centre cho boh lan and sian char bor? You think char bor attracted to Ah Bengs, ah? Acherly, they are our accomplices, and we are all there to shoplift or kuah chui (keep a lookout)! You think be Ah Beng is hobby, is it? It's a profession! My gang is earning so much revenue, I heard Singapore Technologies also wants to form a GLG (government-linked gang) to come into the market. So join a gang only if you're serious. In fact, join a gang only if your studies are damn tok kong. We do'wan any old samseng nowsaday, leh! You just want to relac one corner in a kopi tiam, then be a kopi kiah.

Anyway, back to your question. In my opinion, hor, you should be able to eat anything you like with any drink you like. In fact, I don't recommend you drink wine. It's like ribena with a bit of kick. You may want to try some, but not too much. It's only for ah quahs. Feel free to order XO with everything. But I teach you a trick: got something that goes with any kind of food or beverage - launge hostess.

Acherly, I also don'ch know why Singaporeans want to clean their windows. Maybe you can persuade your Sir or Mum that leaving the windows dirty is a good thing. If windows dirty, then can walk around the flat naked, mah. If clean-clean, then some kaypoh neighbour sure kao peh kao bu, then you kena saman. But then, depending on what your Sir or Mum look like, maybe the sight of them naked might make you jump voluntarily. You maybe also want to tie yourself tight-tight to something solid if you have to lean out. Of course, you could always break the windows. Then got nothing to clean, mah. But then, it makes it easier for your Sir or Mum to throw you out. Aiyah, why not just run away and come work for us at Geylang Lorong 69?
