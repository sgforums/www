            <div class='col-md body'>Thing is, normally, a gal would want to spend time with the guy as much as possible whenever they're released from their weekly torture during the weekends.<br><br>But, NS, being what it is, the guys (most of the time) would rather remain at home, and Zzz.. the rest of the day, or stay at home, keep the family company, continue their hobbies or get reaquainted with his friends (Since they most likely know what the guy went thru, while the girl does not.)<br><br>Since the normal mentality is that the girl should be able to understand the fact that the weekends now are EVERYTHING to a guy serving his time in NS. The girl feels left out, since there's no way that she understands half the NS jargon, unit assignments, or what it means. Not to mention the fact that NS training is almost equivalent to wiping out what little personality or ability to think. Girls probably don't understand. I mean, come on, even the ladies serving the Army does less "time" compared to the guys.<br><br>And once the guy meets other NS friends, they drop into military talk. (E.g. "Which Unit you in now ?", "Did you go thru that Demo Charge training ?", etc etc.... I know the feeling, since that ALWAYS happens when my friends gather together... sheesh.... give a damn thought for the civilian man !)<br><br>Basically, its better to be prepared.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> I'm awaiting my turn, to see how things go. If thing turn out well, Great, if not......  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> Well.... I'm gonna Demolish the camp or turn into one of those weird PT(Physical Training) crazy people in camp. Or I'll turn out to be one of my friends who couldn't take it, and nearly shot his CO during range.<br><br>Well... look at it this way, like Luf said, if she can drop you the next day for another guy, its better for you. Imagine finding out that she's been sleeping with someone else just before you're about to get married. Would you prefer to find out now ? or just when you're about to say your vows ??<br><br>Take it from a guy who got dumped by the same girl 3 times. Its better being a bachelor, than being a slave to such a self serving bitch. (Apologies for the crudeness ladies.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> No harm intended.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Its just a figure of speech.)<br><br>------------------<br>"A Gentleman is not an implement."<br>-Confucius, Analects, 2:12</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm....dunno why ppl always break up during NS. If NS u also cannot tahan, den i guess the breakup is worth it. NS is NOT the only time where you can only get to see ur partners once or twice a week. In fact it's going to get worse, much worse, when the both of u step out to work in society. NS is just a prelude, an appetiser to what is to come next time...<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>

I am just speaking the plain truth. At least during NS, true that you have lesser time for her, but whatever time u have, u can spend it with her without having to worry about anything else. Imagine next time when u go out to work. Whatever time u have to spend with her will still have to be divided among the many burdens on ur mind....ur work, ur projects, bills....etc....<br>Quality time becomes lesser and lesser.<br>Archer...u should know this much better than me coz u r one heck of a workaholic...and u should know the price u paid for it.<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>
