            <div class='col-md body'>this is what my instructor told me..... dun show the instructor that you are 'kan cheong' when in the driver seat. if so, he will be more weary of you. Then check your blindspots(this is bery important). Relax and everything will be gone in a short while. Just treat it as one of your many practises.

I passed first time eventually. And sad to say, 1/2 year after passing, I still can't drive and park.<br><br>This method is unisex.
