Many exchange students stay there. Most of these people just came to Singapore to fool around, especially the guys. There's a rule in all NUS residences, which is, no member of opposite sex is allowed in one's room behind closed doors. It is so rigidly exercised such that there was one particular incident when this girl was sick, so two of her friends, one male, one female, visited her. S H I T! They were caught with the door closed when there was a member of the opposite sex, so she was fined like $200. It is widely known however, if you are an ang moh/exchange student, this rule is entirely waived for your benefit. How fair is that?</div>
