              <p>There is a pretty significant difference between acting young at heart and acting like you've never grown up at all.</p>
              <p>Likewise, there is another significant difference between having the world laugh <em>with </em>you and having the world laugh <em>at</em> you.</p>
              <p>Well, I know you can't tell the difference in both cases, so just let everyone continue laughing <em>at</em> you while you're thinking that they're laughing <em>with</em> you, okay?</p>

              <p>What happen in the past is over, don't let it affect your future
              life. You should try to overcome it and start making new friends
              again.</p>
