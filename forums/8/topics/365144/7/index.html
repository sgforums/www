              <p>Personally i play games more to find people to chat than to really play the game and its not too hard to know people from games. I've met up with a few people i got to know online be it from games or from here and some we become friends and some even after meet up we still don't make friends. Its not a 100% sure work everytime thing but its 1 way to start making additional friends rather than juz people around you who you meet through work etc.</p>
              <p>Start somewhere. You're only 25 not 75, you still have a long life to lead and shouldn't give up trying so quickly</p>

              <p>yeah, i need to start somewhere, but trying to find a suitable online game also not easy.</p>
              <p>WoW and DOTA and Maplestory types not really for me also.</p>
              <p>i thought of Lunar Online but not sure how it is, but seems less people playing it nowadays.</p>
              <p>now, i want to concentrate my career first and then do other things.</p>
              <p>a 25-year old still doing admin asst job is not something to be proud of. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>Hey my admin manager officer is also a man! He dressed himself very well and carried himself like an ABC.. though i don't think he is one lor. It depends on how you see it.. anyway many people have lost their jobs and plently are eyeing at your job. You just don't know how lucky you are lah....</p>
              <p>Don't have friends? What do you usually do after work? Can't you find something of an interest to do that is sociable in nature and can be for character development ? You don't have to necessarily expect to be fit in if you are not comfortable but at least you try to step out of your comfort zone by participating and slowly acquired skills of making new friend. Even if you unable to make new friends this time round, at least you learn something new that can benefit in career and character development. It's still a win.</p>

              <p>1) i very free one at work.......pretty much nothing to do the whole day except swat flies and think of gals</p>
              <p>2) i personally don't place money at #1 position in my life, so i don't care about "working like hell for money". For what?! can bring $$$ to grave? u work like hell during young.....then when old? the stress accumulated during youth will give you all kinds of weird illness. think cancers.</p>
              <p>u effing Noah, better finish building your poor old ship and get ready to sail, before your Daddy (aka "God") drowns you together with the entire village.</p>

              <p>Only 25 yrs old and think there's no need for $$ because cannot bring $$ to grave. Question is, given no freak accidents, how long will you take to go to your grave? Want to be healthy and live long, you also need $$ to eat and pay bills for that long.</p>

              <p>actually, i used to be quite hardworking one, but then these few years, started to take life slower and slower, and i started subscribing to the concept of "<em>take life slowly, easily, money not important as long as enough to survive, just be happy and don't care about other things including others' achivement</em>".</p>
              <p>due to this mentality, now i very slack sia.....want to be hardworking also quite hard.</p>
              <p>i'm trying lah, but need to have something meaningful to do before i will work hard.</p>
              <p>see those high-flyers, they all got something they want to do badly, so they can work 22 hours per day, 1 hour eat and 1 hour wanking in public toilet.<br><br><br><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">(cassie)</span><br>instead of "swatting flies and thinking of gals" during office hours, how about learning or studying something?<br></strong></p>
              <p>not sure what to study also......IT sucks and accounting is worse than ****.</p>
              <p>otherwise, i won't be here liao (i'll probably be sitting in big office with hot OL sitting on my laps daily).</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>my guess is he's still staying with parents, no need to pay rental or mortage (parents' house wat), no need to worry abt food (mother got cook lor), no need to spend on entertainment (no friends to hang out mah)... if i were him, i also no need to worry abt$$ lah... worse come to worse can still open mouth ask lao pei lao bu wat...<br></strong></p>
              <p>that's true.....i live with my parents and they cover everything for me.</p>
              <p>i only need to give S$170 home allowance. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>however, though, i never use a single-cent from my parent to buy my own stuff, though.</p>
              <p>if go lunch dinner or anything, i also pay myself cos' don't wanna spend their $$$.</p>
              <p>they pay for the water and electricity bills for me, though.</p>
              <p><br><strong>eagle, ppl oledi cannot find friends, u want him to find rich gf?! dun ask so much lah....<br></strong><br>at my current state, i not ready to have gf lah.....</p>
              <p>need to get my life in order first, otherwise even if really can get one, she also won't be secure with me and live in uncertainty everyday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>now my main problem is to find something that's worth my time doing and then go 100% into it. my life has no goal or aim which is why i'm drifting like that.</p>
              <p>if got goal, then all these no-friend problem, no-gf problem, low salary problem will all be solved liao. if someone ask me what's my main aim in life, i also dunno what to say.</p>
              <p>btw, i'm not those lazy types ok.....i used to work in shipbuilding company the whole day without even slacking and did plenty of OT and didn't even complain (though the nature of the job sucks).</p>
