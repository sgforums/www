              <p>Well, there are many ways to describe this. Calling it an act of war is just at the extreme scale, and yes, it is highly probable because the security of our water supply is a strategic matter for Singapore.</p>

              <p>I was doing my NS between 2002 and 2005, completed BMT somewhere in September, 02' and was posted to STTS at Sembawang temporarily. To be exact; CBT (Computer Base Training) Room as a computer technician before i was transfered to OETI as a technician.</p>
              <p>Those who served NS during the same time as me would know that Singapore "nearly" went to war with Malaysia in late 2002. We were told one morning that we are on "orange" alert in preparation for war and tanks have already been sent and stationed around the causeway. "red" would mean war... i think... army camps around Sembawang and Woodlands were already on standby and soldiers, tanks are to cross over the bridge in the event of war... If i remember correctly, the reason was Malaysia threatened to turn of the water supply and infringe the contract between the 2 countries. I believe Dr. Mahathir was still at the helm as he was Prime Minister from 1981 till 2003...</p>
              <p>We were ordered not to disclose this to anyone including our family but to be prepared for war with supplies trunks and vehicles were filled up. STTS was a logistic school so i think we had lots of food supplies packed in tonners. As STTS was not a stay-in camp, every morning when we book in, there will be a briefing from our direct superiors about the status and this persisted for almost 2 weeks... everyday, we were on "orange" alert until Malaysia came out and say they aren't cutting off our water supply and we will engage in dialogue to sort out the price.</p>
              <p>in summery, what TS had said wasn't exactly false about possibilities that Singapore will go to war in the event Malaysia turn off the tap but looking at their political situation right now, they won't be that silly to create more trouble for themselves when they are internal fighting now at this moment. Maybe the NSFs at this moment are bored when they aren't involve with any direct "action"... why not go play "paint ball"? it's fun, it's thrilling, it hurts like f**k when it hits you but you won't die from it. want to organise a Paint Ball outing?</p>

              <p>Hi guys. Just had a conversation with a few nsfs and ns-men. What the Ns-Men (ex nsfs) told me was quite disturbing, they all seemed to wish that Malaysia would turn off the water supply so that we in Singapore could have an excuse to invade them.</p>
              <p><br>These guys actually said "I really wish they would turn it off. I dare them to do it." I asked if they were joking, and they said they were very serious.</p>
              <p>Apparently, and this is the impression I got from them, SIngapore has made it clear that it will consider Malaysia switching off the taps to be an act of war. Is this true?</p>
              <p>If such talk had come from NSFs i would not be surprise, you're trained to be all garang and such. But it was the 26 year old uni students that were talking like this.</p>
              <p>So I'd just like to ask everyone here. Do most of you actually think like that? Like you wouldn't mind war with Malaysia over water, or you hope they would turn it off?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><br>Maybe you can ask those uni students to go to Malaysia and turn off the water to Singapore?</p>
              <p>Cos you can tell them I said this "I really wish they would turn it off. I dare them to do it."</p>
              <p>Ok? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This shows the education doesn't represent sensibility cos anybody can buy education, but they cannot buy or earn sensibility.</p>
              <p>They need to realise sensibility, so it's good that they can gain more sensibility after they have turned off the water in Malaysia.</p>
