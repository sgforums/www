              <p>I saw a police tentage at the ground floor today and it was
              obvious what happened.</p>
              <p>Anyway,I did witness a fall before.I was at home at that
              time,suddenly I heard someone screaming and then heard a loud boom
              downstairs...I went to the window to take a look and saw a man face
              up on the floor totally intact(thank goodness!) but obviously he
              was died.</p>
              <p>Seen pics of the aftermath of jumpers before
              and it's not neat.Imagine the head being split open and
              whats inside flowing out looks like strawberry jam. Luckily,I
              didnt see such things before.</p>

              <p>to me...seeing someone jump down a building means seeing the process of jumping or at least the falling.</p>

              <p>I've seen it. Once.</p>
              <p>I was rather young then. But still, old enough to know what 'jumping off' means. I think the incident happened in a shopping mall along Orchard (Ngee Ann City, if I'm not wrong). This man, with a few bottles of beer by his side, was sitting on the parapet between the third story corridor and oblivion. It was obvious he was drunk as he seemed to be muttering to nobody. There was a few police officers at the scene who seemed to do what you'd normally see on HK drama serials.</p>
              <p>The man (obviously, since he was drunk) took no heed and suddenly toppled off the ledge. No audio accompanied the swift and quick plunge. However, there was this grotesque 'splat' sound when his head hit the floor (yes, he fell head-first). I actually witnessed the whole event.</p>
              <p>Blood began oozing out of his head area. I wasn't close enough to see if the skull had broken apart since I was standing on the second storey.</p>
              <p>It wasn't a terrifying experience since it's not really as gore as I'd had thought it would be. Someone once told me that people usually die before they hit the ground. I think it's because while during free-fall, there is an opportunity for the spine to break, therefore killing you.</p>
              <p>Thats it. My little not-so-terrible recount.</p>

              <p>I havent. And dont want to either. Original poster, you say it without any empathy.

              <p>  I seen my first dead body from jumping once when i was in my early teens . I was going to market for my breakfast with my bro when we saw a police cordon along the way at one of the blocks . Being curious n kaypo we went to have a look only to see a body which was already covered by police canvas but apparently the head was hit by the kerb in the void deck and the upper quarter of the skull was split open cleanly . exposing the brain matter which had turned orange colour already and the hair still sticking to the skull was seen further above the brain in the void deck . By the way , the body belongs to a tamil girl/lady .</p>
              <p>    Second time was when i was going to work and i saw an old mans body lying in the drain with his wallet inside his trouser pocket . And the police was asking a man i think reported the death , and again being curious n kaypoh agn i stick ard 5 mins more to try and see if i could get anymore " information " . But in the end i couldn't see much then i left but not without calling my mum abt it and ask if she want to see anot :P . I heard my mum telling me a few days later that this man has alot of sickness for many years liao . And we presumed that he puposely wanted to end it all in one shot . Sigh !!! Anyway years later when i was helping my friends medium temple , the got chided me for watching n kaypohing ard the old mans body . The god told me that the old man was very unhappy abt it . So next time i see such things , the god ask me to ignore and walk away to do whatever i have in mind because they also have their own " journey " to go .</p>

              <p>i wintness a suicide be4 with my dad at age 10 or 11 cant remember my age as its past 20 years</p>
              <p>i was watching some SONGKA going on opp below my void deck with my dad, its the last day for the SONGKA thuse early in the morning they blast the music very loud</p>
              <p>as we were watching from our 4th floor we saw a woman opp us at 5th floor, she was walking slowing towards the center of the level and then she face us ( not sure if she notice us watching her) and then suddenly she rise up (climbing on something) and very fast her body lean over the wall and just stright down she goes. its was a very fast moment. and land her head into the drain. her head hit the drain and spilt. the sigh was very gross and my dad and i was too stund to do anything or say anything.</p>
              <p>this shock the group of ppl  below. as he body lay beside the SONGKA. 1 of the old woman rush out and cry madly....... its really sad to see how sad she was crying for her daughter.</p>
              <p>later that day many rumour come out " some say the the death spirit below got into her body and jump' and etc . u know chinese ppl always very superstition 1.</p>
              <p>(though its was 20 years ago but this is something i never forget.)</p>
