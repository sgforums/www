            <div class='col-md body'>A few years ago when I was living in Bedok North, at Ave 1, I used to go to Bedok Reservoir Park to jog. On the way there, I would pass a field beside Blk 716. On most of the evenings then, there would be a soccer match. The two teams would consist of a motley of players, from katek 8 year olds to lanky teenagers. One team bare bodied, the other with T-shirt of various brands and colours. They would play noisily without a referee. The older players would shout instructions, encouragements, and taunts to the lesser experienced younger player. It was a noisy affair with lots of cajoling. Along the side of the field is a footpath. This would be lined with the Â“spectatorsÂ”. The spectators would be grandmas and maids feeding their charges, or brothers and sisters of the players, and generally elderly residents from flats around the area. Some, walking their dogs. Some just gather to talk with their neighbours. The football match their magnet. The scene always fills me with gladness. A modern day kampong atmosphere in Singapore!<br>I have since moved, and do not pass there anymore.<br><br>Last week, I decided to walk from Bedok Interchange to Bedok Reservoir, just for old times sake, passing through my old neighbourhood. It was getting to be 6 p.m. and I was hoping that there would be a football match at the field. There was not. There was silence. There was stillness. There was no one there. The field. The sight of the field shocked me. It is fenced up. The green chain-linked fence is two meter high, and the gate at the corner is padlocked. Why? The field is not in pristine condition. There are bald patches around the goal area. The grass is not properly trimmed. So the fence cannot be for protecting an upgraded and repaired field.<br><br>Why the fence?<br>I cannot understand.<br>Could the perennial excuse be: complaints, gang fights, Â“to better serve the residentsÂ”, to improve the standard of football in Singapore.???<br><br>Recently in the papers are reports of some town councils putting nails and barbed wires on the walls of the void deck to deter children playing with soccer balls there. The wonder of wonders<br></div>
