            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I'm a He...Every now and then I'll just start to feel really lost and guilt-ridden. She's right, I'd never showed her as much concern as she showed to me, and even at that, she'd never left my side one bit. I made a horrible mistake, wrecked my life and hers along as well. Time heals wounds, but scars remain. The memories are painful, but nevertheless invaluable. I know we can never get back together, and things will never be the same again. But hopes still stubbornly remains. I feel like a book with missing pages, an eerie emptiness within. I can never apologize enough, but hope that she can one day forgive me.<br><br>I wasn't expecting replies, but I'm glad there are people listening. Thanks prodigal.<br><br>------------------<br>Living in the darkest of memories, a lonesome howl echoes through the night, fulfilling the senses, depriving the soul.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi CyberNut,<br><br>Well, you sounded that if you were in my situation once. I guess, it is so similar that I can find a 1-1 mapping (maybe different circumstances). Well, I suppose that at the end of the day, I can only tell you that she's gone and you are still here, and so you have to move on. It is not the best thing to do, but the only necessary thing to do. Well, you can only give yourself Hell if you cannot forgive yourself. That is what happens to people most of the time. Just let time do the healing then.<br><br>Though I am no longer in contact with my ex-gfs, I still sent them birthday cards (just did that last week since their birthdays happen to be on the same week) to tell them that I still remembered them and feel concern for them, wonder how they are now, and part of them would always be in my heart, no matter whether whoever was in the wrong in the first place.<br><br>Since reminiscence and nostalgia are only for that week, now things are getting back to normal for me, and I think you can do that as well...<br><br>You are welcome, and do cheer up...<br><br>Take care and have a nice day...</div>
