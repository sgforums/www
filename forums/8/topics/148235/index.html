Most of us live in GRCs which are walk-overs in every election and GRCs are not getting any smaller. The next few GE sure walk-over one. So, for most of us, the last time we voted was in 1993 and even if the 2011 Presidential election is contested, we would have been able to only vote once in 18 years! If that is contested...I dun think so...<br><br>As the government says, if they are really unpopular, no matter how big the GRCs become, people would still come out to contest. Since the feelings of the people is to keep the government in power and yet desire to have a few opposition MPs or independent President to check on the government, then this is the result we can expect to see in the next few years. This is the package we are being sold. Its a case of just take-it-or-leave it.<br><br>At least we are able to vote for upgrading, "jui dui superstar" and the top 10 most popular actor and actress every year  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Think of it this way: if all the flats in Singapore are worth 1 billion dollars, are you richer than your neighbour in terms of flat value? NO.<br><br>The ones who are truely better "valued off your property upgrading" are the relevant upgrading servicers like HDB, gov, maybe even the contracters.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sigh... How many of us want that guy or rather dun mind that guy to be our President?  Regardless of how many (even if it is zero), the issue is, we don't have any other choice.    My friend asked me is it because we don't have the good enough ppl to run for election.  Well, my answer is : the smart and capable ones will stay out of this.  They know where is the better place to stay.  In Singapore, the only thing we should focus on is make money for ourselves.  Politics... leave it to those who are already in power.  We can't change or control them.  Neither should we let them change our lifestyle.  We should just draw a clear line between lay people and gahmen.</div>
