            <div class='col-md body'>The ghost, correct terminology being "psychotic post mortem", or the human mind that becomes psychologically disturbed after death, being in a self-created state of confusion or psychological pain, due to similar patterns heavily present in the psyche at the time of death, or in the life of the individual, while he/she was alive.<br><br>Such psychotic post mortems need compassion and help (instead of fear! Do *NOT* fear them! That won't help them!), and are often vibrationally and psychologically beyond the reach of the guides &amp; helpers directly. That is to say, the assistance of intraphysical human incarnates is needed, to act as an intermediary for the guides &amp; helpers to contact, assist and free the psychotic post mortem ('ghost').<br><br>Such lightwork, is the focus of the "Out-Of-Body Ministry" or "Soul Retrieval" healing work, that is carried out by many individuals and groups, one of such are the individuals affiliated with Bruce Moen's work, ie. carrying out Soul Retrievals along the lines as conceptualized by researcher and author Bruce Moen - <a href="http://www.afterlife-knowledge.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.afterlife-knowledge.com</a><br><br>The International Academy of Consciousness also have their own methods for retrieval, deintrusion and healing, under the broad heading of "ConscientioTherapy" - <a href="http://www.iacworld.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.iacworld.org</a><br><br>From Hilarion's Spring Equinox 2002 Channeling :<br><a href="http://infinity.hispeed.com/Heart.Of.God/Hilarion/speq02.html" rel="nofollow">http://infinity.hispeed.com/Heart.Of.God/Hilarion/speq02.html</a><br><br><strong>Unfortunately some of the answers that people receive when they open to such (non-physical, psychic) levels, when they do so unconsciously, the answers that they receive are somewhat negative. These are the energies of beings who donÂ’t know they have died, intruders, psychotic post-mortems, beings who struggle simply to know what is going on for them and so on, who will then unconsciously attach to others at the physical reality. To solve this takes education - more and more people simply being aware that this is happening. When you have a sense that something like this is going on for you or for people around you, the obvious thing is to raise the vibration. If the vibration at the physical level is that which is intolerable to such beings who need it to be dense, dark and difficult in order to continue in their place of ignorance, fear and struggle; then raise the vibration. Â“Oh,Â” you might ask, Â“but how?Â” There are many ways to do this of course and it isnÂ’t as if any one way is better than any other. YouÂ’re going to find the ones that are suitable for you by asking.<br><br>Sometimes it is very important to speak to that being and it is easier than you think. Oh yes, the person that youÂ’re with is going to deny all of it and you are going to feel embarrassed about speaking to somebody who is non-physical. But you can always take them aside for a moment. You go into the bathroom, you excuse yourself saying, Â“You know I need to go talk to myself in the bathroom for a few minutes,Â” and do so in an intriguing way and you know that being is going to follow you. They are quite curious just as the curiosity might be aroused in anyone who would hear such words. It isnÂ’t as if itÂ’s going to be a big commitment. The being is going to be away from its host for maybe a matter of a minute or two, and then what you say is what you feel. If you are sensing that such a being is indeed a psychotic post-mortem, a being that has died that doesnÂ’t know he has died, tell him he is dead. That is the obvious thing. He has been hearing it from a lot of non-physicals, a lot of beings, his relatives, helpers and others. Of course he doesnÂ’t believe them, because nobody he is attached to at the physical world says he is dead. And so your word has tremendous weight in this regard. Indeed the individual Edith Fiore in her book, The Unquiet Dead, deals with this very specific plan of action in which you address the individual and you tell that being whatÂ’s going on and you tell it also to recognize whatÂ’s happening, to wake up, to be then surrounded by beings of light and benefit and go towards them and receive that energy. When you come out of the bathroom of course, your friend wonÂ’t know why but he feels a lot better. However, you havenÂ’t solved anything really because if that individual is attracting such beings because of a darkness, a difficulty, some aspect within himself that is leaking energy of a darker nature, then of course he will attract another psychotic post-mortem at some point in the future, and youÂ’ll have to pay the timely visit to his bathroom again.<br><br>However, education in this regard is of tremendous value. It is where you speak about such matters, where you investigate them, where you learn about them. If the individual then changes his or her vibration, then it is not going to be so easy for attachment to take place. And this is another important technique (IIPC's Vibrational State technique), and this you can teach.</strong><br><br>For more info, see my website :<br><a href="http://infinity.hispeed.com/Heart.Of.God/main.htm" rel="nofollow">http://infinity.hispeed.com/Heart.Of.God/main.htm</a></div>
