            <div class='col-md body'>I have liked a gal very much three years ago.  I went for her but she has rejected me.  I was dissappointed and became to have very low self esteem.  She told me that I was bad looking and fat and she cannot accept guys like this.<br><br>I admit I was really very fat back then and to tell you a secret I weighed more than 120kg and I am standing at 181cm.  I was really fat.  I thought I will not be able to find any one special in mylife as I am in my sorry state because I know most gals goes for looks.  So two years back I went on a dieting routine and I visited the gym four to fives times a week and train real hard for an hour or more.<br><br>Over these two and a half years , I have lost quite a lot of weight and after all those commitment exercises now I weigh about 79kg and no kidding I have a body now in which all guys go for (broad shoulders,veiny arms, washboard stomachs...etc), V shaped  body .<br><br>Then recently I have happened to meet up the girl again whom I have liked very much last time.  She couldn't recognise me initially but later we exchange contacts.  I still like her very much deep down inside.<br><br>After a couple of outings together, she finally told me that she like me a lot.  Now I don't know why I hestitated bring myself to accept her into my life not because I am proud because I never am proud.  Now constantly my mind will always tell me that she goes for looks..and not real love.<br><br>So brothers and sisters out there, do give me some advise.  I am lost.  Please help!!!!</div>

She may be particular about looks in the past, but 2 and a half years is not short to a teenager or someone in the early 20s. Her character and perceptions may have changed.

            <div class='col-md body'>You can try going out with her and try to notice if they is any change in her thinking as maybe after all these years ,she has matured,but of cause,the possibility is always there that she like you for your looks only,so i guess only you can tell after getting to know her better whether she has truly changed or is still the same person you knew years ago,but make sure you have all the necessary information you need as this is quite a serious decision and the outcome of your decision is going to impact your life in years to come, <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">))</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, matters of the heart are normally easy to solve, but they just seem so damn difficult at times. There are 2 approaches - one to analyze it; second, just follow your heart.<br><br>Well, first of all, do you know her at all? You say you like her alot. But the thing is do you really know her? You have to ask yourself that.<br><br>Next, maybe you might want to continue to be friends with her, just to get to know her better, like what some of them had suggested.<br><br>Do you know any of her friends? Maybe you may want to ask their opinions about her? I mean not just ask directly, but I'm sure you know how to do it subtly, rite? You might want to get a second or third opinion about that girl, since I'm sure you're blinded by your infatuation and your judgement is clouded.<br><br>If you want to follow your heart, then, you may want to give both of you a chance. Afterall, you deserve it. But bewarn, if she is really bad, then you will not notice it or you might but you will choose to ignore it. This will eventually turn love to hatred. A tragedy, but nevertheless, it happens.<br><br>On the other, things might turn out well. Afterall, no one is perfect and everyone deserves a second chance.<br><br>For me, if I truly love someone, I'm prepare to risk it all. Afterall, you only live once.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think you need to reconsider accepting her. Why didn't she accept you when you were in your sorry state, so to say. If she's real serious about you, she would have accepted you long ago, instead of doing so when you've trained up and become muscular. It's very obvious that she goes for someone with looks.<br><br>I have a friend who had had an incident that proves that most, and I mean most, girls go for guys with looks. My friend is rather handsome, except that he grows up in a very strict family, thus having very tradition thinking. He's also not very fashionable, but still presentable. While working as a part-timer, he met this ger called Q. Q began to keep a lookout for my friend. Then Q's friend came over and told my friend that Q is interested in him. He too had had some feelings for her and so hey began dating for maybe a week. After a few dates, Q found out that he's not the kind of guy that she wants. In terms of looks, yes, my friend has it. However, in terms of character and fashion sense, he's a little backwards. So, Q, without saying a reason or anything, left my friend. She simply disappear from his life. He was devastated, but he remained gentlemanly. On Q's birthday, he tried calling her handphone, but she did not have the guts to pick up the phone. How rude that was! My friend meant well, but Q just ignored the call.<br><br>What I have to offer are all these. It's still up to you if you still want to be together with that girl. We can only offer you ideas and comments, but the ultimate decision lies in you.</div>
