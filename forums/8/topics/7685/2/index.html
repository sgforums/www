            <div class='col-md body'>Ah yes, look some heated discussion over here.  Hmmm.....smoking do harms, there is no denial to it, but come to think of it cigarrettes are invented by humans, so are cars, chemical factories, forest fires, guns etc.  All this are invented by humans and they are causing the destruction of the earth and the human race itself, killing ppl one by one.  What does this show, in order to make all this things, human have to learn to make this thing, thus making them more clever as time goes by, which come to show that human brain evolve to become more clever, coming up with more innovative things, more intelligent things, all these may one day wipe out all the humans.<br><br>So you can see that HUMAN EVOLVE TO DIE !!!<br>We will die somehow, whether through smoking or other factors out there.  So what's the point of blaming those smokers out there.<br>We will be gone in maybe another 1milliom yrs who knows.  So there is no point in blaming others for what they do.  So why dun you blame ppl for discovering electricity, there are cases of people being electrocuted to death. Why dun you blame people for inventing aeroplanes ? Air crashes are being reported all over the world.  Why blame other people for their actions, there is no point in doing that.  You may blame the pilot for causing the air crashes, why dun you go and blame wright brothers for inventing the plane, then you can say all this would not have happen.<br><br>Just face it!! HUMAN EVOLVE TO DIE !!<br><br></div>

Get the real stuff like hard drugs, sure super shiok. and since we're all going to die anyway, it dun matter if its from cigarettes or heroin.<br><br>BTW, has anybody any idea how painful it is to die from cancer, both for u n ur loved ones? maybe when it happens to u then u'll understand.<br><br></div>

Government get to earn from it and in the end the citizens benefits from the high amount of tax collected from it.  So what about exercise to keep you awake, it is also temporary.  As you can see smokers or non-smokers have to die anyway, it is just a matter of time.  So why bother whether smoking harms or does not.  Eventually everyone have to lay in the cemetary or seat on an altar.  Looking down on smokers does not mean that you would not die from smoking related problems, staying away from them also does not mean you will not die from smoking related problems.  Eating also cause cancer, barbecue food also cause cancer, inhaling exhaust fume also cause cancer, does that mean that you are not going to take a bus or car to work or school.<br><br>You smoke !
