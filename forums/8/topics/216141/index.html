            <div class='col-md body'>My friend told me there's yet another suicide by someone jumping down the MRT track, but when I brought the straits times for the news, there's nothing inside. Instead its all about singapore's economy growing strongly with more than 97% gainfully employed and people are snapping up all the latest condo projects.<br><br>My friend said the man was suffering from depression due to job loss and financial problems. According by him, the family of 4 (parents + 2 kids) owe school fees and utilities for a few months. How can that be true in singapore? If it is, then it must be a very rare case as our government is very rich. We send many civil servants for overseas scholarship and some for training every year. We also offer sponsorship for outstanding foreigners and that is easily a few years school fees and utilities.<br><br>I don't really trust my friend as jobs are aplenty in singapore. Only choosy employees and unemployment in singapore was history.<br><br><blockquote>Oct 18, 2006, 8.31 pm (Singapore time)<br>Strong response to public flats sold by private developer<br><br>THE first batch of condominium-like public flats put on sale by a private developer has received an overwhelming response, with more than 5,700 people applying for just 616 units.<br><br>Indeed, 45,600 people - attracted by such features as built-in wardrobes, air-conditioning units and generous bay windows - had viewed The Premiere@Tampines' show-flat.<br><br>The two-week application period close at midnight.<br><br>While it is possible that not all of the flats - sold by ballot - will be taken up eventually, analysts and property agents expect nearly all units to be sold.<br><br>There are eight 17-storey blocks in the project.<br><br>The sale is being closely watched by the Housing Board, which had said previously that the response to this project will determine if more land will be released for future projects.<br><br>The Premiere is an experiment by the Government to give private developers a greater role in public housing. Sim Lian Land, which clinched the plot earlier this year through a tender, was given a free hand over the design, building and pricing of the flats.<br><br>But it had to meet certain conditions for public housing. Thus, the flats must be sold only to family units, the ethnic quota must be maintained and buyers' household income had to be $8,000 a month or below.<br><br>However, individuals who have bought a flat directly from the HDB before do not need to pay a resale levy when they buy a unit there.<br><br>And, like HDB flats, units at The Premiere can be bought with Government housing grants for first-timers.<br><br>The 616 two-, four- and five-room units were priced from $138,000 to $450,000. Most are five-room units, ranging from 105 sq m to 114 sq m and fetching a median price of $370,000 to $380,000.<br><br>The flats are expected to be ready by 2009.<br><br>According to Sim Lian's executive director, Ms Diana Kuik, about 60 per cent of the applicants were buying their first flat, while one-third of them are Tampines residents.<br><br>Ms Hilda Tan, 24, a sales manager, and her fiance, had been condo-hunting for about half a year. They were later drawn to The Premiere because it was located near Tampines town centre, and for its condo-like features.<br><br>Then there was Ms Rina Tan, 38, who would not have thought about changing homes had the Premiere not turned up. The accounts assistant, who lives just a stone's throw from the Premiere site, wants a four-room unit. But she worried that 'with so many applicants, my chances look slim'. </blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The donation for the family had grown to $300,000 and I am sure more than half of it must had came from our beloved government. As commiting suicide is very rare in singapore due to the statistic from the straits times, I urged everyone to donate if you are able to as it is not frequent you get this kind of news.<br><br>We are a developed country with first world life-style. Our HDB is constantly going through varies upgrading with cover walk-ways, lift-upgrading and study corners. Obscene third world proverty for the below average class citizens is extremely rare in singapore. We have jobs for those above 40s as professional cleaners, executive toilet-man, bus captain, self-employ taxi driver and kopitiam waiters.<br><br><blockquote>Dr. Ng Eng Hen said: "The question to ask is - are these good quality jobs. I would say that over the last ten years, our figures show us that 60 to 80 percent of our jobs created for Singaporeans were, if you like, middle class jobs, professionals, managers, executives and technicians, and Singaporeans have by their own conscious decisions moved towards these jobs."</blockquote>A very well-said piece by ministar DR Ng. Indeed our job sector is so over flow with vacancies that we had to import overseas <span style="color: red;">foreign talents in large numbers</span> to work. They usually don't cause pressure on wages to low income workers in singapore as jobs are aplenty here. By hiring them, they in turn create more middle class jobs for singaporeans.<br><br>In conclusion, he maybe is one delusive man and despite repeated reminders to stand behind the yellow line, he accidentally fell down.<br><br></div>
