            <div class='col-md body'>was visiting my gran in sgh today and my dad specifically warned me for the last time not to close my own life's options. (options as in jobs i wanna do in life,etc)<br><br>i knew what he meant so i asked him if he trying to make me do medical (which is too late) but he said no and i shld go marketing, sales and some other stuff he wanted but i didnt want to. i got tired of talking to him and i walked out of the room. my gran was sleeping already.<br><br>i mean, yes it's good that parents do take interest in their children's life and guide them in their options etc, esp at crossroads in life. but to wht extent i wonder. this topic of going biotech is an age-old and never-ending arguement between my dad and i.<br><br>he frequently scolded me and got into an arguement abt life's (my life's ) options when i said i didnt want to go into fields he sort of specified or wanted me to go, like medical, sales, marketing, research (biotech and pharmaceuticals like drug discovery)<br><br>frankly speaking, it appears to me, that all his supposedly advices are actually to 'undo' his lack of success in some of this endeavours.  maybe it's just me but the places i want to go are totally irrelevant to his so-called ideas and in some cases, in a different field.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there is a difference between closing off your options and actually being denied of it.<br><br>i suppose you are capable enough to explore each of those options as your dad suggested. perhaps you can try to find out more ?<br><br>IMHO, I believe one can only do well if he/she is passionate about the things they do. If they step into an industry 'just becoz dad said so' or 'everyone said its good money' then you guys are in it for the wrong reason.<br><br>Sad to say, look at the IT industry now. Too many IT monkeys and too little real professionals. This is a real result of 'following the crowd'.<br><br>Trust me, next will be the biotech industry. just as before the IT one, the enginners, the Lawyers and the doctors before.<br><br>think of what you want to do and do you see yourself doing it in 20 years time?<br><br>if so, go for it.<br><br>while you still can. because everyone is out there fighting for the same piece of pie. as you age, you may realise your options are getting lesser. and thats a fact.<br></div>
