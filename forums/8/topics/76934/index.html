The donations will be used to help poor students to buy textbooks, give them pocket money to have meals and so on. And 100% of your money goes to them cos the charity organization is run by VOLUNTEERS, not like NKF's highly paid "SLAVES".<br><br>I'll rather watch movie than let NKF use it to build some 'gold-plated' taps in CEO's toilet.

I believe more of each dollar shld go to them not just 52 cents? The admin and etc charges shld go down to say 10 - 20 cents so that more cents of each dollar will go to the patients. Main aim is to benefit the patients not to make the ppl in charge comfortable and luxury!!!</div></blockquote>The standard guideline set by govt is only up 30% go to admin and other expenses.   Anything more than that is against the law</div>
