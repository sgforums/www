            <div class='col-md body'>Here I go again, putting on my thinking cap, ok time is the topic...<br><br>Time is define by me as a moment. At the correct time, you should od the correct things. And at certain time, certain things will happen. There is a time for everything, we often here this saying, and how true I think it is.<br><br>There is a time for eating, and a time for sleeping, there is a time to play, a time to work and a time to play, a time to consolidate, a time to expand, a time to flirt(like when I 'm with the gals) and a time to be serious(like now). To do the correct thing at the correct time will be to be able to grasp the moment. And when you grasp the moment you can create a impact, you become a master of your own time.<br><br>Taking advantage of time? Nah... I prefer to look at it as co-operating with time, time can be a friend if you know how to make it so. Time can be a great pal. To understand time, you experience life, you gain life experiences, the more experiences you have the better your knowledge of time. e.g. You know when to keep your mouth shut and when to talk out loud, that comes with experience.<br><br>Create time for yourself? How to do that? I know a few who do, and they are all fine people, E.g. YOu know that rather than sleeping away on a journey while you are not tired at all, you can make time by reading to gain knowledge, also say you are serving NS, and you still dun want to waste your time, take up courses on weekends and all that to make more time for yourself. Sub-consiciously, we all make more time for ourself, people who disrupts from Na to study so that they will not have to waste one year doing nothing.<br><br>There are also People who create opportunities for themselves. These people make time comes to them, they make things happen. Simply put they do not wait for time, they chase ater time.<br><br>All in all, time is what you make of it, and whether or not you can become a master of it, is just a matter of applying logic to your life.<br><br>Tet:<br>You can have all the time with me...<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 + $0.03(from Lex) worth</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Time is money!<br><br>Try to picture this scenario of what I mean by time is money.   A minute ago you have this one share that was worth $1.95 per share.  You were not too sure if you should sell it or if you should hang on to it hoping that it could go up further.  So, you decided to take the bet by hanging on to it.  A minute after you check the online real time trading on the computer to find out that it's now only worth $1.60 per share.  You have just lost $0.35 per share in a minute.  Imagine you have 10,000 shares; that translates into $3,500 in lost profit in just a short 60 seconds of misjudgement.  You curse yourself and regretting why you did not sell it at that time.  So, time is money.  In fact, it's more like greed is endless!!!!<br><br>[This message has been edited by Money &amp;Power (edited 23 February 2000).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by Money &amp;Power (edited 23 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>VRT:<br><br>Hi, In case u might have misread, misunderstood or offended, i would like to interpret it:<br><br>Ur Q: Maybe "we" really have too much time in our lives to do lotsa stupid things. Wadya think?<br><br>My reply is also refering to "we", pple in general, tends to do all that i've mention, &amp; not directed at u.<br><br>Ur 2nd Quote: If we really use our TIME in more worthwhile cases, we will deserve more time in our lives,&amp; we will get it.<br><br>My reply means even if we wants to have more time, literally(extending ur life..) coz we do good deeds(deserved it), we might not be able to get it(can't find it coz death custom dun exist). As our lifetime on earth is not up to us to decide, we only feel better, with good deeds, might be able to live longer but how true, nobody knows.(let's not talk about religious point of view)<br><br>As for FREE, I believe it's only basic courtesy to reply if someone wants to talk to u, or ask u some Q., so as to make it interactive &amp; i will make an effort to chat with anybody even if they didn't talk to me. Just that sometimes i prefer to add jokes so as not to make it sounds so serious. It's already a rat-race out there, so over the virtual world, we can laugh &amp; take most things with a pinch of salt.<br><br>I know it's quite long but i rather make frds than otherwise. OK? Accept ? ok lah!!!<br></div>
