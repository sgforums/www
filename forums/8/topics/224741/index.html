Say, if she already has a few siblings who are staying around her parents and your parents have none, then she should stay near your parents.<br><br>Its only a matter of time that parents will get too old and its time to look after them. So practically speaking, every parent should have a kid nearby, and parents who are unable to take care of themselves should have a kid staying with them.</div>

Between the couple, between the couple are their parents and between parents of both sides.<br><br>I learnt that when practicality meets tradition, that's when all hell breaks loose. Listen to what she has to say, but always remember that all the choices you make now, such as the location of the flat, the amount of money u spend etc, the amount of compromise both of you make, have an impact on you later.</div>

Both can have their own lives. Both can have extra money to spend on themselves without depending on the other. Couples don't see each other so often, it increases the longingness.<br><br>People becomes quite cranky after staying at home for too long. The mind starts wondering and thinking funny things.

Do not over-commit, or be too stretched.  This is a common mistake many young people make.  Paying a flat over 20-30 years is a long time, i am sure you do not want to live under that kind of stress for the rest of your life.  I do not know 2700 can afford how much loan repayment a month, you have to work out your sums.<br><br>Plus, when the baby comes, your expenses will increase again, so, dont be too stretched on your finance.</div>
