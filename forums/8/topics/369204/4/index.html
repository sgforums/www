              <p>Yeah but like you say lah, it's pretty much as it is. The only way up is if you end up starting your own IT company so you become a manager. Otherwise it's just eng for awhile, fix shit or awhile, eng, fix, eng, fix until you die or change career paths.</p>

              <p>actually, you're spot-on regarding my cousin's job.</p>
              <p>he's working in an American software MNC here (not Microsoft,
              though), and is mainly in charge of fixing and debugging the
              software's bugs / glitches, and i think he also do a bit of IT
              maintenance sai-kang + daily software builds, that's why work so
              late.</p>
              <p>as for 3D animation, i don't feel like going into that field
              after reading some 3D animation books in the library yesterday.
              actually, to use 3D animation software to create a decent object,
              you don't really need to know 3D math stuff.</p>
              <p>however, to become a 3D professional animator good enough to be
              hired by companies, 3D math is a must. And btw, these 3D math stuff
              are MORE DIFFICULT than any JC-level maths i've ever seen. It's
              more like computer-science level type of maths....or should i say,
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>only those guys with PhD in Mathematics can understand.</strong></span></p>
              <p>it's very scary for guys like me who can't even do some primary
              4 maths. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>
              <p>and poly courses, for their part-time courses, they offer only
              advanced and specialist diplomas (the specialist diplomas require a
              local poly diploma in any discipline.......i look at their course
              sypnosis and could tell at one glance i won't have a problem
              understanding them but these guys refuse to listen to me).
              <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>if that AEC is S$5000 and not S$1000, i'm going to look for
              alternatives, although those specialized certificate courses like
              Photoshop CS 3 / Flash MX are so damn short (like 48 hours etc) and
              u can't learn anything from those.</p>

              <p>actually, you're spot-on regarding my cousin's job.</p>
              <p>he's working in an American software MNC here (not Microsoft,
                  though), and is mainly in charge of fixing and debugging the
                  software's bugs / glitches, and i think he also do a bit of IT
                  maintenance sai-kang + daily software builds, that's why work so
                  late.</p>
              <p>as for 3D animation, i don't feel like going into that field
                  after reading some 3D animation books in the library yesterday.
                  actually, to use 3D animation software to create a decent object,
                  you don't really need to know 3D math stuff.</p>
              <p>however, to become a 3D professional animator good enough to be
                  hired by companies, 3D math is a must. And btw, these 3D math stuff
                  are MORE DIFFICULT than any JC-level maths i've ever seen. It's
                  more like computer-science level type of maths....or should i say,
                  only those guys with PhD in Mathematics can understand.</p>
              <p>it's very scary for guys like me who can't even do some primary
                  4 maths. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>
              <p>and poly courses, for their part-time courses, they offer only
                  advanced and specialist diplomas (the specialist diplomas require a
                  local poly diploma in any discipline.......i look at their course
                  sypnosis and could tell at one glance i won't have a problem
                  understanding them but these guys refuse to listen to me).
                  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>if that AEC is S$5000 and not S$1000, i'm going to look for
                  alternatives, although those specialized certificate courses like
                  Photoshop CS 3 / Flash MX are so damn short (like 48 hours etc) and
                  u can't learn anything from those.</p>

                  of data and some back-ups can only be done when computers not
                  running).</p>
              <p>2) have to upgrade entire company's PCs (if got 40 PCs and
                  company wants to upgrade RAM, then u die die must take apart 40
                  PCs, unscrew, put in RAM, screw back, test).</p>
              <p>3) if midnight / Chinese New Year / Christmas / weekend and your
                  colliks at Siloso beach have wild nude parties and frat orzies, and
                  the company's servers go down, then u die die must go back and fix
                  even until ok</p>
              <p>4) if colliks screw up their computers, u die die have to fix
                  and sometimes it's a virus attack etc, and u may need to spend 4 -
                  10 hours finding the mysterious thing. If really cannot, need to
                  format PC and this takes even longer</p>
              <p>5) if need to install software, then even lagi worse. Prepare to
                  burn all your weekends away and sign divorce papers cos' wife will
                  leave u for other guys like accountants and finance honchos

              <p>Lots to correct here.</p>
              <p>1. Not all IT jobs are like that, unless you end up working in the networking, server, database, BCT, etc fields. For small IT companies, if you are the support staff, you can't run away from this. It's your job. But for big companies, you probably have no chance of running into such trouble.</p>
              <p>2. It's part and parcel of IT. Old have to upgrade. Can't upgrade, either build or buy new one.</p>
              <p>3. That is you suay.</p>
              <p>4. It's also part and parcel of IT. Company didn't hire you to zou boh you know.</p>
              <p>5. Hello brother, there's something called automation. If I hire you to buy 40 XP CDs, 40 Office CDs so that you can install on all 40 PCs at one go, you might as well go home.</p>
              <p>Me no money to buy 40 XP CDs and 40 Office CDs and 40 of whatever software CDs.</p>
              <p>IT is there to help repetitive tasks. Put everything you need to install on a server, connect all these PCs to the server, set the first boot device to a network drive, configure the installation to run automatically, test to make sure they can detect the network drive and you're done.</p>
              <p>6. Part and parcel of any job.</p>

              <p>btw, i checked the website again and it says the next intake is
              in Jan 2010 and registration is in Oct 09. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>still a long time to wait and about 6 more mths to go....</p>
              <p>maybe i should consider other alternatives since i'm wasting my
              time if i wait so long. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>1. Registration needs time to process.</p>
              <p>2. Need to wait for previous batch classes to end, or at the least, cover around 75% so that the teachers don't burn out.</p>
              <p>3. Teachers need time to update some of the slightly old teaching materials.</p>
              <p>4. This time is for you to prepare, research more on the course you're planning to do.</p>
