              <p>1. Nothing is "not that hard to study". What makes it easy though, is your interest. IT and Science looks easy to me, because the interest is there. Once the motivation to learn is there, concepts are easily absorbed and learnt. The application may or may not be easily applied, but as long as you want to learn, you may find some concepts are easily applied.</p>
              <p>2. I find that SG is quite trendy in terms of jobs. There used to be a time where engineering and IT jobs are hot. Before the financial disaster, financial jobs are hot. At around the same time when the financial industry was booming, SG Science field is also opening up, and it's quite easy to get a job. Now, due to all those people wanting a hot job, certain fields jobs are not filled. IT, engineering and science are pretty steady because innovation and development is always needed. But none of these fields are very easy as you progress and you may find yourself asking stupid questions like "is it worth it" in 5 to 10 years' time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. That you have to ask yourself. There are so many things to study in this world, what in general interest you? HRM? Business? Science? Maths? Languages? History? Geography? Art? Music? IT? Engineering? Accounting? Etc... To list them it would be endless, but for certain, if you would definitely study a couple subjects that you won't like to be more well-rounded. Bear in mind also, some courses are not available in Singapore and are found only overseas.</p>
              <p>4. LOL... unfortunately quite a lot of fields are dominated by either males or females.</p>
              <p>Don't know anything about interior design.</p>
              <p>Multimedia - it's going to be a big field. Which area are you you interested in?</p>
              <p>Business computing - mixture of IT and business.</p>
              <p>Both multimedia and business computing courses can be found in local polytechnics.</p>

              financial disaster, financial jobs are hot. At around the same time
              when the financial industry was booming, SG Science field is also
              opening up, and it's quite easy to get a job. Now, due to all those
              people wanting a hot job, certain fields jobs are not filled. IT,
              engineering and science are pretty steady because innovation and
              development is always needed. But none of these fields are very
              easy as you progress and you may find yourself asking stupid
              questions like "is it worth it" in 5 to 10 years' time.</p>
              <p>Don't know anything about interior design.</p>
              <p>Multimedia - it's going to be a big field. Which area are you
              you interested in?</p>
              <p>Business computing - mixture of IT and business.</p>
              <p>Both multimedia and business computing courses can be found in
              local polytechnics.</p>

              <p>2) yeah, SG moves quite fast in terms of job "trendiness" and "fads".</p>
              <p>however, getting an IT job (programming or IT guy fixing office computers etc.) is the last thing i'll ever do, because as far as i know, IT guys tend to need to work very late into the night. My cousin who got BSc in Computer Science now works from <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>9 AM to 1 AM</strong></span> (yes, 1 AM, no typo) from Mon - Fri. Can u imagine??!!!</p>
              <p>btw, i read from some posts here that you work in IT field? if that's the case, do u happen to know if digital animation industry here got any future? i'm thinking of learning general multimedia first and then specialize in Flash etc.</p>
              <p>i've seen 3D animation books but it seems that you need to know computer science and have at least a BSc in Maths before you can be good in 3D animation (due to the maths required in those 3D environment etc). My maths fail big time, btw.</p>
              <p>also, i can only attend part-time courses now, not full-time.</p>
              <p>polys here got offer some part-time courses which are quite good, but those <em>&lt;insert most foul word here&gt;</em> don't accept me cos' i've no poly diploma. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>It depends on what IT job you get. Most IT jobs have a stable timing, but <strong>passionate</strong> IT people can go on doing the job without rest, or with just a few hours of rest.</p>

              <p>Somehow I feel our advice is irrelevant. You want an interesting course, to improve yourself so you can jump into that career path so you can get more 'face' and not be embarassed about it.</p>
              <p>Why the fuck for?</p>
              <p>I haven't found anything about "what I want to do" or "what are my interests" within the 3 pages. Maybe I overlooked.</p>
              <p>As far as you can pick up from the advice people give you, it will only work if you are interested and willing to know. Not trying to find out more of one thing just so you can weigh which one gives you more 'face'. I won't say money cause, why do we work in the first place?</p>
              <p>And we're here giving you advice cause we believe you are interested in firstly, improving yourself. Not trying to find a course to suit your needs. By needs I mean not having to work for it, hoping for it to be easy, something that you'll be interested in (which I highlighted earlier) and girl &gt; boy ratio in a course?</p>
              <p>I suggest you wake up your idea.</p>
              <p>Don't do something just because it's interesting, do it because your interested in the damn thing.</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>

              <p>PS: This would probably be the last time I'll try to post anything constructive in relevance to anything you post anymore. Because from all your posts, ever since you started posting makes me want to strangle you.</p>

              <p>actually, you're spot-on regarding my cousin's job.</p>
              <p>he's working in an American software MNC here (not Microsoft, though), and is mainly in charge of fixing and debugging the software's bugs / glitches, and i think he also do a bit of IT maintenance sai-kang + daily software builds, that's why work so late.</p>
              <p>as for 3D animation, i don't feel like going into that field after reading some 3D animation books in the library yesterday. actually, to use 3D animation software to create a decent object, you don't really need to know 3D math stuff.</p>
              <p>however, to become a 3D professional animator good enough to be hired by companies, 3D math is a must. And btw, these 3D math stuff are MORE DIFFICULT than any JC-level maths i've ever seen. It's more like computer-science level type of maths....or should i say, only those guys with PhD in Mathematics can understand.</p>
              <p>it's very scary for guys like me who can't even do some primary 4 maths. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>
              <p>and poly courses, for their part-time courses, they offer only advanced and specialist diplomas (the specialist diplomas require a local poly diploma in any discipline.......i look at their course sypnosis and could tell at one glance i won't have a problem understanding them but these guys refuse to listen to me). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>if that AEC is S$5000 and not S$1000, i'm going to look for alternatives, although those specialized certificate courses like Photoshop CS 3 / Flash MX are so damn short (like 48 hours etc) and u can't learn anything from those.</p>

              <p>ok lah, maybe i didn't word my posts properly, but i really want
                  to improve myself and my career which is why i'm posting this stuff
                  here.</p>
              <p>the girl part is good, but that's a bonus if the course happens
                  to have more girls than guys.</p>
              <p>for the past 4.5 years ever since i ORD, i've been doing admin
                  job and i hate every min of it. i knew i was wasting my time but i
                  refuse to move. Now that i think back, i really have been wasting
                  every single min of my life during these 4.5 years.</p>
              <p>I WANT CHANGE!!!!!!!! Yes we can, Yes we can! (slogan copyright
                  of Barack Obama)</p>
              <p>among all the fields out there, i'm most interested in
                  computing-related.</p>
              <p>last week i force myself to sign-up for ither the shipping
                  management course (logistics) and Human Resource Management, but
                  when i look at their course details, i really want to throw up and
                  in the end, i didn't sign up.</p>
              <p>thank god i didn't, or i'll be wasting another 2 - 4 years of my
                  time.</p>

              <p>Aiyah, jokes aside. No matter what you choose, please have interest in it, work hard and stick with it no matter what and be professional.</p>
              <p>As much as you desire change, what's most important is the perseverence and dedication you put into it. Somehow, you recognize the fact that you are 25 and it's 'rather late'. Then pull up your socks and work for it.</p>

              <p>Agree with the problems and colleagues. IT is also very siong if you're the only one doing shit right when colleagues keep messing your shit up and everyone has more work to do.</p>
