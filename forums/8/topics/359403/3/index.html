              <p>the
              previously driven notion of majority of singaporeans are fussy and wont
              do certain jobs is not THE pressing problem in this current reccession;
              this issue is in all countries. Poor get poorer and rich get richer is
              inevitable, majority of the population is chinese, this will maintain
              to be so of cos and this is unavoidable. (how chinese became majority
              in a originally malay country is a entirely different topic and i am
              not going there!) But tolerance works both ways, Generation Y
              singaporeans have undertaken social studies surely! we understand that
              tolerance works both ways and for that to continue, communication and
              cultural understanding is important! racial riots broke out ages ago,
              to maintain peace and most importantly prevent brain drain!!! majority
              of well educated singaporeans are leaving due to this migrants skilled
              employment, they are forced to leave to look for jobs with better
              prospects else where.</p>
              <p>The bank manager my mum had to speak to,
              was unable to explain a policy to her in Simple English! How is this
              contributing to all singaporeans, unless you are saying they are only
              contributing the chinese population/tourists of singapore. this is the
              frustration
              minorities face daily. a sense of identity being slowly burnt away!
              sense of belonging is important in all aspects of any human.</p>
              <p>i
              am not saying all migrants have to speak english, we have come across
              many very friendly and humble migrants who have excellent
              manners but almost non-existent english speaking skills! for them i am
              wiling to speak in the mandarin i have learnt during my years of school
              and years of being around m best mates who are chinese.</p>
              <p>But
              when u are faced with racist remarks in your country from migrants,
              that's when u start to question ur own sense of belonging. Tolerance is
              practiced and postive outcomes are only possible with positive
              feedback. </p>
              <p>Advertising boards, tourism is all plastered with chinese faces and
              mandarin translation, indian and malay restaurants are forced to employ
              chinese migrants for licensing purposes. reason given, so they can
              converse with other chinese!</p>
              <p>sigh why do i even bother ranting, yea true i am losing my identity
              as a singaporean. oh well i ture, i will take my profession elsewhere, and continue to this brain drain. although the profession i am in is much needed in singapore, i refuse to practice it here no longer. Happier elsewhere where i am respected and given a sense of belonging.</p>

              <p>English language is vital for Singapore to survive. We are the crossroad of the world and english had been the common language used by many in the commerce world. Commerce is the life blood of our sea trading nation. It is no surprise that many deplore the standards of foreign employees on the lack of such knowledge.</p>
              <p>But first of all, let us recognise the plight of such foreigners. They are humans, just like you and I. They only want to earn a living, doing jobs as best as they can, and as cheaply as they can, giving up on many things we singaporeans take for granted.</p>
              <p>We can identify and recognise them - they were like our forefathers after our nation gain independence. Our forefathers knew little lingo except their own mother tongue. Yet they never gave up but gave us what we have today. So too will these new foreigners and PRs become one day, if not them, at least their children will be.</p>
              <p>Let's not be too harsh on them, but instead insist that employers be responsible for their lingo training. In the case of service industry, at least the rudimentary words be taught.</p>
              <p>Another aspect of the foreigner issue is the fear of our jobs being taken away. While it may or may not be true, we must know that in order to survive, we must be prepared to move where the money for survival is. To remain where we are with diminishing prospects is to wait for death. We Singaporeans are no inferior or lacking in productivity as compared to anyone else. We had been highly educated, and with our knowledge of english, the world is our oyster, be one a 'N' level or 'A' level cert holder.</p>
              <p>Singapore is a great place to live, but it has only a market of 3million. No matter how hard govt and biz leaders try, the opportunities are not unlimited.</p>
              <p>Go boldly forth and conquer the world. Bring the story of our nation to other developing nations to give them hope. But REMEMBER to return when the country is in a crisis. Without our  courageous society, evolved from painful past, none of us present today would be better off than a 3 world serf. We owe our past generations a debt of honour</p>

              <p>Well Singapore is indeed multi racial no? Foreigners may think Singapore is a chinese country because almost every where you go you can see chinese as chinese is the main population here. Hosnestly im not a Fan Of PRCs either but they are still human (rude and obnoxious kind) So at the very least i believe what i could do is tolerate and shut it because if we were to object too much the goverment steps in and we can kiss our money fly. Singapore is so small that the Goverment has all the talking power. So much for being democratic. Singapore is multi racial~ Singapore is this ~ Singapore is that~They more like promoters then governers. So many singaporean out of jobs they still go China buy those rotten apples come back to replace us seedlings.</p>

              <p>I think Singaporeans will just need to get used to increasing migrants from China. It's no use going around <em>kao bei kao bu</em>. There is absolutely no need for any Cheena bashing. In fact, I despise any Chinese Singaporean who are banana and do not have a sense of awareness of their cultural roots and chinese identity.</p>
              <p>Just don't forget that many Chinese Singaporean's forebearers (ancestors) were also from China. They used to be very poor uneducated migrants who worked as coolies and workers at the dock. Some were even 'sold' to Singapore by british coolie traders.They also didn't speak English when they first arrived in Singapore, but instead spoke Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese etc... That means to say, many of the ancestors of Chinese Singaporean were exactly like today's China immigrants, if not even worst because they were poor and illiterate, with some even being sold to Singapore.</p>
              <p>And now, the descendents of the once-poor and uneducated Chinese from China are now complaining about increasing migrants from China, whose descendents will in the future become Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>The only difference between the great Chinese migration of 1910-1940 were that they were mostly from Southern China and were known as Sinkeh æ–°å®¢. Today, migrants from China came from every provinces of China, including Northern and Southern China, and they speak predominantly Mandarin.</p>
              <p>The crux is that Singapore is an immigration city. Local Singaporeans will need to learn to adapt to live together with fresh new immigrants. New Immigrants will need to learn to adapt to the local culture of Singapore. Singapore local culture does evolve with time. I guess you just need to learn to adapt.</p>
