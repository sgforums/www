              <p>Why is this phenomenon so significant in the minds of Singaporeans? I personally believe that the problem lies in the upbringing of this particular group of people. The influx of PRCs itself will not cause such a big hoo-ha, but the influx of a group of lowly, despicable, ill-bred, discourteous and utterly uncivilised Chinese will.</p>
              <p>I have definitely no problems with the more educated elites of the Chinese society, but I've got to admit, such is not the case with most of our typical PRC.</p>

              <p>i think the pee ay pee expect other races to learn and speak Mandarin.  didn't you people see the speak mandarin campaign ads on TV?   They are using foreigners speaking Mandarin to get more people to speak Mandarin.    So the message to non chinese is go learn and speak Mandarin.  </p>
              <p>Ha ha ha,    local non chinese learn Mandarin to communicate with the front line staff from mainland China because many of these people don't speak English.</p>

              <p>lol Singapore is more Asean that it is China. I'd rather every SIngaporean spoke at least some basic Malay to stay faithful to our national language.</p>

              <p>One I know just cannot speak English but he can mingle with the predominantly Chinese population and is a regular church-goer on Sunday. As far as I know he's not a devoted Catholic but joining the church gives him a toehold in Singapore.</p>
              <p>He has been accepted at LaSalle to study English for the 1st year at a cost of $9,000. He seems to have the social skills to agitate his Chuch members into raising money to subsidize his school fee lol! Also, it is a Church member who rents him a room at only $200 which is far below market rate.</p>

              <p>if u are talking about everyday jobs like cleaning, etc., it is because no singaporeans (or rather few) want to do those jobs. And it's cheaper hiring them. Can you imgaine hiring the everyday singaporean (maybe the surrent generation)? Prob complain about everything also. haha. If you're talking about jobs in banks, etc., then it's because of sg's small population. With it's small pop, talent is essential. If we just ignore individual problems and look at singapore as a whole, then it's more pragmatic to get talent overseas if they are smarter than you right? After all, they work here (or zhao after a few yrs) and contribute to the economy. It's brutal but true. Sg is moving to a moving towards value creation rather than value added so if there are better talents out there, why not? Im just looking at it at a practical point of view.</p>
              <p>However, I find it funny that they just have to work here for like 3-5 yrs? Our gov pay for they university fees, give them monthly allowance some more, and i've yet to meet one china scholar who actually wants to stay in sg to work. All want to zhao when their bond is over. Looks like a waste of our money and space. No offence to them of course, if i were them i'll also would do the same :p</p>

              if they speak good or perfect english, do u think they will still be cheap? If u are paying peanut, dun expect an elephant. Do u see LV shop with non english speaking PRC selling their stuff anywhere beside china?
                                                  
              u complaint they cant speak ur language, then do u wanna take up their job?
                                                  
              Like wat Fantagf said, if I dun like it here, then dun come. 
                                                  
              If u dun like their service, then go somewhere without them.  Why even bother complaining?

              <p>crap lah, as if people know where these non speaking English China chinese are working.    No sense.   </p>
              <p>Moreover, if they want to work in an English speaking environment, they need to learn to speak English and not expect  all customers to be able to communicate with them in their native language.   Spoilt brat, yet there are no brain people defending them.   Customer service comes first!</p>
