              <p>Here is one story where a date in restaurant can go wrong (U become top menu):-</p>
              <p>On July 22, 1991, Dahmer lured another man, Tracy Edwards, into his home. According to the would-be victim, Dahmer struggled with Edwards in order to handcuff him, but ultimately failed to cuff his wrists together.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDavis1991151_34-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDavis1991151-34"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></span></a></sup> Wielding a large butcher knife, Dahmer forced Edwards into the bedroom, where Edwards saw pictures of mangled bodies on the wall and noticed the terrible smell coming from a large blue barrel.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDavis1991152_35-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDavis1991152-35"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></span></a></sup> Edwards punched him in the face, kicked him in the stomach, ran for the door and escaped.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDavis1991153.E2.80.93154_36-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDavis1991153.E2.80.93154-36"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>37<span>]</span></span></a></sup> Running through the streets, with the handcuffs still hanging from one hand, Edwards waved for help to a police car driven by Robert Rauth and Rolf Mueller of the Milwaukee police department.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDavis1991154_37-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDavis1991154-37"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></span></a></sup> Edwards led police back to Dahmer's apartment, where Dahmer at first acted friendly to the officers. However, Edwards remembered that the knife Dahmer had threatened him with was in the bedroom. When one of the officers checked the bedroom, he saw the photographs of mangled bodies, and called for his partner to arrest Dahmer.<sup id="cite_ref-Bardsley-4_38-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bardsley-4-38"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></span></a></sup> As one officer subdued Dahmer, the other opened the refrigerator and found a human head. Further searching of the apartment revealed three more severed heads, multiple photographs of murdered victims and human remains, severed hands and penises, and photographs of dismembered victims and human remains in his refrigerator.<sup id="cite_ref-Bardsley-5_39-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bardsley-5-39"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>The story of Dahmer's arrest and the inventory in his apartment quickly gained notoriety: several corpses were stored in acid-filled vats, and implements for the construction of an <a title="Altar" href="/wiki/Altar"><span style="color: #0645ad;">altar</span></a> of candles and human skulls were found in his closet. Accusations soon surfaced that Dahmer had practiced necrophilia and cannibalism. Seven skulls were found in the apartment.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDavis1991157_40-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDavis1991157-40"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></span></a></sup> A human heart was found in the freezer.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDavis1991158_41-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDavis1991158-41"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>

              <p><br>I got one story very near to your wan. About Serial Killer man invite Chio Bu to his Murder Castle. He look like Bangla:-</p>
              <p><strong>Herman Webster Mudgett</strong> (May 16, 1861<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></span></a></sup> – May 7, 1896<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></span></a></sup>), better known under the alias of <strong>Dr. Henry Howard Holmes</strong>, was one of the first documented <a title="United States" href="/wiki/United_States"><span style="color: #0645ad;">American</span></a> <a title="Serial killer" href="/wiki/Serial_killer"><span style="color: #0645ad;">serial killers</span></a> in the modern term. Holmes opened a hotel in <a class="mw-redirect" title="Chicago, Illinois" href="/wiki/Chicago,_Illinois"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Chicago</span></a> for the <a title="World's Columbian Exposition" href="/wiki/World%27s_Columbian_Exposition"><span style="color: #0645ad;">1893 World's Fair</span></a>, which he built himself and was the location of many of his murders. While he confessed to 27 murders, of which nine were confirmed, his actual <a title="Body count" href="/wiki/Body_count"><span style="color: #0645ad;">body count</span></a> could be higher.</p>
              <p>The case was notorious in its time and received wide publicity via a series of articles in <a title="William Randolph Hearst" href="/wiki/William_Randolph_Hearst"><span style="color: #0645ad;">William Randolph Hearst</span></a>'s newspapers. Interest in Holmes' crimes were revived in 2003 by <a title="Erik Larson (author)" href="/wiki/Erik_Larson_(author)"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Erik Larson</span></a>'s <em><a title="The Devil in the White City" href="/wiki/The_Devil_in_the_White_City"><span style="color: #0645ad;">The Devil in the White City</span></a></em>, a best-selling non-fiction book that juxtaposed an account of the planning and staging of the World's Fair with Holmes' story.</p>
              <p><span id="Chicago_and_the_.22Murder_Castle.22" class="mw-headline">Chicago and the "Murder Castle"</span></p>
              <p>While in Chicago during the summer of 1886, Holmes came across Dr. E.S. Holton's drugstore at the corner of S. Wallace and W. 63rd Street, in the neighborhood of <a title="Englewood, Chicago" href="/wiki/Englewood,_Chicago"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Englewood</span></a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Pawlak_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Pawlak-4"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></span></a></sup> Holton was suffering from cancer while his wife minded the store.<sup id="cite_ref-Pawlak_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Pawlak-4"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></span></a></sup> Through his charm, Holmes got a job there and then manipulated her into selling him the store. They agreed she could still live in the upstairs apartment even after Holton died. Once Holton died, Mrs. Holton mysteriously disappeared and Holmes told people she was visiting relatives in <a title="California" href="/wiki/California"><span style="color: #0645ad;">California</span></a>. As people started asking questions about her return, he told them she enjoyed California so much that she decided to live there.<sup id="cite_ref-Pawlak_4-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Pawlak-4"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Holmes purchased a lot across from the drugstore, where he built his three-story, block-long "Castle"—as it was dubbed by those in the neighborhood. It was opened as a hotel for the <a title="World's Columbian Exposition" href="/wiki/World%27s_Columbian_Exposition"><span style="color: #0645ad;">World's Columbian Exposition</span></a> in 1893, with part of the structure used as commercial space. The ground floor of the Castle contained Holmes' own relocated drugstore and various shops, while the upper two floors contained his personal office and a maze of over one hundred windowless rooms with doorways opening to brick walls, oddly angled hallways, stairways to nowhere, doors openable only from the outside, and a host of other strange and labyrinthine constructions. Holmes repeatedly changed builders during the construction of the Castle so only he fully understood the design of the house, thus decreasing the chance of being reported to the police.<sup id="cite_ref-dope_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-dope-5"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>After the completion of the hotel, Holmes selected mostly female victims from among his employees (many of whom were required as a condition of employment to take out life insurance policies for which Holmes would pay the premiums but also be the beneficiary), lovers and hotel guests, torturing and killing them.<sup id="cite_ref-Pawlak_4-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Pawlak-4"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></span></a></sup> Some were locked in soundproof bedrooms fitted with gas lines that let him <a class="mw-redirect" title="Asphyxiate" href="/wiki/Asphyxiate"><span style="color: #0645ad;">asphyxiate</span></a> them at any time. Some victims were locked in a huge soundproof bank vault near his office where they were left to suffocate.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></span></a></sup> The victims' bodies were dropped by secret chute to the basement,<sup id="cite_ref-dope_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-dope-5"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></span></a></sup> where some were meticulously dissected, stripped of flesh, crafted into skeleton models, and then sold to medical schools. Holmes also <a title="Cremation" href="/wiki/Cremation"><span style="color: #0645ad;">cremated</span></a> some of the bodies or placed them in <a title="Liming (leather processing)" href="/wiki/Liming_(leather_processing)"><span style="color: #0645ad;">lime pits</span></a> for destruction. Holmes had two giant furnaces as well as pits of acid, bottles of various poisons, and even a stretching rack. Through the connections he had gained in medical school, he sold skeletons and organs with little difficulty. Holmes picked one of the most remote rooms in the Castle to perform hundreds of illegal abortions. Some of his patients died as a result of his abortion procedure,<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></span></a></sup> their corpses also processed and skeletons sold.<sup id="cite_ref-Pawlak_4-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Pawlak-4"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
