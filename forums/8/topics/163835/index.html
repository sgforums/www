Its great if you are able to enjoy art films but not every film needs to be Battleship Potemkin or Citizen Kane to be worth watching. Its just like a good roller coaster ride - watched for the thrill, the light hearted laughs - and comparing a roller coaster ride to a museum tour and sniffing at it, just smacks of a cheap low down shot at other people's fun - Unnecessary and the only reason why you do it, is to sound more 'high class.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Many shows can be classified as entertaining or literary. In my opinion, both entertainment or a literary  ('art') acclaim can be appreciated aesthetically. Art is a form of expression, in any. I think it would be quite reasonable and objective to say that entertaining, thrilling or literary shows do not belong within a specific spectrum akin to most aspects of expressionism.<br><br>Harry Potter shows have the POTENTIAL to become artistic when we apply our rationalistic ideals to the directors intent in showing what he has and in the way he chose. Claiming that plot, ('depth'?) or themes do not exist, or have failed to accentuate, is probably due to the lack of attention and the exploitation of stereotypical beliefs that artistic plays are akin to that of Tennessee Williams' "Glass Menagerie" or eugene O'neils' "Long Days Journey into Night".<br><br>In other words, the KINETIC key is important to the keyhole. If you do not actively persue the 'art' in the show, or for anything at all, you won't get it. That is perhaps why the show seems innocuous to your artistic senses.<br><br>I hope you understand that i'm not saying this to get back at you.[/list][/quote]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it's obvious harry potter is a movie designed to capture box office success... mass appeal.. depth or not.. who cares.. of coz compared to movies with depth like cinderella man, harry potter is crap.. end of the day, harry potter is designed for ppl looking for light-hearted entertainment. what matters most is audience feel money well spent.</div>

The author of the thread was complaining on how the newspapers were lashing out high ratings for "boring movies". It is quite obvious that most arthouse movies are "boring". Like I said, it is my right to criticize Hairy Porter whichever way I want to because in the first place, audience do not sit through a movie with a blank mind. The director expect us to digest the movie and give judgements.<br><br>It is just not my cup of tea to see a kid flying on a broom fighting monsters. Whatever your cup of teas are, I do not care.
