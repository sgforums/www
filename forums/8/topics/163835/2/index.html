In my opinion, both entertainment or a literary  ('art') acclaim can be appreciated aesthetically. Art is a form of expression, in any. I think it would be quite reasonable and objective to say that entertaining, thrilling or literary shows do not belong within a specific spectrum akin to most aspects of expressionism.<br><br>Harry Potter shows have the POTENTIAL to become artistic when we apply our rationalistic ideals to the directors intent in showing what he has and in the way he chose. Claiming that plot, ('depth'?) or themes do not exist, or have failed to accentuate, is probably due to the lack of attention and the exploitation of stereotypical beliefs that artistic plays are akin to that of Tennessee Williams' "Glass Menagerie" or eugene O'neils' "Long Days Journey into Night".<br><br>In other words, the KINETIC key is important to the keyhole. If you do not actively persue the 'art' in the show, or for anything at all, you won't get it. That is perhaps why the show seems innocuous to your artistic senses.<br><br>I hope you understand that i'm not saying this to get back at you.[/list][/quote]</div></blockquote>Harry Potter has no whatsoever potential to become artistic. I shall not bore you with the detail, because if I were to argue upon it, I would have to start watching the movie which is a displeasure to me.<br><br>You do notice that my responses towards the movie is solely personal. What is worthless cobbles to others may be art to another.</div>

When I say the world does not revolve around a broomstick and silly magics, I was making out a point in which one should also explore different genres of movies.<br><br>My initial comparison between Harry Potter and serious art film was in response to the author's following statement:<br><br><strong>Anyway, i think the critics of life newspaper, I read daily are dumb, they suck. They give <span style="color: red;">boring movies</span> -alot of them- high ratings and great movies aka harry potter have low ratings. Which sucks. Anyway everyone I know says it's good. Maybe the critics are old and only watch shows with people playing with their slippers. </strong><br><br>Drama and arthouse genre has many times been labelled as "boring movies".<br><br>I would not even try to draw a comparison between Zhang Yimou's or Wong Kar Wai's pieces with Harry Potter out of the blue had I not come across such comment.<br></div>
