              <p>Discovered an increasing number of telephone operators/customer care officers with odd english accents.</p>
              <p>I recall such experiences mostly with Starhub and at times, Hewlett Packard and Apple.</p>
              <p>(HP is not so bad, their service officers volunteer a name, contact number and reference number, ensure a follow up call within three days to find out whether the problem resurfaced).</p>
              <p>It's pretty frustrating trying to understand what they're trying to explain on the phone.</p>
              <p>To top it off, most of these customer care officers don't seem
                                  equipped with decent knowledge to answer simple phone queries. Is it
                                  the language barrier at work?</p>
              <p>The conversation gets 'put on hold' for more than 5 minutes,
                                  with no sound on the other end of the line so I wind up calling again
                                  only to be given the same clueless operator.</p>
              <p>When quizzed why it took so long, answer was he/she was seeking consultation with managers. And so the
                                  vicious chicken and duck talk repeats. After more than 20 minutes,
                                  nothing gets solved so I hang up and schedule a trip down
                                  the service center on a weekend.</p>
              <p>It's both amusing and annoying when the final "Is there anything else I can do for you?" query comes and I utter "Nope." </p>
              <p>Miss
                                  those days when there were well informed and eloquent customer
                                  care/technical officers (usually locals) with good service standards especially
                                  Starhub, whose level of service has definitely dropped significantly over the
                                  past year.</p>
              <p>Anyone else with similar experience?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>my dad was so du lan .. he called 1633 .. kan the person ..n finally they send some one down in 1 hr ...</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>In terms of technical support, it's still not that bad. Had no major problems so far.</p>
              <p>But in terms of assistance rendered by service officers on the phone, I'm finding it increasingly difficult to clarify even general enquiries say subscription, information on reward points etc.</p>
              <p>Not serious enough for me to lodge complain with the management, at the same time, these petty inconveniences really grate on my nerves. Really pek cek.</p>

              <p>I brought my dog to Mount Pleasant Animal Hospital some time ago, for an ultrasound scan.</p>
              <p>While the scanning was being done, the radiologist explained what was being shown on the screen, but I think she was Filipino or something, I couldn't quite catch what she was trying say in that strong accented English, so I had to keep asking her to repeat herself. In the end, I just gave up and thought I'd leave the explaining up to the vet. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              <p>Wow... I had no idea... how is that even possible if they are not based locally?</p>
              <p>If they are actually based overseas, it gets harder for them to keep up with regular updates, training and skills required by the local (singaporean) market Starhub has been tapping on.</p>
              <p>Come to think of it you could be right though I've always thought it only makes sense for certain companies dealing with specific technologies to outsource their call centers. I remember being re directed to an ang moh (i think american) fellow while making queries on Apple care.</p>
              <p>Apart from that I was under the impression these foreign operators are based in Singapore, just employed under cheaper salary packages compared to locals, therefore the difference in service standards.</p>
