            <div class='col-md body'>[quote]---------------------------------<br>NUSSU NEWSFLASH<br>---------------------------------<br><br>Dear Fellow Students,<br><br>The Union would like to share with you what has happened in the past few days after the announcement of the fee hike.<br><br>Upon the announcement, the Union has firmly stated our objections as well as expressed our disappointment in the lack of consultation through the NUSSU NewsFlash. We have also taken steps to ensure that the voices of our students are heard by the immediate set up of a forum on IVLE to gather feedback.<br><br>In addition, we have taken a more active approach by initiating meetings with the school administration on a daily basis to better understand the situation and discuss the possibility of a reversal of the decision.<br><br>This morning, we met up with Deputy President and Provost, Prof Tan Chorh Chuan. We brought up the concerns that were voiced out in the forum. The Provost expressed his sincerity to address these concerns but we feel that more students should be involved in this clarification process.<br><br>The Union fought for an urgent dialogue session with senior school administrators open to all students but the school administration has their reservations. In the end, a compromise was reached. There will be a close-door session between the Provost and 50 students on Friday, 17th Feb. These 50 students will be made up of 7 representatives from the Executive Committee, one representative from each of the 14 constituent clubs, as well as 29 selected participants from the IVLE  Fee Hike Response Forum. The Union will also follow up with the release of a report on the discussions in the dialogue session. Details of the dialogue session can be found in the forum.<br><br>[/quote</div>
