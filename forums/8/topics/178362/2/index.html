            <div class='col-md body'>I remember that a couple of years ago when NUS implemented the ill-advised (assuming it was even advised) plan to cancel the mid-term break, NUSSU successfully managed to get them to reinstate it - after a year of lobbying.<br><br>This time, though, NUSSU has less than six months before the next semester to get the admin to change their minds. I'm extremely sceptical about any possible turnaround in the admin's policies. So I say, be prepared to pay more. Looks like I'm going to have to take out another loan. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Change can happen, and there is still the chance (albeit remote) that the higher-ups will change their minds. It's plain wrong. They can justify the raise anyway they like - to have two raises in two successive years is simply unfair. Heck, they won't even justify the raise fully - they just gave some very vague statements on 'increasing operating costs'. Now, how did the 'operating costs' increase in the 12 months after the last tuition fee hike? Because of those garish-looking 'centennial mugs' or the spanking-new University Hall which most of us are not going to step into anyway?<br><br>Sure, they may make more subsidies and financial assistance. But how, pray tell, is that going to help undergrads from middle-income families who struggle to pay their fees but don't qualify for financial assistance at the same time?<br><br>And yeah, I agree that overseas unis are much more expensive. But hey, most of us here joined NUS because we CAN'T afford overseas universities in the first place. Even studying in a local university is already hard on our finances as it is. I'm already having a hard time, and I can still consider myself as one of the lucky ones. I may have to give tuition three times a week to cover my expenses, but at least I'm not scraping and wondering how I'm going to get my next meal.<br><br>I know of a friend who has already maxed himself out on loans. I believe he was rejected for financial assistance. He works almost every night to cover his expenses. So, who's going to pay for him?<br><br></div>
