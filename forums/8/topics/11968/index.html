            <div class='col-md body'>Pop girl, I think you are stereotyping. Not all guy will avoid fat girls. Take for example, my 26 yrs old guy friend who is quite handsome and average build is attached to a plump girlfriend. they are into serious relationship planning to ROM end of this year. I quite surprised at first when i recieved news of their plan to ROM. Ask him why he choose his current girlfrn? he would say cos of her character. Both of their character matches, that's wat trigger off their love. Ask him why he don't go for those chio bu that always hang around him when he go to pub or disco. He would answer, well he had dated all those chio bu before but found them ugly under their hide. they look pretty on the surface but inside rotten to the core, materialistic, vain, impractical and difficult to handle. His current girlfriend however is different although she's abit plump. He said she's more understanding, caring and kind.<br><br>Another case, a married couple friends where the husband look ok and average build while the wife is damn fat. Tell me how this marriage is possible then??<br><br>So you can't say all guys want is only looks in gal. It depend on individual guy what they want. However, i agree that most guy do place some importance into look when searching for girlfriend. Everyone want the best of everything, some guys just blindly go for look eventhough these pretty girl that they eyed on are rotten in their core.<br>Maybe they are still young and immature to know the truth in life. And maybe they are just out for fun and not into serious  relationship.<br><br>Well, lastly i like to agree with ^TzM 53^ that fat gal have to wait for their right one to come along and not simply give up because they are fat and unwanted. Wat they can do if they really mind is to start cutting down on their diet, stop being lazy and exercise more. Most fat girl simply give up and accept the fact that no one will love them and hence develop that low self-esteem character and bad temper. that's wat really put all the good guys off. These are my personal opinion.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dun think fat gals can't wear tube/spagettis, coz i have personally seen some in orchard flaunting watever they have too. They juz ignore wat others, might, say.<br><br>True, to certain extents, that the society's eyes are being bias(but no one can make them feel inferior w/o their consent). However, it might sometimes be the way they carry themselves. Afterall, they're like normal people, who can be nasty, having inferior complexity and all kinda traits.<br><br>In my opinion, it's not so much abt following the fashion(wearing spagettis or tube-tops), rather, or more imptly would be to dress appropriately(that is to cover their flaws and bring out their assets).<br><br>There are still pple arnd looking for a deeper beauty, although they might be the minority.<br><br>'Everything has it's beauty, but not everyone sees it.'<br><br></div>

The answer is no to your question. It just happened tat one particular group of pretty girls whom my friend know are.
