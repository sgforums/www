            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Honeybunz:</div><div class="quote_body">Ok... this is what happened to my good friend and her family.  I shall not use real names lah.<br><br>My friend Jamie is the youngest of the family.  She has two sisters.  The second sister Mandy in the family is the most highly educated.  She graduated from NUS with an Architecture Degree.<br><br>When Mandy was 29, she was dumped by her boyfriend after a six year relationship.  She went through a deep depression for some time.  Jamie was worried.  Though she was eight years younger, she didn't think it was easy for Mandy to go through the 'from-breakup-to-getover' phase.  So she signed up for a foreign language course with Mandy, hoping to keep her occupied and also hoping that she could meet some nice guys.<br><br>Months after months.  Instead of meeting new guys, Mandy met a Taiwanese girl from the same class, JinJin.  JinJin befriended Mandy and brought her into a Buddhist group.<br><br>Mandy was a born Catholic, but has always been inclined to Buddhism teachings since her parents stopped attending church.<br><br>Before the family got to know what changes has occured to Mandy's life, Mandy was already very involved and brainwashed in the group.  She tried to convert her parents.  Instead of preaching like Christians (by saying believe in God, come church with me), she was very secretive about her religious group.  She just pretended to be bringing her mother out for a dinner or something.  But she eventually brought her to somebody's house.  There, they were having some meeting and prayers.<br><br>So the mother bo bian, she just sat down and listen to their talks.<br>During the talk, they talked about San Bao (3 Treasures).  The speaker claimed to be given this San Bao by Buddha.  The San Bao is supposed to be some secrets or what.  At the end of the talk, the speaker made everyone said a vow not to leak out the secret of San Bao to outsider, otherwise Buddha will send 5 thunders down to hit the head of the person who breaks the vow (Wu Lei Hong Ding).  My friend's mother was already very put off by that.  She was thinking to herself "Why would a divine or God be so evil and force us humans to say this kind of vow?"<br><br>After that, they straightaway wanted to "baptise" her by registering her name in a book.  They told her that with her name in the book, "God" will reserve a place in heaven for her.<br><br>Other changes in Mandy was her eating habit.  She refused to eat with anyone in her family, cuz their food is dirty.  She refused to use same kind of pots or woks to cook her food.  cuz they are dirty.  She doesn't use her family's cultery and utensils anymore.  She went to buy a new set of everything for her own use.<br><br>Mandy wants her family to be like her -- vegetarian.  And to her the best would be whole family follow her religion.  She came out with 101 reasons why we shouldn't take meat.  Once I rebutted her by saying "How about Ji Gong?  That one also buddha what!"  But Mandy gave a very very strange answer "Ji Gong eat animals so that their soul could be saved &amp; reincarnated.  Don't you know that once he ate the whole chicken, and immediately he spat it out, the chicken came back to life?"  I was very stunned and confused!  What on earth is she talking about?  I dont' think I've heard this story, cuz it doesn't exist in the first place.  Jamie also diam diam.<br><br>Months later, Mandy disappeared.  She said she was going to another part of the world to spread the religion and to help the poor.  She said it's a calling.  But but but, her parents were already old and going to retire soon.  Don't the parents need her????  She ignored the comment, but said that she helped the poor in the third world country, god will protect her family here.<br><br>End of Story Part I.</div></blockquote>That was probably I Kuan Dao.

            <div class='col-md body'>Got difference between hardcore and cult as suicine pointed it out.<br><br>Hardcore are people who religiously follows the religious books and stuff strictly. U can call them Buddhists, but they follow the sutras 101%. Bit scary.<br><br>Worse, if cults means not really Buddhist in form, or controversial from another perspective.<br><br>Third which many may neglect is scams in guise Buddhism.<br><br>This story came from my mother, who said one of our neighbour practised asking people go to a certain temple go pray in a room. Only two people will be in the room. Every month pay 50 bucks, cannot tell parents, spouse, siblings unless want to recruit them.<br><br>this i have not much info, but one must be beware of.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think the one mentioned is not buddhist one. first of all, as many mentioned... in buddhism... there is no god, but only human beings who got enlightened and could proceed to paradise.<br><br>The one mentioned i believe is one of the groups that worship the "Wu Sen Ren"(forget the name). They consist of many gods and beings... including Jesus, Buddha, Kong Z etc(i think). Basically they just want the people to do good deeds and they practise those old old teachings... They vegeterian too! They are not known to force people to join thou.<br>Note that this is very different from Taoist/Buddhist even thou they also have alter... Most people think they are T/B since they teach in chinese.<br><br>But there are always blacksheeps everywhere... so its not surprising to see some members try hard to convert their loved ones or friends.<br><br>Just my thoughts.</div>

It seems that she's telling stuff from Taoist legends rather then Buhhist teachings.<br><br>Secondly, about the punishment and retribution. In Buddhist terms, the good deeds and bad deeds u do affect your karma. The level of your karma determines where u go in the AFTER LIFE. Not attract lightning. We use Lightning rods to do that<br><br>This 2 facts alone prove that this Mandy probably knows next to nothing about the religion<br><br>Another fact, we already said there wasn't a surpreme being, where did the so called "calling" come from. What does this mean, it means the girl is mental, send her to a hospital<br><br>As for Vegetarians, I dun think many pple are mistaken about them. Buddha teaches that we should avoid killing living things(still on acummulating Karma), that's why monks and devoted buddhist do not eat meat. But that doesn't mean that he condemn meat eaters. FYI there are many buddist out there who eat meat. Some monks in certain countries also eat meat. It's the vegetarian in that asshole who cannot tahan seeing u eat meat that's why they try to stop u, not the buddhist teaching. The next time someone claiming to be a buddhist tries to stop u from eating meat, kick him in between the legs.</div>

I dun mind this sort of threads, good for a laugh n demonstrates how anything taken too hardcore can become bad, but i hope it wasn't opened in retaliation because... if the thread starter is a hardcore whatever religion he/she is, it dun reflect too well on his/her religion.<br><br>meanwhile, I'm a hardcore anarchist! wahahah</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Honeybunz:</div><div class="quote_body">Ok... this is what happened to my good friend and her family.  I shall not use real names lah.<br><br>My friend Jamie is the youngest of the family.  She has two sisters.  The second sister Mandy in the family is the most highly educated.  She graduated from NUS with an Architecture Degree.<br><br>When Mandy was 29, she was dumped by her boyfriend after a six year relationship.  She went through a deep depression for some time.  Jamie was worried.  Though she was eight years younger, she didn't think it was easy for Mandy to go through the 'from-breakup-to-getover' phase.  So she signed up for a foreign language course with Mandy, hoping to keep her occupied and also hoping that she could meet some nice guys.<br><br>Months after months.  Instead of meeting new guys, Mandy met a Taiwanese girl from the same class, JinJin.  JinJin befriended Mandy and brought her into a Buddhist group.<br><br>Mandy was a born Catholic, but has always been inclined to Buddhism teachings since her parents stopped attending church.<br><br>Before the family got to know what changes has occured to Mandy's life, Mandy was already very involved and brainwashed in the group.  She tried to convert her parents.  Instead of preaching like Christians (by saying believe in God, come church with me), she was very secretive about her religious group.  She just pretended to be bringing her mother out for a dinner or something.  But she eventually brought her to somebody's house.  There, they were having some meeting and prayers.<br><br>So the mother bo bian, she just sat down and listen to their talks.<br>During the talk, they talked about San Bao (3 Treasures).  The speaker claimed to be given this San Bao by Buddha.  The San Bao is supposed to be some secrets or what.  At the end of the talk, the speaker made everyone said a vow not to leak out the secret of San Bao to outsider, otherwise Buddha will send 5 thunders down to hit the head of the person who breaks the vow (Wu Lei Hong Ding).  My friend's mother was already very put off by that.  She was thinking to herself "Why would a divine or God be so evil and force us humans to say this kind of vow?"<br><br>After that, they straightaway wanted to "baptise" her by registering her name in a book.  They told her that with her name in the book, "God" will reserve a place in heaven for her.<br><br>Other changes in Mandy was her eating habit.  She refused to eat with anyone in her family, cuz their food is dirty.  She refused to use same kind of pots or woks to cook her food.  cuz they are dirty.  She doesn't use her family's cultery and utensils anymore.  She went to buy a new set of everything for her own use.<br><br>Mandy wants her family to be like her -- vegetarian.  And to her the best would be whole family follow her religion.  She came out with 101 reasons why we shouldn't take meat.  Once I rebutted her by saying "How about Ji Gong?  That one also buddha what!"  But Mandy gave a very very strange answer "Ji Gong eat animals so that their soul could be saved &amp; reincarnated.  Don't you know that once he ate the whole chicken, and immediately he spat it out, the chicken came back to life?"  I was very stunned and confused!  What on earth is she talking about?  I dont' think I've heard this story, cuz it doesn't exist in the first place.  Jamie also diam diam.<br><br>Months later, Mandy disappeared.  She said she was going to another part of the world to spread the religion and to help the poor.  She said it's a calling.  But but but, her parents were already old and going to retire soon.  Don't the parents need her????  She ignored the comment, but said that she helped the poor in the third world country, god will protect her family here.<br><br>End of Story Part I.</div></blockquote>whoa lao eh my lau peh hardcore also never hardcore until liadat. ownself eat vegan ownself eat vegan la, where got cannot eat with others de? this case is ki siao liao. also never hear the ji gong eat the chicken story.This one not buddhism.

But when I told him I din like it, and that i got backaches, he didn't get angry, and allowed me to not do the chanting stuff. In fact later one they let me be their unofficial photographer for the special occasions becos I dun join in e chanting, so I was more than willing to help out.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>Its cool. my hardcore relatives never harress me to go chant. hehehe</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>U know it's really funny that most of the bad things they try to associate with this "hardcore Buddhist" dun really exist. Not in my books anyway. It's "strange" since it's obvious that these pple aren't buddhist and knows next to nuts about Buddhism. So they take whatever bad stuff from their own religion or someone else's religion and dump it into Buddhism. I'm sure many of us in here comes from Buddhist family or those being more traditional families or have more truely Buddhist friends knows better. U know what the main problem with "Truely Hardcore Buddhist" is??? Well They're too freaking passive and too much of a Pacifist IMO. Probably why the religion doesn't enjoy as much popularity as the others.<br><br>Seriously, Buddhism is a way of life &gt; Religion. More then enough pple have said that already. In fact, if u do good and lead a meaningful life, u'll already be following the teachings of the Buddha. U dun have to go pray in front of the Buddhist statue or chant whatever prayers outright to be a Buddhist. It's not like Christianity or Islam. Conclusion: Get your facts right!!!</div>
