            <div class='col-md body'>My dad was pretty Hardcore when he was still around. Meditates every night, Visit his regular place of worship every evening. Since Buddhist are accept the existance of other religion, he never force his beliefs onto us. Basically I'm an Athiest, my young bro a Christian and my youngest bro a free thinker. In which case, we all kind of follow many of the teachings of Buddha coz we've been doing it since young and it's very much a way of life anyway.<br><br>I may be kind of a green horn at this but from what I know a true buddhist won't go around forcing their idea on you. That's not the way the Buddha teach anyway. They have a duty to lead u on the right path but not to condemn u if u are not. Maybe that's why Buddhism isn't as wide spread as those "Thou shall go to hell if thou does not believe in me religion"(I call this TSGTHITDNBIMR for short. Yes it makes no sense, who cares  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> ). Seriously Buddhism fit me well since it does not really have a supreme being but I'm sometime put off by some of it's overly optimistic view of human nature. Human by nature are assholes and not all conflicts can be solve by love and peace. that's where pple from the TSGTHITDNBIMR are needed<br><br>I'm not sure what kinda friends kops21 but I'm surrounded by Buddhist pple and none of them ever ask u to go with them to mediation sessions. In fact u probably can't even find any monk on the street asking u to go into the temple to meditate which is more then I can said for those TSGTHITDNBIMR who likes to not only pester u but use Brainwashing tactics like going as far as to calling up complete strangers to go to chur... eh I mean prayer session with them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>By the way, I would have contributed but for the fact topic starter was so much in glee to flame Buddhists.<br><br>Noeing the topic starter also once started a rather immature topic flaming our ancestors who were all Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims, Taoists etc etc, i understand her foolishness. I beg u all to forgive her. Amen.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Obviously those guys who posted a similar topic were damn peeved off by some Christians who tries to impose their beliefs on them. Many noted, which obviously our said topic starter did not observe, that the victims were also forced upon.<br><br>Also, many of the people of the people proclaim themselves atheists too. Why pick on the Buddhists onli?<br><br>Lastly, this thread from the start, is kinda like want people to say "ooh, honeybunzie jie, come on, tell us more abt the obnoxious Buddhists"<br><br>Well, it took her some time to finish mopping her floor aint it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok... this is what happened to my good friend and her family.  I shall not use real names lah.<br><br>My friend Jamie is the youngest of the family.  She has two sisters.  The second sister Mandy in the family is the most highly educated.  She graduated from NUS with an Architecture Degree.<br><br>When Mandy was 29, she was dumped by her boyfriend after a six year relationship.  She went through a deep depression for some time.  Jamie was worried.  Though she was eight years younger, she didn't think it was easy for Mandy to go through the 'from-breakup-to-getover' phase.  So she signed up for a foreign language course with Mandy, hoping to keep her occupied and also hoping that she could meet some nice guys.<br><br>Months after months.  Instead of meeting new guys, Mandy met a Taiwanese girl from the same class, JinJin.  JinJin befriended Mandy and brought her into a Buddhist group.<br><br>Mandy was a born Catholic, but has always been inclined to Buddhism teachings since her parents stopped attending church.<br><br>Before the family got to know what changes has occured to Mandy's life, Mandy was already very involved and brainwashed in the group.  She tried to convert her parents.  Instead of preaching like Christians (by saying believe in God, come church with me), she was very secretive about her religious group.  She just pretended to be bringing her mother out for a dinner or something.  But she eventually brought her to somebody's house.  There, they were having some meeting and prayers.<br><br>So the mother bo bian, she just sat down and listen to their talks.<br>During the talk, they talked about San Bao (3 Treasures).  The speaker claimed to be given this San Bao by Buddha.  The San Bao is supposed to be some secrets or what.  At the end of the talk, the speaker made everyone said a vow not to leak out the secret of San Bao to outsider, otherwise Buddha will send 5 thunders down to hit the head of the person who breaks the vow (Wu Lei Hong Ding).  My friend's mother was already very put off by that.  She was thinking to herself "Why would a divine or God be so evil and force us humans to say this kind of vow?"<br><br>After that, they straightaway wanted to "baptise" her by registering her name in a book.  They told her that with her name in the book, "God" will reserve a place in heaven for her.<br><br>Other changes in Mandy was her eating habit.  She refused to eat with anyone in her family, cuz their food is dirty.  She refused to use same kind of pots or woks to cook her food.  cuz they are dirty.  She doesn't use her family's cultery and utensils anymore.  She went to buy a new set of everything for her own use.<br><br>Mandy wants her family to be like her -- vegetarian.  And to her the best would be whole family follow her religion.  She came out with 101 reasons why we shouldn't take meat.  Once I rebutted her by saying "How about Ji Gong?  That one also buddha what!"  But Mandy gave a very very strange answer "Ji Gong eat animals so that their soul could be saved &amp; reincarnated.  Don't you know that once he ate the whole chicken, and immediately he spat it out, the chicken came back to life?"  I was very stunned and confused!  What on earth is she talking about?  I dont' think I've heard this story, cuz it doesn't exist in the first place.  Jamie also diam diam.<br><br>Months later, Mandy disappeared.  She said she was going to another part of the world to spread the religion and to help the poor.  She said it's a calling.  But but but, her parents were already old and going to retire soon.  Don't the parents need her????  She ignored the comment, but said that she helped the poor in the third world country, god will protect her family here.<br><br>End of Story Part I.</div>
