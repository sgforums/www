Y chromosome on the other hand is being used now in a new study to track the movements and evolution of people quite the same way as blood type was used some time ago. just so you know <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

(though it may be lower than the international standard which is 1.1 male to 1.0 female iirc).<br><br>the ratio is still higher upto 15 years of age.<br><br>after that, on the main grouping there are more females; and of coz the elderly group is way higher (coz generally males are shorter-lived).<br><br>Why 15 year old males more... than suddenly lower?<br><br>Could it be many died in NS? oopss....

In heavily industralised areas, even the air is affected and cause the male to become "more female", and the mutated genes are passed on to the next generation.
