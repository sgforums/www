            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to ask all the forumites, young or old, to see if you are compassionate. To see if you belong to the "good-natured" side of Singaporeans...Please answer Yes Or No..<br><br>1. Have u try ever giving up your seat to a person who needs more than U, EVERYTIME?<br>2. Do you put a person's time of difficulty as a priority instead of your proudness?(for e.g, if u see an old woman carrying lotsa things crossing in Orchard Road, if U are nicely dressed. Would U help her?<br>3. Have you offered anyone to share with your umbrella in the rain, knowing that you have more than enough space for another head?<br>4. Have you ever stopped your car for a disability person trying to hail a cab?<br>5. Have you gone to any homes to do voulunteering services?<br><br>If you answered no, to most of the questions...start now...we have so many members in the forum..more than 700.Anyone reading these thread, starting from today. Do any of the compassionate acts and it sure makes a difference in your life and the person that you have helped.Start making a difference in the lives of the ppl less privilledged than u.<br><br>A LITTLE THOUGHT MEANS SO MUCH.<br><br>Any comments on compassionate acts in Sg? Or a compassionate act you have seen? Share with us so we can learn from each other...<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 29-11-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's see..<br>1. No.. not everytime, but more often than not.<br><br>2. Yes, if what you meant by being too proud to give a helping hand. If I want to help, I would, no matter what I am in.<br><br>3. No, becoz, I rarely carry umbralla, usually people would offer me help instead.<br><br>4. No, I still having driving lessons, so even want to offer, people also won't dare to accept.<br><br>5. Yup, used to be one but nowadays too tied down by work.. but hope to do some ad hoc basis one.<br><br>Hmm.. compassionate acts in SG, well, even every little thing we do, which might affect the being of another can be considered a compassionate act even though how insignificant it can be. Next time you do something, think twice how it might affect another person before doing.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Luf (edited 28-11-1999).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by Luf (edited 28-11-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1.  Yep...but not all the time...If I'm really really tired(and that can be bad and quite often because of my schedule), then I will just sit down and not give up...mostly because I know if I give up, I will most likely drop to the floor before I reach the destination...so when I don't give up it's usually when I consider myself to be one of the helpless peoples...<br><br>2. I'm always helpful...no matter how busy(unless the guy/girl really asking me for help on really idiotic things...)...most times to the point where my work and time will suffer...<br><br>3. I never carry an umbrella...Once when i did, i didn't offer, I just put it over the girls head without her asking...she smile, I smile...that's it...while we waited at the traffic light behind Taka...no shelter there...But I ever asked someone if they can share(the umbrella damn big), and she told me no...it was raining really hard then, and I had a meeting to attend..damn...:-(<br><br>4. Can't really say I have...never come across such situation during my time driving...and I don't drive here in Singapore so...<br><br>5. not in Singapore...but back in States, I used to help out to feed the homeless people in the inner city....Does that count?<br><br>I find that I don't have enough time during the day to help out in a home...mainly because of times that shops are open and my sheduling...also weekends are burned trying to finish work and things...Stress!!!...my only free time would have to be at night after everyone is asleep...That's why I stay awake so late what...During day hours got no time...(doing work as we speak)...Blame it on Singapore society...but true that a lot of people do have the time to help...but don't...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To your first point, no, not always but most of the time especially if person is old, blind, handicapped, little kid, pregnant woman...to be frank, 1/2 the time i'll just get up and walk away, without telling the fella the seat's for her/him, sounds dumb but i'm just embarassed to do such things very especially in singapore cos of the weird looks u usually get...<br><br>sometimes, i really am so crippled by this sense of embarassment if i get up, i really dunno whthr to give up my seat, but at the same time i feel so uncomfortable knowing that its not right to pretend i nvr see...eventually i will get up if no one else offers the seat in a couple of minutes...<br><br>i kinda feel this "embarassment" is why many singaporeans dont do it...my sis and friends included...<br><br>what do the rest of you think?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1) yes.  i always do.  i don't understand people who could easily sit down and ignore an old lady/man or a pregnant woman on the train or the bus.  once i saw a man ignoring a crippled guy on crutches on the train and the crippled man's stop was more than 20 minutes away.  i was already standing up, so i just said to the guy to have the common decency to stand up...he was listening to his walkman, but i know he heard me.  at least it made some others to stand up and give up their seats.<br><br>2) yes.  although sometimes people are just too damn proud to admit that they need other people's help.  i also don't understand that.<br><br>3) no.  why?  cuz i don't carry an umbrella.....hehehe...i think it's really immasculate...i'd rather drown... =)<br><br>4) no.  why?  cuz i don't drive.  it's hard to get around town using the highways...<br><br>5) no.  i do a charity service by volunteering to help out at the children's hospital at their picnic every 3 months.  i know it's not much, but my schedule restricts other things.<br><br>i also don't understand how some 'new-age' women who claim to be independent from the shackles of male domination who thinks that by accepting my offer of a seat on the trains/bus means that they submit to us males cuz of some stupid feminist reason.<br><br>it's a crazy world out there...<br><br>------------------<br>Underneath the Southern Cross I stand...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To:JC boy<br>I do understand that there is a considerable amounts of ppl who are embarrased to help ppl in need. Initially me too..."paiseh", scared the person reject me or whatever excuse I can give. But always remember to give is a virtue and to receive is a gift from heaven. U will never know when u need the help of the others one day on the street. Start from tommorow...U will be able to build your "shyness" too. Trust me sometimes it is better for u to give than 2 receive cos 2 person is happy instead of none. Make this society a moregraceful country as it is supposedly to be...<br><br>The rest of the "graceful" ppl, glad to know that U all have been so courteous to ur fellow countrymen. This proves to show that there is love on this earth.<br><br>Fire...I think the girl rejected u becos she might thought that u are trying to be funny or something(cos maybe u looked beng.he!), but she is quite mean in letting u get drenched in the rain.<br><br>But guys taking an umbrella doesn't mean that U are feminine, this is also a chance to shelter girls over...(good excuse)cos girls like me sometimes forget to take umbrella also..haha!<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1. yeah.. always do this. esp on the bus...<br>2. ahem.. yup. though along orchard you dont really see old women struggling with bags rite? and when you see them, half the time they look kinda crazy... abit the scary lor.<br>3. haha. i nv do this. why? 'cos i nv carry an umbrella! yeah.. but alot of ppl, total strangers, have done this for me. most of the time occurs when i'm wearing my sch uniform though... guess lil schgirls look more disarmingly cutes and vulnerable.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>4. nv been in this situation before... but we usually stop to offer someone a lift if it's a. raining heavily, b. an old woman who looks lost.<br>5. yeah.. went to an old folks' hme.. it was so sad.<br><br>i guess being compassionate's somethg inside all of us. but most can be bothered/too lazy/too embarressed to do anythg abt it...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1. as many times as possible.  however, there are instances when i offered my seat but got rejected.  :Ãž<br><br>2. honestly speaking, i do try to.  there is this old lady who always pushes a cart full of newspapers on the road around my estate.  its very dangerous and i helped her once.  but she is always around.  the thing is, she doesn't need the money from peddling the papers.  her son told her not to do tat and even told my mum before that she has savings of more than $10,000 in the bank.  now the only thing i can do is to offer a prayer for her safety everytime i see her.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>3.  yupp did tat. a very warm feeling.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>4.  err... no car.<br><br>5.  try to keep to a weekly basis of volunteering my time at the local children's hospital (KK hosp) to visit and play with cancer-stricken kids.  these visits really help me, more than the kids, in the sense that they make me feel that i don't have the biggest unsolvable problems in the world.  they are so young, yet they fight their illness so courageously.  how trifle our troubles seem compared to them!<br><br>i have one compassionate act to share with all of ya.  it happened last year i was walking towards an MRT station with my friends after my exams.  the road was rather uneven coz some bangladesh workers were carrying out some construction work there.  i accidentally stepped into a hole and fell down.  my friends helped me up and tried to assess the damage harmed.  what really touched me was that one of the bangladesh worker walked to me and handed me a handiplast!  i was really really touched.  frankly speaking, i'm sure our s'porean forumites know tat these bangladesh workers are not held in high regard in s'pore.  (am i right? ) and for them to help a chinese s'porean girl ....  i'm sure i won't forget this compassionate act for a long time to come.<br><br>thanks rinoa, for posting this thread.  fellow forumites, like wat rinoa urged, do put a bit more thought into doing compassionate acts.  bring some cheer into another person's life &amp; u'll find urself being warmed by it too.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah Rinoa, i agree totally i feel good when i help others...<br><br>but at the same time, i dunno if i help primarily cos i wnna feel good cos i did a good thing, or cos i really wnna help, or cos i feel bad if i see a chance to do good but i missed out on it...<br><br>its kinda also these suspicions of my own motives that make me really wonder if i'm being nice or doing such deeds to assuage my guilt for not helping someone in the past, for the unkind things i say sometimes...<br><br>Some fella once told me though, that as long as one does good deeds, it kinda doesnt matter cos good is done anyway...thats true in a manner of speaking, but i personally feel that i'd rather be doing good just because its right to do so, (no this aint a justification) though i still do help whenever i can...<br><br>to a limit of cos, while i have done visiting to both children and old folks' homes, i find at the end of the day i feel too drained when i visit old folks' homes; i prefer children...so its like i'd probably spend my "social worktime" with grps i prefer to work with...is this kinda hypocritical??<br><br>analyse me...<br><br>=============================================<br><br>We are the Young Ones....<br><br></div>
