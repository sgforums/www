And I should say, Singaporeans have been generous towards supporting its products. But then again, Creative depends on the international market, esp USA, for a large majority of its income, so whatever Singapore can do is minimal. This is unlike Korean brands which their conglomerates wield so much power on its local consumers and depend on their monopoly over them for quite a long time. You would be amazed by how lousy brands over here such as LG have so much business over in Korea - rubbish collection, petrol stations, handphones, etc...<br><br>Buying creative shares is basically just a gamble - (blind) faith on our Mr Sim to come up with another killer product parallel to SoundBlaster. The only consolation, however, is that Creative is conservatively managed financially and hence any loss loss would deal a blow less destructive.</div>
