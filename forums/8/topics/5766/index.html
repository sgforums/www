            <div class='col-md body'>dear lex,<br><br>I have made my "bet" 12 years ago. In the halls of St. Andrew's Sec Sch. Though I wasn't sure at that young age whether I was going to "win the bet". I have never turned back since. And it has been a wonderful experience knowing Christ. The "bet" has been increasing in amounts, they are not in monetary value, but my life is at stake. And yet I do not have to wait for the time to come to see my "bet" be doubled. I have reaped much more treasures in life I can imagine and it's still growing. Many lessons I have learnt, bad ones, good ones. Along the way, the temptation of giving up the "bet" has been great. Who do not want to do whatever he likes, not having something to "bind" him down? But I know the if I keep and hold on to the "bet" my "rewards" will be greater than anyone can give me now. And I never felt happier or freer than before.<br><br>So if want me to "bet" on any gods, it will still be my Man, Jesus! If I "win", I'll just return to heaven one day. If I "lose", I'll know I have lived my life without regrets. In anyway, I still "win". As for yourself, think of the consequences if I "won" and you are not "betting" on my side.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just wanted to let daniel know that my old friend was also in the same situation...Because the cell group didn;t approve of his relationship with this girl who was also a meber of the same church, they told him he was comitting a sin and they should break it off...and my other friend had to join in this "debate" with the parishioners to defend my friend....<br><br>In the end, he was forced to leave because he refused to listen to them...and so he denounced christianity afterwards....<br><br>sounds like a fake story but it did happen...<br><br>they even tried to quote passages from the bible telling him why he should break it off...<br><br>yet another example of humans in action trying to use something good for their own ends....<br><br>I only respect a certain few christians who have raised themselves above this pettiness that plagues many of their own memebers...and of course Mother Theresa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>iamsilly<br><br>...do u actually believe Annaconda when he did his 'I touch u and u are healed' thingy?<br><br>feelgood sessions are probably beneficial to patients in small dosage. I am speaking about prayers, encouragements and all... but to an extent that might cause a patient to abandon all treatments and place his fate in the hands of the healer is another matter all together.<br><br>If the patient dies, healer has blood on his hands..<br><br>This, is the works of overzealous christians<br><br>[This message has been edited by Illegal Operation (edited 22 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>illegal op,<br><br>i just belief that if God wants to bless you, He can use channel He wants. afterall, He was the one who gave life and created everything you see. so making you walk from paralysis is chicken feet to Him.<br><br>But like I said, He provides other channels to bless you, not just miraculous healings.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm, i was reading from the top and when i got to the bottom i was surprised to see how far it has strayed from the original topic.<br><br>ng, yes, the initial posts sounded like Pascal's Wager but I've got a headache and won't try to think about it. are you still looking for bourdieu?<br><br>general,<br>a lot of anti-christians here i see. however, i would be able to sympathise with them if they actually produced arguments that prove (or at least attempt)that Christianity is false. Instead we get silly excuses like 'my Christian girlfriend left me so i hate all Christians' or 'Christians are so pushy and so in your face that's why i'm anti-Christ' or 'some church members of a friend's friend's friend were soooo unfair so i don't believe in God'. Com'on give me a break. Go down to to nearest 7-11 and buy yourselves some maturity. the whole world doesn't revolve around your petty feelings.<br><br>if everyone did that this world would have ceased to have existed long ago. we are talking about the validity of an idea, an ideology. how strong this idea is does not depend on whether or not your gfriend left you.</div>
