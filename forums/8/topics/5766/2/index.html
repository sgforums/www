            <div class='col-md body'>There are serious theological problems with<br>Pascal's Wager. Since Terence is not going<br>to address it, I think I will.<br><br>Before I continue, it is fair that I explain<br>what is Pascal's Wager first. It is basically<br>a win win bet oftenly used by the christians.<br><br>1) If there is God, belief in God will pay<br>off with entrance to heaven.<br><br>2) If there is no God, belief in God will<br>not harm you anyway.<br><br>So, you can only benefit with the belief in<br>God, and there is no chance that you can<br>lose. But if you disbelieve, there is a<br>chance which you may land in hell.<br><br>That kind of argument sounds quite okie,<br>except that it does not address a theological<br>requirement set out by Christianity (or<br>Christ for that matter).<br><br>That this type of argument stems from self<br>interest. The basic theological tenet of<br>christianity is NOT about self interest.<br><br>Christ says, "Deny yourself, take up the<br>cross, and follow Me". What is the<br>psychological revolution needed to properly<br>happen before you can call yourself a true<br>blue christian? A revolution in which the<br>self is being dethroned (destruction of Ego,<br>which I and Terence has addressed earlier).<br><br>Pascal Wager fails by virtue that it does not<br>address this theological requirement and it<br>ends up as a crappy argument. Because if you<br>believe in God because of self interest, you<br>will surely end up in hell.<br><br>For those christians who are so damn sure<br>that they will end up in heaven, I remind<br>you that such a position is no different from<br>the position that was taken by the Pharisees<br>during Jesus's time. They are so damn sure<br>that they shall inherit the kingdom of God.<br><br>Beware, my dear friends, the Bible warns<br>"The first shall be the last, and the last<br>shall be the first.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Asure:<br>read ur topic... ya, we do share similar beliefs... one can't have the good without the bad. That's why i have always wear a Yin-Yang necklace just to symbolize my belief that life is a balance of many things: good and evil, play hard and work hard, athletic and intellectual... balance...<br>as for religion, i'm really interested in the darker, more obscurer religions like u, religions that would be branded satanic or blasphemous by christians... i mean, there has to be some truth to some of those religions coz they have existed way before christianity... i guess i'm toking about occult rite now which has nothing to do with this topic so i save for later... but i believe in souls or watever energy that is left once the physical body dies... and i feel that if souls exist, then the "energy" of jesus, buddha, krishna is still around... and if u believe in the cycle of life, there should also be ways where man is able to escape such a cycle (death and revbirth). According to Buddhist scriptures, Buddha found a way.<br><br>One major difference between the major religions was dat buddha was a dissatisfied and curious prince searching for enlightenment?, Krishna was already a god ( i tink), and Jesus said he was the son of God<br><br>my dad is more of an atheist. He says he's a scientist and therefore cannot believe anything without hard physical proof. He feels u dun have to be religious to be good as long as u are good. My mum on da other hand, is the typical superstitious and very religious Singaporean homemaker so i constantly get bombarded on both sides by wat and wat not to do... if i eat beef, my mum goes crazy on me but my dad would gruffly encourage me"Good boy!! be strong &amp; big like those american boys and eat beef"<br>cracks me up most of the times...<br><br>but i believe in every religion coz like u said Asure, they are essentially the same 'cept Christians would always argue that being good ain't good enuff... u have to live for God and love him as well...<br>i've given up debating with christians on religion becoz they refuse to take in any other religions view and consider those religions to be blasphemous... I'm cool w/ christians and all, i go to church and pray and sing christian pop songs (better than buddhist chants but buddhist chants sound more soothing, especially the new ones with all those sweet tinkling bells) my christian frens have given up trying to convert me though they'd once in a while tease me about Buddha being a beggar and dying from food poisoning... while i'd say Jesus was a street magician/illusionist just like David Copperfield (if Jesus can turn one peice of bread into many peices of bread, i'm sure david copperfield could too hehehe...) those were some of the tamer jokes we crack on each other so dun flame me ok? is juz jokes =)<br>But all religions are cool... i just dun like the ones dat force u to change when u marry someone from dat religion. Love and religion should not go against each other i tink....<br>i tink i'm very very off da topic but i'm bored rite now and juz spilling out stuff... bear with me plz =)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>interesting question.<br><br>let's examine how easy it is to go to heaven for each religion.<br><br>islam.<br>very easy to go to heaven<br>as long as you die for islam, you go to heaven straight away and in heaven, have 7 virgins to serve you honey and dates. that explains why there are a lot of muslims fanatics and terrorists - they die and they enjoy.<br>muslims also can have 4 wifes.<br>muslims are very intolerant of criticism.<br>if you want to die early, just criticise islam.<br>if you want to show you are a good muslim, just criticise other religions and pray 5 times a day.<br>sorry gals, i don't know what woman get out of islam - very sad<br><br>roman catholic.<br>also easy to go to heaven.<br>donate this and that.<br>must also donate to the priest and the church so that when you die, your time spent is purgatory is lesser.<br>also can buy certain items 'indulgences' (from the church of course!!)that will reduce your sins.<br>and remember to say your "hail mary's" daily<br><br>hindu<br>an easy way to go to heaven.<br>hindu is a very caste based society.<br>if you are a warrior caste, just make sure you are a very brave warrior and die in battle and don't be a coward. you no need to worry whether you are fighting on the side of good or evil. just fight and kill.<br>and if you are born a slave, just make sure that you are a good slave, no rebellion and all that stuff.<br><br>protestant/christianity<br>difficult to go to heaven.<br>the way to heaven is through your heart and jesus/holy spirit.<br>if you perform good deeds because you expect something out of it, for example, go to heaven, the good deed does not count at all.<br>you still go to hell.<br>one of the most tolerant religion.<br><br>buddhism.<br>impossible to go to heaven.<br>because there is no heaven at all.<br>a person goes through endless cycle of reincarnation and suffering in hell.<br>if he can become a buddha, then he achieve nirvana and escape from cycle of life.<br><br>conclusion:<br>1st choice:<br>i will bet on islam. it is so easy to go to heaven and you get a lot of benefits.<br>do you know that islam is the fastest growing religion ever.<br>people are not stupid - they know a good thing when they see one.<br><br>2nd and 3rd choice:<br>roman catholic and hinduism are very close - easy to go to heaven<br><br>there is a very big gap from 1,2,3 choices and the 4,5 choices.<br><br>4th choice:<br>very difficult to go to heaven.<br>only for the poor people of roman catholic and the untouchables of hinduism. because they have nothing to lose and can only hope for a better life.<br><br>5th choice:<br>i don't understand what people see in buddhism. except that people generally accept it as fate - correct me if i am wrong.<br><br>yours<br>bboss2<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Me a free-thinker, on my way of growing up, u get to meet ppl along the street 'invite u aside' &amp; make u read after them, that is the 1st reason why I slowly distance Christ.<br><br>Please hear this story.<br>TO me all religion are fair, they only teach us to be good etc..so I always dun want to comment much until I met 1 friend she know what we would do during the 7th mth or when consulting 'medium' etc.<br><br>She was telling us her aunt's in-law tablet name stroke was written wrongly &amp; when altered she gets all offering &amp; she let her strike lottery &amp; other stories.<br><br>So I actually asked her since u know all these why dun u believe? She reply that "oh I believe there's only 1 god &amp; if others help u in ways like cure etc they're just evil forces.<br><br>When I heard this I was so surprised how could a Christian say tht in fact I feel NO religion should say bad abt other relig even if u dun believe in it RESPECT it! It makes me look down on her church, what did they actually teach her????<br><br>I understand by spreading words of god u are actually doing a gd deed but not to that extent.<br><br>(zhongjiao zhi shi sing yang bu shi mi yang) religion is only kind of believe not indulgion.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Heavens Above....<br><br>bboss2&gt; I read your post, and i laughed... and i laughed and laughed... then i stopped for about 5 seconds, and i laughed s'more...<br><br>Sorry, but was your post suppoused to be funny?<br><br>ANYway, I agree with Ngkaihoe, your facts about Islam are especially wrong. good grief! Please, try to read up on it, then call us when you're done...<br><br>Oh can i point out one thing? Please don't take me to be anti-christ cos i'm not. But i was just wondering how churches chooose the pple they send out to "spread the word"?? Cos I've been cornered by one too many christian evangelists, and frankly, i find that 1) they don't know enough to evangalise in the first place 2) they are too persistent, i'm thinking of placing a restraining order on the next one i meet! Hello? try telling them that you have a religion, that you're buddhist/hindu/muslim! they give you this look which says "that's not a religion! you call that a religion?" and then they proceed to ask you if you want to get to know Christ... "yes i know who he is thank you very much, can you please get out of my face now??" And the worst thing is, their ploy for getting you to come for "just one of the services" is that they don't know the answers to the questions you ask! "why is it like...?" "well i don't know/i'm not sure why don't you come for one of our masses??" HELLO? If you don't know, stay at home and read your bible! Who puts these kids on the streets anyway???<br><br>The classic is when they come a-knocking at your door! "hi we are from city harvest, and we would like to help you get to know Christ". Yes please! barge into my house and start preaching! Would you like a mike to go with it?? Should i play an accompaniment on the piano? Will "oh when the saints" do??<br><br>ok that's abt it i guess... :]<br>Haven't really addressed the issue... oh well...<br><br></div>
