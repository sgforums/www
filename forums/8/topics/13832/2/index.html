However the final choice is really up to u and u alone.<br><br>Polytecnic has long been deemed by many as the place NOT to go if u have gd grades. That was past stereotyping. This is the present, past beliefs dun and shouldn't apply here.<br><br>Going to poly does not prevent u from ending up in the Uni...it only makes u generally 1 year older than the existing batch of students in the same course and year as u.<br><br>Similarly, the culture at poly is more relaxed and hands-on, even for commerce related courses. Poly students come out wiser for it. No uniforms are required, this of course enhances the lack of monotony in the campus grounds...<br><br>3-year courses culminate in a diploma which enables u to go out and work if u have financial difficulty. A level certs are nothing but a passport for the uni...<br><br>On the other hand, JC cultivates a enriched tertiary education life. Ppl from similar walks of life come together with similar goals and ideals. And everyone there is generally the same age so interaction is not a problem.<br><br>The system is similar to previous education standards, with the usual mid-term exams and final term exams and the occasional annoying class tests. Hence adaptation is not a problem.<br><br>2 years and u're ticket bound to the uni or NS (whichever sex u belong to). Basically, A levels is an express train to the uni.<br><br>My recommendation is go to poly...u trade one year for added cirriculum that cannot be gained from JC...<br><br>If u decide on JC, a simple advice would be - enjoy ur life there, dun be too focused on grades (though that's important too). It's also better to go for a JC that does not have it's priorities on statistics rather than ur well being, in short go for a JC other than the top five. Less stressful and more exciting.<br><br>Remember, the final decision is of course your own.

            <div class='col-md body'>My personally feeling is that poly path is still the best choice althought i was a JC student who made it to local U. 1stly, poly courses are more practical and handson thus having more industrial value. In local university, poly grad who managed to come in do relatively well compared to those JC students in most practical fields e.g engineering due to the relevancy of their past work in poly. Like what controveray had said, JC is just a 2 years ticket for you to go to local U. if you fail to make it that's it cause your result must be sucking big time. But for poly grad if they can't make it to local U will have other alternatives.<br><br>I think it depend on your financial status. If you can go oversea, choose poly path and go oversea to get a degree faster. If you are not rich and think that you can make a go for JC path, then go for it. Otherwise, choose poly path and try your luck there too. If you cannot make it into local U from poly, at least you got a poly cert to fall back to that is in line with your interest in communication. And maybe after working for some time, you might like to consider going oversea to get your degree. Oversea degree render you more exposure and also a chance to work oversea e.g. Austrialia, US etc where salary is relatively higher and benefit better. Think about it. When singapore government is placing bets on oversea talent, why don't you act like one working oversea and come back as oversea talent if you bother to come back?<br><br>It's your choice ultimately, think carefully whether you can fit into which path better.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 02 March 2002).]</div>
