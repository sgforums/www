            <div class='col-md body'>It's very interesting how the government plans to promote creative thinking to people through campaigns and new teaching methods. First of all, how do you teach creative thinking? The Government probably sees Creative Thinking as a new subject to be introduced into our education system, with teachers being the light houses that will guide students to achieve that higher level of thinking. Knowing the Singapore Government, there will probably be control factors and fixed methods and techniques in reaching this objective. Everything should be packaged nicely into a campaign, promoted and properly integrated into the system to mutually benefit both the government and the sheep...excuse me, I meant 'people'. That's the typical idealistic point of view they'll probably hold.<br><br>No, creative thinking isn't a subject. It's the backdrop for a stage of thought. Creative thinking isn't generated at random. It's cultivated. I know what you're thinking. Isn't introducing it into the school education system a form of cultivation? Yes, in a way it is. It does introduce the concept to students, that's for sure. The problem is, why should students even have to be 'introduced' to it when it should be a natural part of any human being's brain expenditure?<br><br>The reason why we have to be introduced to it is because of the state of the Singapore society. Everything builds up around this 'need' to keep up with others. To always keep attempt to be a step ahead of everyone else. As a result, you have everyone trying to outrace each other even before they know what they're racing for. The Government's always talking about this Singapore dream thing. What exactly is our dream? Owning bigger houses, driving larger cars, getting higher pays, getting better degrees? With so much emphasis on the materialistic, it's no wonder we have to be introduced to a simple concept known as 'creative thinking'.<br><br>'Creative thinking' is just a fanciful way of saying "Thinking in your own way". As far as we are concerned, 'creative thinking' in Singapore will probably be limited to writing fiction stories for publishing.<br><br>Does Singapore really encourage you to think in your own way?<br><br>Let's take a look at the Speaker's Corner. This was something the government introduced to allow citizens to voice out their opinions and to provide politically-correct ideas. The meaning of 'politcally correct' simply means that you're allowed to give some feedback here and there, but you aren't allowed to contradict the fundamental laws and restrictions placed by the government onto us. "Thinking in your own way" isn't particularly allowed because chances are you will be cornered and accused of not understanding the workings of our 'conservative society' and to be merely 'seeking attention' from others.<br><br>Let's take a look at the opportunities then. There are always going to be opportunities for you to put your 'creative thinking' to good use and excel in it. Does Singapore encourage such endeavours? Perhaps, in some instances. But it's probably a safer bet to stick to your 9-5 job, work your life away, and collect the 'government's gifts' that would be your CPF money. Because if you really do set your 'creative thinking' to good use and venture out of the established system, and you happen to fail, it's not going to be easy to recover at the pace things go.<br><br>So you can probably sit back in your rocking chair when you're really old and say to yourself, "I had a great, wholesome, rich life in Singapore working day and nighit to earn big bucks to own this house and to own a large car and high social status. I even have a large hi-fi system in my house. All thanks to the creative thinking they taught me in school."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wanna bet?I was quite creative as a student when it comes to thinking of ways on how to play truant and copy during exams although i think this type of creativity was not what the government had in mind,eheh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>But i really think the gov is a bit slow in advocating as the west have been practising it and look at the harvest they have sown.Guys who become rich overnight on an idea,anyway the gov is always slow eg advocting dot.com when the bubble was at a point of overheating and now advocating biogenetics when it was supposed to be advocated a few years ago,but at least must applaud their effort for trying,heheh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Drooling is not to be drooled to the extreme.<br>Burping is not to be done to the extreme.<br>If eating is done to the extreme.<br>Your tummy will bring you to the toilet.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">~~~<br>Waiting for Diablo 2 Add-on <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
