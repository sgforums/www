            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for the email.  I better tell you all something..  My classmate<br>had an encounter about 1.5 mths ago with the very man in ref in the<br>emails below.<br><br>Her experience was similar except that somehow she'd had a sudden sense<br>of foreboding a brief moment before the stranger had initially<br>approached her for directions.  Before she could reply he interrupted<br>with the same query a second time and started gesturing.  Immediately<br>the hair on her arms and back of the neck prickled.  So whatever tricks<br>he'd had up his sleeves, she didn't fall for them.  She told him off<br>right there that she knew what he was up to, and that if she should see<br>his face again, she would drag him straight to "whichever is the nearest<br>holy place filled with religious leaders", OR deal with him herself.  I<br>think the last thing she said to him was, "YOU look into MY eyes and<br>tell ME that I'M lying to you."  Then instead of storming off, she stood<br>there glaring at him.  She told me she knew it was very risky and she<br>was being really stupid by challenging him like that.  She was just<br>suddenly furious and taken aback by the man's audacity to pull off a<br>stunt like that.  Fortunately he didn't try anything further and moved<br>off quickly.  He kept looking back at her.  I asked her, "He looked like<br>he's scared of you?"  Her reply: "I think I scared the crap back out of<br>him."<br><br>My friend has a laid-back, non-judgemental nature, built real tough and<br>not the unnecessarily gossipy sort.  She's also quite strong<br>spiritually.  So if anything shld come out from HER mouth, it's usually<br>something the listener must pay attention to.  She was somewhat visibly<br>shaken (w/ anger or faint fear, I dunno) when she told me about it, and<br>it was not typical of her to be that way.  Seems like she saw right<br>through him, and in turn HE knew SHE meant business.  Pls warn your<br>female acquaintances, friends, family and relatives about this.<br><br>-----Original Message-----<br><br>Pls warn your lady friends abt this.  Very Scary....<br><br>My female friend encountered this incident in Orchard before, that time<br>she was waiting for me at Orchard Tower. She was approached by a Chinese<br>30 - 40yrs old man. I saw the man talking to her while I am walking<br>toward her. I was puzzled when she suddenly walked off with the man<br>....... and even stunned when she walked pass me without looking at<br>me...but I am standing in front of her!!<br><br>Thinking something amiss, I called her handphone instead.<br><br>She answered the phone and was shocked to saw herself not waiting at<br>Orchard Tower for me. The man must have saw his charm being broken,<br>immediately talked to her again..... This time I told my friend don't<br>listen to what he said and not to see his eyes.....RUN! She quickly ran<br>off ......  She called me again after 15mins..... and meet me at<br>Takashimaya.<br><br>She was shivering all over when I met her. She told me she really don't<br>know what was going on..... I told her I heard of this kind of things<br>before, thought it is another internet poo poo..... But never expected<br>to see it myself too......<br><br>Well....... that day, she took almost half a day to calm herself down.<br><br>And so coincidence, Caroline who is my ex-colleague has encountered that<br>man.......<br><br>Subject: Beware<br><br>Something to share with u...during this festive season....don't know if<br>its true. But still u need to take extra care abt it.<br><br>My friend sent me the following email yesterday, am forwarding to all of<br>u for info so that u would not be caught in that situation. Take care.<br><br>To share what happened to me last evening, sorry to send to so many, but<br>sending this hoping that nothing unfortunate will happen to my friends.<br><br>While waiting for my husband at Tangs side entrance facing Lucky Plaza,<br>suddenly a Chinese man approached me, disregarding my personal space,<br>stood so close to me that i need to back off. Then he asked me where was<br>a place, which i didn't comprehend. After repeating 2 times or so, he<br>said the place was where they sell chicken rice, duck rice, making some<br>innocent hand gestures like counting, so i thought he meant food court,<br>told him that he could go down the flight of stairs next to Mac to<br>basement. He appeared lost and asked me again, then asked if it was on<br>left hand side or right hand side. I was little irritated as we were<br>facing the stairs, such a big stairway and u are asking me right or left<br>hand side? Luckily my husband arrived and a taxi behind him sounded the<br>horn as my hubby waited for me. So i pointed again to the stairway and<br>asked him to go down.<br><br>This morning suddenly awaken with uneasy feeling. Realised that he might<br>be a hypnotiser. As i remembered that he was loitering near me for some<br>time, but i just took it that he was another passerby at that moment, he<br>spoke in a deliberate and slower manner, his hand gestures when<br>mentioning chicken &amp; duck rice, his deliberate attempt in asking me if<br>left or right. These people try to get us to conjure up images in our<br>mind, thats how they hypnotise us. Why I thought was a hypnotiser was<br>because my KL friend shared with me 3 mths back that it happened very<br>frequently in KL, her friend was a victim when she woke up naked, not<br>remembering what happened. She herself almost fallen prey.<br><br>Her story was that she was at busy shopping centre exit, saw a flustered<br>overseas chinese man speaking very loudly on HP, then the man approached<br>her for help, told her that his girlfriend from overseas came to look<br>for him but was lost, so wanted to borrow money from my friend, amount<br>was quite a lot which my friend didn't have. After talking for a while,<br>he even managed to ask her to follow him.<br><br>Fortunately her HP rang, she said she suddenly became more aware of what<br>was happening, before that, she just wanted to follow him to help him.<br>Immediately she told the man she didn't have money and left.<br><br>So beware of all foreign chinese man (i really can't decifer his accent,<br>definitely not sporean, very decently dressed, normal guy on the street,<br>maybe late 30s, carrying a rather big shoulder sling bag).<br><br>Please alert your galfriends, sisters, mothers etc.<br><br>Have a nice day!<br><br></div>
