            <div class='col-md body'>How gd would it be if humans does not have any physical form but juz a glowing flame...color of the flame would depend on ur character on how caring u are and how devoted you are to the person u love....i guess this will make the world a better place.....I mean i feel that its kinda of unfair to gals that does not look great i mean those below average looking gals....usually they have already lose out to pretty gals out there even before guys could really know their kind and caring character....i feel that the first sight at a gal,most probably looks is the most important...i mean it sorta giving beautiful gals the starting advantage already...i know in this world there is true love where ppl love each other on their characthers rather then looks but most of us just could not help it by putting looks as the first piority before looking into other factors....*ask urself* Would u ever approach an ugly stranger and want to know more abt her?...if a person is faithful and and a great lover type then he/she will take the form of a bright beautiful flame....and people will now then choose much much more on the person character rather then looks anymore.If god can grant my wish and this wish would certainly make this world a real real better place and less ppl will be hurt in relationship due to their uncaring and unfaithful lovers...but i know if ever this wish become a reality i would most probably turned into an ugly flame with a evil glow and ward off any gals.(cos i am a poor and uncaring lover) But with less ppl hurt in relationship i guess its Worth it after all.Like what Riona had reply in my message thread earlier "If u cannot give ur lover happiness,let her go...."I mean why bother to start a relationship that there is some bad pts on you that ur the other partner did not know at the start..for example those 'play play' type and a poor lover who does not even bother to show care and concern after a while...in fact u are actually hurting ur partner in the long run if the flame wish is fufilled then everyone will really know what the person is like...Hope what i have said will 'awaken' more ppl...so they will seriously give some thoughts on how they treating their partner whether they r showering them with love and care....Rinoa thnx for the reply and advice on the last message thread...u sorta of enlighten me....i will not ask her back anymore as i dun want to risk another time which may hurt her again and i will pray the best for them...i know that even she forgive me on how i treated her i also could not forgive myself and i guess the knot in my heart and the sweet memories will serve some sort like a punishement to me as it will filled me with guilt.I guess the punishment would continue thru out till the day when i die...............<br><br>*Ppl out there pls give me ur comments on the flame wish.Am i right to have such a thought or am i wrong?*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mystery...<br>Good for u!At least U know where u are heading now...I always feel that time heals.It is a matter of time for u to find a gal that can untie the knot in ur heart and releases all the love and care u have for the person. It is my pleasure to be of a service to u and give u a better vision of how u want u life to be. Once again thanks for heeding my advice.<br><br>According to ur flame wish, I think ppl are still quite superficial in a sense...like all of my threads view with ppl views about looks...character...social problems, U somehow know what the person really thinks.This is the place where ppl dun judge u how u look but how u think.Yes, the forum is the right place for u to put ur thoughts into reality where ppl of the same calibre will stand by your side and support u all the way.You have made the right choice, dude!<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Very good to know you have made a decision.<br><br>As for the flame wish, I have to say that it doesn't change much. Appearence still matters, its just that now the beauty of the flame is paramount rather than your great bod or height or whatever. What is changed is that people will be easier to figure out, and like you said, there will be less victims.<br><br>No matter what form we wish to use project our personalities, I put to you that its the capacity to change that brings optimism and hope. If you don't like people judging at looks, then you don't do the same. However bad you are at the moment, you'll probably project the same image as a guy or a flame. After you change, you'll project a better image, as a guy or a flame. So, all will not be lost.<br><br>Have a good time reinventing, no, improving yourself.<br><br>I'm just acting as a devil's advocate, and I do that sometimes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>mysteryrider - i don't really noe what's wrong wif ur love life right now but i can guess. i understand what it's like to have to let someone go. i understand how hard it can be. it's even harder sometimes when u realise it's really the best thing for her to leave you. it can hurt. more so if she leaves to be with someone else....i guess the greatest comfort you can get from a situation like this (if you can call it that) is to focus on her happiness and to tell yourself (hard as it may be) that her happiness is all that matters. and dat as long as she is happy then it's alrite and you'll be happy too. so try to be happy for her even tho you miss her. hard to do. but prob the best thing to do. it gets easier with time. time really does heal. but you have to allow it to. i wish you all the very best.<br><br>really like your flame idea. at first i thot that it'd all be the same and everyone will just end up looking for the best looking flame....much like what happens now....but then i thot abt it a bit more and i think understand where you're coming from. i mean the most impt thing is (and should be) how we are as a person rite? all too often we either get deceived abt a person's character becos we couldn't get past the looks or didn't want to acknowledge some bad point abt a person....we fail to see the person for who they really are.....we deceive ourselves....and then get hurt. so maybe if we were all like flames, it would be like wearing our hearts out on our sleeves and showing ourselves for who we really are.<br><br>this would really be an ideal world of sorts tho....we wouldn't have the chance to show who we're really not, and others wouldn't fall for us becos they judged us wrongly....in a way, if we were all flames, what you see is what you'll get....and beautiful flames would be a reflection of the inner beauty that you really are. enchanting thought. i really like that. altho for a flame to capture all that we really are....well i really gotta see that flame! it must really be a rich and beautiful flame to capture all the different shades and hues we are capable of as a person. i don't think that the flame always remains the same tho....it could start out an ugly flame and progress to a lovely one, or it could be the other way around....and different ppl like different kinds of flames, some like it bright and red hot, others prefer a warmer, cozier flame....impt thing is that we choose the flame we like and then learn to tend the flames.<br><br>but life being the way it is (as i said above) i'm not sure if the flame will always be an unwavering one....sometimes, becos of circumstances and experiences (u can liken it to the winds of change), the brightness and quality of the flame changes too....it may flicker, it may die, or it may glow an even richer hue....we are never the same person all the time....we are forever and never the same (much like some perfume ad! haha!)....but then at least if we were all flames, you'd more readily see the changes....and hopefully your partner will more readily see the changes too....<br><br>i think perhaps the sad thing abt a lot of r'ships is that things change and sometimes the other party doesn't see it til it's too late....it's all hidden inside you see....and sometimes you just grow apart from one another....nobody's fault really....but maybe if we were flames we'd see the beginnings of a change and could perhaps do something abt it....talk abt it maybe....then instead of growing apart, maybe we could save the r'ship and understand what's going on and grow together instead....we may even grow to love all the changes in our new flame....<br><br>the thing abt being with someone too long is that you tend to take them for granted and then even if your partner, your flame starts to change a different shade or colour, you don't really take notice.....until it becomes too late....the signs may always have been there....just that we didn't see them. it's quite true that u often fail to see what's right there before your very eyes. whether deliberately and consciously or otherwise. so regardless of whether we're flames or not, the impt thing is to be less self-absorbed and to be more attentive to your partner and his/her needs and wants. and to learn to share and communicate our hopes, fears and aspirations. in sharing with our flames, we change as flames ourselves and grow together. an ideal world.....yeah it is....but it'd be a brighter and warmer one too.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I thought the idea was refreshing. Mystery, guess you have matured a lot since your ex left you. Was looking at your previous postings, and was pretty disturbed that her new bf is someone whom she seeked out in IRC, who listened to her problems she encountered with you, and whom she embraced when she was going to breakdown. I wonder is it love she has for him, and as you mentioned earlier, she might be staying with him because she do not wish to hurt him. If she's that selfless, I'm afraid that she'll be the one hurting in the long run. Perhaps you feel that you do not deserve her. But if she has no feelings for the other guy, is it fair or just for her to be hurt again?<br>But again, who is the right person to judge whether it is the case or not? Perhaps if the flame could be seen, we might be able to see things clearer, and many heartbreaks can be avoided. Perhaps only.<br><br>Was also thinking of what fadingstar said.  Yes, I believe that the colour of the flame do change. But like looks, if we just look at the current state of the flame, are we being too shallow? I mean, all the bright flames would be the ones wanted, what about those not burning beautifully? Will anyone consider why they're not burning as nicely as the rest? Who will then be "saving" these "dying" flames?<br>When a candle doesn't burn brightly, is it only because the wax is of poor quality? What about environmental factors? (Lack of oxgyen for example?) Who will be the one giving the oxgyen for these candles before they suffocate to death? Is it that only candles that are burning brightly deserve to continue burning?<br>Perhaps knowing too much is bad either. At least, when some of your flaws is covered up from the rest, it allows you to breathe easier. That's why many people wear masks. It's for their survival. It's the only way they could face the world. Without it, they might have lost their will to live long ago.<br><br>Seasons change, people change. But if your love is true, you'll find that no matter what happens to your partner, you'll still stick by him/her. The mystery of love. Something that's really profound. People always said that love dies 'cos the other party has changed. But has anyone thought that they're also at fault because they're unwilling to accept their partners' flaws? (will anyone blame their partner if he/she changed for the better?) Do they also acknowledged that they're partly to blame when the other party changes(due to the fact that they have been neglecting him/her?)They are the ones who love themselves more than their partners, and hence could not accept changes from the other half.<br><br>Mystery, I think you should try to sound her out and see if she's really happy(try to look beneath the surface, masks are deceiving). If she really is, give her your blessings. If she's not, you don't have to make her come back to you(you might not be the most suitable person for her either, but if you are, all the best), but it's important to make her see the light before she falls further into the pits.</div>
