Why do white guys like Asian girls?<br>A. ItÂ’s a cultural norm among white people for attractive girls to be small and skinny. Asian girls are generally small and skinny. Therefore white guys like Asian girls.<br><br>Q. Why donÂ’t white girls like Asian guys?<br>A. Generally speaking, white girls are attracted to tall muscular (white) guys. Asian guys generally arenÂ’t tall and muscular, or white. Of course there are exceptions to each statement. Such as my friend who is Asian, 5Â’11Â”, and pretty well built, and gets more Asian AND white ass than he can handle.</span><br><br>Probably true, comparing the number of Asian-guy-Caucasian-girl and Caucasian-guy-Asian-girl couples around us.<br><br>Give Singapore girls a chance. Compared to Caucasian girls, they are more likely to give Singapore guys a chance, too.</div>
