If you don't want ppl like me to have other views to make a comment, I believe you and your fav girl can go create another forum to idolise your race and condamn others. But for ChitChat, if I get banned for making this statement, then I know I am not welcomed for my views and comments. However, I am not therefore I've not broken any forum decorum. Whereas, you are fanning fire and flaming people who do not share your views.  If you do not wish people with other views to post in your thread, you should make it clear in your first post that alternative views are not welcomed.  However, clearly as caramon had riled many, and Yet I do not support a ban. You would be the next in line for people to ask to be kicked out. Guess who who not support that ban and where are your "friends"<br><br>Let me turn this around, you twisted that I say someone's husband stink. Did I name a name? So Can I also conclude that YOU just said Elindra's arse stink then. Isn't this your logic or is it that only YOU and only YOU are always right.<br><br>The thread is "fine" cause no one want to talk to you because and I quote caramon: You can't handle the truth.  Your only supporter is rather pathetic a person if you ask me. The rest just ain't interested in your flame war trap and besides, the thread is turning gay. You never seen handsome and good Chinese men and women so don't make sweeping statements. The reverse is the same, lots of Indian women married wonderful Chinese men cause they just can't stand Indians like you. And the Chinese men had better grace and refinement than you to b!tch/whine about everything like you.<br><br></div>

I believe anyone is entitled to their own choice and everyone has their reasons. Please do not mistaken that I think Indians are a superior race whatsoever. I just so happen to fall in love with and married an Indian. I am just sharing my own experience with regards to the thread.<br><br>There will be stereotypes of every race and there will be exceptions.<br><br>Anyway from my personal experience if anyone is even interested:<br><br>1. My husband does not stink. He is extremely particular about personal hygiene and takes more than 2 bathes a day. He does not suffer from body odor problems either.<br><br>2. He is not a heavy drinker. His favorite drink is chinese tea (pu-er)<br><br>3. He is not from a rich family. Whatever he earns today is due to his own work and effort. I won't call him rich, nor will I call him poor. We are just an average Singaporean family.<br><br>4. He has no complains about my personal hygiene.<br><br></div>
