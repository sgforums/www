            <div class='col-md body'>As for me, i admire guys with striking eyes and sharp nose and short hairstyle with neatly combed up fringes (or Armani hairstyle). Good lips would be a bonus though. Caucasians are out for me becos they tend to be unfaithful.<br><br>By far among asians , only Indian and Eurasian guys, and some Malays have these features. Yet to  cames acorss a Chinese guy with such features.<br>Never really been impressed by  some chinese guys who keep long hair or those standing up like a carpet being vacummed. It just looks so unnatural. these guys make it difficult for me to differentiate between male and female lah. They  look like girls and  some of them look like the "butches".
