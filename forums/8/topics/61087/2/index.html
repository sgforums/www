If people do a bad investment, they have to pay for the mistakes. Why should the public pay for the mistakes?"<br><br>One Chinese man said: "They should give a little more notice and solicit some opinions from the public rather than just implement it when they decided to go on it."<br><br>A Malay man said: "Actually it's not fair. $5 is a big amount of money...there's always no time for us consumers to react to it."<br><br>One Indian woman said: "Previously I had five (ez-link cards). Basically, two I misplaced, this you can't stop it."<br><br>Though many were opposed to the new policy, there were some who thought it was a fair system.<br><br>One student said: "It's very fair because if some people don't pay for it they'll take it for granted."<br><br>Amrin said: "It's fair because its causing an economic burden on the operators and if you want to have more cards, you should be prepared to pay for it...if you can't afford to pay $5, then just buy one card."<br><br>Still the new scheme does not seem to have affected card sales.<br><br>By late afternoon, one counter at Raffles MRT station had sold over 20 new EZ link cards - about the same number sold on Monday. - CNA<br></strong></blockquote></div>
