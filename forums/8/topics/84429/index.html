            <div class='col-md body'>By right, there are anti-discrimination laws barring HR recruiters asking about your religion, status or race during your interview. But, this is Singapore and in Singapore everyone is Kapo! Hence, the HR personnel would most likely ask you about your martial status and do a mental calculation that maybe you want to start a family.<br><br>Being a Govt Agency, they might take into consideration you want to start a family down the road. However, its best you do not let them know that youÂ’re pregnant unless they ask. Because chances are your position will be given up to someone else who is Â‘betterÂ’ qualified.<br><br>But this not only happens in Singapore, it happens everywhere. Its very difficult, to hire someone who in 6 months time, is going to take paid maternity leave for 3 months, when she just started working, the company would have to hire a temp to handle her tasks.<br></div>

I do support pregnant women but its a give and take. I know of someone who applied for a job 6months before pregancy, got the job then went on paid maternity leave, after she gave birth, she took another 1 month paid leave then quit her job. Thats just taking advantage of the system.<br><br>So unfortunately, alot of the SME's or small time business owners cannot afford to hire a staff only to see her leave in a few months time and the owner has to hire another 1 to replace her for a while.<br><br>Its a different case, if a woman has been working for at least 1 year, gets pregnant takes paid maternity leave and some extra leave but stays with the company at least another 2 years.<br><br>I mean, same goes for us men, we have reservist as well but its only 2 - 3 weeks at most per year. Even so, we feel the pinch when we go for reservist and our job takes a back seat, come back and lose business/ footing.<br><br></div>
