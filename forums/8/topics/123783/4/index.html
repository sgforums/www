            <div class='col-md body'>themoment, let me relate a real life incident to u. 2 years back, there was this group of qualified first-aider on a hike. during the hike, they saw an accident which a man was knocked down. however, they did nothing but to call the ambulance. why? because the guy is bleeding like we sweat and is dying. to cut short, the guy is going to die, with or without first aid.<br>it's the same why people don't wanna rescue the man down the track as they know the train is coming very soon, people helping the guy will be beaten up too. how many people wanted to be involved in these trouble which is non of their concerns. beside this, as i mentioned earlier, people will experienced shock when they see these kind of incidents happen. also, these guys may be in a rush. strike off all these people, u will get a few people left or none at all.</div>

And i wonder why you bother.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> It doesn't make any sense tat people should be helping this situation.<br><br>Why people around him look for his gf when they don't know who his gf is? You talk as if the everyone knows him and his gf. You think drama is it? If you're not there, then don't say a word.<br>And where did his gf go? Left him alone or what? Why did she disappear? You couldn't find any concrete reasons right?<br>I could've said, she ran away.<br>How long did the fight last?<br>How much time did he stay on the scene? Do you know how minutes he stayed at that same spot? Maybe he left to look for his gf right after that, nobody had time to react. He was giving big reactions which anyone may have been hit by him of they got near him?<br><br>Before you accuse people humji Don't act smart and assume things are the way they are.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Threadstarter, by starting such threads wif baseless accusations really speaks alot of ur age n maturity. Yes u may think singaporeans are selfish not to help the poor man. By helping the man, their life would be at risk if the incoming train hits the man, and he pulls them along too. Secondly, most commoners would not have experienced such situations and may be too shocked to decide what to do.<br><br>Another scenario would be a guy getting beaten up by 10 youths. Of course ur PSLE education will teach u to approach them acting like a hero to save the man. By all means go ahead, u might be deemed a hero but ur picture will be on the main page of the obituaries. It may be a selfish way of thinking, but why shld 1 endanger his own life for the sake of others?<br><br>General stereotyping singaporeans really highlights ur immaturity.</div>
