B4 you take an action such as this please be more considerate of your family and friends.<br><br>the bleeding man situation different i guess but maybe they were just scared and anyway other than calling ambulance which i think some one did they couldn't do much else also<br><br>please dun just call  pple humji without thinking it thru pls</div>
