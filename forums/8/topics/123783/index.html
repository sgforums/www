Rather den as "singaporean" although we are one.<br><br>like u, u said u helped in donations... well done, but tt doesn't qualifies you to "condemn" the others who have in their NRIC something similiar to yours.<br><br>those people who did not help the poor guy at Orchard,... Well, maybe u can think, they just happen to be the minority who just keep to themselves.<br><br>i tink u ought to think hard about your thread.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't understand why would the guy have to go to such extent to pick up his shoe? It's that damn ex or something? Even if it is,I felt that he shouldn't do that since he knows when the MRT was about to approach. This is just plain stupidity on his own.<br><br>As for the gang beating this one person, As a bystander, they could at least call the police or something. (duh,if they don't want to get implicated, this method would still be the best if they daren't stand up for a certain stranger that they don't know or is suspicious of his background)</div>
