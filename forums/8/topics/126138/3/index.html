Most of them are Islamic countries, yet they are so divided. It can also be argued that most are Arabs, yet they are constantly fighting. Dragg further pointed out the China, Taiwan issue. There are alot more examples to be found. It's evident that each nation acts according to their best interests. If you are expecting any racial favors, you are going to be sorely disappointed.</div>

Though, the Japanese have made several apologies in the past but none of them were official. Furthermore, they view the visit to the shrine as a sign of respect for those who had died for their country. They likened it to Bill Clinton ( a Vietnam war protestor) visiting the Vietnam War Memorial on Veteran's day. And with the recent China/Korea protests which sometimes turns ugly, I don't think that they are in an apologetic mood.<br><br>About the PM's visit,  I dun think solah. He himself did not expect to get such a hostile reaction. He did not expect his visit to be misunderstood as a sign of support for Taiwan.<br></div>

Please direct me to the link.<br><br>However, I do know -- according to this BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1443233.stm" rel="nofollow">article</a> -- that "in a <strong>rare</strong> move" only about 30 Japanese schools and a local education board in the Tochigi Prefecture rejected the textbooks in 2001. Please enlighten us how your source could interpret 30 out of more than 50,000 schools, and 1 out of 47 Prefectures in Japan as the "majority".<br><br>Also, I do know -- according to this IHT <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/04/06/news/letter.html" rel="nofollow">article</a> -- that the latest editions of the textbooks have made even more glaring modifications (as follows) to the 2001 Japanese version of the Sino-Japanese war:<br><br>1. "Comfort women" (female sex slaves of mostly Chinese and Korean origin who were forced to service Japanese fighting men in the field) is omitted.<br><br>2. Forced Asian labour brought to Japan is now voluntary Asian labour.<br><br>3. Death toll in Rape of Nanjing is now trivialised from figures to "many".<br><br>The IHT article (incidentally written by a Japanese columnist) also stated that Japan's largest newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun had largely supported the latest versions of the textbook and claimed "good reason" to remove the topic of "comfort women".<br><br>One could only imagine the chagrin of the poor women at this news. Their rapists may be dead, but some of these pitiful women are still living out the horror of the past up to this day. To borrow a phrase from the late writer Iris Chang, <strong>the abused "comfort women" are now being raped a second time</strong>, this time by defenders of the Japanese army who belittle the women's suffering and attempt to erase them from memory.<br><br>Please tell your information source to get the facts right first.</div>
