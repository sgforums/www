I was just explaining the rational behind why rapists are kept behind bars for long period of time and in case of Singapore, also caned (actually many countries too). All these punishments are carried out to ensure that the rapists do not forget their crime.<br><br>The act of boycott is strictly not to "punish" the japs per say. I will think of it more as to alert the Jap gov that the chinese and koreans are not push-overs in demanding a change to the japs history txt books. Accurate txt books are important to educate the jap youths so that the rightish military jap gov will not rise up again. With jap's economic might and high technologies who knows what type of terror will a military-minded rightish jap gov do to the east Asia region.<br><br></div>
