            <div class='col-md body'>I just happened to know that people on public transport keep away from nurses who who work at TTSH and the communicable disease centre, taxis also refuse to pick them up when they try to get a cab from outside TTSH or the centre.  This is rather understandable behaviour from Singaporeans.<br><br>However, sometimes matter are taken too far.  Residents at some blocks, upon knowing they have nurses from TTSH or the centre living in their blocks, they have posted a notice at the lifts telling nurses from these 2 places to please NOT take the lifts.  Erm, how then do they propose the nurses get to and fro from their houses especially if they live on the higher floors.<br><br>Perhaps it'll be wise if TTSH, the communicable disease centre, and now NUH, provide accomodation for their staff involved in the handling of SARS patients.  Also, why quarantine people who have come into contact with SARS but not the nurses themselves, who have the most contact with SARS patients, albeit with protective gear. ..?</div>
