            <div class='col-md body'>Came across this article on the internet and thought it might be worth sharing... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><blockquote><br><strong>The pros and cons of an in-house romance</strong><br><br>With our working hours increasing every year, it's hardly surprising that some of us find comfort in the arms of a co-worker.<br><br>Our ever-increasing working hours and a corporate culture that includes extensive post-work socialising, combine to create a social hotbed in which office romances can't help but blossom.<br><br>"I met Sarah when we worked on a project together," says Greg, a marketing executive. "The attraction was instant Â— and obvious Â— and by the time the project was over, we were talking about moving in together," he says.<br><br>But in-house dating is not all meaningful glances across the office and illicit lunchtime rendezvous. A failed workplace relationship has the potential to lead to harassment and to a complaint under the Sexual Discrimination Act, according to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.<br><br>"When we stopped seeing each other it was terrible," says Diane, who dated co-worker Kerry for two months. "He took it really badly and started saying things about me to others at work. It was really hard," she says. Luckily, for Diane, her tormentor came to his senses before any real damage was done.<br><br>And when love at work does go wrong, it's not just jilted lovers who feel the pain.<br><br><strong>The fallout</strong><br>After the end of workplace liaisons, some employees claim they have been the victim of sexual harassment, discrimination or unfair dismissal. A woman who had an affair with a member of the family that owned her firm claimed she was harassed out of a job after she ended the relationship. The claim was settled out of court.<br><br>In the US, a jury awarded a woman US$250,000 for a sexual harassment and discrimination claim after an office love went wrong. Three years after ending an affair with a senior exec at her workplace, the employee found she was out of a job. The exec had gotten wind that she was in a new relationship and set about intimidating and questioning her about the relationship. He threatened her future with the company, and allegedly encouraged her to end the relationship and come back to him. She received compensation for lost pay, back pay, and punitive damages.<br><br>Little wonder then, that legal practice is stepping in to help protect the rights of dating co-workers Â— and their employers.<br><br><strong>Sign up before we hook up</strong><br>In the US, dating co-workers can sign a "consensual relationship agreement," or more commonly, a "love contract". A love contract is a legal agreement between two employees which confirms that they are in a consensual relationship. These agreements are brokered by law firms.<br><br>Signing such a document allows the dating couple to come clean about their affair, effectively protecting either party from future sexual harassment claims from eachother should things head south. The contract also covers the employer from any lawsuits that may follow should the relationship disintegrate.<br><br>It is estimated that a few thousand such "love contracts" are written in the States each year. This number is increasing along with the number of hours we are spending at work. In Australia, the average worker easily clocking up 40-plus hours per week; in the US that number is closer to 45 hours per week.<br><br><strong>How to do office romance the right way</strong><br>Managing an in-house affair the right way requires all the skill and dexterity of a circus performer. Keeping your professional appearance, workload and personal life intact is a juggling act that few have successfully mastered.<br><br><strong>Don't make the relationship something it isn't</strong><br>If you want to keep things casual with your co-worker, say so at the start. Your colleague-turned-lover will appreciate your honesty more than they will appreciate being unceremoniously flicked after one or two casual encounters.<br><br><strong>Don't make it with the boss</strong><br>There are sooo many reasons why this should be a no-go dating zone. Firstly, your colleagues will gossip and complain if you get a pay rise or a promotion no matter how much you've earned it. Second, if things do go bad with the boss, there is a multitude of ways he or she can make life uncomfortable for you around the workplace Â— from not approving holiday leave requests, to picking up where they left off with another member of staff.<br><br><strong>Don't make it public knowledge</strong><br>Sure, the sparks flying between you two might be hard to miss, but you don't need to send a group e-mail to the team advising them of your dating status. Officially confirming an in-house relationship is a risky move, even in an organisation that has more relaxed policies on dating.<br><br><strong>Don't throw caution to the wind</strong><br>Sure, some relationships that start at work go on to bigger things. But before you get frisky with a co-worker in the copier room, ask yourself: "If this ends badly, how will it reflect on me and how will it affect my career?"<br><br>Because if things do come to an end with an office affair, love might not be the only thing you've lost ...<br></blockquote></div>
