Good eg is the one I just quoted.    Think hawkers are good in providing bad service.  YOu know if u don't buy things from them but buy from other stalls, when one day patronise the stall, they give that sort of sickening lousy service.  Like as if to tell people :  I am not happy to serve you and do business with you because u don't buy things from me but buy from other stalls.  This happen so many times!!!</div>
