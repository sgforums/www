Why subject yourself to that which u need not subject yourself to? U don't understand buddhism well enuf to think buddhists would feel offended. And taoism which is what is widespread in sg, is not buddhism. Maybe the taoists will feel offended, and maybe muslims would have adverse reactions ala satanic verses, but do u really want yr religion compared to one whose extremists advocate violence against non-believers? Do u want xtianity to go back to the barbaric period of xtianity where non-believers are burnt at stake?<br><br>U really just need to lighten up. don't u realise some other xtians are laughing at u getting so worked up over something that is nothing?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

I won't feel anything as i am sensible enough to know it's classified as fiction. Be logical and mature when u handle things, and not be sensitive like you</div>

Why subject yourself to that which u need not subject yourself to? U don't understand buddhism well enuf to think buddhists would feel offended. And taoism which is what is widespread in sg, is not buddhism. Maybe the taoists will feel offended, and maybe muslims would have adverse reactions ala satanic verses, but do u really want yr religion compared to one whose extremists advocate violence against non-believers? Do u want xtianity to go back to the barbaric period of xtianity where non-believers are burnt at stake?<br><br>U really just need to lighten up. don't u realise some other xtians are laughing at u getting so worked up over something that is nothing?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>uhh. yea okay... easy to say. anyway, my church too isnt boycotting it and im in fact gonna watch it to see how ridiculous the storyline of the show can be.</div>
