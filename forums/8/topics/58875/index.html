            <div class='col-md body'>Frustration: Her 'command and conquer' ways<br><br>JOE got four miserable dollars a day allowance.<br>No, Joe wasn't a kid in primary school. He was 27, a salaried man, and married. And the sum was what his wife of two years gave him for lunch every day after confiscating his monthly pay of $1,200. Breakfast and dinner were provided by her.<br><br>To be fair, she also gave him three cigarettes a day. Not that she wanted to help him quit - she's a heavy smoker herself. She just felt any more would be a waste on him.<br><br>And she didn't mind handing out some more of his own money to him so that he could buy petrol for his motorcycle, as long as he submitted a strict mileage and destination record every time he asked for it.<br><br>Heaven forbid if he should claim more than necessary. He would have to give a blow-by-blow account of his whereabouts.<br><br>Joe, now 28, is big-sized and looks like he can hold his own. After all, he rides a Harley and has multiple tattoos.<br><br>He's just, well, terribly nice.<br><br>Nice enough to end up marrying Rita even though his intention was to dump her.<br><br>"I wanted to break up with her after being together for two years because I felt there was no future for us. She was really possessive and bossy. But then she tried to take her own life after I brought it up.<br><br>"While she was lying in hospital, she asked me to marry her. How can you say no in this type of situation, right?"<br><br>Er, right. So the couple got married in 1998, and moved into their flat. Somehow, Joe tolerated what he called his "command and conquer" wife and her nasty rules, even after she proved to be a nightmare.<br><br>"We had a spare bedroom in our flat so I suggested that my mum could come and stay over whenever she wanted. Rita said she wanted her mum to have the room. Her mum lives one street away! But she just told me my mum was my problem and that was that."<br><br>It wasn't always so bad, though. When the couple first met while working at the same cafe, Rita was an adventurous girl. Joe loved to ride his motorbike - he had a scrambler then - and Rita would ride pillion as he took dangerous jumps. The couple would also spend hours at coffee shops just chatting.<br><br>But the witch in Rita started to emerge after some time. Her temper flared easily, and her possessive and controlling nature reared its ugly head. When Joe wanted out, Rita swallowed 35 paracetamol pills and landed herself in hospital.<br><br>So Joe found himself with a wife that wouldn't allow him to indulge in his hobbies, biking and sailing. He wasn't allowed to meet his friends, and his pay went into a joint account that he couldn't access.<br><br>"She said she wanted to keep my pay because I could not control my spending, but I don't waste money. We bought most of the furniture and appliances for the house with my savings!"<br><br>Although Joe hinted at separation and divorce on several occasions but never demanded it, it was Rita who eventually wanted a divorce, much to his relief.<br><br>She took everything that she had paid for, down to the chopsticks and bed sheets.<br><br>He doesn't mind though. When she left, Joe took his bike for a long ride to celebrate.<br><br>"That woman was a real b**** from hell, and I've learnt my lesson. Good luck to the next guy she hooks up with, man."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Understand women? Don't even try<br><br>THE harsh reality is this: Most men simply don't know what women want.<br><br>And, really, who can blame us?<br><br>Unlike men, whose desires can be categorised into beer, women and football, the female sex is one of incredible complexity.<br><br>When I say complexity, I'm trying to be nice here. I actually mean to say contradiction, but I really don't want my wife to lock me out of the bedroom tonight.<br><br>Seriously, though, just think about it.<br><br>They want equality, yet they still want doors opened and chairs pulled for them.<br><br>They demand that we do housework, since they also have careers these days, but when we clean, they tell us not to touch things around the house because we mess them up.<br><br>They get insanely jealous if any other girls look at their partners, but they themselves crave attention from other men.<br><br>They call us sexist when we admire a woman's well-proportioned chest, but it's okay if a bunch of girlfriends get together to check out a cute guy's cute butt.<br><br>They can't believe we can spend two hours to play computer games, yet see nothing wrong in spending four hours choose a pair of shoes.<br><br>You know, sometimes, I wonder if God created women just to have fun with us.<br><br>I mean, how is it possible that a being created out of our rib is so completely confusing to us?<br><br>This entire article might sound strange, especially coming from a married man.<br><br>But, you see, I can say all these things with authority because my lack of understanding of femaledom didn't hamper the development of my relationship with my wife.<br><br>When it comes to understanding women, there are really only two things you can do, but alcholism is generally frowned upon by society, not to mention that the hangover's a pain.<br><br>So, really, there is only option two.<br><br>Which is, don't even try.<br><br>Just chalk women down as one of those great mysteries in life, like why no women care that Keanu Reeves is a bad actor.<br><br>You see, I think we're just not meant to understand what's going on inside their heads, simply because it then makes the journey of discovery all that more engaging.<br><br>I've known my wife for some 16 years now, and I'm still peeling the layers off her every day to understand her better.<br><br>And not just her. Some of my best female friends, I'm also relishing knowing more about them as the years go by.<br><br>The journey's hit some rocky bumps, for sure, but you can never say that it's been uninteresting.<br><br>If you're Christian, then you will know that women are a gift to men, although He might have been sniggering as He pulled out our rib.<br><br>I think that they are, indeed, for the world would be terrible without them. But to paraphrase a line from the movie Spider-Man (who also can't understand women, by the way) they are our gift, they are our curse.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Frustration: Wife said her new lover was much more fun<br>ROB envisioned a married life which had stability and security.<br><br>But when he tied the knot with Rina, he realised she saw things differently. She just wanted to have fun.<br><br>To make matters worse, she ended up having an affair with another man while he was in Australia completing his degree.<br><br>Problems began about half a year after their 2001 wedding.<br><br>Rob, a 27-year-old project manager, said: "A few months after I went overseas, I noticed a change in her behaviour. On the phone, she'd be very impatient with me.<br><br>"At first, I thought it was just work stress. But when I came home, she admitted she had gotten to know someone else."<br><br>The guy was someone whom Rina, a 25-year-old technical officer, had met during her part-time degree course.<br><br>Rob also found out from mutual friends that while he had been away, Rina had continued a life of singlehood - clubbing, partying and flirting with other men.<br><br>He said: "She's an outgoing person and doesn't like to stay at home. She once told me that she prefers to hang out with guys more than girls."<br><br>They married after dating a few years because they "felt it was the right time".<br><br>He added that, despite the affair, he was "very patient" with Rina.<br><br>"I didn't even scold her. I was willing to really give the marriage a try."<br><br>Back in Australia, Rob said he would send Rina cards and call her frequently.<br><br>"But I found out from friends that she was with him. She wasn't willing to make the marriage work. She didn't try as hard as I did. Before I returned, she said she wanted a divorce to be with the other guy."<br><br>The couple eventually annulled their marriage in the middle of this year.<br><br>"Ultimately, I think she was looking for a particular lifestyle, not a lifelong partner. She wanted to be married and yet have fun and lead a single person's life.<br><br>"However, I am someone who is serious about marriage. I want to settle down and spend time at home. She told me that there was nothing wrong with me. But the other guy was just much more fun."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Frustration: Her late nights got more frequent<br>IF we go by what the ladies said last Sunday, this Singapore man is guilty of being bodoh-sexual on two counts.<br><br>First, Frank doesn't have a high-flying job and hasn't taken steps to improve himself professionally. He works long and irregular hours. But his wife is far from perfect.<br><br>Frank, 27, married Tisa four years ago after dating her for three years. Tisa periodically complained that Frank neglected her because of his job, and said he should further his education so he could find a better job with more pay.<br><br>Tisa also formed a habit of staying out past 3am with her friends. The late nights got more frequent, even when she knew Frank would not be working.<br><br>In March last year, Tisa asked for a divorce out of the blue.<br><br>Frank was stunned: "My mind was blank, I kept repeating to myself that she just said it on a whim and didn't mean it."<br><br>Later, Frank saw a car stop by his block. Tisa got out and waved goodbye to the man who had driven her home. It happened again the next night, and Frank confronted her.<br><br>"She hemmed and hawed, like she didn't know what to say," said Frank. "It was then that I granted her the divorce."<br><br>But, in November, after a family outing, the couple reconciled.<br><br>Then, in February, Tisa chose a cruise trip with her friends over spending time with Frank. And she didn't come home even after he told her that he wasn't feeling well.<br><br>That proved to be the final straw. Frank is waiting for the five-year no-sale rule on his flat to expire next year before starting divorce proceedings.<br><br>He now sleeps in a separate room.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Frustration: Her tantrums and 'drama-drama' display<br>HE thought he had married his dream woman.<br><br>But his hopes were dashed when his wife turned out to be a 'selfish and petty' bully.<br><br>Shawn (not his real name), 27, had his marriage annulled two years ago. He married his first love, an attractive fashion designer, when he was 23.<br><br>The marriage lasted less than two years.<br><br>The car dealer said: 'My ex-wife was nice and gentle before we got married. But, after marriage, she showed her true colours.'<br><br>Shawn said they had dated for three or four years.<br><br>During that time, his ex-wife, who is a year younger, was supportive and got along well with his parents.<br><br>But, as wife, she became a terror.<br><br>She refused to allow his father to move into their four-room flat, which Shawn had bought for their marriage.<br><br>He recalled: 'She wanted her mother to move in instead and she wanted more space in the house. I was so angry but we compromised finally and neither of our parents moved in.'<br><br>More problems followed.<br><br>Shawn said his ex-wife was unwilling to do housework. He felt cheated as she had seemed a virtuous woman who would help out with household chores.<br><br>She also told him to come home by 11pm and to spend less time with his friends.<br><br>He said: 'If I didn't give in to her, she would start to lose her temper, shout, slam the door and go into all drama-drama.'<br><br>He also complained that she focused too much on her career and neglected him.<br><br>He said: 'Our relationship deteriorated to the point where we had no sex life to speak of. And, although I didn't mind having kids, she wasn't interested.'<br><br>His ex-wife was extremely calculating with money.<br><br>He said: 'Normally, I pay the household bills but, sometimes, she'd pay the bills first and then I'd return her the money. If I shortchanged her by $50, she'd get angry and grumble.'<br><br>The last straw came when she started staying out late.<br><br>Shawn, who has a steady girlfriend now, said: 'I felt she didn't care for this family any more, so there was no point in trying to work things out.'<br><br>He said he and his ex-wife are no longer friends.<br><br>With a hint of annoyance, he said: 'Just talking about her makes me feel lousy.'<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
