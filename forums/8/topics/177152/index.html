            <div class='col-md body'>Mine's opposite the cisco barrack 15 yrs ago.. but at those times they don't always have trainee. I remember the worst was when doing OB duty.. dame lonely .. and in a very secluded location. Anyway, I climbed out of the compound twice and partied.<br><br>About the OB part, on one occasion in the middle of the night, Something woke my up, as I felt something on my face. Instinctively, My hand reach out to smack it...... guess what It was a Fcuking BAT sucking blood from my lips  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> . WTF, and I personally saw it flew towards the louvers, in a Jackie Chan manourve between the slid. I slept with the lights on because I was the only SOB on the block... you understand.<br><br>I jumped out of bed to discover I was bleeding in the Lips and MY BLOOD was all over my throat area and bedsheet.... like a crime scene murderer ! WTF<br><br>My lips were swollen for a week, and was worried like hell.. that I might has Rabbies. When to see the bloody (unqualified) singh resident doctor.. Not only did he only gave panado.. but gave me a smirk when I told him I was attacked by a <strong>VAMPIRE BAT</strong>.... KNN didn't give me MC..

            <div class='col-md body'>There are many fun things also..... At one time, during confinement weekend. We decide to have Korean BBQ in the Bunk. We brought an ultra thin mess tin as a stove... smuggled some fresh meat  and started BBQ.<br><br>Guess what ... It was not a good idea.. It seemed that the oil and tha tin couldn't take the heat.. and the whole mess tin was ablaze with fire. ... Imagine the amt smoke created... Especially pouring cups of water help spread the fire.... what WTF... imagine the comotion, swearing and bewilderness. Anywhere, We were able to put out the fire by covering the fire with wet blankets and tons of water on it.<br><br>To make things worst... the OCS trainee on inspection round came.... who notice the whole lenght block was missy than usual. I think we held the world record of fatique duties of clearing the mess.... actually we dumped the whole mess out the rear window and hose the floor to cover the carbon smell.<br><br>The Inspection team came up.. and asked if anything wrong and why the floor is wet. We wayang all the way.. saying that one of my bunk mate was possessed and when wild and we had to drouse him. Then one of them enquire about the Carbon smell. We said we were also curious why and that we had notice it the whole night... They looked puzzled and left.<br><br>As the inspection team was walking away... We understood why... KNN the whole entire blocks of barrack was heavily misty and very spocky... maybe they were spooked too.. while coming here... damn lucky... then again it was actually smoke.<br><br>You see... the inspection team have to walk across a make-shift wooden bridge over a small river in thick vegetation to get to our block. While the fire was going on one of my bunk mate was "watching the water".<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Talking about the Make-shift wooden bridge...<br><br>About a month later, we Kana weekend confinement again... you can guess my service record isn't that great.... anyway .. we were sick and bored with nothing to do. we decided to smuggle out again... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  but the damn OCS inspection team might check up on us. CB<br><br>So, one of us decided to play a prank. Out came the pliers... you see .. that wooden bridge was lashed togather by metal wires to metal poles holding two wooden planks as a walk way... well that's where the plier come in.<br><br>We cut the wires at diagonal locations  and those holding the planks. The thing abour wires is they don't just give way when cut and still held the planks. Well, we ran up to the third floor of our bunks which was the third block away and waited.<br><br>Well, about an hour they appeared and as they were walking over the bridge.. it gave way to one side and the OCS fellas slipped into the river.. ha ha ha. You can hear them swear a mile away. We watched the whole event for the whole 15 mins worth. One of them, was still swearing as they retreated back to where they came.<br><br>Incidentally, the bridge was repaired over Sunday. I did not hear of the incident being even mention on monday.</div>
