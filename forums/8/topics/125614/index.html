            <div class='col-md body'>Two women are new arrivals at the Pearly Gates and are comparing stories on how they died.<br><br>1st women: "I froze to death."<br><br>2nd women: "How horrible!"<br><br>1st woman: "It wasn't so bad. After I quit shaking from the cold, I began to get warm and sleepy, and finally died a peaceful death. What about you?"<br><br>2nd woman: "I died of a massive heart attack. I suspected that my husband was cheating, so I came home early to catch him in the act. But instead, I found him all by himself in the den watching TV."<br><br>1st woman: "So what happened?"<br><br>2nd woman: "I was so sure there was another woman there somewhere that I started running all over the house looking. I ran up into the attic and searched, and down into the basement. Then I went through every closet and checked under all the beds. I kept this up until I had looked everywhere, and finally I became so exhausted that I just keeled over with a heart attack and died!"<br><br>1st woman: "Too bad you didn't look in the freezer. We'd both still be alive"!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After his death, Osama bin Laden went to heaven. There he was greeted by George Washington, who proceeded to slap him across the face and yell at him, "How dare you try to destroy the nation I helped conceive!"<br><br>Patrick Henry approached and punched Osama in the nose and shouted,<br><br>"You wanted to end our liberties but you failed."<br><br>James Madison entered, kicked Osama in the stomach and said, "This is why I allowed our government to provide for the common defense!"<br><br>Thomas Jefferson came in and proceeded to beat Osama many times with a long cane and said, "It was evil men like you that provided me the inspiration to open the Declaration of Independence!"<br><br>These beatings and thrashings continued as John Rudolph, James Monroe and 66 other early Americans came in and unleashed their anger on the Muslim terrorist leader.<br><br>As Osama lay bleeding and writhing in unbearable pain an Angel appeared. Bin Laden wept in pain and said to the Angel, "This is not what you promised me."<br><br>The Angel replied, "I told you .... there would be 72 Virginians waiting for you in heaven. Why...........What did you think I said?"<br></div>
