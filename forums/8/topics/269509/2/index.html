His oxygen level in his blood was very low, obviously it has something got to do with his respiratory system, and that's definitely his sickly lungs. So obviously his cause of death is COPD, but they simply won't write that down on the death cert. and won't let us collect his body. Damn that b!tch doctor.

This is not a murder case and why should 'he' go for autopsy to find out his death?  Beside he is already dead, can just pronouce him dead and sign it and give 'him' back to u all.  If so smart should already heal the person mah, not adding on suffering.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by alleggerita:</div><div class="quote_body">Today morning at around 4.15am, my grandfather passed away at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. They only called the emergency contact person (which is my auntie) at 4.20am, telling her that my grandfather was "very ill" when in fact he's already dead. This is still acceptable as maybe some doctor is trying to resuscitate my grandfather while the nurse contacted my auntie.<br><br>But what PISSED my WHOLE family off was when the doctor in-charged of signing off my grandfather's death cert. told us that they "suspected" foul play and they are handing the case over to the coroner and let the coroner decide whether should they do an autopsy to find the cause of death.<br>We objected to autopsy as that would mean "cutting up" my grandfather. We would never let that happen.<br><br>Ok, let's backtrack a little here. The reason that my grandfather was admitted into hospital was due to his constipation. After X-Ray-ing his tummy, doctors said there's a lot of stool that needs to be cleared. They also found out that his lungs was infected, AGAIN. My grandfather has COPD final stage due to his smoking habit last time. COPD is a form of lung disease. His lungs will get infected every now and then and he got to have constant oxygen supply. Doctors initially said he wouldn't survive till Feburary, but he managed to struggle all the way to 21st of July. Probably thanks to his SHARP mind. I would say his mind is only "60-years-old" even though in truth he's already 87-years-old.<br><br>So after TTSH treated his constipation, they said he can be discharged after just ONE day. We were all shocked at that point in time, we thought TTSH wasn't going to treat his lungs infection. But last minute, TTSH changed their mind and decided not to discharge my grandfather. So on that night at 4am, when the nurse on night-duty checked out my grandfather, his oxygen level in his blood is already very low and he's non-responsive, probably in a coma already. He called for a doctor to come and when the doctor came at 4.15am, it was too late.<br><br>Reason for an autopsy?! The doctor can't determine did my grandfather died of constipation or because of his COPD. ABSOLUTE CRAP! His oxygen level in his blood was very low, obviously it has something got to do with his respiratory system, and that's definitely his sickly lungs. So obviously his cause of death is COPD, but they simply won't write that down on the death cert. and won't let us collect his body. Damn that b!tch doctor. I bet she's just trying to do an experiment on my grandfather to see how can he survive the final stage of COPD for so long.<br><br>We will definitely sue TTSH for that when the wake is over and everything has settled down. Thanks to anyone who cared to read my ultra-long post as I simply needed somewhere to rant about this incident.</div></blockquote>I am sorry to hear abt this. My condolences..<br>but let me share my 2 cents worth-<br>there are some criteria as to when to refer a case to the coroner, one of which is when the cause of death is unclear or unexpected. While reading your entry on your grandfather, the most likely cause of death is still COPD, he might not be expected to succumb that night (i.e the sudden deterioration of his condition). And the female doctor who was on call that night will not and should not sign the death certificate just that. Of course i can't over-generalise all cases.<br><br>Moreover, i don't think she is in any way related to the autopsy/"experiment" cos it won't be done by her anyway.<br><br>Communication does play an important role in managing doctor-patient and doctor-relative relationship, and i believe this is probably the root of all problems even in other working community.</div>
