            <div class='col-md body'>Today morning at around 4.15am, my grandfather passed away at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. They only called the emergency contact person (which is my auntie) at 4.20am, telling her that my grandfather was "very ill" when in fact he's already dead. This is still acceptable as maybe some doctor is trying to resuscitate my grandfather while the nurse contacted my auntie.<br><br>But what PISSED my WHOLE family off was when the doctor in-charged of signing off my grandfather's death cert. told us that they "suspected" foul play and they are handing the case over to the coroner and let the coroner decide whether should they do an autopsy to find the cause of death.<br>We objected to autopsy as that would mean "cutting up" my grandfather. We would never let that happen.<br><br>Ok, let's backtrack a little here. The reason that my grandfather was admitted into hospital was due to his constipation. After X-Ray-ing his tummy, doctors said there's a lot of stool that needs to be cleared. They also found out that his lungs was infected, AGAIN. My grandfather has COPD final stage due to his smoking habit last time. COPD is a form of lung disease. His lungs will get infected every now and then and he got to have constant oxygen supply. Doctors initially said he wouldn't survive till Feburary, but he managed to struggle all the way to 21st of July. Probably thanks to his SHARP mind. I would say his mind is only "60-years-old" even though in truth he's already 87-years-old.<br><br>So after TTSH treated his constipation, they said he can be discharged after just ONE day. We were all shocked at that point in time, we thought TTSH wasn't going to treat his lungs infection. But last minute, TTSH changed their mind and decided not to discharge my grandfather. So on that night at 4am, when the nurse on night-duty checked out my grandfather, his oxygen level in his blood is already very low and he's non-responsive, probably in a coma already. He called for a doctor to come and when the doctor came at 4.15am, it was too late.<br><br>Reason for an autopsy?! The doctor can't determine did my grandfather died of constipation or because of his COPD. ABSOLUTE CRAP! His oxygen level in his blood was very low, obviously it has something got to do with his respiratory system, and that's definitely his sickly lungs. So obviously his cause of death is COPD, but they simply won't write that down on the death cert. and won't let us collect his body. Damn that b!tch doctor. I bet she's just trying to do an experiment on my grandfather to see how can he survive the final stage of COPD for so long.<br><br>We will definitely sue TTSH for that when the wake is over and everything has settled down. Thanks to anyone who cared to read my ultra-long post as I simply needed somewhere to rant about this incident.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Err..i also got a minor problem with TTSH. I got infected cause i got too many ear piercings so they decided to make another appt. wif the Ear doctor. Before the appointment, I had to be taken into an A &amp; E rm to extract out the earrings..so after they extracted it out, they told me to see the ear doctor instead to check for any other infection.<br><br>Luckily, on that day itself when i got home, my mum helped me to clean my ears wif the antibiotics &amp; so i thought, "well, then cancel the appt. ba", it looks like it's healing fast already. So i called them up the next day to cancel the appt. &amp; they told me it wasn't in their records at all!! wtf  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> what if i see i really tio infection &amp; kena disfigured? (in their own words &amp; somemore the ear doctor told me to see him fast the next two days)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> then their hospital always so busy &amp; i overheard one couple waited for the ear doctor for like 8++hrs?? waa..??<br><br>Fast forward, ohh well, luckily my ears are healed completely &amp; nicely now.<br><br>(Sry ear &amp; what doctor..forgot liao)</div>

The sh!t went into the blood? Can't be..The sh!t blocked the flow of oxygen? Impossible..and his stools was already CLEARED when he passed away..means his constipation was, technically, already SOLVED..left the lungs infection problem..so with only one "possible cause of death" now, COPD is definitely the most probable cause of death..of cuz, "probable" is not enough for doctors, but being professional and with experience, they should know COPD is 99.99% the cause of death..</div>

Doctors initially said he wouldn't survive till Feburary, but he managed to struggle all the way to 21st of July. Probably thanks to his SHARP mind. I would say his mind is only "60-years-old" even though in truth he's already 87-years-old.<br><br>So after TTSH treated his constipation, they said he can be discharged after just ONE day. We were all shocked at that point in time, we thought TTSH wasn't going to treat his lungs infection. But last minute, TTSH changed their mind and decided not to discharge my grandfather. So on that night at 4am, when the nurse on night-duty checked out my grandfather, his oxygen level in his blood is already very low and he's non-responsive, probably in a coma already. He called for a doctor to come and when the doctor came at 4.15am, it was too late.<br><br>Reason for an autopsy?! The doctor can't determine did my grandfather died of constipation or because of his COPD. ABSOLUTE CRAP! His oxygen level in his blood was very low, obviously it has something got to do with his respiratory system, and that's definitely his sickly lungs. So obviously his cause of death is COPD, but they simply won't write that down on the death cert. and won't let us collect his body. Damn that b!tch doctor. I bet she's just trying to do an experiment on my grandfather to see how can he survive the final stage of COPD for so long.<br><br>We will definitely sue TTSH for that when the wake is over and everything has settled down. Thanks to anyone who cared to read my ultra-long post as I simply needed somewhere to rant about this incident.</div></blockquote></div>

My sis went there and complain very bad headaches..  all they prescribe is pain killer.  My sis demanded a scan, the doctor refused and say we are wasting time and money.  However, she insisted and a scan was done..  the result show some blockage at the back of the head and she had to be operated immediately..  can you imagine if my sis did not insist on the scan ?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

Their standards are horrible. Even some nurses (go to TTSH A&amp;E department you get what I mean) are better. The problem with local doctors is that they are young and are very young... they lack everything that senior and experienced doctors have.</div>
