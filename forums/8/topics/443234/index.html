              <p>I subscribe to Starhub Cable TV in August 2010 on a 12 month contract. I was offered a 6 month discount from the time I signed up. I took up the compulsory 3 Basic Tier groups and the additional Sports group.</p>
              <p>After the discounted period, my bill was about $32.50 per month. A few months later, I was informed that subscription rates will be up $2 per group and that my new bill was effectively up to $36.50 per month. That is fine to me!</p>
              <p>I had been paying this amount for months even after the contract period expires. However, I received a 'shock' of my life last month when I was billed $44.50! I did not even add in additional channels! That is $9 increase without prior notice! Bear in mind that I have no overdue amount in my bill balance.</p>
              <p>I thought to myself: "Just pay it first and see if the following bill still costs as much!" I settled the $44.50 bill and still received the $44.50 bill this current month! A $9 increase without notice! This is absurd! </p>
              <p>I now got so pissed that I will not be paying this current bill until Starhub send me a warning letter and then I will finally settle the bill and cancel my subscription!</p>
              <p>What on earth is Starhub doing? From what I understand, the tv rights to the other soccer leagues apart from the English leagues cost significantly lesser and that is why online betting companies are willing to offer free streaming of those non-English games to their customers. Maybe the reason is because Starhub came up with a show called "FC Daily" where they need to pay expert pundits to feature on the show together with the resources involved and Starhub wants to make up the costs by charging their customers more? We sports subscribers can live without this 'crap' show and pay less!!</p>
              <p>Starhub is not getting more customers and from what they are currently doing, they will lose more customers instead. Call that 'money-making'? What a joke!</p>

              <p>why didn't you use your Starhub monthly rewards points to off-set your monthly subscription bills @ <a href="http://www.starhub.com/rewards/starhubrewards/rewardspoints.html">http://www.starhub.com/rewards/starhubrewards/rewardspoints.html</a>?</p>
              <p>at least you can off-set a few dollars off, it's better than nothing at all...</p>
              <p>and by comparing all 3 telcos reward point schemes, the conclusion is that Starhub offers the best-in-value in terms of using points to off-set your bills in the catalogue.</p>

              everyone always see the small details but few people catches the big picture.
              
              the reason for these priceups here and there is because the Green line has been leaking customers, if not haemorraging them by the litres.
              
              more and more people are jumping boats to the Red line (it have the sports, it have nice bundles). those that arent are going online with faster and faster connection speeds. there is almost no lag if you time yourself properly or if you have some patience and diligence and the resources, you can schedule the DLs ahead. since you are already paying for the access, everything else is literally free. very hard to compete against that.
              
              so all thats left what the Green can do to sustain its existing network (which is still kicking and hence costing) is to milk its existing customers, or whichever new signups whom they can still sucker in. the way a business runs (and hope to continue to run) is to spread its operating costs (and profits) amongst a paying market aka a pool of willing buyers, so the more it (the paying market) shrinks, the more each buyer within that market will have to fork out for the same quality and quantity of services.
