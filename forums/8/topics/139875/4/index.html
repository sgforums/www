            <div class='col-md body'>I remember there is a terran scenario where you need to protect a female terran solider called Terra or something like that and also the proteos from ther zerg. The scenario ends when you as the terrans, successfully protect the proteos, but unfortunately, there was a mad rush of zergs which eventually capture your female solider. Later she become some zerg queen or something. The ending mad rush once started, you can't control your terran units, but you can watch the rush and it lasted for like 1 or 2 minutes.<br><br>I enjoyed watching the mad rush alot. I remembered I managed to positioned all my bunkers, battlecruisers, siege tanks,and what ever fire power i had at bottom of the 2 or 3 rams where the zergs rush down. When the ending mad rush started, i would sit back and watch the incredible zerg frying scenes. It was pretty awesome. I actually fried all the zergs, and so the female terran should be safe. But alas, the story line was fixed, she was still captured.<br><br>Anyone remember that scenario?<br><br></div>

Like, a new video technology, computer processing power, etc. Or a new concept with massive improvements. Perhaps Blizzard is waiting. Like the movie Star Wars which waited a long time for technology to improve, for its visual effects of the latest Star Wars series. If it's small improvements/ upgrade, Blizzard has done it with BroodWar, patches downloads, map downloads, etc......</div>

But SC really gives off the feeling of playing in galaxy. WC fails to produce the type of atmosphere.<br>Age of empire is a more strategic game la... Very tradition too.. all of their classic weapons sege etc etc..  Age of empire requires a better micro than WC and SC...</div>

On higher end computer, the graphics of WC3 looks much better. I knew it because my lower end computer couldn't handle the graphics well too. I came to 'wow' when I saw it on other computer. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Warcraft 3 is much better designed to have a shorter game time (each game will typically end with 30-45 minutes). Starcraft could drag on hours if two players are equally skilled.</div>
