            <div class='col-md body'>Well, in my perception, we should not only give up seats to elderly, pregnent women, small kids or parents carrying a toddler in their arms, but also to conventient of people who need that seat more than us especially at the front seats.<br><br>For example, a middle aged woman may carrying bags of groceries from the market, we should also be considerate to give up the seat for her, instead of her moving all the way back for a free seat.</div>
