She has been separated from her husband, a banker, for two years.<br><br>She is among an increasing number of Caucasian women whose marriages hit the rocks after their husbands were posted to Singapore.<br><br>And she blames their marital woes on a pretty young Singaporean woman.<br><br>Rachel, who has two adult sons from her marriage, said: 'My husband was good to us until he met a 20-something local woman. I can't make him want this family, but I believe she must have seduced him.<br><br>'My husband never strayed while we were in Australia, so I was really shocked when he said he fell in love with a Singaporean woman and wanted to marry her.'<br><br>GREAT PLACE TO LIVE<br><br>Rachel intends to return to Australia after finalising her divorce early next year. She will leave with an unpleasant aftertaste of life in Singapore.<br><br>Yes, Singapore is a great place to live and work for expatriates.<br><br>Last year, in a survey of 215 cities by Mercer Human Resource Consulting, Singapore tied with Tokyo as the most attractive Asian city for expatriates.<br><br>But Rachel's experience, along with accounts from marriage counsellors, suggest that the downside is that many expat men are enticed by local women.<br><br>Lawyers, marriage counsellors and officials of expatriate associations who spoke to The New Paper say that they are seeing more expatriates with marital problems.<br><br>Divorce lawyer Ellen Lee, who has been practising for 24 years, says she sees an average of 12 expatriate couples every year, a big jump from the three or four couples she saw annually before 2000.<br><br>Expatriate couples can have their marriages dissolved in Singapore if they have lived here for at least three years.<br><br>The most common reason for marital break-ups among expatriates is infidelity by men.<br><br>Said Ms Karen Gosling, an Australian who has been practising family counselling for 20 years: 'I'm seeing many more cases here than I ever did in Australia.'<br><br>She has been trying to mend marriages here for the past eight years. Eighty per cent of her clientele are expatriates.<br><br>'Many expatriate men are in regional positions requiring frequent travel. In some parts of Asia, prostitutes are easily available, so there's a temptation to stray.'<br><br>The Pinkerton Syndrome - when Asian women think of Caucasian men as being superior - is partly to blame.<br><br>Ms Lee said: 'Asians, including women, tend to be more submissive and receptive towards Caucasians, whereas white women are seen as equal to their male counterparts.<br><br>'So here, the white men would welcome it when local women are more than willing to serve them.'<br><br>Miss Sue Lim, a marketing executive who is engaged to a divorced American, empathises with this.<br><br>Miss Lim, who is in her 20s, said: 'Caucasians are definitely more appealing than local men. They're more gentlemanly, and they're willing to share household chores too.<br><br>'Generally, local men are still chauvinistic and don't know how to treat women like ladies.'<br><br>Was she having an affair with him before his divorce?<br><br>No, said Miss Lim. She said they began dating after he separated from his wife, although they met before his separation.<br><br>'I don't think I'm a home-wrecker because I never forced my fiance to leave his wife and children. He was the one who fell in love with me.'<br><br>At the Singapore American Community Action Council (Sacac), more expatriates are also seeking marriage counselling at its office in the American Club.<br><br>Ms Margo Passarella, a counsellor at Sacac, sees eight to 10 couples a week, an increase from previous years. But she claims that it is not only because of male infidelity.<br><br>She said: 'Infidelity is not uncommon. Usually, though not exclusively, it's the men who had the indiscretion. But there are also many reasons for marital problems.'<br><br>LONELY WIVES<br><br>There are expatriate wives who cheat on their husbands too.<br><br>Ms Gosling said: 'While their expatriate husbands travel, the wives are left here alone, without anyone to see to their emotional needs.'<br><br>Two of her clients were a British couple. The wife had been having an affair with a friend of theirs for nearly two years.<br><br>A lack of communication was the root of the couple's problems, which were compounded by the husband's frequent travels and long working hours.<br><br>Despite more expatriate marriages getting into trouble, there is a silver lining - couples who seek counselling are keen on salvaging their relationships.<br><br>Besides seeking help, the wives, says Ms Gosling, have a lot to lose if they divorce their husbands.<br><br>It takes between six and 12 sessions for these couples to get their marriages back on track.<br><br>She said: 'A marriage involves money, extended family ties and children. It's very hard to walk away from all that.<br><br>'During counselling, I suggest strategies to help my clients rebuild the trust in the relationship, so that the marriage becomes better than before.'<br><br>When counselling and other avenues fail, some expatriate couples prefer to return to their home countries for divorce. This is because divorce laws here are different.<br><br>The women, especially, may want to have their divorce finalised in their homeland if they can get a better deal.<br><br>Lawyer Wong Kai Yun said: 'It's more practical for the couple to divorce in their own country, if most of their assets are there.<br><br>'Certain agreements may also be easier to enforce overseas. For example, pre-nuptial agreements are acceptable in the West, but they're outlawed here.'<br><br></div>

They also lack emotional support from their families.'<br><br>Lawyer Ellen Lee said that because of their financial dependence, many expatriate wives are worried about maintenance in the event of a divorce.<br><br>'Most of the time, the husbands are willing to pay their wives alimony because they accept that as their responsibility.<br><br>'The wives tend to seek custody of the children, while the men are only too happy to give the children up so they can start afresh easily.'<br><br>It is also not easy for these women to get jobs here because of employment pass issues and cultural differences.<br><br>If these women come here on dependents' passes, they could be revoked should they divorce.<br><br>She said: 'Many Caucasian women prefer to return to their homelands with their children as they're more accustomed to their own cultures.<br><br>'They could apply for employment passes to continue living here, but only if they possess the necessary skills and qualifications.'<br><br>CALL THEM FOR HELP<br><br>IF you're an expat and facing a marital crisis, here are some organisations and centres you can turn to:<br><br>Singapore American Community Action Council (Sacac): They offer counselling and community programmes, and can also provide a divorce/relationship support group.<br><br>Membership is open to all persons living here.<br><br>Tel: 6733 9249<br><br>The Association of Women for Action and Research (Aware): The organisation focuses on women's welfare and social issues, and offers helpline assistance, legal advice and professional counselling to women in need.
