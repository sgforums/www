            <div class='col-md body'>Neurotica,<br><br>I make no apologies for the word bastard. The post was directed to you, the word bastard directed to people whom you so elegantly described, specifically the ones who broke your heart previously (you know, the low lives), the word women directed at, well, females.<br><br>Nowadays, the word bastard means so much more than the conventional meaning i.e. the illegitimacy part. Bear in mind that I do not have the guts to swear at people face to face.<br><br>As for invasion of privacy part, you lost me there. You private business is of course your own. However, recall that I used "contact details". No comments about privacy there. In fact, I hope more ladies would be so forthcoming with their contact details like you. It sure would make things a lot less difficult. I meant that you sure are bold in posting your details up front. So, for me, its was like "wow, daring man!!" rather than whatever other that statement implies.<br><br>Anyway.<br><br>I shouldn't spoil the intended purpose of this thread by bringing in all these debate. A bit trigger happy with verbal sparring nowadays, and words are easily misintepreted. I shall stop here.<br><br>Enjoy yourselves.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 18 November 2000).]</div>
