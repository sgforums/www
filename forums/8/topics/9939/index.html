            <div class='col-md body'>yup i agree with nytemare, they might resort to those illegal abortions...<br><br>ok.. wat acidhurt said about big decisions should be made by the parents... but i mean i tink the parents would be sensible to tell their daughter to get rid of the child... for a young girl of 13 to give birth to a child will most likely cause serious health complications for both the girl and the child.. so wouldn't the logical decision be to abort??</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I agree wif nytemare too... Some parents are not that understanding towards their children too.. Instead of advising them or helping them, beats them and condemn them.. To some parents, they feel that it brings shame of the girl is not married. Not all pple can emphatise wif the girl... Even for counsellors, I doubt they can fully understand how the girl really feels, unless they haf underwent the process themselves.. even then, the seriousness to everyone is different...<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore is not that big a country whre illegal abortions can become rampant and our doctors are too kiasu to prefer illegal procedures,so i think illegal abortions being introduced in Singapore is a unlikely idea,but i think the age should be increased to 18 or 21 as this is the time when the girl can really think for herself and not as a kid,ehehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>If I knew it would be the last time that I'd see you on my plate,<br>I would eat you up and pray the Lord, i put on some weight<br>If I knew it would be the last time that I see you drop onto the floor,<br>I would call the waiter over and ask for 1 more.<br>If I knew it would be the last meal before i go to sleep,<br>I would sleep soundly knowing you are in my stomach deep.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">~~~<br>Waiting for Diablo 2 Add-on <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That's why Singapore introduced the law of having sex with a minor(that is below 16.5 yrs of age) being a offence.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>True. Think of the implications. Some would really resort to drastic measures (suicide inclusive) to escape the problem. So it might not be a really good idea to have the parents making such a decision. Some parents are not really that understanding.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>My personal opinion: What do it in the first place if u know the consequences??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>but i personally think that 13 is a very young age where a girl would be very vulnerable and immature. if the govt states the minimum age to be 13, it could indirectly encourage teenagers of today to engage in sexual activities. the govt keeps lowering the age limit...and very soon, the age might drop to 8 years old or even as long as the girl has reached puberty!!!<br><br>------------------<br>tHe BeSt aNd MosT bEaUtiFuL tHinGs iN tHe wOrLd cAnnOt bE sEEn oR tOuChEd. tHeY mUsT bE fELt wItH tHe hEaRt...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all I would like to say this is a v nice topic to discuss.<br>Personally, I felt that parents' consent to abortions are essential to the root o the problem. Teens nowadays do not noe consequences of abortion.......here pain thee pain after the abortion, n one may be weak after the abortion. I once read a magfrom a counsellor stating that it has its side effects to the weaker ones. Better to be safe than sorry! Do not engage in pre-marital sex. V sad to c younger n younger aged gers so naive n dun encouraged them not to go 4 abortion. I f they tink that is the best choice n they r not weak after the operation, they can seek their parents' consent or guardian's consent....so logn as that person is related to her in blood terms. Think propely b4 doing anything.....believe it or not a 12 yr ger in Marie claire's mag has stated her lost of virginity, n had an abortion. Pri 6! Take care of ur own body gers, for the sake of ur worried parents n frenz....n ur future. This topic will nv end.....</div>
