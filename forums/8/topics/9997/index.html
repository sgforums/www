            <div class='col-md body'>Well, just to add on some juicy details...<br><br>The distraught vitim's brother barged into the press conference room and was followed closely by the airport's police, who tried to drag him out. Rick Clements intervened and the man got to stay...<br><br>This was followed by the speech made by Mr. Tan (the victim's brother). He told the press that all those relatives and next-of-kins who were huddled away in the airport did not get any first-hand news as promised... The buddies just told them that they knew nothing... well, the relatives knew that their loved ones were obviously dead, and Mr. Tan said that he just wanted the true news...<br><br>Mr. Tan was very upset, on the verge of a breakdown, and as I watch from my home TV, I thot he was either going to get a heart attack, stoke, or just faint from all that worries.<br><br>The airport staff urshered Mr. Tan's daughter (who was with him) out of the conference room, and Mr. Tan, on seeing that his daughter was not with him, demanded the immediate presence of his daughter.<br><br>Mr. Tan told all present that he did not get any news, neither did his wife, who was in Taipei. He told his wife to barge in to the press conference there, and was told that the buddies there did not try to encourage nor help his wife on this aspect... Well, we all knew his wife managed to interrupt that 2am press conference in Taipei...<br><br>Not in the article was the part where Mr. Tan said that when he tried to get news by watching CNN on TV, the airport switched off the TV. When he tried to get the press release into the barricade area for family members, the security there tried to prevent him from doing it.<br><br>Mr. Tan paused some time in the midst of his speech and drank whatever remained from a mineral water bottle, showing his stress and tiredness...<br><br>Mr. Tan said that he could understand if the buddies and people around them did not reveal the information 'cos they are under the employment of SIA, and he doesn't blame them... but he said that what they (relatives, next-of-kins,etc...) wanted was just news...<br><br>Mr. Tan also condemned one of the Chinese radio station (he can't remember if it was 933 or 958, but I did listen to 933 and I believe they were not the culprit) for spending a lot of airtime discussing the effect of this accident on SIA's reputation rather than reporting the latest of the accident. He felt that it was very wrong for the radio station to do this when all the relatives, who were isolated, wanted true news.<br><br>He didn't mention much after that and Rick Clements went forward to console Mr. Tan, and Mr. Tan started crying after this...<br><br>Well, Mr. Tan left the room and most of the reporters followed like hounds... and that pretty much ended the interesting press conference...well, so far...<br><br>Well, something more to add... at the 11.30am news conference, the reporters asked why there were barricades around the "family area" , and Rick Clements intially said that it was not his decision, but towards the end, contradicted himself by saying that he requested this to be a media-only news conference...<br><br>Okay...that's all...alll the juicy gritty details...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>with some victims burnt beyond recognition, SIA chose to err on the side of caution, it cannot afford to list wrongly the names of possible dead victims, the shock may prove too much or even kill their love ones, especially if they're elderly. SIA is really caught between a hard rock and the deep blue sea.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I think it is very wrong for SIA to be so secretive, not releasing any information to relatives. Information does not necessary just means the list of dead or alive, but it also menas things like what happened, was it the wind, pilot or just anything... If you let the relatives know that it might have been the fault of nature, they might not have been that distraught...maybe they will quickly accept this as fate.<br><br>And it's pretty obvious that with such a bad accident, where there was engulfing fire and explosions, the relatives themselves knew that chances were low. So it might have been better if SIA has told them the truth, even the worst, rather than give them hope and thrashed it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it's indeed between the devil and the deep blue sea, how could i ever forget?<br><br>i'm not really sure about this but if i'm not wrong, it's not SIA which will eventually pay the victims' families the compensation they're due, it's the insurance companies that SIA has insured with which will have to fork up the money. thus, to admit liability at this junction would do itself, its passengers and the passengers' families a grave disservice.<br><br>nobody really knew what happened, to speculate on what caused the accident is an exercise in futility when rescue efforts would be more productive in rescuing possible survivors. the cause of the crash would be investigated by experts and hopefully, since the cockpit crew survived, the truth should be out soon.<br><br>SIA did what it could to its best ability in an ugly situation. of course, no amount of gestures of goodwill or money will ever compensate the victims' families for their losses and to quote Theresa Tan in her article "The Long Wait" in The Straits Times today:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">You read about people's tragedies in newspapers.

Did he get the news from the internet, or was it from the SIA office in LA? I dunno...<br><br>That Malay lady who was on her way to discuss marriage arrangements with her finacee in LA, well...her family knew that she was dead... well, from the finacee who was in LA... nevertheless, they knew the truth and accepted it.<br><br>When I saw the grief-strikened families in Taiwan &amp; Singapore who still didn't know if their loved ones were dead or still lost hours after the accident, and who were damn worried about their loved ones, I really sympathized them...<br><br>Whose fault is it to cause this unwanted worries and distress in a time of tragedy?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah...they are just too careful...serve them right. In this IT era where information travel fast, I think SIA should think twice about their info network system... hopefully they can do some "info" damage control after such an embarassing morning. I still remember the immediate hours after the tragedy, at around 2am, on FM933, where Desmond kept up with a continual update of the accident through faxes that were streaming in. The information came fast, almost in between every 1 or 2 songs, and everytime he opened his mike, it was news. SIA might want to rethink the use of fax, if not email.<br><br>Okay, me going home to catch the press conference supposed to come on at 6.30pm. HOpefully will have somthing interesting again...<br><br>Have been sitting in front of the computer in the school comp lab, watching ChannelNewsAsia live on the school network, catching news 'live', reloading those pages...
