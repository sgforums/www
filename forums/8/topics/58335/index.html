            <div class='col-md body'>WHEN night falls, Tina trades in her jeans, T-shirt and sneakers for a skimpy black number. The skimpier the better.<br><br>And most important of all: the dress must be easy to slip out of.<br><br>After all, the men want it that way. They like her to pose nude while they snap away with their new-fangled camera-enabled mobile phones.<br><br>Tips soar when she does that, and when she lets them touch her intimately.<br><br>'I can get up to $200 a night just sitting with clients, singing and drinking with them. If I agree to sleep with them, I can get $300,' said Tina, a Chinese national on a student visa in Singapore.<br><br>Just three months ago in June, the voluptuous long-haired beauty was a salesgirl in Shenyang in north-eastern China, earning 1,000 renminbi (S$210) a month.<br><br>As she served customers, she dreamed of a better life. She wanted to travel. Get more education. Learn English. Pick up a trade.<br><br>On her days off, Tina talked to her friends. Some had been to Singapore and returned with wealth beyond their dreams.<br><br>'In China, people say Singapore is a land of opportunity. And it is,' she said.<br><br>Like her ancestors before her, Tina decided to leave China to strike out for a better life.<br><br>After working for more than 20 years, her father, in his late 40s, earned 2,000 renminbi a month in an electronics factory. Her mother is a pensioned state worker.<br><br>She borrowed close to 200,000 renminbi from friends and relatives to come to Singapore to study English.<br><br>In Singapore, Tina quickly learnt how to make money the fast way: as a karaoke lounge hostess.<br><br>She said candidly: 'This is not something we ever talk about because we are not allowed to work while we are studying. But this is one of the main reasons why we are here - to make money. I don't see anything wrong with it.'<br><br>All across Asia, Chinese women like Tina are making their presence felt in the sex trade. Call it the invasion of the Chinese sex workers.<br><br>They come from all parts of China, including Fujian, Sichuan, Liaoning and Jilin. Economics drives many of these women out of China in search of a better life.<br><br>Economic reforms have led to 30 million unemployed in cities across China. Another 150 million are migrant rural workers roaming from job to job.<br><br>Last year, the unemployment rate was 9.9 per cent. Among those below 24 years, 27.2 per cent were jobless.<br><br>Some young girls leave China with starry-eyed dreams of finding a decent job and netting a kind, wealthy husband.<br><br>But others lead comfortable middle-class lives in China: they just want a better life.<br><br>They strike out for Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand or Singapore. Last year, tourist arrivals from China to these places totalled 6.69 million.<br><br>Most enter these countries legally, on social, student or tourist visas.<br><br>The journey can be costly, even dangerous if they are smuggled across borders. But the ambitious and determined will try.<br><br>Ms Xiao Qian is one example. She was a policewoman in Jilin in north-eastern China.<br><br>Fed up with the low pay and dangers of her job, she started doing part-time 'modelling' in hotels there.<br><br>She wanted to make big bucks fast. Taiwan beckoned. After all, her older sister, 30, had travelled to Taipei to marry an aged soldier, 65.<br><br>The sister sent her the money for a plane ticket and Ms Xiao set off on her six-month Taipei adventure.<br><br>'The whole purpose is to make money fast and prostitution is the fastest way,' she said.<br><br>In Taipei, she met her agent at a bar. He supplied her with a string of high-paying customers.<br><br>At 1.65m tall, with long black hair and an elegant air, Ms Xiao is a cut above the average hooker. And she has imagination.<br><br>'They often go wild whenever I put on my green police uniform,' she said.<br><br>She charges NT$10,000 (S$510) per customer. By the time her six-month social visit visa ran out, she had made NT$1.5 million. It would take the average Chinese worker 20 years to make that amount, given the average labour cost per hour of US$0.92 (S$1.60).<br><br>In Hong Kong, the women can take back HK$20,000 (S$4,470) to HK$30,000 after a month.<br><br>No one knows how many Chinese women enter Asian cities to work as prostitutes.<br><br>Chinese sociologists say the number has increased as domestic sex workers face increasing competition and decide to take their services overseas.<br><br>In Taiwan alone, about 10,000 dalumei or mainland sisters are said to dominate the NT$5.2-billion-a-year industry. In Singapore, nine in 10 karaoke lounge hostesses are said to be Chinese.<br><br>Liberalisation of travel rules for Chinese nationals, for example to Hong Kong, have added to the numbers.<br><br>After the Chinese government scrapped the quota on mainland tourists allowed to travel to Hong Kong, the number of mainland visitors nabbed for prostitution soared from 4,597 in 2001 to 8,062 last year.<br><br>On the receiving end, host countries eyeing the massive Chinese market have also relaxed immigration rules for Chinese tourists and students, and award visas more liberally.<br><br>Sociologists say women risk the notorious dangers of prostitution - HIV or other deadly sexually transmitted diseases and beatings or even torture and death at the hands of pimps or clients - because circumstances compel them to.<br><br>Many do it to support families back home.<br><br>Madam Chen, 35, from Fujian province, went to Japan looking for a husband so she could bring her daughter and family members to Japan 'so they can all have a better life here'.<br><br>She never found her dream husband. Instead, she ended up working at an esute or massage parlour in Ikebukuro's sleazy quarter, where 'full service' can be had for around 10,000 yen (S$155) or less.<br><br>She was busted in an anti-vice raid and sent back to China, her dream in tatters.<br><br>Brothel keepers and clients say Chinese women make good sex workers.<br><br>One brothel in the Taiwanese port city of Kaohsiung has replaced its local workers with mainland Chinese women over the past three years - because the Chinese workers are cheaper and 'more submissive'.<br><br>'Some customers request for threesomes or foursomes. Dalumei would accept the request while most Taiwanese would turn it down,' said a pimp.<br><br>In Singapore, local hostess Sandy confessed she found it tough to compete with the Chinese.<br><br>'When the China women came in, the customers preferred them because they act so innocent and, being foreigners, they will always seem more exotic than us,' she said.<br><br>She said many local and Malaysian women end up being 'downgraded' from lounges in the Orchard Road area to clubs around Tanjong Pagar and Geylang.<br><br>In Taiwan, local hookers continue to dismiss mainland Chinese sex workers as 'cheap and low-class'.<br><br>But the reality is that many of these women are younger, prettier and keener to please. And less aware of the health risks to themselves and their customers.<br><br>In the sex industry, as in manufacturing, the Chinese are proving hard to compete against.<br><br>http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/news/story/0,4386,211944,00.html<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
