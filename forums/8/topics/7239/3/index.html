            <div class='col-md body'>FRIDAYFAX Issue 15, 14 April, 2000<br>Now with 1,682 electronic subscribers<br>worldwide<br><br>A few weeks ago, we published the astonishing<br>story of a Buddhist monk in Myanmar, who rose from the dead during his own funeral,<br>three days after his death. The report was<br>distributed on cassette. We have now obtained a translation of the report,of which this Friday Fax is a summary.<br><br>"We first heard of the events from a number of Burmese church leaders, who investigated the reports and have no doubt as to their authenticity. The monk, Athet Pyan Shintaw Paulu,has turned his life around, and suffers and risks much to tell his story. Nobody would undergo such hardship for nothing. He has already led hundreds of monks to Jesus, has been imprisoned, despised by his relatives, friends and colleagues, and been threatened with death if he does not tone down the reports. His current whereabouts are not certain: one Burmese source claims that he is in prison and may have been murdered, another that he is free and preaching."<br>(AMO: see below)<br><br>"My name is Athet Pyan Shintaw Paulu<br>I was born in 1958 in Bogale in the Irrawaddy<br>Delta,Southern Myanmar (Burma). When I became 18 years of age, my Buddhist parents sent me as a novice to a monastery. At 19, I<br>became a monk, entering the Mandalay Kyaikasan Kyaing monastery, where I<br>was instructed by probably the most famous Buddhist teacher of the<br>time, U Zadila Kyar Ni Kan Sayadaw, who was killed in a car crash in<br>1983. I was given a new name when I entered the monastery: U Nata Pannita Ashinthuriya. I<br>tried to deny my own selfish thoughts and desires; even when mosquitoes landed on my arm, I would let them bite me instead of<br>brushing them away. I became very ill, and the doctors diagnosed a combination of Malaria and Yellow Fever. After a month in hospital,they told me that they could do no more for me, and discharged me so that I could prepare myself for my death. Back in the monastery, I became ever weaker, and finally lost consciousness. I only discovered that I had died later: my body started to decay and smelled of death, my heart had ceased beating. My body was put<br>through the Buddhist cleansing rites.<br><br>But my spirit was wide awake I found myself in a powerful storm which blew everything away. Not asingle tree, nothing was left standing. I was in an empty plain. After some time, I crossed a river, and saw a<br>terrible lake of fire.I was confused, because Buddhism knows no suchthing. I did not know that it was Hell until I met Yama, the King of Hell. His face was that of a lion, his feet like snakes, and he had many horns on his head. When I asked his name, he said 'I am the King of Hell, the<br>Destroyer'. I then saw the saffron-coloured robes of Myanmar's monks in the fire, and upon looking closer, saw U Zadila Kyar Ni Kan<br>Sayadaw's shaven head. 'Why is he in the lake of fire?' I asked. 'He was a very good teacher; his cassette "Are you a human or a dog?" helped thousands of people recognise that they are worth more than a dog.' 'Yes, he was a good teacher,' said Yama, 'but<br>he did not believe in Jesus Christ. That's why he is in Hell.'Buddha in Hell<br>I was then shown another man, with long hair bound in a ball on the left side of his head. He also wore a robe, and when I asked who he was, I was told 'Gautama, who you worship(Buddha).'<br><br>I was distraught. Buddha in Hell, with all of his ethics and moral character?' 'It is not important how good he was.<br>He did not believe in the eternal God, so he is in Hell,' answered the King of Hell. I also saw Aung San, the revolutionary leader. 'Heis here because he persecuted and killed Christians, but mainly because he did not believe in Jesus Christ,' I was told. Another man was very tall, wearing armour and carrying a sword and shield. He had a wound on his forehead. He was larger than anyone else I could see, around 22 feet<br>tall. The King of Hell said 'That is Goliath, who is in Hell because he mocked the eternal God and his servant David.'<br>I had never heard of either Goliath or David. Another 'King of Hell' approached me and asked 'Are you also going into the lake of fire?'. 'No,' I said, 'I am just here to look.' 'You are right,' the creature said. 'You only came to look. I can't find your name. You'll have to go back to where<br>you came from.' On the way back, I saw two paths,one wide, one narrow. The narrow path, which I followed for about an hour, was soon<br>made of pure gold. I could see my own reflection perfectly! A man calling himself Peter told me 'Now go back to tell<br>the people who worship Buddha and other gods that they will end up in Hell if they do not change. They should believe in Jesus. He<br>then gave me a new name: Athet Pyan Shintaw Paulu (Paul, who returned to life). The next<br>thing I heard was my mother crying. 'Son, why are you leaving us now?!' I realised that I was lying in a coffin.<br><br>When I moved, my<br>parents cried out 'He's alive!', but the others around them did not<br>believe them. When they saw me, they were frozen with fear, and started shouting 'It's a ghost!'. I noticed that I was sitting in<br>about 3 1/2 cups of an odorous liquid, which must have come from my body as I lay in the coffin. I was told that they were about to<br>cremate me. When a monk dies, his name, age and the number of years of his service as a monk are inscribed in the coffin. I had already been registered as dead, but as you can see, I'm alive!"<br><br>Source:<br>Asian Minorities Outreach, P.O.

            <div class='col-md body'>A young man had been to Wednesday night Bible Study. The Pastor had shared his thoughts about listening to God. The young<br>man couldn't help but wonder, "Does God still speak to people?" After service he went out with some friends for coffee and<br>pie and they discussed the idea. Several different people talked about how God had led them to do things in different ways.<br>It was about ten o'clock when the young man started driving home. Sitting in  his car, he just began to pray, "God.. If you<br>still speak to people, speak to me. I will listen. I will do my best to serve your wishes." As he drove down the main street of his town, he had the strangest thought, to stop and buy a gallon of milk. He shook his<br>head and said out loud, "God is that you?" He didn't get a reply and started on toward<br>home. But again, the thought was there, "Buy a gallon of milk."  The young man thought about how he'd heard that not all those spoken to recognized God's quiet voice inside of one's mind. Then he said, "Okay God, in case that is you, I will buy the milk." It didn't seem like too hard a request to fulfill. He could always use<br>the milk himself if nothing else. So he stopped and purchased the gallon of milk and started off toward home.<br><br>As he passed Seventh street, he again felt the urge, "Turn down that street." "This is crazy," he thought and drove on pass the intersection. Again, he felt that he should turn down seventh street. At the  next intersection, he turned back and headed down Seventh. Half jokingly, he said out loud, "Okay, God, I will." He drove several blocks, when suddenly, he felt like he should stop. He pulled over to the curb and looked around. He was in a semi-commercial area of town. It wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst of neighborhoods either. The businesses were closed and most of the houses looked dark like the people were already in bed. Again, he sensed something,Go and give the milk to the people in the house across the street.<br><br>" The young man looked at the house. It was dark and it looked like the people were either gone or they were already asleep.<br>He started to open the door and then sat back in the car seat. "God, this is insane. Those people are asleep and if I wake them up, they are going to be mad and I will look stupid." Again, he felt like he should go and give the milk.<br><br>Finally, he opened the car door, "Okay God, if this is you, I will go to the door and I<br>will give them the milk. If you want me to look like a crazy person,okay. I want to do as I wish. I guess that will count for<br>something, but if they don't answer right away, I am out of here." He walked across the street and rang the bell. He could<br>hear some noise inside. A man's voice yelled out, "Who is it? What do you want?"<br>Then the door opened before the young man could get away.The man was standing there in his jeans and t-shirt. He looked like<br>he'd just gotten out of bed. He had a strange look on his face and he didn't seem too happy to have some stranger standing on<br>his doorstep."What is it?" The young man thrust out the gallon of milk. "Here, I<br>brought this to you,"he said nervously.<br>The man took the milk and rushed down a hall way speaking loudly in Spanish. Then from down the hall came a woman carrying<br>the milk toward the kitchen. The man was following her holding a baby.The baby was crying. The man had tears streaming down his face.The man began speaking and half crying, "We were just praying. We had<br>some big bills this month and we ran out of money. We didn't have any milk for our baby. I was just praying and asking God to show me<br>how to get some milk." His wife in the kitchen yelled out, "I ask Him to send an<br>Angel with some milk. Are you an Angel?"<br>In response to hearing this, the young man reached into his wallet and pulled out all the money he had on him and put in the<br>man's hand.He turned and walked back toward his car as the tears were streaming down his face. He knew that God still answers prayers and that God still speaks to people.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* ~*~*~*<br>&gt; ""For I know the thoughts that I think towards you, says the Lord,<br>thoughts<br>&gt; of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope.""<br>&gt;                                           Jeremiah 29:11<br><br>------------------<br>Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they<br>were to success when they gave up ....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Middle East<br><br>Ready to pay the price?<br><br>Ibrahim Yousef James (name changed) looked at his reflection in the mirror. "Perhaps there really is something wrong with my life," he thought to himself. He was a dedicated 24-year-old Muslim, with a religious hat and a long beard as signs of his faith. He was born in India, but his family moved to Kuwait when he was 6 years old. He and his brother founded a TV production company, and he was rich by the age of 20. His TV company became the largest in Kuwait. Ibrahim studied the Koran, learning long passages by heart, gave to the poor and made seven pilgrimages to Mecca. There was only one thing he could never do right: commit suicide. He had already tried four times. "Why can't I find peace?" he asked himself over and over.<br><br>The God who speaks<br><br>In 1985, he studied in Europe. During the last week of Ramadan, the Muslim month of fasting, he could not sleep. Even sleeping pills had no effect. He cried out to Allah "God, why are you punishing me?". He found a Gideon bible in his hotel room. Opening it, he discovered the words "Where to find help in a time of need" and a number of other topics, including "If you need sleep, read Psalm 4". Ibrahim was astonished. He read, and prayed "I know that there are people who believe this book. If you are the God of this book, let me fall asleep." He lay down and fell into a deep, dreamless sleep. However, he soon forgot his experience. During street evangelisation, he heard Christians saying "Jesus is the only way to God, he is the Prince of Peace." Ibrahim asked "How do you know that Christianity is the only way? Or that the Bible is God's Word, not the Koran?" "If you want to know the answers to those questions, ask God. He loves you and will show you the way," he was told. "I was completely astonished. I had never heard of anyone saying that God spoke to him!" he said. For all his life, he had served a judgemental God, not a loving one. Uncomfortable, Ibrahim prayed: "God, you must be able to speak to me. If you do not, I will reject you." The five following nights, he had a dream of a very bright light in the sky. As it approached, he recognised it as a cross, then heard a voice from heaven saying "This is my way. Jesus is my son. I give you my peace, and will leave my joy with you." Ibrahim woke up, almost unable to believe it: God had spoken to him!<br><br>Peace which no man can give<br><br>"The following day, I considered the cost, what it would mean for me to follow Jesus. I knew that I would be expelled from my family. My company was in the Arab world, and it was clear that I could lose everything, including my life." He visited some other Christians of whom he had heard, and decided to follow Jesus. "From that day, a Godly joy filled my heart," he says. "Joy and a great peace..."<br><br>"Whoever leaves father and mother for my sake..."<br><br>He immediately wanted to proclaim his new faith. He called his family, who had returned to India. "You must be joking!" exclaimed his father. "No, dad, it is no joke." "Recant!" his father demanded. As Ibrahim refused, his father told him "From this moment on, we have nothing more to do with you. We do not want to hear from you. Do not write, and do not call." His family confiscated all his wealth and his company. He had nothing left. A few months later, he received a letter from his parents, telling him that his mother was ill. "You are killing her. Give up your faith." He married in 1986, and in 1987, he recieved a telegram from India, inviting him to his sister's wedding. "Do not take your wife with you," he heard God telling him. Instead, he took his brother-in-law Jim with him. When he arrived, the reception was friendly, and everything looked good for 30 minutes. Then the atmosphere changed, and the whole family started hitting and kicking him, even his mother. "Recant Christ and convert to Islam!" demanded his father. As Ibrahim again refused, his father asked "Who then will rescue you from my hand?" Ibrahim replied "My God is great enough to protect me. But I would rather die with Jesus than live on without him!" His father fetched a gun, and was about to shoot when Ibrahim's uncle knocked his arm aside. "They kept me prisoner, with guards everywhere. They destroyed my Bible, my wedding photographs and all of my books, and chased Jim out of town." Desperate, he was only able to pray under the shower. After some time, his family started to take him out on visits. Suddenly, Jesus spoke to him, telling him that the day had come for him to leave his family. "Go now!" he heard, and the moment was opportune. He could jump into a taxi and flee back to his wife.<br><br>"Now I know that your God is real"<br><br>Some years later, he was able to speak with his mother on the telephone. His sister's child lay dying. The family had been to the mosque to pray, but in vain, and the doctors had also given up hope. "What should I do?" asked Ibrahim. His mother asked him to pray, "pray in the name of Jesus for the child yourself," he replied, "and Jesus will heal her. But don't let yourself be caught, because you know what would happen." His mother prayed, and the child was miraculously healed. Ibrahim recently spoke with his father, who told him "I now know that your God is real, and that you know him, because our plans to destroy you have failed for 10 years." "The price of following Jesus is high," says Ibrahim, "but Jesus paid it!"<br><br>Source: name and address withheld<br><br>------------------<br>Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they<br>were to success when they gave up ....</div>

I consider myself as a free thinker hence I have got nothing against any religion, in fact, I respect all religions. Juz wanted to voice out that we should give people the freedom to practise what they want, for it is their life they are living, not our's. Who are u to say ur religion is rite n others are wrong. Let people live their lives. It is their choice as it is ur's. If u affected their choice, n it turns out to be something bad, can u give back his life to him? Juz let things be n never ever judge other religion as u wouldn't want others to make unjust or bad remarks against yours too.

I think Christians should be discerning &amp; pray for a spirit of discernment.  sadly that is lacking today as bible literacy is low &amp; we tend to accept anything labelled Christian at face value...we never check the contents...we seldom compare it in light of God's word...and we get ripped off by "Christian" authors who sell us silly books with contents like Y2K is the end of the world, that Jesus took this lady on a tour of heaven &amp; hell (I forgot her name but she cancelled her meeting here last yr). rtc  we get conned by evengelists who tell us 50% of SG will be Christian by 1999 &amp; we still don't hold him accountable for his "prohecies"  sigh...<br><br>anyway I don't doubt something might have happened to the Buddhists monk that might have caused his conversion.  but as with third world with oral traditions passed from person to person something might get exagerated in the porcess. maybe he never died just had a coma...or maybe he had a vision...<br><br>my 2 cents<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No such thing as those who converted the most christian get the higher rank.<br><br>For in the bible , there was this incident<br>"At that time the disciples came to Jesus  and asked "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"<br>He called a little child and had him stand among them. And he said :"I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children , you will never enter the kingdom of heaven . Therefore , whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven."<br>Matthew 18:1<br><br>God's kingdom is unlike the our world.<br>He who is the most humble is the greatest.<br><br>And many people who are proud of himself<br>or obstinate refuse to even listen to the teachings of bible (not to mention acceptance).<br><br>I quote this not to pick up an arguement again. If any of you agree with me , i welcome any messages from you guys.<br><br>If you dont, just keep if to yourself and dont try to pick up any arguement. I had enough of it already.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Regarding what i have said about the Catholics, i want to relate to you that<br>I have been to Catholic Church for some time to worship coz I thought it was Christian Church.<br><br>When the worship is over,<br>many stayed behind and i followed them out of curiousity. They actually went to the statue of Mary and pray. Some even kneel down to the potrait of Mary and worship.<br><br>In the bible God said "You shall not make yourself an idol in the form of anything in the heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.<br>You shall not bow down to them or worship them; .."  Exodus 20:4<br><br>And I was told many Catholics still believe in salvation through Mary while the bible never even mention about this.<br><br>Hope that it's all misunderstanding for me.<br><br>Again I mention, you can send in your views about this but please do not try to start any<br>arguement.

            <div class='col-md body'>Another question for PooPoomoon.<br><br>Judging from the number of denomination that has spurned out from its roots. Is it right that Illegal Operation says that most will not make it to salvation since to one denomation, the other is probably wrong?<br><br>Illegal Operation realize the unhealty split up of churches. In one instance, half the church do not agree with the other half and had to move out...<br><br>If different denominations of Christianity is not able to come up with a common understanding and intepretation of the bible, how can it convince the non-believer?<br><br>PooPoomoon mentioned that when the book of Genesis mentioned that earth was created in 6 days, the writer (Moses?) was suggesting that god could be speaking in parables. 6 days could mean 6 days in "god days". Could this have been man's own intepretations after Science has proven the bible wrong? Some Christians believes that 6 days REALLY meant 6 man days.<br><br>...man , are we confused..<br></div>

All churches are as one under Jesus as long as they accept Jesus as saviour I feel.<br><br>Usually the churches today meet up a lot<br>to exchange programmes.

The<br>atheist professor of philosophy pauses before his class and then asks<br>one of his new students to stand. "You're a Christian, aren't you,son?"<br><br>"Yes, sir."<br><br>"So you believe in God?"<br><br>"Absolutely."<br><br>"Is God good?"<br><br>"Sure!  God's good."<br><br>"Is God all-powerful?  Can God do anything?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Are you good or evil?"<br><br>"The Bible says I'm evil."<br><br>The professor grins knowingly. "Ahh! THE BIBLE!"  He considers for<br>a moment. "Here's one for you.  Let's say there's a sick person over<br>here and you can cure him.  You can do it.  Would you help them? "Would<br>you try?"<br><br>"Yes sir, I would."<br><br>"So you're good...!"<br><br>"I wouldn't say that."<br><br>"Why not say that?  You would help a sick and maimed person if you<br>could... in fact most of us would if we could... God doesn't.<br><br>[No answer.]<br><br>"He doesn't, does he?  My brother was a Christian who died of<br>cancer even though he prayed to Jesus to heal him. How is this Jesus good?<br>Hmmm?  Can you answer that one?"<br><br>[No answer]<br><br>The elderly man is sympathetic. "No, you can't, can you?"  He takes<br>a sip of water from a glass on his desk to give the student time to relax.<br><br>In philosophy, you have to go easy with the new ones.  "Let's start<br>again, young fella."<br><br>"Is God good?"<br><br>"Er... Yes."<br><br>"Is Satan good?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Where does Satan come from?" The student falters.<br><br>"From... God..."<br><br>"That's right. God made Satan, didn't he?"  The elderly  man runs<br>his bony fingers through his thinning hair and turns to the smirking,<br>student audience. "I think we're going to have a lot of fun this<br>semester, ladies and gentlemen."  He turns back to the  Christian.<br><br>"Tell me, son.  Is there evil in this world?"<br><br>"Yes, sir."<br><br>"Evil's everywhere, isn't it?  Did God make everything?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Who created evil?<br><br>[No answer]<br><br>"Is there sickness in this world? Immorality?  Hatred?  Ugliness.<br>All the terrible things - do they  exist in this world? "<br><br>The student squirms on his feet. "Yes."<br><br>"Who created them? "<br><br>[No answer]<br><br>The professor suddenly shouts at his student. "WHO CREATED THEM?<br>TELL ME, PLEASE!"The professor closes in for the kill and climbs into<br>the Christian's face. In a still small voice: "God created all evil,<br>didn't He, son?"<br><br>[No answer]<br><br>The student tries to hold the steady, experienced gaze and fails.<br><br>Suddenly the lecturer breaks away to pace the front of the<br>classroom like an aging panther. The class is mesmerized.<br>"Tell me," he continues, "How is it that this God is good if He created all evil<br>throughout all time?"  The professor swishes his arms around to<br>encompass the wickedness of the world.  "All the hatred, the<br>brutality, all the pain, all the torture, all the death and ugliness and all<br>the suffering created by this good God is all over the world, isn't it,<br>young man?"<br><br>[No answer]<br><br>"Don't you see it all over the  place?  Huh?"<br><br>Pause.<br><br>"Don't you?" The professor leans into the student's face again and<br>whispers, "Is God good?"<br><br>[No answer]<br><br>"Do you believe in Jesus Christ, son?"<br><br>The student's voice betrays him and cracks.  "Yes, professor.  I do."<br><br>The old man shakes his head sadly. "Science says you have five<br>senses you use to identify and observe the world around you. Have you? "|&gt;<br><br>"No, sir.  I've never seen Him."<br><br>"Then tell us if you've ever heard your Jesus?"<br><br>"No, sir.  I have not."<br><br>"Have you ever felt your Jesus, tasted your Jesus or smelt your Jesus...<br>in fact, do you have any sensory perception of your God whatsoever?"<br><br>[No answer]<br><br>"Answer me, please."<br><br>"No, sir, I'm afraid I haven't."<br><br>"You're AFRAID... you haven't?"<br><br>"No, sir."<br><br>"Yet you still believe in him?"<br><br>"...yes..."<br><br>"That takes FAITH!"  The professor smiles sagely at the underling.<br>"According to the rules of empirical, testable, demonstrable protocol,<br>science says your God doesn't exist.  What do you say to that, son?<br>Where is your God now?"<br><br>[The student doesn't answer]<br><br>"Sit down, please."<br><br>The Christian sits...Defeated.<br><br>Another Christian raises his hand. "Professor, may I address the class?"<br><br>The professor turns and smiles. "Ah, another Christian in the vanguard!<br>Come, come, young man. Speak some proper wisdom to the gathering."<br><br>The Christian looks around the room.  "Some interesting points you<br>are making, sir.  Now I've got a question for you. Is there such thing<br>as heat?"<br><br>"Yes," the professor replies.  "There's heat."<br><br>"Is there such a thing as cold?"<br><br>"Yes, son, there's cold too."<br><br>"No, sir, there isn't."<br><br>The professor's grin freezes. The room suddenly goes very cold.<br><br>The second Christian continues. "You can have lots of heat, even<br>more heat, super-heat, mega-heat, white heat, a little heat or no heat<br>but we don't have anything called 'cold'.  We can hit 458 degrees below<br>zero, which is no heat, but we can't go any further after that.<br>There is no such thing as cold, otherwise we would be able to go colder than<br>458 - You see, sir, cold is only a word we use to describe the absence<br>of heat. We cannot measure cold.  Heat we can measure in thermal units<br>because heat is energy.  Cold is not the opposite of heat, sir, just the absence of it."<br><br>Silence. A pin drops somewhere in the classroom.<br><br>"Is there such a thing as darkness, professor?"<br><br>"That's a dumb question, son. What is night if it isn't<br>darkness? What are you getting at...?"<br><br>"So you say there is such a thing as darkness?"<br><br>"Yes..."<br><br>"You're wrong again, sir. Darkness is not something, it is the<br>absence of something.  You can have low light, normal light, bright light,<br>flashing light but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and<br>it's called darkness, isn't it? That's the meaning we use to define<br>the word.In reality, Darkness isn't. If it were,  you would be able<br>to make darkness darker and give me a jar of it. Can you...give me a<br>jar of darker darkness, professor?"<br><br>Despite himself, the professor smiles at the young effrontery<br>before him. This will indeed be a good semester. "Would you mind telling<br>us what your point is, young man?"<br><br>"Yes, professor. My point is, your philosophical premise is  flawed<br>to start with and so your conclusion must be in error...."<br><br>The professor goes toxic.  "Flawed...?  How dare you...!""<br><br>"Sir, may I explain what I mean?"<br><br>The class is all ears.<br><br>"Explain... oh, explain..." The professor makes an admirable effort<br>to regain control.  Suddenly he is affability itself.  He waves his<br>hand to silence the class, for the student to continue.<br><br>"You are working on the premise of duality," the Christian explains.<br>"That for example there is life and then there's death; a good God<br>and a bad God. You are viewing the concept of God as something finite,<br>something we can measure. Sir, science cannot even explain a<br>thought.<br>It uses electricity and magnetism but has never seen, much less<br>fully understood them. To view death as the opposite of life is  to be<br>ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive<br>thing.<br>Death is not the opposite of life, merely the absence of it."<br><br>The young man holds up a newspaper he takes from the desk of a<br>neighbor who has been reading it. "Here is one of the most disgusting<br>tabloids this country hosts, professor. Is there such a thing as<br>immorality?"<br><br>"Of course there is, now look..."<br><br>"Wrong again, sir.  You see, immorality is merely the absence of<br>morality.<br>Is there such thing as injustice?  No. Injustice is the absence of<br>justice.  Is there such a thing as evil?"  The Christian pauses.<br>"Isn't evil the absence of good?"<br><br>The professor's face has turned an alarming color. He is so angry<br>he is temporarily speechless.<br><br>The Christian continues. "If there is evil in the  world, professor,<br>and  we all agree there is, then God, if he exists, must be<br>accomplishing a work through the agency of evil. What is that work, God is<br>accomplishing?  The Bible tells us it is to see if each  one of us will,<br>of our own free will, choose good over evil."<br><br>The professor bridles. "As a philosophical scientist, I don't vie<br>this matter as having anything to do with any choice; as a realist, I<br>absolutely do not recognize the concept of God or any other<br>theological factor as being part of the world equation because God is not<br>observable."<br><br>"I would have thought that the absence of God's moral code in this<br>world is probably one of the most observable phenomena going," the<br>Christian replies.<br><br>"Newspapers make billions of dollars reporting it every week!  Tell me,<br>professor.  Do you teach your students that  they evolved from a<br>monkey?"<br><br>"If you are referring to the natural evolutionary process, young man,<br>yes, of course I do."<br><br>"Have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes, sir?"<br><br>The professor makes a sucking sound with his teeth and gives his<br>student a silent, stony stare.<br><br>"Professor. Since no-one has ever observed the  process of<br>evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on-going<br>endeavor, are you not teaching your opinion, sir? Are you now not a<br>scientist, but a priest?"<br><br>"I'll overlook your impudence in the light of our philosophical<br>discussion.  Now, have you quite finished?" the professor hisses.<br><br>"So you don't accept God's moral code to do what is righteous?"<br><br>"I believe in what is - that's science!"<br><br>"Ahh! SCIENCE!" the student's face splits into a grin. "Sir, you<br>rightly state that science is the study of observed phenomena. Science too<br>is a premise which is flawed..."<br><br>"SCIENCE IS FLAWED..?" the professor splutters.<br><br>The class is in uproar.<br><br>The Christian remains standing until the commotion has subsided.<br>"To continue the point you were making earlier to the other student,<br>may I give you an example of what I mean?" The professor wisely keeps<br>silent.<br><br>The Christian looks around the room.  "Is there anyone in the class<br>who has ever seen the professor's brain?"  The class breaks out in<br>laughter.<br><br>The Christian points towards his elderly, crumbling tutor. "Is<br>there anyone here who has ever heard the professor's brain... felt the<br>professor's brain, touched or smelt the professor's brain?"  No one<br>appears to have done so. The Christian shakes his head sadly.<br>"It appears no-one here has had any sensory perception of the<br>professor's brain whatsoever.  Well, according to the rules of empirical,<br>stable, demonstrable protocol, science,<br>I DECLARE that the professor has no brain."<br><br>The class is in chaos.<br><br>The Christian sits...

            <div class='col-md body'>What a neat, manipulative story, of course, making the scientist the loud and overbearing bad guy while the Christian calmly appeals to reason and beats him on his own ground of logical deduction. But there is a fundamental flaw in his argument.<br><br>If darkness is merely the absence of light, cold the absence of heat, immorality the absence of morality, and evil the absence of good, as that Christian student confidently says, then, going along that very same line of logic, the inevitable conclusion is that the Devil is merely the absence of God. And not an entity in itself. Obviously this would mean that the Devil does NOT exist. And where does that leave the Bible, I wonder?<br><br>Any thoughts on that, marker?</div>
