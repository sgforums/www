            <div class='col-md body'>On a more serious note.. Illegal Operation feels that.. like all other religions, Christianity preaches goodwill to man. This is essentially a good. Christianity could have been a beautiful religion... the roots and the philosophy behind it were beautiful if you agree with me. The bible stories , Abraham , Moses and all..<br><br>The dawn of new age will come when cultist like PooPooMoon gets eradicated from Christianity.. probably from the face of earth as well.</div>

I'm a christian like u. I may not be very well versed in the Bible and the history of the church. But let me remind u as a bro: haven't u read what's in 2 Peter, that u should defend with gentle and in meekness(this is what I can recall). No doubt they are skeptical about Christianity. But dun u be angry about them. Remember Paul, who used to be known as Saul, hated Jesus as other pple did. He went all over the place to presecute them. When He accepted Christ in his life. Other brothers in the Faith shunned away from him, expect for Barnabas. He accepted and welcomed Paul. Here I'm not telling how great he is. Yes in Christ, he is great. And we shld learned from Barnabas, learned from his warmth and sincerity.<br><br>By the way, what u mentioned abt the crusader, is from the church,i.e. both Catholic and the Protestants. But then, so what? The Church is made of pple. Human being are fallible. But only Christ stands.Even Martin Luther also disapproved of Galileo's thoeries of the sun and the earth. But that doen't mean that Galileo's rite, his only half correct about the theory. So bro, do not be so sure of yrself, u maybe wrong, I may be wrong also. God knows the truth, and He will guide us with His spirit.<br><br></div>
