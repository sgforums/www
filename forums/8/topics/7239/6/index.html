It at least show they do not subscribe to organized religion and have some independence of thought.When you joined organized religion, you are basically following other people's interpretation of the religion(be it christianity or otherwise).That has led to lots of religious wars even till now. Your beliefs should be highly personal and not depended upon by other people's interpretation.<br>I personally believe that God (if there is one) would not be so simplistic to have only one way to HIM.There could be many roads to take and not just through Jesus.<br>And what is wrong with sticking to his parents' religion.

In the modern day context, the medium from which the God's existence is spread isn't too far off. You get things like charity drives organised by churches, with the purpose of spreading the news through deeds instead of words, just like the good old days. For those who are, let's see how to phrase it, not that high level (?? English terok lah), they go door to door with the hope of doing something to that effect, hoping too to be fishers of men.

The christian who knocks on his door to preach/convert him? Can a human being take such great responsibility over a life of another?

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there Ding, I have absolutely no idea how to do the quoting thingie (anyone enlighten me on how to do that)? Anyway, people who preach to you will most probably have enjoyed the benefits of Christianhood (is there such a word??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">) so much so that they wish to tell that to everyone around. Let's see if I can think of an analogy, okay, if you are a Faye Wong fan, I know I am...... when you get this latest news that Faye Wong is releasing yet another album, won't you get so excited that you wanna spread the news to everyone so that they can sample Faye Wong's new songs? Err...... not very sure if I got the correct example, but I hope you somehow understand.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>As for the going door to door, look at it like a salesman going door to door selling some product. You wouldn't know if you need the product or not until the salesman explains all the functions of the products, it's usefulness, etc. After that, you will decide if that product is worth your attention. You may think you need it, you may think you don't, you may think what the heck let's just give it a try. At the end of the day, even if the salesman has made just one sale, it would be better than nothing, at least someone would have enjoyed the benefits of the product. Appropriate/not appropriate example? Well, I don't know, just hoping that you can see the picture.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Well, is there anything in this world that guarantees happiness?? Life is afterall so full of trials and tribulations, no one can therefore guarantee you happiness, not even the guy who knocks at your door. But what I suspect is, I don't know if you feel the same way, is that that guy knocking on your door isn't really interested in being "responsible" for your life. What he is interested in is to introduce this new way of living, which hopefully, will offer solutions to your problems in life. Happiness, unhappiness, it is all up to the individual. Maybe that guy was thinking, hmm...... if you are thankful for what you are given, instead of grumbling over what you don't have, maybe, just maybe you will leave life that little happier? No one is forcing anyone to do anything against their wish (although I do suspect that a little overenthusiasm will present itself negatively), but still, it is presented to you as an option. When one of them comes knocking at your door and you curse and swear at his entire family tree, and get rid of him, I'm definitely sure he won't stay behind telling you, "Oh you have sinned, you have sinned, may you be condemned blah blah blah." This is because that was not his intention. You definitely have the right to tell him straight in the face that you are really not really interested, and you think he is just wasting his time, and that he better get lost before you set the dogs after him. I'm sure he won't force it upon you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Right/wrong, you be the judge.<br>Look at the time, cannot sleep too late liao, adios babes  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Oh yah, to BluErf, saw your post. I am no fan of manipulative stories as well, that's why I don't think you saw me quote anything unnecessarily so far? Using shakey explanations to explaining the bible is just like self-delusion, it has absolutely no benefits towards building up towards one's faith. Now let's see, how would a christian convince a non-christian. For one, relating of personal experiences would be the only best selling point. Talking about things happening thousands of years ago and thousands of miles away will definitely not be very useful. You listen to them, and you be the judge. Reminds me of the time I was convincing a foreign friend of mine to taste a durian. I described to him the smoothness of the texture, that heavenly aroma, that gastronomically satisfying aftertaste. Well, for him, to be able to relate or not, it is really up to the individual. It was difficult to convince him though, that tough exterior of a durian, and so beautiful pungent smell, he looked at me and said, yah rite. Well, that was a few years back, now everytime he comes down to Singapore, a trip down Geylang for a D24 is a must.<br><br>And one more thing, qwerty, beautiful name, makes me feel bad that I'm so suaku, but beautiful. And I like your quote. Nice.<br><br>Oh dear, someone please tell me that I'm getting so long-winded, so I won't post such a long thread again, it is 7+am and I still haven't got any sleep yet.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

Shame on me, hahaha...... thanks for the enlightenment.<br><br>Sato, I believe the line that you were referring to is from Isaiah 40:22 "He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth......" The other someone who managed to sail round the world in the 1500s is Magellan, the first (I think) to really prove the world is round. Anyway, if you were to read the entire scripture, I somehow believe that this circle doesn't indicate the world is round. Again, this is opened to argument as on one hand, one might argue that it is only a coincidence that the term "circle" has that double meaning and that the bible has been quoted out of context to suit the means, while others might argue that Isaiah had been inspired to purposely choose the particular words (I don't know if the original translation meant this). All these are again open to all round of attacks. That is what discussions are for. And one more thing, thanks for the blessings, Sato. It is indeed true that love is the one main thing preached that is truly undisputable, and love is something whose power cannot be underestimated.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Another long post, another long night......adios for today.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

Er, not you, forumite Revelations.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote><br>From the book of Revelations of the bible (sorry to be quoting again):<br><br>Prologue (Chapter 1, verses 1 to 3):<br><br>The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants what must <strong>soon</strong> take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John, who testifies to everything he saw Â— that is, the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. Blessed is the one who reads the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear it and take to heart what is written in it, because the time is <strong>near</strong>.</blockquote>*Note: words in bold are highlighted for emphasis by me. The book of Revelation is estimated to have been written around AD 90 to 96, near the end of the reign of the Roman emperor Domitian, about when his persecution of the church began.<br><br>My point being the words <strong>soon and near</strong> used in the bible in the prologue of Revelations has been 1910 years since as Apostle John is believed to have written this book between AD 90 to 96. I believe that a lot of people at that time believed that the end was near as there were lots of miracles during that period as Christ lived up to almost AD 30 to 33. Good old Paul lived to a healthy age too if I remember correctly and Apostle John is still alive and kicking, er, he wrote this book  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">.<br><br>And yet, 1910 years later the end has not come, IÂ’m not saying it will not come. What am I saying is that why be so concerned about the end of the world or the 2nd coming of Jesus Christ? If you are not prepared, you are not prepared, looking for signs to match to the predictions or revelations in the book would be futile as every generation after the book has been written has had their own interpretations of what they mean.<br><br>The end has been predicted for years and it has never occurred, I honestly think that cult leaders or leaders with a crazed craving for power tap into weaker menÂ’s fears about the end of the world and preaching about it endlessly to control them and make them do what they want. God <strong>never intended us to live in fear of Him</strong>, in the bible when the word Â“fearÂ” is used to describe our relationship with God as in Â“to fear GodÂ”, it means to revere, love and honour Him.<br><br>The meaning of Â“fearÂ” here is distinctly different from our normal usage and/or understanding of Â“fearÂ” as in a feeling of distress, apprehension, or alarm caused by impending danger, pain, etc. My Christian God is a tolerant God, He has given Man 1910 years to repent and return to Him, He has seeked Man all these years like a loving husband seeking for His wayward wife and yet we have rebuffed Him all these years. I believe that God loves Man so much that He will give us and I fervently pray that He will give us several more 1910-years cycles for us to learn to love Him too. Man is indeed foolish and need a lot of time to come to our senses.<br><br>I believe it is more fruitful to live our lives as God has intended for us to live, that is to worship Him and love each other. No offence to believers of other faiths. Somewhere in the book of Revelations, Jesus Christ Himself told us not to waste time looking out for His return as He Himself does not know the time or day, [only God know the details] but to live our lives as He has taught us.<br><br>I hope that this may bring new light to some of you who are preoccupied with the ends of times. Live your life fruitfully according to ChristÂ’s teachings and even if Jesus Christ comes again tomorrow, you will be prepared. I think IÂ’m the only Christian who does not look forward to the 2nd coming of Jesus Christ, I mean when I die, hopefully I will get to see Him, so why hurry the process and get everyone else to die with me just because I believe in God?<br><br>Please do not start on rapture. Rapture, together with Eternal Life are  concepts that are quite foreign to me as they involve me <strong>dying</strong> in order to experience the love of God and my Lord Jesus Christ. Well, at least that is what has been preached for centuries, unless I misunderstood it. If that is the case, then I truly cannot understand nor wish nor want to experience them, because I firmly believe that was not what God wanted for us. <strong>God wants us to experience His love while we are ALIVE, not when we are dead</strong>! if He had wanted us dead to experience rapture or eternal life, He could have ended our lives at anytime, why wait until now?<br><br>Eternal Life can be experienced while one is still alive and kicking, to me it is the peace that God gives me when my world is falling apart. When everything is taken away from me, I can still find the strength with which He supplies me to go on and hopefully be cheerful with the trials He sets for me. Eternal Life for me is to experience the love of God when He sends friends, family and even strangers in my times of need. Eternal Life for me is the knowledge that I am never truly alone in this world even if it seems that all my friends and family have deserted or shunned me in my neediest hour of need for God is there to sustain me even though I may be bitter about it.<br><br>Let me be frank, I will be bitter if my friends and loved ones forsake me when I need them most but again, I will look to God to resolve the issues of bitterness and forgiveness.<br><br>So, my advice for Christians is to live a righteous life and be prepared at all times for we may be called back home to give a report to God way before the end of the world or the 2nd coming of Jesus Christ (essentially the same thing) comes.<br><br>My brains is almost fried now, got to go, I have been sleeping very late everyday this past week and waking up really early, I really do need the rest.<br><br>If anyone disagrees with me, do post your alternative views but no flaming please. Thanks and good night. God bless,<br>colette<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There seem to be a misconception that Buddhists think they're right and everyone else is wrong.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Here's a link for those who has questions about Buddhism. <a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/qanda.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhanet.net/qanda.htm</a><br><br>I've highlighted a few questions with their answers in the links.<br><br>I suppose you think Buddhism is right and all others are wrong?<br><a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/ans12.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhanet.net/ans12.htm</a><br><br>Was the Buddha a god?<br><a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/ans5.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhanet.net/ans5.htm</a><br><br>If he is not a god, then why do people worship him?<br><a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/ans6.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhanet.net/ans6.htm</a><br><br><blockquote><br><strong>Is it a religion?</strong><br><br>It is neither a religion in the sense in which that word is commonly understood, for it is not "a system of faith and worship owing any allegiance to a supernatural being."<br><br>Buddhism does not demand blind faith from its adherents. Here mere belief is dethroned and is substituted by confidence based on knowledge, which, in Pali, is known as saddha. The confidence placed by a follower on the Buddha is like that of a sick person in a noted physician, or a student in his teacher. A Buddhist seeks refuge in the Buddha because it was he who discovered the path of deliverance.<br><br>A Buddhist does not seek refuge in the Buddha with the hope that he will be saved by his (i.e. the Buddha's own) personal purification. The Buddha gives no such guarantee. It is not within the power of a Buddha to wash away the impurities of others. One could neither purify nor defile another. The Buddha, as teacher, instructs us, but we ourselves are directly responsible for our purification. Although a Buddhist seeks refuge in the Buddha, he does not make any self-surrender. Nor does a Buddhist sacrifice his freedom of thought by becoming a follower of the Buddha. He can exercise his own free will and develop his knowledge even to the extent of becoming a Buddha himself.<br><br>The starting point of Buddhism is reasoning or understanding, or, in the Pali words, samma-ditthi.<br><br>To the seekers of truth the Buddha says:<br><br>"Do not accept anything on (mere) hearsay -- (i.e., thinking that thus have we heard it for a long time). Do not accept anything by mere tradition -- (i.e., thinking that it has thus been handed down through many generations). Do not accept anything on account of mere rumors -- (i.e., by believing what others say without any investigation). Do not accept anything just because it accords with your scriptures. Do not accept anything by mere suppositions. Do not accept anything by mere inference. Do not accept anything by merely considering the reasons. Do not accept anything merely because it agrees with your pre-conceived notions. Do not accept anything merely because it seems acceptable -- (i.e., thinking that as the speaker seems to be a good person his words should be accepted). Do not accept anything thinking that the ascetic is respected by us (therefore it is right to accept his word).<br><br>"But when you know for yourselves -- these things are immoral, these things are blameworthy, these things are censured by the wise, these things, when performed and undertaken conduce to ruin and sorrow -- then indeed do you reject them.<br><br>"When you know for yourselves -- these things are moral, these things are blameless, these things are praised by the wise, these things, when performed and undertaken, conduce to well-being and happiness -- then do you live acting accordingly."<br></blockquote></div>
