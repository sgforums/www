            <div class='col-md body'>Some questions again.<br><br>One of the scientific answer to the reason that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs was the Ice Age. Incindentaly, this will coincident with the Christian belief of the Noah Ark and Great Flood story.<br><br>If that is the case, one will wonder why fossils of dinosaurs, and other prehistoric creatures were found beneath the ice millions of years later, but the remains of the oldest man was nothing more than thousands of years old. Illegal Operation believe that if the great flood were to have caused such a huge lost of man and creatures, we could have at least found some remains close to each other. Archeologist employ a method called carbon dating to determine the age of a fossil. Why have remains of a man that is the same age as a dinosaur not been found?<br><br>Parables. These were widely used in the teachings of past Christain prophets. One begins to wonder which verse of the scriptures are parables and which are facts. Some felt that "let there be light" was done in a man day. Will others belief that this might just be a parable that actually meant to say that "First there was the Big Bang"  Surfing on some anti-evolutionist website, one will find that it is a widespread Christian belief that the earth could never has been "hundred and million years old" as claimed by the evoutionist.<br><br>Egyptians once prayed to the sun. In that era, the idea of the solar system, universe was never known to man. Since man will not<br>live if there was no sun, it will be correct to relate sun to god. Since Sun=Life. We now know that the sun is not god, but a member<br>of our solar system. Could the current state of Christianity be a repeated example of history of the Egyptian sun worship thousands<br>of years back? Could the explaination that Christians are quick to associate with god's work merely be undiscovered science?<br><br>But like what Illegal Operation once said, Christianity is a beautiful religion. A philosophy that preaches goodwill. if everyone follows the "Thou shall love thy neighbour as thyself" , the earth would have been a much better place to live in. Sadly, christianity has been badly distorted by men over the ages. One such distortion Illegal Operation will try to point out is Spiritual Healing.<br><br>Spiritual Healing. A true story. A non christian friend attended the Anncordian Rally held here last year. An injury has caused this friend a slight disability in his arm. This friend has never believed<br>in the exisitence of a god. He went because he was desperated to be healed. During the rally, this friend had the chance to be blessed by Annacordian himself personally. Due to the amout of "miracle" that happened<br>on the night, the friend was convinced. He was almost into the new faith he found. It was the best night sleep he ever had because he knew that when he woke up the next morning, he will be able to swim as swiftly as he used to. Miracle didn't happen.<br><br>This story is never an isolated case. It leads one to wonder whether spiritual healing session like these are really as what Christian proclaim "a demostration of god's power" or just a highly envalagistic act that is meant only to lure non-believer into the faith. If it is, what expenses has it been done at? Who's responsiblity is it when such sessions caused more dissapointments than miracles, and who's to blame when a patient dies because of blind faith to such healing sessions. The patient himself? I think not. If one were to attend such a rally, one will realize the amount<br>of morale there is there. The singing, the lights and the atmosphere is enough for a blinding hynoptic effect...it attacks the emotions and senses. Do we blame the patient when he succumbs to the wrath of spritual<br>healers?<br><br>Thanks for listening.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Illegal Operation (edited 12 May 2000).]</div>

You mentioned that Christians go around denouncing other people of their religion: Not true. It isn't fair to judge all the Christains just by the works of a few others who denouced the others right?

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm...I feel kinda sad that my first reply posted in this forum is about religion...<br><br>Anyway, my 2 cents worth:<br><br>Whatever religion anyone might believe in, is REAL and TRUTH (I myself am a roman catholic). why do i say this?<br><br>A Christian might not go to heaven if he goes to church everyday but steals and pluders and rapes the rest of the time he is not in church...<br><br>Similarly, a non-christian will not be condemned into the fires of hell just because he/she believes in Buddha or Allah...he would still go to heaven (a common entity) if he leads a good life...<br><br>I have seen my fellow christians sliming a Buddhist monk that happened to walk past us one day. They said that he will go to hell cos he didn't believe in God (the christian one)...I snapped back at them that if anybody were to be allowed in the Christian heaven (if there is even one), it would be the monk as this is one man that dedicated his life to religion, to finding the path...while my friends who claimed to be devout christians were smoking and drinking in pubs...<br><br>Thus! (I think I exceeded my 2 cents worth!) Regardless of religions, the religion of TOLERANCE is of utmost importance. Whether or not we came from apes or from god is also not important...what's important is how we will end up...as good humans or will the earth cease to exist because we are trying to kill one another for conflicts in beliefs...food for thought...<br><br>------------------<br>Different Day...Same Shit...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>merkava...well said.<br><br>Is heaven, if there is one,..makes for christians only? If there is only one god, then why did 'HE' makes a mockery of the world..to have the 'fittest survives'. Why must 'HE' made us goes through all the suffering to realised that there is only one GOD? I have been pondering over it..when I was following this thread.<br><br>All religions taught us to be good. But, look at the world today. Wars murders, rapes, kidnapping, atrocities and likes. You hit me..I reciprocate. When will all end? Is the one God going to shake his head and say.."Hey, I make a mistake...I am going to destroy the Earth (Amagadeon), those who did good will go to 'heaven' and the rest to 'hell'. What is 'good' and what is 'bad'? What about the animals? The strongest killed the weakest to survives and to feed  their 'families'. Do they go to hell too? It is a joke isn't it? I am wondering to myself, whether, there are such things as retribution and reincarnation.<br><br>For me..my believe in my 'God', was to find solace and peace in the hustle and bustle of a materialistic society I lived in. I tried to follows the path, which was taught in the scriptures and those from my grandparents, parents and 'elders'. Time and time again, I'll go against it due to the competition I face in the real world we lived in. For that..I leave it to the 'creator' to pass judgement on me..if there is one. But my question to 'HIM' will be "Who's fault was it?"<br><br>Good day!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Illegal Operation,<br><br>Ehhmm, from this post onwards, I think,<br>I will not give full details of  the researches I found. The more I give details,<br>the more wrongs I may have there. I may be wrong,coz I am not a scientist.<br><br>So ,here goes.<br>As for the Ice age thing, I have read that<br>there were reseaches saying the method used to detect how old a fossil was not accurate.<br>For fossils older than 5000-8000 years<br>(I forgot the actual age), the results were so close that the scientist could not really guess the age of the fossils. They can just give assumptions, together with clues found on other fossils.<br>Some researches I read claimed that the existence of human may not be even older than 8,000 years!<br>This made me very suprised and excited because ever since when I was young, I<br>was fascinated about the Egyptians' pyramid.<br>Historians claimed that the pyramid was 4000-5000 years old. Then I had be wondering<br>since 11 years old,<br>"what about before the pyramid? Why there wasn't any civilizations found?? Seemed like there was a very big gap between the early man (apes) and the first human civilization. There was a millions of years' missing link in between.<br><br>The pyramid was the oldest civilization evidence found and it was only 4000-5000 years old. What about before that?"<br><br>That was another reason why I doubted the Evolution theory. (There was many loopholes of the evolution theory, try to find from the internet)<br><br>So I believed dinosaurs may not be older than  10,000 years, or even 8000 years..<br><br>Check this out: <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dinosaurs/j-age1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.christiananswers.net/dinosaurs/j-age1.html</a><br><br>It may be unbelievable, but it may be right, it may be wrong. It's all up to you to believe or not.<br><br>How many days it takes god to create earth<br>is mystery. it may have been "god's days"<br>not 24 hrs. I have put forward a "guess" in the first page regarding the topic<br>"how long did god really took to create the universe.". You may go back to read again.<br>Here I say, i may be wrong also.<br>May god forgive me it i said the wrong thing.<br><br>Regarding that Christian may be worshipping god because of undiscovered science,<br>I will give a neutral statement here because<br>arguement may start again : "Who knows?"<br>It is the faith that counts.<br><br>The bible is the most selling book in the world, in English, Chinese, Tamil, Malay,<br>Japanese, Korean, Spanish,..almost all languages..<br>Yet it was the book that was insulted the most. It was burnt, torn, threw away by many<br>yet until today, No scientist or reseachers could prove it wrong. They found no single mistake in the bible historically, geographically or scientifically (claimed by the creationist-scientists).<br><br>I feel that all the laws of the nature were created by God (Laws of Gravitational pull,<br>Principles of force etc) and will go along perfectly with the bible.<br>That was why it couldn't be proven wrong for<br>the 3000 years ever since it was written.<br><br>As for your friend's spiritual healing, it may be a test of faith from god. Who knows?<br>Again, I said, I think It is not right to establish a Christian's faith through miracles. Miracles can be from god , it can be from evil spirits. It may be a test, it may not. i will not know.<br><br>I have once prayed very hard to pass an IPPT test coz i really wanted  to pass it.<br>I praised God and Jesus during the run too,<br>but I still failed.<br>I was disappointed of course. Very disappointed. I think i didn't pray for many months.<br>It was after that i realized faith and love for god is more important.<br>I still want to be with him even though i am crippled and cannot walk and lost everything.<br><br>About the Revelations page, I think I will not talk too much about it. I have found many articles about it, but, I do not want to talk much, cause I might "Wu Ren Zi Di" (lead the wrong way).<br>It was said that the Anti-Christ (a person) will rise up after the collapse of the world economy. the cashless society system would be suggested and implemented by the<br>Anti-Christ  such that everyone will<br>not buy or sell unless they have a 'barcode' in their hand or forehead. (The type of paying-system which looks a bit like the one used at 7-Eleven when you pay)<br>But god will comdemn those who accept the barcode.<br><br>I have a lot to say, but am afraid I might say the wrong thing.<br>May god forgive me if I said wrong things, as I was just trying to help.<br><br>From now onwards, I shall try to make myself scarce. Try not to ask me any questions .I will not say much about anything again cause a lot of people are against me now. There are a lot of people who dislike me outside this place as they say i am inconsiderate and arrogant.<br><br>God, forgive me.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I saw the question posted by someone on the book of Revelations, and this is also a favourite book of mine. In this book, John describes many symbolic events in the eternal battle between good and evil which is being fought on earth. And of course, it ends with a picture of God's new creation at the end of time. It must be said that this is the book which withholds the most mysteries, and definitely the book which one must not read from face value. There was a movie, if I can recall, called the Seventh Sign, which really exploited a few verses from this book, and that actually inspired me to start reading the bible (wallah). The sea, rivers and spring that turned into blood, the locusts with faces resembling human faces, tails and stings like scorpions and teeth like that of the lion, the release of plagues that killed much of the population, well, these are only some of the "symptoms" which are mentioned in the book of Revelations. I shall not attempt to explain anything, for that is what I am most poor at (eeps)...... so I shall leave it as that. I do believe that there will be many different interpretations to this book, some will be more well accepted than the others. Any attempts to explain this book, therefore I believe, will be futile. So to conclude, electromagnetism anyone??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, I think that the issue here is faith. There's no way to disprove or prove that, for there are too much we do not yet know. There maybe an entity that is all-powerful. Maybe all them are right, just that the way they intepret are different.<br><br>Anyway, just be happy with your life, dun be obssessed with whether you're doing it right or not.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We can never have an objective argument regarding this subject of christianity because people are generally stubborn. The christians(sorry if I am over-generalising) believe that non-christians are stubborn and blinded to the ways of God(Jesus) while the non-christians believe that christians(again I am generalising) are blinded by too much faith to accept any other objective truth other than the fact that Jesus is the Lord (God).I saw the website address posted by poopooMoon as well as read his arguments.<br>I came to the conclusion that people do not use facts to come to a conclusion . They first make a conclusion(Example wheither the bible is right or wrong) and then try to find the facts supporting their statements. In the process omitting facts that seem inconvenient(example dinosaurs)or distorting facts(or perceiving facts differently) to make their case stronger.Before you start to flame me I believe the same argument also applies to some people in science.(E.g Darwinian thoery)<br>It is hard to have such arguments as spirituality is a deeply personal thing which is between you and the God/Allah/Yahweh/gods/entity/philosphy you choose to follow.<br>Just another thing I think about preaching. Jesus tells christians to spread the word...instead of irritating people with your speech .Why not spread the word by example..do good deeds everyday. Let people see your example and try to follow the path you have taken.I believe that this is a better way to spread the word of God than by making the religion a total turnoff (to some) by over zealous verbal irritation.<br><br>My views as an agnostic</div>

Words can only go a certain way, but actions will definitely have greater impact, don't you think so? I'm sure you have met sufficient examples of that in the bible too rite?

Maybe there is really something good about them that they can really do without preaching(active advertising,marketing).

They get no money, get stares from others etc. They go to all this trouble because they believe that they are saving people's soul.No one is questioning their motivation. What I am saying is that there are better ways to spread HIS word. Furthermore if the person is ready to accept the christian beliefs he would open his arm and seek it .If he does not want to ,all the preaching in the world would not convert him. I disagree with Adam&amp;Eve about the method of going door to door to let others know the existence of God.<br>Speaking in the Singapore context , who has never heard about christians and their beliefs.Apart from the older people, I think alot of youths have come across christianity through friends and relatives. If they are interested about christianity they could ask their friends , they don't need complete strangers knocking on their door to tell them about Jesus. As for older people , they are usually set in their ways. They don't need some youngster to tell them they are worshiping false-idols etc. I say live and let live. If the person is receptive to the religion he will naturally accept it otherwise please leave him alone.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Third mail qwerty, keep it up, hehehe...... care to enlighten everyone about the reason for the nick?? hehehe......<br>Well, actually I too don't really approve of such methodology to spread a religion, afterall, as you put it, it would most probably put a layman to sleep than anything else, or worse, irritate them til their pants fall off...... just figurative speech.<br>I guess this methodology actually comes from the bible itself, whereby the gospel was actually spread by reaching out to the people. In the modern day context, the medium from which the God's existence is spread isn't too far off. You get things like charity drives organised by churches, with the purpose of spreading the news through deeds instead of words, just like the good old days. For those who are, let's see how to phrase it, not that high level (?? English terok lah), they go door to door with the hope of doing something to that effect, hoping too to be fishers of men. Hope this provides some sort of answer to Ding as well? No?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Well, dil seem to have a misconception of the word salvation. Not his fault, poopooMoon wasn't too clear with what he was saying. I would say only you can help yourself. Something like in school, the teacher is there for you. But your teacher can't help unless you help yourself and accept his help. True/false? And of course, I totally agree with him that religion is also a sort of spiritual guideline to living, providing that integral support for you during your times of needs, like what a good friend would do for you. To foster that relationship with a friend, it requires time and effort to enforce mutual understanding, so that you get to know your friend better and allow him to reach out to you, true/false?<br>Okay, now is time yet again for electromagnetism.

Notice the letters are not arranged alphabetically (ABC...XYZ) on your keyboard.The name comes from the top left 6 letters found on your keyboard.<br><br>Back to the topic of preaching:<br>I still think people who in your own words are "not that high level" can still show by example. Just lead a good decent clean life and when people notice what a good christian he is , they may start to give the religion a second look.<br>A personal example would be my JC teacher.<br>He belongs to the 7th day adventist church.<br>(Please no flames about wheither it is a real denomination as it is not as well known as perhaps Protestian)<br>Well I used to have no respect for christians, I thought they were just a bunch of losers mouthing off blindly something they heard from the scripture but not really understanding what it means. That was until I saw my JC teacher. He really was a good example of how a christian should live being a nice and friendly person. Nothing could make him angry and I think he was well-liked by both students and teachers (including non-christians).That was 4 years ago and it totally changed my view about Christianity.It also forced me to re-examine my beliefs as an aethist. I am still not a christian but I have changed my beliefs to be more open-minded. That is why I am an agnostic. I used to have the narrow minded view that God does not exist but now I just simply keep an open-mind to HIS existence.Neither dismissing it nor whole-heartedly believing it.<br>Well this is just an annecdote. It is nothing compared to quoting facts but to me it had a great impact on how I view my spirituality(not religion).<br><br>Religion shows you how to live after death.<br>Spirituality shows you how to live before death.</div>
