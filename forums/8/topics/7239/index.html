            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, before I start, I must declare that I have no intention of starting a religious argument, but I would just like bring forward a phenomenon I heard about.<br><br>There are people who leave home to join religious fellowships where a group of them buy a house and convert it into a private chapel. They piously hold masses several times a day, and whatever they earn from outside work, they give to the church. They are singles, who claim to be attached to the Lord, and they have forsaken almost all ties and communications with their family. They gave all their money to God, and what happens to their family?<br><br>One can of course understand how heartbreaking this is for the family, and is God so selfish as to want people to break away from their families, and leave behind whatever vestiges of normal social life? How can God, in all his benevolence and goodness, condone this act?<br><br>[This message has been edited by BluErf (edited 07 May 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, let me state my believe that God does not condone such acts. What those people have done are not what God would have wanted.<br><br>They are probably misguided, and practicing a perverse form of worship, maybe not satanism, but definately not mainstream.<br><br>What needs to be done is proper counselling by the family members and loved ones. I know you asked why does God condone such acts, but then again, what do you expect him to do? Come down from the heavens and slap them across the face, or appear as some apparition or in their dreams?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>quarzimodo,<br>i agree with you it will take time to form<br>the Earth.<br><br>The first page of bible ,<br>Genesis 1:16 "God made two great lights -the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth....<br>.....And there was evening, and there was morning - the fourth day."<br><br>yes, the bible says god took six days to complete the Universe and Earth.<br>He created the sun and the moon on the fourth day.<br><br>So that means three days before there is no Sun and Moon .

God came to seek adam, but<br>'He answered,"I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked ; so I hid."<br>(Genesis 3:10)'<br><br>Well adam realized his nakedness after he ate the fruit.

I believe it's the truth.<br>I agree with you, Enigma, no one can actually prove man come from ape or God.<br>But, where do you think you will go after you die?

            <div class='col-md body'>As for the answers to your questions, Jubroni<br><br>1.God exists. I understand that many of you will not agree with me.<br><br>Jubroni, everyday you take bus or train to school/work, you see all the proofs<br>of god : the trees, the birds, rain, the sun, the clouds...<br><br>everything i mentioned here works in cycles - the ecosystem, the food chains and food cycles, the water cycles, the plants photosynthesis and make food, the man and animals consume and exhale carbon dioxide for the plants....<br><br>these are all planned perfectly, don't you agree? Who planned them?<br><br>For bible says that it is the unrepentant heart of man that he choose not to believe that god exists when he sees his creation.<br><br>2. Jesus did not write the bible himself.<br><br>There are 66 books in the bible and each book is written by different writer.<br><br>They are written over a period of about 1200 years with the writers not knowing one other and lives in different parts of the world, different age of time, beginning from 1100 B.C. to 150 A.D.<br><br>There are fishermen, kings, scholars, citizens, farmers, the rich and the poor.<br><br>They, all write the same thing : God's existence, relation to man and Christ's salvation for mankind.<br><br>Who, other than God, could have the ability to inspire them to do so?<br>Who, other than God, would love and care for man?<br>So, bible itself is already a proof of god's existence.<br><br>3. We all know there are many religions and beliefs in the world, Buddhism, Islam, etc.<br>But every religion says their god is the ONLY WAY for salvation!!<br><br>We all know they can't exist together coz<br>they all contradictory.<br><br>So, that means there is only one speaking the truth, the rest are telling lies.<br>If they tell lies, they cannot be the real god. True God dont lie.<br><br>Well,as in which one is the real god, just take a look the bible's history and we'll know who's right and who's wrong.<br><br>I understand tuonela, how you will feel.<br>I was worse than you. I hated Christians. I hated God. I even scolded vulgar right into his name. But, I was punished badly. Really.<br><br>But I love the punishment. -coz I became God's follower because of that.<br><br>I mention again, It is my personal belief here and I do not mean to offend anyone or any religion.<br>Everyone has his own freewill to choose which god to follow afterall, just like god gives freewill to man, he will not take it back.<br><br></div>

(You might not have said that outright, but you certainly did hint that it's the case) read:<br>"So, that means there is only one speaking the truth, the rest are telling lies.<br>If they tell lies, they cannot be the real god. True God dont lie.<br><br>Well,as in which one is the real god, just take a look the bible's history and we'll know who's right and who's wrong."<br><br>You know what is one thing I can't stand about arrogant believers in GOD like you? (with all due respects to christianity) The thing I can't stand is how people like you go around telling others their religions are make believe, that the GOD's they've been worshipping do not exist.<br><br>I'm not going to argue about the teachings in the Bible, since, like I said I don't want to start a religious war. All I hope is that you will respect other people's religion and not go around telling other's their Gods do not exist.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well you have proven yourself that you just a blind follower of BIBLE. You can't prove anything without the help of your BIBLE. Ohhhh.. You have mentioned about the nature.well I think it's the Humans creations-- the Bus,Trees,Building etc.. All these are been build by Humans.<br>Well as for myself I believe in a Supernatural power which commands and control the entire world. One of which should be your Bibile.. I guess...<br>I am accusing you of anything.. Once upon a time I was even more strong believer of GOD than you were. But thru real Life situations I came to understand that You are all by yourself-- <strong>You do what you think is right or wrong!!!!!</strong><br><br>Nobody on this world can ever change your strong believes, but only you yourself could do it....<br><br>I believe the Bible has mentioned that the <strong>World would come to an end in the year 2000...</strong>What's your opinion george????<br>Izzit gonna happened?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by poopooMoon~:</div><div class="quote_body">As for the answers to your questions, Jubroni<br><br>1.God exists. I understand that many of you will not agree with me.<br><br>Jubroni, everyday you take bus or train to school/work, you see all the proofs<br>of god : the trees, the birds, rain, the sun, the clouds...<br><br>everything i mentioned here works in cycles - the ecosystem, the food chains and food cycles, the water cycles, the plants photosynthesis and make food, the man and animals consume and exhale carbon dioxide for the plants....<br><br>these are all planned perfectly, don't you agree? Who planned them?<br><br>For bible says that it is the unrepentant heart of man that he choose not to believe that god exists when he sees his creation.<br><br>2. Jesus did not write the bible himself.<br><br>There are 66 books in the bible and each book is written by different writer.<br><br>They are written over a period of about 1200 years with the writers not knowing one other and lives in different parts of the world, different age of time, beginning from 1100 B.C. to 150 A.D.<br><br>There are fishermen, kings, scholars, citizens, farmers, the rich and the poor.<br><br>They, all write the same thing : God's existence, relation to man and Christ's salvation for mankind.<br><br>Who, other than God, could have the ability to inspire them to do so?<br>Who, other than God, would love and care for man?<br>So, bible itself is already a proof of god's existence.<br><br>3. We all know there are many religions and beliefs in the world, Buddhism, Islam, etc.<br>But every religion says their god is the ONLY WAY for salvation!!<br><br>We all know they can't exist together coz<br>they all contradictory.<br><br>So, that means there is only one speaking the truth, the rest are telling lies.<br>If they tell lies, they cannot be the real god. True God dont lie.<br><br>Well,as in which one is the real god, just take a look the bible's history and we'll know who's right and who's wrong.<br><br>I understand tuonela, how you will feel.<br>I was worse than you. I hated Christians. I hated God. I even scolded vulgar right into his name. But, I was punished badly. Really.<br><br>But I love the punishment. -coz I became God's follower because of that.<br><br>I mention again, It is my personal belief here and I do not mean to offend anyone or any religion.<br>Everyone has his own freewill to choose which god to follow afterall, just like god gives freewill to man, he will not take it back.<br><br></div></blockquote>1.You and your 'holy' bible again..bah!<br>God planned the universe, and who planned God? God's god? or god's god's god's god's??<br><br>2.So many writers? That goes to show how inaccurate the bible is. The bible you're reading now has most prbly gone thru so many changes that the original interpretation is corrupted. In the past, where there are no laws or whatesoever, ppl prbly created Jesus to just give themselves hope and to guide their lives. The bible never and never will prove the existence of god.If that's the case I can write my own 'bible', create my own 'god', and go on to say that I'm inspired by my god. Hahhaa...<br>God loves and cares for man? Why would he only 'promote' those that worship him to heaven? While those that do not know of his existence or do not worship him will be condemned to hell? What about those natives, tribes etc? They do not know about Jesus, and Jesus cares for them by condemning them to hell just becos they do not worhip him/her? Your god must be one hell of an egoistic person man!!<br>Care for men indeed.How do explain how those christian crusaders who murdered and killed those in ancient Scandanivia to force them into submission into christ? Did jesus support such acts just to get more worshipers? The people in ancient Scandanivia had their own beliefs,worhsip their Norse gods, and this tradition is destroyed all because of who? These christian crusaders..seems that jesus is more than willing to sacrifice lifes just to get more worshipers...care for mankind indeed...<br><br>3.Finally, its people like you that give christianity a bad name. I do not condone christians nor hate them. In fact I have many christians friends too...<br>If you belive in your own 'true' god, thenn keep it to yourself, dont go about preaching or condemning other religions or their gods,and claim that jesus is the true god...it's christians like you that i despise.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That my friend was the last straw!<br><br>People like you make me sick to the core.. maybe you'll like to know how disgusting some of these countries who have "God's blessings" can be...<br><br>US.. the pinnacle of selfishness and abuse of power...<br>1. sending in troops only to countries in trouble which benefits them economically, I don't see US bothering themselves with Indonesia, but were like more than willing to help in Kuwait and Yugoslavia.<br><br>2. imposing trade embargo on countries which do not practice human rights when their own country is full of racism and they themselves withhold human rights to the "non-whites"<br><br>Germany... Hitler was from Germany wasn't he?<br><br>How about England and their crusade? how they massacre people along the way.. how they plunder along the way? all in the name of God... Still on England... how about when they invaded Scotland?<br><br>How about Ireland? The civil unrest in the country thanks to two factions worshipping the same God?<br><br>Of course similar things can be said of other non-christian countries.. which only serves to reinforce my point that you must open you eyes and not be blinded by your religion.<br><br>I know you can argue China had her tyrants, and Iraq has Saddam.. and that's the truth, I admit it. But what you must realise also is that you can't just cite one example and glorify one faction while denouncing the others. Be rational here.</div>
