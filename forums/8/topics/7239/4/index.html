            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br><strong>In Need of Mercy</strong><br>For judgment is without mercy to the one<br>who has shown no mercy.<br>Mercy triumphs over judgment.<br>~ James 2:13<br><br>According to a traditional Hebrew legend, Abraham was sitting by his tent one evening when he saw an old man walking towards him. He could tell long before the man arrived that he was weary from age and travel. Abraham rushed out to greet him and then invited him into his tent. He washed the old manÂ’s feet and gave him something to drink and eat.<br><br>The old man immediately began eating without saying a prayer or invoking a blessing. Abraham asked him, Â“DonÂ’t you worship God?Â” The old traveller replied, Â“I worship fire only and reverence no other god.Â” Upon hearing this, Abraham grabbed the old man by the shoulders and with indignation, threw him out of his tent into the cold night air.<br><br>The old man walked off into the night and after he had gone, God called to His friend, Abraham and asked where the stranger was. Abraham replied, Â“I forced him out of my tent because he did not worship You.Â” The Lord responded, Â“I have suffered him these eighty years although he dishonours Me. Could you not endure him one night?Â”<br><br>Do you know someone who needs to experience your mercy as a tangible expression of the mercy God is extending to him or her? DonÂ’t turn them away, take them in.<br></blockquote>Hi All,<br><br>First of all, I would like to state that the following are my own personal opinions and should our views differ, please kindly do not start a flaming war. Thanks.<br><br>I am a Christian too and I find by basis of that, the odds are against stacked against me. It could be that in Christianity (besides Islam and Judaism, if I missed any other religions, please kindly do let me know), we practise the belief of one God and we have to denounce all others that is highly offensive to practitioners of other faiths.<br><br>I too have had to grapple with this troubling fact as I was a converted Christian, I was not borned into a Christian household but after reading the above devotional about 1 or 2 years ago, I realized that my God is not all that cruel or megalomaniac that he will consigned all non-Christians to hell if they do not believe him. Furthermore, it does not mean that simple salvation will earn you a place in heaven, you do have to practice ChristÂ’s teachings. If as a professed Christian and yet not possessing a single ounce of Christ-like behaviour, personally I think itÂ’s a slim chance, if any at all, that there is a place in heaven for the Christian in question. Of course it is not my place to judge but Jesus did say that not all who call Him by His name will get to heaven.<br><br>Personally I think those consigned to that fiery place would be those who knew Jesus Christ and yet rejected Him. This may offend a lot of people but please let me clarify what I meant by Â“knewÂ”. Â“KnewÂ” here does not just mean knowing who Jesus Christ is, I think most reasonably civilized people would know that Jesus Christ is the God of Christians, the context of Â“knewÂ” here would be when God has shown plenty of mercy and grace towards an individual and he/she hears the calls of God through friends who are Christians or maybe he/she has been attending church services for a while, yet outright rejects Him, and/or worse still, he/she vilify and blasphemizes Him.<br><br>By the way, if non-Christians can understand our plight, perhaps it would ease this hostility between Christians and non-Christians, as a Christian, I am to believe in one God, if I do not even believe that, what kind of Christian am I? Of course, believing what I do does not give me the right to bash people of other faiths. Perhaps, some Christians may have been overzealous in their evangelizing efforts and that may have turned people off, for that I do apologize for they turn me off too.<br><br>I am not very familiar with the Bible yet, but there are records of people who are non-Jews (the Jews are GodÂ’s chosen people before the time of Christ) who are held up to be great examples of faith and are honoured even today, three comes to mind: Job, Ruth and Rahab. Certainly, when they died, I believed they went to heaven instead of hell. Of course, some Christians may write that that was before Jesus ChristÂ’s time, and before I get flamed, could you think about the fate of the Jews? The Jews were the chosen people of God and God has made a covenant to love them eternally, does the fact that they are still waiting for their Messiah consigned them to hell too? The covenant God made is eternal, does His later covenant via Jesus Christ nullify the first? I think not.<br><br>(paraphrased from Chapter 1, verses 6-12 from the Book of Job):<br>Job was a very wealthy man and greatly blessed by God. One day when the angels came to present themselves before the LORD, Satan (who was Lucifer, the fallen archangel) came too, and for reasons known to God himself, God said to Satan: Â“Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like like: he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil.Â”<br><br>Â“Does Job fear God for nothing?Â” Satan replied. Â“Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land. But stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face.Â”<br><br>The LORD said to Satan, Â“Very well, then, everything he has is in your hands, but on the man himself do not lay a finger.Â”<br><br>And with this brief exchange of words between God and Satan, Job lost everything, and I mean everything, except his nagging wife. Besides that, Job was blessed by Satan with all kinds of sickness and troubles in his bid to make Job curse God. However, Job was a man of great faith, he cursed everything but God, the book of Job basically looks at the problem of suffering but there is no conclusion because the important conclusion was foreheld by God, kind of like Him, isnÂ’t it? The point is that man is of definite intelligence and God is unfathomable, letÂ’s face it, if everyone knows everything, where is the joy in living? That is why, for millenniums, the problem of pain has been debated endlessly and no conclusive answers have been found.<br><br>From the above, it may look like that God is a show-off, but He is not, what do you expect Him to do when Satan is suggesting that Job is only faithful because he has been greatly blessed by God. Satan is a cunning old sly fox, he uses this so that God had to let him has his way with Job to prove if Job is indeed faithful whether he is blessed by God or not.<br><br>Ruth is a Moabite and Moabites are enemies of Israelites (the Jews), but because of her great faith in a God which is the God of her late husband, she became an ancestor of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Rahab is a prostitute who is also non-Jew (if IÂ’m not wrong) who chose to believe in God instead of others and she is also an ancestor of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Jesus ChristÂ’s genealogy is so twisted and dysfunctional that sometimes I wonder why my God if so awesome and powerful not just present Himself in all His glory? A simple answer is that He came as a human to experience the joy, pain and suffering of the majority of human race and to breach the distance between mankind and Himself that He went through life as an ordinary peasant instead of some great king. And because of this, sometimes it has been unfairly said that Christianity is a religion for failures and rejects, but that is so untrue.<br><br>Because God is perfect and blameless, only His own blood can buy the salvation of mankind. Before Jesus paid the price of salvation for humankind, the range of offerings that needed to be made to God would make the rituals of some faiths here look simple [for those who do not believe, just get hold of a bible and read the Book of Leviticus        <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">]. And before JesusÂ’ crucifixion, He was all too human, he prayed to His Father that he may spared that pain but if He was spared the pain of crucifixion, the chasm between God and man would not be healed, thus His prayer was denied and He was crucified and there is hope for you and me.<br><br>Being a Christian when times are good is pretty easy but when you are suffering, it can really become a contest of wills. Do I continue to believe in a God I cannot see, to Whom I pray constantly and yet no relief is seen but instead more troubles seem to find me? Do I continue to praise a God who seems to take great delight in humbling me? Do I continue to believe a God who just doesnÂ’t seem to care? Do I continue to believe a God when the future looks bleaker than bleak?<br><br>I do because without God as a guiding light and a beacon of hope, however faint, I am utterly useless. No matter how intelligent or how gifted He has made me, if He doesnÂ’t bless and/or guide me, everything I do will turn out wrong. Sometimes I wonder if He is having a joke with me? I seek Him earnestly and yet He eludes me, crazier still, He seems to delight in pushing me to the other side: to believe in myself and my abilities instead of relying on him. Even though there are days when I whine and complain to Him, sometimes when I am greatly depressed I even question Him if He does exists? He will then show His face to me in the kind acts of strangers and friends who appear just so coincidentally at the moment of need. He toys with me in this manner and yet it is indeed in this manner that I learn that He exists and my faith grows stronger, hopefully learns humility and whatever that it was that I was supposed to have learnt. Sometimes I do not get the objective of the lesson until months or even years later *paiseh*. There is also a sense of peace in my heart filled with troubles although that sense of peace can sometimes go MIA or AWOL, but He doesnÂ’t leave me alone for long, He comes back for me all the time and sometimes I go running back to Him too after spurnning Him when He seems intent on ignoring me, when all my prayers and requests are denied.<br><br>Regarding the questions of denominations within the churches, this is another question that perplexes me, but personally I believe that itÂ’s the relationship you have with God that matters more than what denomination you belong to. It is a sad fact that most Christians do not read the Bible but rely on the sermons and bits and pieces of verses they picked up because most of the verses are somehow cross-referenced to some books and often they are not what they appeared to be and thus, they do get twisted out of recognition. And if they do not have any or sufficient bible knowledge, how are they to know what they have been fed is the truth or not? By the way, the Bible consists of 66 books: 39 are Old Testament (before ChristÂ’s time) and 27 New Testament (ChristÂ’s time and later).<br><br>To some Christian, they may find my relationship with God bothers on impertinence but it is my personal relationship with Him.<br><br>To those who have the time and inclination to read the bible, you will find that God is very much like us or rather we are very much like God as we are made in His image: loving, humble, arrogant, compassionate, witty, sarcastic, funny, merciful, jealous, He feels sadness and grief too and a host of other very human emotions that we feel. Perhaps this is the reason why I identify with Him and love Him too.<br><br>Just my personal opinions and experience, no flames please.<br><br>&gt;&gt;Hi Illegal Operation and Adam&amp;EveÂ™<br><br>We meet again.        <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Please let bygones be bygones, religion is a very sensitive topic already, so I hope you will not pick on me to start a flaming war just because we flamed one another in the you know what threads. If you do want a flaming session for fun and recreation, letÂ’s start it on a new thread on any topic other than religion, okay? Thanks.<br><br>God bless,<br>colette<br><br>[This message has been edited by colette (edited 11 May 2000).]</div>

Do Jews go to the Christian heaven?<br><br>The Noah Ark issue. Christians that Illegal Operation have spoken to believes that at one time, dinosaurs co-existed with man. The great flood was suppose to be an Ice Age that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. And dinosaurs extinct because they were not brought up on the Ark. How true is this?<br><br>The tower of Babel. Christians believed men only started to speak in different languages after the fall of the tower of Babel. Is this correct?<br><br>A spiritual healer like Benny Hinn perform one of his (highly envaglistic) healing act in front of a large audience.

The service is very well attended, try to go early so that you may sit inside the building, if not you will either have to stand or be seated on benches on the porch where you will be "warmed" by the setting sun, trust me it's very uncomfortable and view the service conducted by television (if I remember correctly).<br><br>If you do not mind trying Christian churches, I know that Barker Road Methodist Church along Dunearn Road, next to the demolished ACJC Junior School, has a 5.00 pm service, ending around 6.30 pm too. It is a traditional service, I love the services as sometimes the hymns chosen to be sung can really speak to you and the Sanctuary (where the service is held) is really peaceful and beautiful, that is my personal opinion of course. However, due to personals reasons, I am unable to continue attending services at BRMC and I am currently attending another Methodist church, so no worries, we will not meet.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Illegal Operations,<br><br>Thanks for your compliment. If I may, I would to answer your questions directed at Poopoomoon.<br><br>Regarding the Jews, I believe that they will go to Heaven too when they die. This is because when God make a promise, He keeps it even if we do not keep our side of the bargain. Even though God would be greatly grieved that His own chosen people (the Jews) chose to reject Jesus Christ and thus Him, I think He still blesses them and He would not consign them to hell when they die. Greater civilizations have come and gone and yet tiny Israel survived all sorts of persecution throughout the centuries, God has not allowed and will not allow Israel to be snuffed out of existence and I take great comfort in that.<br><br>Regarding the dinos, there were no records of them in the bible but that does not mean they never existed. You have to remember the bible is GodÂ’s word of instruction for Christians on how to live our lives, perhaps to Him the dinos do not that figure much in His eyes and thus there were no mention of them. As it is now, the bible is over a 1000 pages in length, just imagine if God included every fact and feature, the bible would be utterly unaccessible to ordinary human beings. The bible is GodÂ’s guide for Christians to conduct ourselves in life, to comfort, remind and reassure us of His love for us eternally throughout the future generations in times of need, trouble and stress. It is not a record of world history but rather a record of His works and covenants with His chosen people and people who would later choose to believe in Him, so a lot of stuff does not get mentioned in the bible at all.<br><br>Mankind is fascinated with dinos just because of their sheer size, had dinos been small, they would not be used as a stumbling block to people in believing in God and His word. Some people will try to find missing links in the bible just to prove that the bible is not GodÂ’s word or not accurate, to me, that is not really helpful as they are asking the Bible to be a record book of world history which it is not meant to be that at all.<br><br>Regarding the Towel of Babel, that is when Mankind started speaking in different tongues as God was a little petty (no flames please, personal opinion, this is why I can identify with Him), saddened and annoyed that Mankind actually had the audacity to think that they would be clever and smarter than their creator, God. The following is from the bible regarding this issue, Genesis 11, verses 1 to 8 (New International Version):<br><br>Now the whole world had one language and a common speech. As men moved eastward, they found a plain in Shinar and settled there.<br><br>They said to each other, Â“Come, letÂ’s make bricks and bake them thoroughly.Â” They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar. Then they said, Â“Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth.Â”<br><br>But the LORD came down to see the city and the tower that the men were building. The LORD said, *Â“If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. **Come, let us go down and confuse their language, so they will not understand each other.Â”<br><br>So the LORD scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city. That is why it was called Babel Â– because there the LORD confused the language of the whole world. From there the LORD scattered them over the face of the whole earth.<br><br>Some notes on the above to help you understand better:<br><br>*This is the statement which lead me to conclude that my God is sometimes quite petty too, but <strong>actually it is me who is petty</strong> and wish to project that pettiness onto Him because it makes me feel good and close to Him, which is not very clever as I think He is taking note of my impertinence in heaven now and every time I cite this example.<br><br>One of my study bible explains the phrase <strong>Â“nothing ... will be impossibleÂ”</strong> refers to ManÂ’s potential for doing evil. ItÂ’s similar to our figure of speech Â“anything can happen.Â” When a culture unites, the power that results can be dangerous. History demonstrates the tragic results when people have power but use it the wrong way. God scattered the people to undermine this potential for destructive behaviour.<br><br>** In Christianity, God is the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ) and the Holy Spirit [the Trinity], a difficult concept to appreciate and one which I took literally years to come to terms with. Now I just take it as God can be three separate entities and a 3-in-1 when He feels like it. Come on, if we can believe all those sci-fi movies, why canÂ’t my God be a 3-in-1 if He wants to and be separate entities when he feels like it??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Some study bibles describes this as God speaking to his heavenly court of angels or as the word for God in Hebrew (Elohim) is plural, so that may indicates that God was taking counsel with himself and this may also hint at the mystery of the Trinity Â– in the unity of God, there is plurality.<br><br>Regarding the spiritual healer like Benny Hinn and Christians who refused medical treatment, when they die, who do we blame? No flames please, blame the Christian in question and the person who advocates no medical treatment required and still be healed type of preaching. God did say that we are to pray but there were no promises all our prayers will be fulfilled. If they were, I would be holidaying in the French Riviera now instead of typing this to you, but I digress. God made and gave us doctors and dentists and surgeons, you get the drift.<br><br>What is the use of God giving us great and wonderful doctors who can cure and help ease our pains if we refused His gift? So to me, when a patient dies from lack of medical treatment, there is no one to blame but himself if he refuses to seek medical help and the person who advocates no medical treatment required and still be healed type of preaching. <strong>Definitely not my God, no blame should be laid there</strong>. For heavenÂ’s sake, even during Jesus ChristÂ’s time, there were doctors already, Luke who wrote the 2 great books Â“LukeÂ” and Â“ActsÂ” of the New Testament was a doctor. If doctors were not meant to help heal us, there would be no doctors and since Luke was a good doctor himself, <strong>God definitely never forbid us to seek the doctorÂ’s help.</strong><br><br>And I would really hope that Christians whose beliefs differ from mine be logical about this, some medical conditions really needs medications, without medications, they will die faster or they will suffer relapses. I mean all of will us die one day, but why hurry the process? I canÂ’t speak for my God, but I think it grieves Him greatly whenever He sees someone dying unnecessarily due to misguided notions preached by mere men about Him. <strong>It has never been written in the bible (I am not sure as I have yet to finish the whole bible, but I am confident that it is not in the bible at all) that we cannot seek medical help when sickness strikes.</strong><br><br>I hope my answers may give you some ideas about my God. Best regards,<br>colette<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Enigma,<br><br>Sorry, once I get started on Christianity, I just canÂ’t seem to stop and now IÂ’m butting my nose in almost everything and actually I am trying not to post in this forum anymore, I was away for 10 days but I succumbed to its lure again early this morning.<br><br>I think another reason why Christianity seems to put people off is the word sinner and every time someone preaches, they would start: Repent all sinners. Somehow, the word sinner is so offensive to a lot of people. I do not problems with admitting that I am a sinner, not even in the beginning because I know I can be very two-faced, I mean I do not go round telling everyone the truth about how I actually feel about them. Basically everybody sins, right from when they know how to think. Because a simple white lie is also considered a sin, thus all of us would be sinners and letÂ’s admit it, there is nothing more fun than sinning, forbidden fruits are the best, itÂ’s just the perverted nature of man to want to sin. An example would be a chio girl throwing herself at you and a chio girl you are trying to court, who gives you more thrill, somehow the girl whom you can get easily without effort simply has no kick, right? If you are a girl, please imagine the scenario with guys. You would put me in my place if you answer that you prefer the girl who throws herself at you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>To rationalize my guilty feelings because IÂ’m not supposed to harbour such ill will towards others, I admit I am human, thus not perfect, IÂ’m merely being diplomatic, tactful and it is way impossible for me to love everyone. Come on, somehow, some people are just more lovable than others and some people could just ... you know, for all I care. Not very Christ-like, isnÂ’t it? But hey, I am only human although I do try very hard not to harbour ill will towards my not so lovable fellow human beings residing on the same earth as me. I rather be frank about how I feel and appear like a spoilt brat than to mouth platitudes I do not possess or believe.<br><br>Regarding your statement as Christians that our sins are forgiven if we believe in God and embrace Him in our hearts, our sins are indeed forgiven but that is no guaranteed passage to heaven. If we sin by telling a white lie, of course we sin when we do not believe in God, specifically my Lord Jesus Christ. I think that is what offends most people, not that one sins when one does not believe in God but when one does not believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God, they sin. I guess a lot of people are offended that Jesus Christ actually dared claimed to be the Son of God and the only true way to God but as a Christian, there is no way I can entertain the idea anyone else can be God, Jesus Christ is my only God, I hope you can understand a ChristianÂ’s difficulty as well.<br><br>If you are at the stage where you are searching for God, I hope you could set aside your unhappiness or resentment at our Â“absoluteÂ” kind attitude and be a little open minded and do open your heart a little, you may find that my God could be your God too. But of course, no one can force you to accept my Christian God as your God, but I do find that if one is resentful or resists Jesus Christ from the start, it is harder for one to accept Him as his/her personal Saviour. Sometimes, it takes years before one accepts Christ as his/her personal Saviour, sometimes, it may take only one incident to convert someone but whatever the case, being a Christian does not stop at having accepting Jesus Christ, it requires a lot of hard work and a will to change our previous habits, attitudes and beliefs, it is really tough being a Christian.<br><br>And let me share with the rest of the forumites, being a Christian does not mean life is a bed of roses, I have been greatly blessed and greatly tried too, it is during the trying times that will test oneÂ’s faith, itÂ’s okay if oneÂ’s faith wavers during crisis and He will strengthen one again as long as one does not give up on Him and ask Him for help, He will surely show His grace although sometimes not in the way one usually hope for.<br><br>I think most people have a misguided idea that Christians are not supposed to have fun, but thatÂ’s not true. Of course certain stuff are totally out like amorality, but generally Christians are allowed to have fun. I think I have fun.<br><br>Another thing that makes a lot of people resistant to accepting Jesus Christ as God is that it seems too easy. How could it be that by just saying the SinnerÂ’s Prayer, poof! all my sins are forgiven? But it is indeed that easy, why look a gift in the horseÂ’s mouth or was it a horse in the giftÂ’s mouth? That is why Jesus Christ said that children will have an easy time getting into heaven, because of their child-like faith. As most of us here are unmarried, none will have children of our own, but we have nieces and nephews right? When you give them a gift, have they ever rejected it? LetÂ’s not be petty and have posts about lousy booby gifts, what I mean is a reasonable gift, something that they would want. As adults, somewhere along the line, most of us lose that child-like trust and that is really sad, note that here I wrote child-like, not childish and child-like is definitely not stupidity either.<br><br>Okay, I better stop as my posts are really lengthy, Revelations, another forumite, [Hi Revelations! ItÂ’s good to see you again now that the rest are gone, that sure made you feel special, doesnÂ’t it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Seriously, itÂ’s good to see you again] complained in another thread about the length of this thread.  :p<br><br>IÂ’m just sharing my personal opinions and definitely you can disagree with me but no flames please.

            <div class='col-md body'>hi quarzimodo,<br><br>er, a personal question, are you really that ugly that you had to choose quarzimodo as your nick or are you in fact quite good looking?<br><br>it is true, Jesus definitely did not want shove His commands down peopleÂ’s throats, He won them over with His love, gentleness and grace. but then, we are human what, how to compare with Him? He preaches if you slap my right cheek, iÂ’m to offer you my left. er, i have not attain that kind of Christ-like submissive attitude yet, so if you slap my right cheek for no rhyme or reason, iÂ’m liable to slap you back too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">. probably on both cheeks.  :p<br><br>Jesus Christ performed miracles and wonders to sort of prove that He is the Son of God, the final miracle being the Crucifixion and rising again on the third day as prophesied, this is another corner-stone of belief that Christians hold. If one does not believe that Jesus Christ died and rise again on the 3rd day, then itÂ’s very hard for them to be called a Christian. please bear in mind that even when Jesus Christ Himself did all those miracles and wonders, not everybody believed Him because of it. first generation Christians (the Apostles or Disciples) and maybe a few more generations thereafter (these few more generations are just my guesses, but the first generation Christian were definitely able to perform miracles) were blessed with special powers to perform miracles and wonders because the Church was at its infancy and God is not stupid, when His Son was on earth and performed miracles and wonders, not all believed Him but all asked for Him to be crucified instead, what about His disciples? So some of the disciples and a few other Christians were given powers to do the miracles and wonders to bring people to the young church.<br><br>As time passes by, i think this breed of people gets lesser and lesser until itÂ’s not that common now as Jesus Christ already gave advance notice that itÂ’s better &amp; greater to believe without seeing than to believe after seeing, or something to that effect. sorry iÂ’m tired already and to check for the bible reference is just too much for me now. and with the bible finally complied and ready, all Christians are to believe and rely on that.<br><br>regarding the moving mountains matter, itÂ’s a parable, itÂ’s not supposed to be taken literally, basically it means that if you have the faith in God, all matters can be solved, but i believed that you may have found out that that may not be true, but please do not lose hope and faith. sometimes a matter may not be concluded to our satisfaction at the time, especially when loved ones depart unnecessarily, but for most other matters, sometimes with hindsight, it does turn out for the best and of course you have to be ruthlessly honest with yourself whether the outcome became what it was because you ignored that sensible voice (GodÂ’s guiding voice) or did that sensible voice lead you astray? which is highly impossible. most times, when things turned out wrong, it could be one did not consult God enough or put enough thought to the matter.<br><br>hehe ... you should hear my own desperate prayers and recriminations to God, He doesnÂ’t do requests on tap, which is really unfortunate for you and me, you have to wait and learn to see the signs, He usually doesnÂ’t give you exactly what you prayed for to solve your problems but He will definitely send something/someone along the way to help you solve the problem, it took me a while to catch on to His replies to me. sometimes i just ask Him, why doesnÂ’t He help me solve the problem pronto and let me get on with life? er, no answer yet, but i suppose there is something iÂ’m supposed to learn in that trial, sometimes if iÂ’m lucky, i actually know the objective of the painful experience, sometimes, i need time to figure it out.<br><br>by the way, Jesus Christ, for reasons known to himself loved to speak in parables, which means that what you read in the bible is not as straight forward as it seems, so if youÂ’re in doubt or would like to check out the facts, one great and free place to do research is the Christianity section of Borders, they have a great selection of bibles there and you can read for free. er, please try to buy something else there if you read too much free stuff, if no one buys anything from them, they may close down.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> oh, i donÂ’t work there, i read there too, buying only occasionally.<br><br>as written in my earlier posts, itÂ’s really hard to bring non-believers to Jesus Christ as most are resistant to Him and more or less have a closed heart. i could pour out my heart about my walk with Him but if youÂ’re skeptical and have a closed heart to Him, my most moving experience would not touch you at all. one has to be open minded and receptive to receive Jesus Christ, i guess that goes for a lot of things too.<br><br>okay, got to go. regards,<br>colette</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>quarzimodo,<br>Yes i agree.<br>Yesterday night while i was doing something<br>suddenly i realized my mistakes.<br><br>i should have preached god's love for man.<br>i shouldn't have just related the facts.<br>it made me sounded like a cultist.<br>I am not a cultist, and i will never want   to be one.<br><br>but so far, i tried my best to say<br>things which i had learnt from all   christian books. They are not all my   personal views. Those which are from<br>bible i will say "God says" "Jesus say"<br>or " in the Bible".<br>Those which are not are mostly what i<br>learnt from  other christian materials.<br><br>Just because i was won over by the facts       and god's love doesn't mean everybody will       be the same.<br><br>I hereby apologize to god and everyone.<br>I really learnt a lesson here.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am sorry.<br>Christians' do not go around denouncing all other religions. We DO NOT think we are the best.<br><br>I did not purposely do so. I was just trying to make you guys understand the things that are going on now in the world, because<br>a lot of things written in the bible<br>is going to come true.<br>Like the cashless society system.<br>Do you know what it is?<br>Do you use the MRT card when you take<br>bus or MRT? It is , i believe,<br>the primary form of the cashless society system.<br><br>We are not arrogant. It is because of the confidence and trust in God we have that<br>you see that we are arrogant.<br><br>I had tried very hard to make you understand because time is running out.<br><br>You may not believe it, everyday it seemed so peaceful in Singapore here.<br>but there is a raging war out there between forces of god and satan. You may not think you want to side any one of them, but everyone of us is involved.<br><br>God loved us and wanted us to accept Jesus.<br>They want us to be saved.<br>We can't see with the naked eye, we cannot hear it. God just hope you will accept Jesus.<br><br>Who in heaven who in hell, i am in no position to judge. I just want everyone to go heaven.<br>I know it's not possible, not everyone will agree with me, and many think my brain short-circuited.<br><br>You may think i am crazy.<br>But a lot of things you have to experience yourself then you'll understand. You have to make a decision.<br><br></div>
