            <div class='col-md body'>Â“Ladies and gentlemen,Â” the organiser raised his voice. Â“Tonight we are very glad to have Mr Caramon here to speak with us." As you all know, Mr Caramon made his first million at the age of only 25.. Today he has built up an estate worth 10 million.. Let us welcome our distinguish speaker for today, MR Caramon..<br><br>" Thank you everyone down here.. Its my pleasure to be here." I see a lot of young guests tonight.. Hmm, so how are you all feeling right now? funny feeling I guessed.. Keke..<br><br>" Alright" before I begin.. can I have a show of hands, how many think that doing business is tough?  Wow, thats a lot.. Nevermind.. I will show you how easy it is.. Argg ( Clears my throat)<br><br>During my sec school, I found myself bottom three in my class.. I was in sec 4 then.. when my dad found out, he was furiously mad.. I must had hurt his heart deeply.. But I never change, and as you have guess, I failed my "O" levels..<br><br>It was not until at the middle of the year when the truth hit me.. One day, my mum told me that dad got retrenched.. coming from a lower middle-class income family, the future looks even more bleak.. That year I retake my "O" and got a decent enough results to get into poly..<br><br>Over the years, life was hard, but the entrepreneur spirits in me never ceased..<br><br>SO ladies and gentlemen, I am sure you are here today for a reason.. Like me, YOU want to enjoy finanical freedom, am I right? Haha...  Ok...  To be a business man, you need the following criteria.. you must be :<br><br>1) Commited<br>2) Persistance<br>3) Enthusiasm<br><br>In other words, if you have to endure 16hrs of work, DO it.. If the client gives you end-less trouble and don't give you a deal, nevermind, continue to follow-up.. There's a case which happens to me : This guy was sure he don't need my products.. in fact a lot of other business associates told me that.. however I persist, and they are shocked when I clinched the deal.. WHY ?<br><br>That day I happened to be at his door, when he need my service.. after numerous attempt, It pays off.. was the hour spent worth it? Well, no matter how much you hates your client, how you dislike his/her face, end of the day, as long as you earned his/her money you are the WINNER.. You gained his/her profits..<br><br>To me, the most satisfying aspect of selling is not so much of the money I earn, but that I get to meet different types of people all the time.. The trust each time when they hand me the money is.... what money can't buy..<br><br>The odds were all heavily stacked against me when I first started.. Little money and no head-start.. If I can do it, so can you..<br><br>With that, I wished everyone of you here good luck and good night</div>
