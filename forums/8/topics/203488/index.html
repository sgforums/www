            <div class='col-md body'>This is to continue the discussion from eternal hope where the thread is locked apparently for no apparent reason.<br><br><blockquote>if god dont exist...y r u all here?<br>...</blockquote>U ask the wrong question. Why do u assume tat everything has to come for a reason ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> If u can prove to me tat eveyrthing need to have a reason, then I can show u wat tat reason is. By the way, if u wanna start on answering tat question, perhaps u can start by giving the reason why the english word "the" is spelled as "the" and not "te" or "che" or "phe" or the infiite combination watever ?<br><br><blockquote>if u ppl want to say theres no god...<br>prove it... </blockquote>The burden of proving god rest on the people ho believes in it. Ti is especially so since exceptional claims demand exceptonal evidence. Otherwise I can claim flying speghetti monster or invisible pink unicorn and no one can prove it to be wrong.<br><br><blockquote>if u ppl want to say ''God doesnt give us money,water and food like the UN gave food to the ppor countries..''<br>den tell me who creates money...who creates water and foor...WHO CREATES U... explain to me</blockquote>Tat come to another question. Why do u believe tat things have to be created to exists and not just there because of nature ? Water is just there because the earth has water and it is there due to nature process and not divine ones.<br><br><blockquote>den can u say that science makes colours?can u tell me who NAMED the colours?</blockquote>Wat make colors ? nobody, it is just there because of nature. Who named colors ? Definition or words r invented by human.<br><br><blockquote>God has sent prophets and messengers with many proofs throughout the ages for people to be able to clearly see with their own eyes and to be able to use their own senses the miracles and proofs pointing to the fact, God does in fact, exist. </blockquote>If I am not wrong u get tat information from the scriptures. A lot of other religious scriptures such as hinduism also claim many miracles and deities coming over to mankind to tide over difficulties etc. How do u distinguish tat your religion is right while the other religions r wrong ?<br><br><blockquote>no one sees or hears God, not even the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. Nor are we able to use our senses to make some kind of contact with Him. However, we are encouraged in Islam to use our senses and our common sense to recognize all of this universe could not possibly come into existence on its own. Something had to design it all and then put it into motion. This is beyond our ability to do, yet it is something we can understand. </blockquote>According to christian/jewish belief, god did appear to people such as moses, abraham where they can use their physical senses of hearing to hear wat god says etc.<br><br></div>
