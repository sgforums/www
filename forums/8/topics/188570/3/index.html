Anti-PAP forum people over here (I shan't name who they are) will take every opportunity to shoot PAP regardless of whether they know the whole story or not. This case is obviously your fault because you rejected singapore citizenship! You were given a choice to enjoy Singapore citizen benefits but you rejected it! Dont say tht u served NS before and u deserve all the NS benefits. We are talking about citizen benefits here. The government cant go around giving money to non-citizens who served NS and not want to be singapore citizens right? If the governent does that, then the Anti-PAP forum people over here will start saying that the government is wasting unnecessary money on non-citizens and neglecting its own citizens. Am I right, Anti-PAP people (you know who you are)?</div>

Doing NS does not give you the right to be a citizen and also not give you the right to get any benefits out of Singapore!!  Doing NS only give you a choice of whether you are capable or fit to be citizen.  This system is to deter people like you looking to get benefits and also stopping you to abuse the system here.<br><br>As to what you mention that you bring $ to singapore, the other side could be true that you are taking money out from singapore too!!!<br><br>Also you being a PR not a citizen will not allow you to the full entitlement a singaporean will get, and that is simple because you have no loyalty to the country!!!  You are just a parasite where there is good you suck on it.<br><br>So dont come and stir shit as I strongly believe that only those contribute to the country with a sense of loyalty in this case a citizen should entitle to the rightful benefits.</div>
