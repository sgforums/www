This case is obviously your fault because you rejected singapore citizenship! You were given a choice to enjoy Singapore citizen benefits but you rejected it! Dont say tht u served NS before and u deserve all the NS benefits. We are talking about citizen benefits here. The government cant go around giving money to non-citizens who served NS and not want to be singapore citizens right? If the governent does that, then the Anti-PAP forum people over here will start saying that the government is wasting unnecessary money on non-citizens and neglecting its own citizens.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think some of your got my point of the thread wrongly.<br><br>When Govt declared the NS Bonus package, they said, "in recognition to ALL NSF and NSmen who have contributed to Singapore by serving NS."<br><br>So I was asked to serve NS, I HAD a choice to serve or not. But to not serve means I will be denied to ever have the chance of becoming a citizen. As of now, I have rejected the SAF-backed Citizenship but I am still eligible to apply for citizenship.<br><br>To be honest with you, I wanted to take Singapore citizenship towards the end of NS. But because of legal implications that may affect my family prejudicially back home, I defered the citizenship offer till dual citizenship is allowed.<br><br>Going straight to my point is, IF the Bonus is to recognise people who have contributed to Mindef/SAF. Why are PRs excluded when I can say they "volunteerily" served NS as ALL PRs have the choice not to serve NS.<br><br>PRs served NS because they feel an attachment to Singapore, they see Singapore as their home.<br><br>PRs having no voice in election is acceptable as it has always been a citizen's right. But to have laws to make PRs serve NS and at the end of it not recognise their effort is simply a cold shoulder in the eyes of PR.<br><br>Its not about money. It's about recognition.<br><br>To those people who wants to take a snipe at me, I am ignoring your immature comments.</div>
