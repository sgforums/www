            <div class='col-md body'>ur case is really very unique i'd say. but really, it's quite clear cut they're rewarding those who can vote. if u wan recognition, sure, u can go get ur citizenship now.<br><br>but u didn't (or shld i say can't cos of ur situation), so NS or not, u're still a PR in the eyes of everyone, carrying a blue IC.<br><br>PR is PR.
