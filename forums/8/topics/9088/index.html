            <div class='col-md body'>Taken from Straits Times Interactive today<br><br>Nigerian girl to get 180 lashes for pre-marital sex<br><br>GUSAU (Nigeria) -- An Islamic court in northern Nigeria has sentenced a 17-year-old pregnant girl to 180 lashes of the whip, after finding her guilty of engaging in pre-marital sex, a court official said on Wednesday.<br><br>Bariya Ibrahim Magazu was found guilty last week by the new Islamic court at Isafe in northern Zamfara State, the court's presiding judge, Malam Idris Usman Gusau, said here.<br><br>Police in the village of Magazu in July reported the unmarried 17-year-old to the court after observing that she was several months' pregnant, the judge said.<br><br>Asked by the court to identify the father, she named three middle-aged men as being the possible father, saying that all three had paid her to have sex with them, adding that it had been against her wishes.<br><br>Seven witnesses cited by the girl were unable to confirm the claims against the three men, all farmers living in the village, to the satisfaction of the court, which demands strict proof.<br><br>As a result, the judge last week sentenced the girl to receive 100 lashes of the whip for engaging in pre-marital sex and 80 lashes for making unsubstantiated claims against the three men, he said.<br><br>The girl, who is soon expected to deliver her child, has been consigned to the care of her parents and then 40 days after the delivery will be publicly flogged, the judge said. -- AFP<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------<br><br>Isn't it a wonder if people have this image of Islamic nations as terrorist-infested, women-hating, decidedly a horrible place to live in?  Aren't the Arabian countries famous for raping the foreign maids that work there?  And Libya is full of people who maul and kill and are certain that they are doing it in God's will, that if they die they'll go to heaven.<br><br>Perhaps it's a good religion in its pure teaching, but certainly it is the most abused of all the religions nowadays.  I am convinced that it is because Islamic laws can't be changed with time.  Thinking and arguing about whether a law has lost its invalidity is out of the question.  Thus, everything the book says, whether or not the interpretation is correct in the first place, can be done.<br><br>Really, just because they have oil all over the place,...</div>
