R. Rahman.<br><br>So far, NOBODY has ever tried to realize, a well-made film documentary about<br>A. R. Rahman, his classical works, and his impact on we the listeners, music-lovers. Nothing exists like this.<br><br>We're talking about the greatest, most-famous, down-to-earth composer of our time. The man who redefined contemporary Indian music and who is the pride of the entire nation and an idol for millions all over the world needs no preamble.<br><br>It's only off-lately that we can see and hear A.R.Rahman interviewed by news channels, press, film launch parties, in some documentaries and special featurettes. But they're always scant 5-6 minute interviews, sometimes less or sometimes more. Most of these interviews are replayed over and over again is some or the other channel, and it just shows the same old thing !<br><br>Friends,<br>How many times have you watched him in an interview with your heart out, without any interferences. . . ( NONE! would be the answer !!)<br><br>Wouldn't it be great to see a 2-hour long documentary dedicated only to A. R. Rahman? A film documentary that shows all the creative process of the maestro, from the spotting sessions with the director, to the final mixing! All this intercut with a career-retrospective interview. It would be great to see archival footage from old musical sessions, to see A.R.Rahman at work with directors and musicians, intercut with clips from films he scored.<br><br>All A. R. Rahman fans and film music lovers would simply love to see something like this.<br><br>So, this petition is about :<br>A VCD-DVD Documentary on A.R.Rahman titled<br>"A. R. Rahman - The Mozart Of Asia"<br><br>If you all do see the way the west markets it's musicians; its just fabulous. They get the status just as the Director or Actor gets, Because they value music and know it's importance in cinema. We A.R.Rahman Fanatics and True Music Lovers, would know what his music is all about.<br><br>His music can change one's life for good. Can you imagine the number of talented musicians born in this country after 1992- the year a phenomenon called "A.R.Rahman" rocked the nation ! Can you imagine the number of people who have been healed through his music ? Can you imagine the number of musicians he has revived and brought them to limelight ? Can you imagine, a man of his stature, be a really "Good Human Being" ? Can you imagine ONE single Mind, Heart And Soul, which connects to you with the shear power of his music, and puts a smile on your face?<br><br>There can be only one and one, A.R.Rahman. himself ! to achieve all this at such an early age of his musical journey ! A man, who believes in god and finds his genius coming through spiritual influences!<br><br>This documentary would feature the life and works of A.R.Rahman, in-depth, in detail. It would feature the experiences of the singers and musicians he have a new lease of life. It would feature all the producers, whom he gave their moneys worth. It would feature all the directors whose vision just got enlightened by A.R.Rahmans soulful music! It would also feature the imapact of his music on normal people like us, you and me; it would feature real life stories and miracles, yes miracles that have occured, but are unseen and unheard of. Last but not the least, We could hear the great man himself speak....Speak about his life and music!<br><br>This petition is aimed to the people who can realize such an idea and that are close to A.R.Rahmans camp. Because realizing such a thing would cost a lot of money, a lot of time for research and it's not an easy task to do. And only companies and personalities like these have the means and the money to do it. When a good amount of signatures will be reached, this petition will be sent to these people and companies.<br><br>I hope to generate support from the large film music community all over INDIA and the world, from fans and professionals, from people who work in this field and people who simply love his kind of music.<br><br>A documentary about A. R. Rahman is not only a good way to celebrate the Legend, but itâ€™s also a great testament for future generations of film music and cinema lovers. It would be an amazing contribute to film history and literature too. It would be a motivator for all those young ang talented budding musicians, singers...and also a normal man.....<br><br>It's time to honor and pay tribute to A. R. Rahman and his music. And this is the bare minimum we can do to celebrate a legend who gave, and is still giving, such wonderful emotions to all of us.<br><br>Please each one of you who sign this document, go ahead and get atleast five more signatures on this petition to make a success. People from India and all round the world who are into A.R.Rahman's music and Sign this petition<br><br>For those who would like to volunteer for this Documentary in some way or the other, as in scripting, research work, some rare info's etc, please get in touch at : arr.2005@gmail.com.<br><br>Thank you for reading!<br>Sincerely,<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>The Undersigned</div>
