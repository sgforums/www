It is time again to lose some weight. Some of you might be regretting now and thinking you should not have eaten too much. Looking at the extra pounds you had put on, some of you might be looking for some quick fixes to solve the problem. If you are looking for quick fix here, then you are looking at the wrong place. These are some sensible tips that you may find useful for yourself.<br><br>The Holiday Season is upon us. This time of year we have the habit of indulging ourselves. Food is an important aspect of our celebrations. It is therefore obvious that we make wise food choices. Of course, this is easier said than done. Especially when we see some of the food that is available that is made by our family and friends.<br><br>In the majority of cases people will not be concerned with those of us watching our weight. Because of this they are less inclined to prepare healthier versions of their recipes. At this point it becomes our responsibility to both stick with our diets and to watch what we eat. It is obvious that the variety of dishes that we are presented with will be very tempting.<br><br>What follows are 10 eating suggestions that will help you with your weight loss program.<br><br>1. The first one is to stop eating when you are full. At this time of year this is something that many people do not do. This is especially true of those people that believe in cleaning their plates.

            <div class='col-md body'>i just want to comment that.."just as you didnt gain weight overnight, There is no way you can lose weight overnight as well". So patience and discipline is the crux to your slimming regime.<br><br>But Most importantly, what is your motivation to slim down? Get that straight 1st. Are u doing this regime to slim down so you can please this special girl or boy? If that is so, then the moment, this special someone rejects you, you will probably plunge back to your weight and if not more! Cz you eat MORE to vent your anger.<br><br>I also need to tell you that.. Regardless of wat you eat, be it protein, carbohydates or anything else, the Body is Still capable of converting it to fats. You can have a freaking healthy diet plan, but if you juz slack and dun do anything, it will end up as fats in the end.<br><br>WE are talking about a drastic change in your lifestyle, Walk more, Go window shopping, Walk around at least for 1 hr after u have your meal. Or Just skip taking short-feeder bus trips. AS for meals, Jz eat moderately per meal, there is no need to skIp meals; because the more meals you skip, the more your body would be reluctant to burn the food and it will want to store the fats.<br><br>Dieting is a simple equation of Outputs &gt;&gt;&gt; Inputs. As simple as that. So yeah. Understand your motivation for slimming down 1st.<br><br>Good Luck.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Eating right, by taking more greens and less meat or fried stuff and avoid all sugary cold drinks. Example cai peng less rice only 1 portion meat the other two portion veg or other non-meat stuff. Avoid supper and snacks at all costs. If you really have to eat something in between meals, take wide variety of  fruits and nuts as snacks.....a healthier alternative and keeps you from going hungry and something to bite on.<br>Cut your daily intake gradually so that it can be a long term solution that you can adhere to.<br>Start doing Cardio exercises such as jogging,cycling or swimming or take up sports by joining a club. Keep at it for at least half an hour or up to 1 hr or more. If tired just slow down or walk quickly but don,t stop and rest.<br>Set a long term target with immediate milestones to acheive it such as completing a half marathon or a sprint triathlon and work towards it.<br>Get friends that have similar objective or join a support group to help in losing weight together.<br>Take the stairs instead of the lift if you can.</div>

I eat as much dishes as I can but no rice. Every afternoon I will go for a very very slow jog of 2.4km to 3.2km. There was a stadium near my house. I take it a point to run 6-7 laps almost everyday. (the most outer lane).<br><br>Basically this is what I did for 4-5 months and it worked out for me. I was tired of being called fat by people that's why I decided to work things out for me. It really take a very slow process and not easy at all. But I was determined and I did it and to be honest Im very proud of myself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I don't know if this will work out for others but if anyone does apply my method and feel unwell, you have to stop imediately. Through process of it sometimes i do feel unwell, esp after a jog i will feel abit giddy and out of breath. The key point is everything is at your own pac, you don't have to race with time or anyone.<br><br>And when i mentioned slow jog means very very slow jog. I took 20-30 mins to finish the 6-7 laps. Something like I make it a point to finish 6-7 laps everyday and must jog for 20 mins and beyond. Of course for those who dislike to jog, someone mention swimming and cycling which I think is even better. Myself hate jogging alot and find it difficult the 1st time i step into the stadium. The 1st time i jogged, 3 rounds and i cannot take it already, out of breath (wonder if anyone has got the same experience as I do) But you must have that kind of determination. So i started slowly --&gt;<br><br>Let me recount my experience if anyone care to read on.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I started with 3 laps in the most inner lanes. (as i know i don't jog at all and it is always best to start slowly then you slowly advance further when you feel it is the right time.)<br><br>then i started to go out one more lane then lastly to the outer lane which was very very difficult at the start. Then from there I advance to 4 laps, it took me about 2 weeks and from there 5 laps. And when I have build up my stamina, I concentrate on 6-7 laps outer lane almost everyday. Most of the time is just 6 laps, the most i have gone is 9 laps and that's only once and after I realized it is not a neccesary to push yourself so hard, I tone down to 6 laps per day. of course those who want to lose weight does not neccesay need to follow my methods as Im not sure if it is recommenable anyway. Just my 2 cents on how I did it. I call it one of my biggest achievement.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Thank you</div></blockquote>thanks for ur contribution</div>

Actually don't have to go so low, sometimes BMI are just plain bull. I'll say someone with your height, at 60kg is just great. I stopped losing more weights because I realized if i had gone lower, I would become skinny which for a guy isn't very nice. Of course that's just my 2 cents. Whats most important is you are comfortable with yourself.</div>
