Btw, u gotta take nutritious food. If u dun have nutritious food, it is gd to supplement with multi-vitamins. u may like to take more chilli or spicy stuff as it increases metabolic rate excercise is gd, but u gotta do cardio excercises more than 1/2 hr to burn the fats</div>

I eat as much dishes as I can but no rice. Every afternoon I will go for a very very slow jog of 2.4km to 3.2km. There was a stadium near my house. I take it a point to run 6-7 laps almost everyday. (the most outer lane).<br><br>Basically this is what I did for 4-5 months and it worked out for me. I was tired of being called fat by people that's why I decided to work things out for me. It really take a very slow process and not easy at all. But I was determined and I did it and to be honest Im very proud of myself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I don't know if this will work out for others but if anyone does apply my method and feel unwell, you have to stop imediately. Through process of it sometimes i do feel unwell, esp after a jog i will feel abit giddy and out of breath. The key point is everything is at your own pac, you don't have to race with time or anyone.<br><br>And when i mentioned slow jog means very very slow jog. I took 20-30 mins to finish the 6-7 laps. Something like I make it a point to finish 6-7 laps everyday and must jog for 20 mins and beyond. Of course for those who dislike to jog, someone mention swimming and cycling which I think is even better. Myself hate jogging alot and find it difficult the 1st time i step into the stadium. The 1st time i jogged, 3 rounds and i cannot take it already, out of breath (wonder if anyone has got the same experience as I do) But you must have that kind of determination. So i started slowly --&gt;<br><br>Let me recount my experience if anyone care to read on.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I started with 3 laps in the most inner lanes. (as i know i don't jog at all and it is always best to start slowly then you slowly advance further when you feel it is the right time.)<br><br>then i started to go out one more lane then lastly to the outer lane which was very very difficult at the start. Then from there I advance to 4 laps, it took me about 2 weeks and from there 5 laps. And when I have build up my stamina, I concentrate on 6-7 laps outer lane almost everyday. Most of the time is just 6 laps, the most i have gone is 9 laps and that's only once and after I realized it is not a neccesary to push yourself so hard, I tone down to 6 laps per day. of course those who want to lose weight does not neccesay need to follow my methods as Im not sure if it is recommenable anyway. Just my 2 cents on how I did it. I call it one of my biggest achievement.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Thank you</div>

I eat as much dishes as I can but no rice. Every afternoon I will go for a very very slow jog of 2.4km to 3.2km. There was a stadium near my house. I take it a point to run 6-7 laps almost everyday. (the most outer lane).<br><br>Basically this is what I did for 4-5 months and it worked out for me. I was tired of being called fat by people that's why I decided to work things out for me. It really take a very slow process and not easy at all. But I was determined and I did it and to be honest Im very proud of myself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I don't know if this will work out for others but if anyone does apply my method and feel unwell, you have to stop imediately. Through process of it sometimes i do feel unwell, esp after a jog i will feel abit giddy and out of breath. The key point is everything is at your own pac, you don't have to race with time or anyone.<br><br>And when i mentioned slow jog means very very slow jog. I took 20-30 mins to finish the 6-7 laps. Something like I make it a point to finish 6-7 laps everyday and must jog for 20 mins and beyond. Of course for those who dislike to jog, someone mention swimming and cycling which I think is even better. Myself hate jogging alot and find it difficult the 1st time i step into the stadium. The 1st time i jogged, 3 rounds and i cannot take it already, out of breath (wonder if anyone has got the same experience as I do) But you must have that kind of determination. So i started slowly --&gt;<br><br>Let me recount my experience if anyone care to read on.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I started with 3 laps in the most inner lanes. (as i know i don't jog at all and it is always best to start slowly then you slowly advance further when you feel it is the right time.)<br><br>then i started to go out one more lane then lastly to the outer lane which was very very difficult at the start. Then from there I advance to 4 laps, it took me about 2 weeks and from there 5 laps. And when I have build up my stamina, I concentrate on 6-7 laps outer lane almost everyday. Most of the time is just 6 laps, the most i have gone is 9 laps and that's only once and after I realized it is not a neccesary to push yourself so hard, I tone down to 6 laps per day. of course those who want to lose weight does not neccesay need to follow my methods as Im not sure if it is recommenable anyway. Just my 2 cents on how I did it. I call it one of my biggest achievement.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Thank you</strong>[/quote<br><br>so how much did you lose?<br>oh do cut down on kit kats too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> [/b]</blockquote>I lost 10 over kg.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  My waist also gone down.<br>Haha of course I still do have kit kats once awhile, how could you miss the joy of life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

After I succeed in losing my weight, I take rice almost every meal now, sometimes it goes up 0.5 or 1kg then gradually it will stay at a 'fixed' kg. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually january, I want you to understand that my point is very simple, just like what CFCJ said. "Must have really good determination and discipline." Don't be like me, I was a desperado then (Because I used to be at an average weight then I grew FAT and everyone starts to talk but I truely wanted to lose weight is not entirelly because of the sarcasm and wasn't that bad to that extend but just that when you reach a certain age, it just struck to you that what should be best for you) and doesn't really know what was good for me, of course i tried reading up on losing metabolism and bla bla bla but was simply too lazy to do with the calculation hence i did it my way. Whatever it is, either you want to jog, swim or cycle. I wish you good luck and I believe as long you are determined and don't give up. You will make it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
