            <div class='col-md body'>I read thru some postings that 2 commandos posted. The postings were some time ago...abt aug2000 hence..did not bother to reply to them....but i really felt quite purturbed by their posting in which they downgrade the rest of the formation in the army and glorify their oh-so-great unit. I have to agree that the training that they get are tough..but that does not give them the previlige to brand the others in other units Ah-qua or sissys rite...I think that they have really overatted themselves..are the elite of the army getting too cocky...any commandos wanna clearify this issue? thks..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly I think Commandos or not...at the end of the day it depends what you want out of your army career. Do u really like wearing green? Will you enjoy the vocation? If you sign on with the Commandos, there is a substantial amt of risk involved largely due to the operations they undertake. The $$ is good but the downside is, you have only a micro view of how the entire army operates. If you hoping to climb really fast and high, dun join CDO. Long term career I will not recommend CDO.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sounds lame to some but really if you look at it at another perspective, it does make you play the mental game better. I guess they tried to instill the never say "impossible" sorta attitude. Playing human waste is disgusting but at the very least the first impression "this or that thingy is ridiculous so I dun do it" is "corrected". Honestly when you are dead tired, and having to carry half your body weight running and hiding over long distances, its no more physical fitness that matters.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have been as objective as possible and offering my best advise and what I think generally. I think before you shoot of the words "wayang" you should first and foremost have a taste of it in commandos first. As far as CDO is concern, esp the exercises, they are not wayang ... certain things are hard to "make too real" ... should I kick off the head of my fellow singaporeans from another unit during ATEC?? Guess not, come'on if you think its wayang then dun even bother making it a career ... dun even consider it. I mean why should any1 chase the wind? If its all fake and wayang, why spend a considerable part of your life devising new SOPs formulating methods of warfare etc. Jus my opinion. BTW I dun represent them, I hated the life there so I will never sign on.</div>

Its the ego on them that really irks me...its like...in a point blank distance with 7 men shooting at an officer...the CDO officer manage to stay alive (Never say Die Attitude...)and the 7 enemy are all shot by him..when questioned..he just say that because he is a commando officer..so he will manage to evade all your rounds and you are just men..so chances of getting shot by him is higher...and the best thing is that he issn't carrying a rifle!!!i don't really see any resemblances in a real warfare with that kind of attitude and...that is one incident that has the most impact in my mind...there are many other incidents that really make me wonder if the CDOs can really deliever the punch when required..and when i mean wayang..i do not mean that they are not trying hard in their exercies..but they just go thru the exercise as if that there are no enemy...and that every shot that they fire will sure hit a target..no matter what.....i am also trying to be objective here...i have no doubt abt their training...its tough i must agree..but dun you think that the CDOs are really relying too much on their tough training as a means of showing off..rather then to make sure that they are able to deliever when required</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess there are always the bad apples among the good ones. ATEC as you know it is like a game of basketball - each person will say the other foul ( not suggesting anything )... its the real world I guess. Probably you met a arsehole cdo officer. There are definitely some childish pricks ard, but hey why take offense  - they are like I say childish pricks. I went back for reservist and Im glad to say the attitude has changed dramatically. Moulded by the coporate world, the air ... the unjustifiable pride has mellowed down to a simple resolution "lets do it once and get the hell of this place".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Also we are not saying cdo are the best ... I agree that other units must work hand in hand to get any work done. There is no one absolute winner in the army ... only in its entirety we are effective.</div>
