It's really interesting.<br>Whahahahaa.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> From the straits times today.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><br><br>JAN 20, 2004<br>Girl Talk<br>The race to get hitched<br><br>The Dithering Late 20s is a confusing time for some girls who are not sure they want to get married, but start dating frantically anyway just because they are hitting 30<br><br>By Clara Chow<br><br>MY GIRL pal, who is in her late 20s, has embarked on a spate of last-ditch dating, in the quest for a soulmate.<br><br>A 27-year-old of a sunny disposition and blessed with exotic good looks, she is not short of suitors.<br><br>On Monday, she has drinks with Guy A. On Tuesday, she goes on a blind date with Guy B. On Thursday, she goes clubbing with Guy C.<br><br>And on Friday, she flirts via SMS with Guy A all night.<br><br>It sounds like she is on the right track, if only she can stop turning tail whenever things get remotely serious.<br><br>When a guy starts showing very definite signs of interest, she goes off him.<br><br>My friend is in the throes of what I call the Dithering Late 20s.<br><br>A woman in her Dithering Late 20s panics at the prospect of hitting the Big Three-O.<br><br>Unlike men, who do not need to worry about things like their ovaries drying up, women in this age group feel added pressure as relatives and peers intensify their 'when are you getting married?' questions.<br><br>The realisation that their biological clocks are incessantly ticking doesn't help.<br><br>Ever wonder why some of us get teary whenever we see babies? Tick tock.<br><br>So, saddled with all this pressure, a woman approaching 30 starts looking for a prospective mate because time is running out. Hence the frantic dating.<br><br>But deep down inside, settling down is probably the last thing she wants. Hence the dithering between various men.<br><br>As my girlfriend said to me while staring morosely into her gin and tonic: 'It's worse when you know that the men you are seeing are also looking for The One to marry within a specific time frame.'<br><br>In other words, they don't necessarily want you. Just a suitable bride. That's enough to turn a girl off.<br><br>She adds: 'When I was younger, I wanted to have a husband, two children, a car and a cat by 27.<br><br>'And now, the only thing I've managed to get is the car. Not even the cat.'<br><br>For some women, the last few years leading up to 30 are when they put in a last manic attempt to achieve that dream wedding which was part of their girlish dreams.<br><br>However, I have read that the pressure eases off once the psychological barrier age of 30 is passed.<br><br>A Salon.com article by Debra Ollivier earlier this month talked about how French girls learn early in life that happiness is elusive.<br><br>In comparison, American girls are concerned with things like finding a fairytale husband using what they learned in Harvard Business School.<br><br>She puts the difference in mindsets down to the fact that the French are a 'grown-up culture', whereas Americans are 'historically barely adolescent'.<br><br>French women sip Bordeaux while musing on passion and pathos; American women drink milk shakes and hope that their boyfriends will love them.<br><br>Singaporean women probably fare even worse when it comes to being sophisticated about passion. Perhaps the problem is that women here grow up in a super-efficient culture, and it has led us to see everything in terms of goals.<br><br>Haven't got a husband? Up your productivity level and start dating more men.<br><br>But in the rush to achieve such socially-sanctioned goals, many girls in their late 20s may not have thought properly about what they want.<br><br>Also, as women today are faced with more lifestyle choices, they are also finding it harder to decide what they really want.<br><br>A woman in her Dithering Late 20s is like a woman in a shoe store five minutes before closing time: Faced with so many options, she becomes paralysed with indecision.<br><br>Relationships are not the only things a girl dithers over.<br><br>I recently told an older colleague I would give up my career to be a mother.<br><br>He retorted: 'Why? You want an abstract thing.'<br><br>Indeed. While my desire for a husband and children is a palpable thing to me, I agree that I do not fully understand what these entail.<br><br>So in the name of research and productivity, perhaps I should make use of the next three years before I turn 30 to babysit other people's kids.<br><br>I want to be sure that that's what I really want.<br><br>Hopefully, it'll give me enough to think about to stop me from dithering.<br><br>So for those who are in their Dithering Late 20s, remember, getting married and having children is not a race.<br><br>As a friend who turns 30 this year said: 'Just chill. It'll look really silly once you reach the other side.'<br><br># Send your comments to stlife@sph.com.sg<br><br>Copyright @ 2003 Singapore Press Holdings. All rights reserved. </span></div>
