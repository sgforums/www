In such cases, I believe it's best to let him go even if you love him to bits. No point forcing him to settle down. Both of you will be miserable. Let him have his fun and give yourself a chance to meet others. If it's meant to be, you'll find each other again.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HI...just some personal experience lah.<br>WEll, i don't believe that if the person leave u she will come back again.  normally, human rather let yourself be regretted for the rest of your life than to go abck to your ex-lover...that;s human natural.  I',m sure most of us out there will agreed.  So if u can still try to persuade her to stay.  But if she still wants to leave, let her go.  At least, u tried your best to ask her to stay .  U won't be regretted.  If she's happier with other person, let her go. Coz U DON'T OWN HER. I knoe it very hard.  I ahve experience such situation few times.  But i get over to it and i learnt something in the process.  I can control my feeling and let her go with she;s happier.  I think that many pples have her wrong conception that if u love a person , she msut be with u.  For me, i really got this thinknig that, we pples should not think of wht will happen in the future, most important is that during the process of countship or loverstate we should be happy that we are able to be with them.  TReasure this moment as no one will knoew wht will happen next time.  At least, u r giving wht u can give ( in this case, your love and caring), at least U ARE HAPPY IN DOING EVERYTHING FOR HER. that;s the most important part. Even if u didn't manage to get hold of her in the future.  Thinking back next time will be a happy memories.  Isn't tht wht a relationship is all abt? Happy is the word.  Think about it .  U will understand sooner or later. It's really take time to see the light.  I'm sure all those pples out there can too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what else would you want to do? stalk the person? drag the relationship on? do the "i know you don't love me, but i dont give a damn as long as i'm still with you"? personally, i dont see the point. i have been in such a situation before, and dragging it on, with a person who expressly said he(or she) doesn't like you... it's useless. you feel stupid and disgusted by yourself for going so low, for behaving so cheaply, for throwing yourself at someone who doesn't like you. i don't see the point at all.</div>
