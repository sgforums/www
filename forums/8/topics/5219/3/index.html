Each person will pair off with the person<br>sitting to his or her immediate right.  One of you will then write the<br>first paragraph of a short story.  The partner will read the first<br>paragraph and then add another paragraph to the story.  The first<br>person will add a third paragraph, and  so on back and forth.<br>Remember to re-read what has been written each time in order to keep<br>the story coherent.

The<br>chamomile, which used to be her favorite for lazy evenings at home,<br>now  reminded her too much of Carl, who once said, in happier times, that<br>he  liked chamomile.  But she felt she must now, at all costs, keep her<br>mind off  Carl. His possessiveness was suffocating, and if she thought about<br>him too much  her asthma started acting up again.  So chamomile was out of<br>the question.<br>_________________________<br><br>Meanwhile, Advance Sergeant Carl Harris, leader of the attack<br>squadron,  now in orbit over Skylon 4, had more important things to think about<br>than the  neuroses of an air-headed asthmatic bimbo named Laurie with whom<br>he had spent one sweaty night over a year ago.  "A.S. Harris to<br>Geostation 17" he said into his trans-galactic communicator.  "Polar orbit<br>established."<br>No sign of resistance so far . . ."

Soon afterwards, Earth stopped its<br>pointless hostilities towards the peaceful farmers of Skylon 4.  "Congress<br>passes Law PermanentlyAbolishing War and Space Travel,"  Laurie read in her<br>newspaper one morning. The news simultaneously excited her and bored<br>her.  She stared out of the window, dreaming of her youth -- when the<br>days had passed unhurriedly and carefree, with no newspapers to read, no television to distract her from her sense of innocent wonder at all the beautiful things around her.<br>"Why must one lose one's innocence to become a woman?"  she pondered wistfully.<br><br>_______________________________________<br><br>Little did she know, but she has less than 10 seconds to live.<br>Thousands  of miles above the city, the Anu'udrian mothership<br>launched the first of its lithium fusion missiles.  The dim-witted wimpy peaceniks who pushed the Unilateral Aerospace Disarmament Treaty through Congress had left Earth a defenseless target for the hostile alien empires who where<br>determined to destroy the human race.  Within two hours after the passage of the treaty, the Anu'udrian ships were on course to Earth, carrying<br>enough firepower to pulverize the entire planet.  With no one to stop them,<br>they swiftly initiated their diabolical plan.  The lithium fusion missile entered<br>the atmosphere unimpeded.  The President in his top secret mobile<br>submarine headquarters on the ocean floor off the coast of Guam, felt the<br>inconceivably massive explosion which vaporized Laurie and 85 million other Americans.<br>The President slammed his fist on the conference table, "We can't allow this!<br>I'm going to veto that treaty!  Let's blow 'em out of the sky!"<br><br>_______________________________<br><br>This is absurd.

No problems for the first few stops, a few people got on, a few got off, and things went generally well.<br><br>At the next stop, however, a big hulk of a guy got on. Six feet eight, built like a wrestler, arms hanging down to the ground. He glared at the driver and said, "Big John doesn't pay!" and sat down at the back. Did we mention that the driver was five feet three, thin, and basically meek? Well, he was. Naturally, he didn't argue with Big John, but he wasn't happy about it.<br><br>The next day the same thing happened--Big John got on again, made a show of refusing to pay, and sat down. And the next day, and the one after that, and so forth. This grated on the bus driver, who started losing sleep over the way Big John was taking advantage of him.<br><br>Finally he could stand it no longer. He signed up for body building courses, karate, judo, and all that good stuff. By the end of his summer vacation, he had become quite strong; what's more, he felt really good about himself.<br><br>So on the next Monday, when Big John once again got on the bus and said, "Big John doesn't pay!" the driver stood up, glared back at the passenger, and screamed, "And why not?"<br><br>With a surprised look on his face, Big John replied, "Big John has a bus pass."<br><br>Comebacks to that all time favorite question "Why Aren't You Married Yet?"<br><br>You haven't asked yet.<br><br>I was hoping to do something meaningful with my life.<br><br>Because I just love hearing this question.<br><br>Just lucky, I guess.<br><br>It gives my mother something to live for.<br><br>My fiancÃ©e is awaiting his/her parole.<br><br>I'm still hoping for a shot at Miss/Mr. America.<br><br>Do you know how hard it is to get two tickets to Miss Saigon?<br><br>I'm waiting until I get to be your age.<br><br>It didn't seem worth a blood test.<br><br>I already have enough laundry to do, thank you.<br><br>Because I think it would take all the spontaneity out of dating.<br><br>My co-op board doesn't allow spouses.<br><br>I'd have to forfeit my billion dollar trust fund.<br><br>They just opened a great singles bar on my block.<br><br>I wouldn't want my parents to drop dead from sheer happiness.<br><br>I guess it just goes to prove that you can't trust those voodoo doll rituals.<br><br>What?

Police<br>arrived at the scene to find an ill man curled up next to a motor<br>home near spilled sewage. A police spokesman said that the man<br>admitted to trying to steal gasoline and plugged his hose into the<br>motor home's sewage tank by mistake. The owner of the vehicle<br>declined to press charges, saying that it was the best laugh he'd<br>ever had.<br>A woman was reporting her car as stolen, and mentioned that there was<br>a car phone in it. The policeman taking the report called the phone<br>and told the guy that answered that he had read the ad in the<br>newspaper and wanted to buy the car. They arranged to meet, and the<br>thief was arrested.<br>David Posman, 33, was arrested recently in Providence, R.I, after<br>allegedly knocking out an armored car driver and stealing the closest<br>four bags of money. It turned out they contained $800 in PENNIES,<br>weighed 30 pounds each, and slowed him to a stagger during his<br>getaway so that police officers easily jumped him from behind.<br>Drug-possession defendant Christopher Johns, on trial in March in<br>Pontiac, Michigan, said he had been searched without a warrant. The<br>prosecutor said the officer didn't need a warrant because a "bulge"<br>in Christopher's jacket could have been a gun. Nonsense, said<br>Christopher, who happened to be wearing the same jacket that day in<br>court. He handed it over so the judge could see it. The judge<br>discovered a packet of cocaine in the pocket and laughed so hard he<br>required a five-minute recess to compose himself.<br>Clever drug traffickers used a propane tanker truck entering El Paso<br>from Mexico. They rigged it so propane gas would be released from all<br>of its valves while the truck concealed 6,240 pounds of marijuana.<br>They were clever, but not bright. They misspelled the name of the<br>gas company on the side of the truck.<br>Oklahoma City -Dennis Newton was on trial for the armed robbery<br>of a convenience store in a district court this week when he fired<br>his lawyer. Assistant district attorney Larry Jones said Newton, 47,<br>was doing a fair job of defending himself until the store manager<br>testified that Newton was the robber. Newton jumped up, accused the<br>woman of lying and then said, "I should of blown your [expletive]<br>head off." The defendant paused, then quickly added, "-if I'd been<br>the one that was there." The jury took 20 minutes to convict Newton<br>and recommend a 30-year sentence.<br>R.C. Gaitlin, 21, walked up to two patrol officers who were showing<br>their squad car computer equipment to children in a Detroit<br>neighborhood. When he asked how the system worked, the officers asked<br>him for a piece of identification. Gaitlin gave them his driver's<br>license, they entered it into the computer, and moments later they<br>arrested Gaitlin because information on the screen showed that Gaitlin<br>was wanted for a two-year-old armed robbery in St. Louis, Missouri.<br><br></div>

'Oh<br>no,' she says 'there must be something wrong<br>with Scruffy!'  She scoops the dog up and rushes<br>him to the vet.  Doctor doctor, please help, she<br>says as she puts him on the table.  After a<br>short examination the doctor says, 'I'm sorry<br>madam but I believe your dog has died.' 'Oh but<br>there must be something you can do,' said the<br>woman.  'Well there is one thing,' said the vet<br>as he pulled a sack from the closet near by.<br>The vet opened the sack and placed a scronny old<br>cat on the table next to the dog.  The cat<br>looked at the dog and hissed.  It then preceeded<br>to walk around the dog cautiosly, smelling and<br>hissing.  The vet put the cat back in the bag<br>and said, 'there is nothing more I can do.' The<br>old women said,'I guess you're right doctor,<br>Scruffy hates cats and if he wasn't dead he<br>would surely have barked.'

            <div class='col-md body'>Subject: If You Gotta Go, Start Early<br><br>This story is about a rather strange reply for a<br>campground reservation.  It is said to be true,<br>but you be the judge.<br><br>A woman who was rather old-fashioned, delicate,<br>and elegant - especially in her language - was<br>planning a week's vacation in Florida so she wrote<br>to a particular campground and asked for a<br>reservation.<br><br>She wanted to make sure the campground was fully<br>equipped, but didn't quite know how to ask about<br>the toilet facilities.  She just couldn't bring<br>herself to write the word 'TOILET' in her letter.<br>After much deliberation, she finally came up with<br>the old-fashioned term 'BATHROOM COMMODE.'  But<br>when she wrote that down, she still thought she<br>was being too forward.  So, she started all over<br>again, rewrote the letter and referred to the<br>bathroom commode merely as the B.C.  'Does the<br>campground have it's own B.C.?' is what she<br>actually wrote.<br><br>Well, the campground owner wasn't old-fashioned at<br>all and when he got the letter, he just couldn't<br>figure out what the woman was talking about.  That<br>B.C. business really stumped him.<br><br>After worrying about it for a while, he showed the<br>letter to several campers, but they couldn't<br>imagine what the lady meant either.  So the<br>campground owner, finally coming to the conclusion<br>that the lady must be asking about the location of<br>the local Baptist Church, sat down and wrote the<br>following reply:<br><br>'Dear Madam:  I regret very much for the delay in<br>answering your letter. I now take the pleasure in<br>informing you that a B.C. is located nine miles<br>north of the campground and is capable of seating<br>250 people at one time.  I admit it is quite a<br>distance away if you are in the habit of going<br>regularly, but no doubt you will be pleased to<br>know that a great number of people usually take<br>their lunches along and make a day of it.  They<br>usually arrive early and stay late.'<br><br>'The last time my wife and I went was six years<br>ago and it was so crowded that we had to stand up<br>the whole time we were there.  It may interest you<br>to know that right now, there is a supper being<br>planned to raise money to buy more seats.  They're<br>going to hold it in the basement of the B.C.'<br><br>'I would like to say it pains me very much not to<br>be able to go more regularly but it is sure no<br>lack of desire on my part.  As we grow older, it<br>seems to be more of an effort, particularly in<br>cold weather.'<br><br>'If you do decide to come down to our campground,<br>perhaps I could go with you the first time you go,<br>sit with you, and introduce you to all the other<br>folks.'<br><br>'Remember, this is a friendly community.'<br><br>------------------<br>It takes a moment to have a crush on someone,an hour to like someone,and a day to love someone,but it takes a lifetime to forget her.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;There was a little boy<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;about 12 years old walking down the footpath dragging a<br>&gt;flattened<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;frog<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; on<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;a string behind him. He comes up to the doorstep of a house of<br>&gt;ill<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; repute<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;and knocks on the door. When the madam came to answer it, she<br>&gt;saw<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;little boy and asked what he wanted.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;He said he wanted to have sex with one of the women inside,<br>&gt;had<br>&gt; &gt; the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; money<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;to buy it, and wasn't leaving until he got it. The Madam<br>&gt;figured,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;why<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;not, so she told him to come in.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Once he got in, she told him to pick any of the girls he<br>&gt;liked.<br>&gt;He<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; asked<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;her if any of the girls had any diseases, and of course the<br>&gt;madam<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;said<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;no. But he said he'd heard that all the men were talking about<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;having<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;go to the hospital and get shots after making love with Mable,<br>&gt;and<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;THAT<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;was the girl he wanted. Since the little boy was so adamant<br>&gt;and<br>&gt; &gt; had<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;money to pay for it, the madam told him to go upstairs and go<br>&gt;to<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;first room on the right.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;So he headed down the hall dragging the squashed frog behind<br>&gt;him.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;Ten<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;minutes later he came back down, still dragging the frog, paid<br>&gt;the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; madam,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;and headed out the door, at which time the madam stopped him<br>&gt;and<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;asked<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;him just why he picked the only girl she had in the place with<br>&gt;a<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; disease,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;instead of one of the others.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;He said: "Well, if you must know, tonight when I get home, my<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;parents<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; are<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;going out to a restaurant to eat, leaving me at home with a<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; baby-sitter.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;When they leave, I'm going to have sex with my baby-sitter,<br>&gt;who<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;happens<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;to be very fond of cute little boys, and then she will get the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;disease<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;that I just caught.

            <div class='col-md body'>One day God came to Adam to pass on some news. "I've got some good news and some bad news", God said. Adam looked at God and said, "Well, give me the good news first." Smiling, God explained, "I've got two new organs for you. One is called a brain. It will allow you to be very intelligent, create new things, and have intelligent conversations with Eve. The other organ I have for you is called a penis. It will allow  you to reproduce your now intelligent life form and populate this planet.  Eve will be very happy that you now have this organ to give her children."  Adam, very excited, exclaimed, "These are great gifts you have given to me. What could possibly be bad news after such great tidings?" God  looked upon Adam and said with great sorrow, "The  bad news is that when I created you, I only gave you enough blood  to operate one of these organs at a time."<br><br>------------------<br>It takes a moment to have a crush on someone,an hour to like someone,and a day to love someone,but it takes a lifetime to forget her.</div>

Men just need a place. - Billy Crystal<br><br>According to a new survey, women say they feel more comfortable undressing in front of men than they do undressing in front of other women. They say that women are too judgemental, where, of course, men are just grateful. - Jay Leno<br><br>In the last couple of weeks I have seen the ads for the Wonder Bra. Is that really a problem in this country? Men not paying enough attention to women's  breasts? - Jay Leno<br><br>We have women in the military, but they don't put us in the front lines.  They don't know if we can fight, if we can kill. I think we can.  All the general has to do is walk over to the women and say, "You see the enemy over there? They say you look fat in those uniforms." - Elayne Boosler<br><br>There's a new medical crisis. Doctors are reporting that many men are having allergic reactions to latex condoms. They say they cause severe swelling. So what's the problem? - Jay Leno<br><br>When the sun comes up, I have morals again. - Elayne Boosler<br><br>There's very little advice in men's magazines, because men don't think there's a lot they don't know. Women do. Women want to learn. Men think, "I know what I'm doing,  just show me somebody naked." - Jerry Seinfield<br><br>See, the problem is that God gives men a brain and a penis, and only enough blood to  run one at a time. - Robin Williams<br></div>
