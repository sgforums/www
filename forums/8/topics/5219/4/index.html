            <div class='col-md body'>A dying man gathered his Lawyer, Doctor and<br>Clergyman at his bed side and handed each of them<br>an envelop containing $25,000 in cash. He made<br>them each promise that after his death and during<br>his repose, they would place the three envelops in<br>his coffin. He told them that he wanted to have<br>enough money to enjoy the next life.  A week later<br>the man died. At the Wake, the Lawyer and Doctor<br>and Clergyman, each concealed an envelop in the<br>coffin and bid their old client and friend<br>farewell.  By chance, these three met several<br>months later.  Soon the Clergyman, feeling<br>guilty, blurted out a confession saying that there<br>was only $10,000 in the envelop he placed in the<br>coffin.  He felt, rather than waste all the money,<br>he would send it to a Mission in South America.<br>He asked for their forgiveness.  The Doctor, moved<br>by the gentle Clergyman's sincerity, confessed<br>that he too had kept some of the money for a<br>worthy medical charity.  The envelop, he admitted,<br>had only $8000 in it. He said, he too could not<br>bring himself to waste the money so frivolously<br>when it could be used to benefit others.  By this<br>time the Lawyer was seething with self-righteous<br>outrage.  He expressed his deep disappointment in<br>the felonious behavior of two of his oldest and<br>most trusted friends. I am the only one who kept<br>his promise to our dying friend. I want you both<br>to know that the envelop I placed in the coffin<br>contained the full amount. Indeed, my envelope<br>contained my personal check for the entire<br>$25,000.<br><br>------------------<br>It takes a moment to have a crush on someone,an hour to like someone,and a day to love someone,but it takes a lifetime to forget her.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TIPS FOR MANAGERS AND BOSSES<br><br>1.  Never give me work in the morning.  Always<br>wait until 4:00 and then bring it to me.  The<br>challenge of a deadline is refreshing.<br><br>2.  If it's really a 'rush job,' run in and<br>interrupt me every ten minutes to inquire how it's<br>going.  That helps.<br><br>3.  Always leave without telling anyone where<br>you're going.  It gives me a chance to be creative<br>when someone asks where you are.<br><br>4.  If my arms are full of papers, boxes, books,<br>or supplies, don't open the door for me.  I need<br>to learn how to function as a paraplegic and<br>opening doors is good training.<br><br>5.  If you give me more than one job to do, don't<br>tell me which is the priority.  Let me guess.<br><br>6.  Do your best to keep me late.  I like the<br>office and really have nowhere to go or anything<br>to do.<br><br>7.  If a job I do pleases you, keep it a secret.<br>Leaks like that could cost me a promotion.<br><br>8.  If you don't like my work, tell everyone.  I<br>like my name to be popular in conversation.<br><br>9.  If you have special instructions for a job,<br>don't write them down.  In fact, save them until<br>the job is almost done.<br><br>10.  Never introduce me to the people you're with.<br>When you refer to them later, my shrewd deductions<br>will identify them.<br><br>11.  Be nice to me only when the job I'm doing for<br>you could really change your life.<br><br>12.  Tell me all your little problems.  No one<br>else has any and it's nice to know someone is less<br>fortunate.<br><br>------------------<br>To luf someone is nothing, to be luf by someone is something, to be luf by the one you luf is everything.....</div>
