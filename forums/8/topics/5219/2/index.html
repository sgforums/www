            <div class='col-md body'>Software helpline excerpt ..................<br><br>I'm currently running the latest version of GirlFriend and I've been having some problems lately. I've been running the same version of DrinkingBuddies 1.0 forever as my primary application, and all the GirlFriend releases I've tried have always conflicted with it.<br><br>I hear that DrinkingBuddies won't crash if GirlFriend is run in background mode and the sound is turned off. But I'm embarrassed to say I can't find the switch to turn the sound off. I just run them separately, and it works okay. Girlfriend also seems to have a problem co-existing with my Golf program, often trying to abort Golf with some sort of timing incompatibility.<br><br>I probably should have stayed with GirlFriend 1.0, but I thought I might see better performance from GirlFriend 2.0. After months of conflicts and other problems, I consulted a friend who has had experience with GirlFriend 2.0. He said I probably didn't have enough cache to run GirlFriend 2.0, and eventually it would require a Token Ring to run properly.<br><br>He was right - as soon as I purged my cache, it uninstalled itself.<br><br>Shortly after that, I installed GirlFriend 3.0 beta. All the bugs were supposed to be gone, but the first time I used it, it gave me a virus anyway. I had to clean out my whole system and shutdown for a while.<br><br>I very cautiously upgraded to GirlFriend 4.0. This time I used a SCSI probe first and also installed a virus protection program. It worked okay for a while until I discovered that GirlFriend 1.0 was still in my system. I tried running GirlFriend 1.0 again with GirlFriend 4.0 still installed, but GirlFriend 4.0 has a feature I didn't know about that automatically senses the presence of any other version of GirlFriend and communicates with it in some way, which results in the immediate removal of both versions.<br><br>The version I have now works pretty well, but there are still some problems. Like all versions of GirlFriend, it is in some obscure language that I can't understand, much less reprogram. Frankly I think there is too much attention paid to the look and feel rather than the desired functionality. Also, to get the best connections with your hardware, you usually have to use gold-plated contacts. And I've never liked how GirlFriend was totally "object-oriented."<br><br>A year ago, a friend of mine upgraded his version of GirlFriend to GirlFriendPlus 1.0, which is a Terminate and Stay Resident version of GirlFriend. He discovered that GirlFriendPlus 1.0 expires within a year if you don't upgrade to Fiancee 1.0.<br><br>So he did, but soon after that, he had to upgrade to Wife 1.0, which he describes as a huge resource hog. It has taken up all his space, so he can't load anything else. One of the primary reasons he decided to go with Wife 1.0 was because it came bundled with FreeSexPlus.<br><br>Well, it turns out the resource allocation module of Wife 1.0 sometimes prohibits access to FreeSexPlus, particularly the new Plug-Ins he wanted to try. On top of that, Wife 1.0 must be running on a well warmed-up system before he can do anything. Although he did not ask for it, Wife 1.0 came with MotherInLaw, which has an automatic pop-up feature he can't turn off.<br><br>I told him to try installing Mistress 1.0, but he said he heard if you try to run it without first uninstalling Wife 1.0, Wife 1.0 will delete MSMoney files before doing the uninstall itself. Then Mistress 1.0 won't install anyway because of insufficient resources.<br><br>------------------<br>It takes a moment to have a crush on someone,an hour to like someone,and a day to love someone,but it takes a lifetime to forget her.</div>

"Slower than the speed limit?<br><br>No sir, I was doing the speed limit exactly...  Twenty-Two miles an hour!" the old woman says a bit proudly.

Is everyone in this car ok?  these women seem awfully shaken and they haven't muttered a single<br>peep this whole time." the officer asks.<br><br>"Oh, they'll be alright in a minute officer.

So I saw Miss Hershey standing behind the Powerhouse on the corner of Clark and Fifth Avenue, and I whipped out my Whopper and whispered, "Hey Sweetart, how'd you like to Krunch on my Big Hunk for a Million Dollar Bar?<br>Well, she immediately went down on my Tootsie Roll, and, it was like Pure Almond Joy, I couldn't help but grab her delicious Mounds 'cause it was easy to see that this little Twix had the Red Hots.  It was all I could do to hold back a Snicker and a Krackle as my Butterfinger went up her tight little Kit Kat and she started to scream "Oh Henry, Oh Henry!"<br><br>Soon she was fondling my Peter Paul and Zagnuts and I knew it wouldn't be long before I blew my Milkduds clear to Mars and gave her a taste of the old Milky Way.  She asked if I was into M&amp;M, but I said "Hey Chiclet, no kinky stuff."  Why don't you just take my Whatchamacallit and slip it up you Bit O' Honey?" (What a piece of Juicyfruit she was too.)<br><br>She screamed, "Oh, Crackerjack, you're better than the Three Musketeers!" as I rammed my Ding Dong up her Rocky Road and into her Peanut Butter Cup.  Well, I was givin' it to her Good 'n' Plenty, when all of a sudden... my Starburst.<br><br>Yeah, as luck would have it, she started to grow a bit Chunky and complained of a Wrigley in her stomach.  Sure enough, nine months later, out popped a Baby Ruth.<br><br>Joke 2:<br><br>Pierre, a brave French fighter pilot, takes his girlfriend, Marie, out for a pleasant little picnic by the River Seine. It's a beautiful day and love is in the air.<br>Marie leans over to Pierre and says: "Pierre, kiss me!"<br><br>Our hero grabs a bottle of Merlot and splashes it on Marie's lips.<br><br>"What are you doing, Pierre?", says the startled Marie.<br><br>"I am Pierre the fighter pilot!  When I have red meat, I like to have red wine!"<br><br>She smiles and they start kissing.  When things began to heat up a little, Marie says, "Pierre, kiss me lower."<br><br>Our hero tears her blouse open, grabs a bottle of Chardonnay and starts pouring it all over her chest.<br><br>Pierre! What are you doing?, asks the bewildered Marie. "I am Pierre the fighter pilot!  When I have white meat, I like to have white wine!"<br><br>They resume their passionate interlude and things really steam up.<br><br>Marie leans close to his ear and whispers, "Pierre, kiss me lower!"<br><br>Our hero rips off her underwear, grabs a bottle of Cognac and pours it in her lap. He strikes a match and lights the Cognac on fire.<br><br>Marie shrieks and dives into the river.  Standing waist deep, Marie throws her arms upwards and screams furiously, "PIERRE, WHAT IN THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING?"<br><br>Our hero stands up, defiantly, and says, "I am Pierre the fighter pilot!  When I go down, I go down in flames!"<br><br>Joke 3:<br><br>One night, Superman was feeling very horny.  He flies into the bat cave and asks Batman,  "Hey Batman, How about you and me going to a bar and picking up some chicks tonight?"<br>Batman replies, "Not tonight Superman, I have to clean the bat mobile tonight."  Superman tells Batman to forget the bat mobile but Batman insists that he cannot fight crime in a dirty car.  Superman flies away.<br><br>Superman files into the ocean and asks Aquaman, "Hey Aquaman, How about you and me going to a bar and picking up some chicks tonight?"<br><br>Aquaman replies, "Not tonight Superman, I have to feed the dolphins."  Superman pleads with Aquaman to feed the dolphins later but Aquaman insists that he cannot fight crimes without his dolphins.  Superman, who by now is extremely horny, flips Aquaman the finger and flies away.<br><br>As Superman is flying over the city, he sees an open window and through the window he sees Wonder Woman, naked, spread eagle on her bed. Superman says to himself - YES!  Flies through the window, takes off his clothes and hops on top of her and does it 40 times (you know him, speed of light!).  He gets up, puts on his clothes, lets out a sigh and flies away.<br><br>Wonder Woman sits up on the bed a little and says, "What was that?"  The Invisible Man answers, "I don't know but my asshole sure hurts!"<br><br>Joke 4:<br><br>A man was visiting his wife in hospital where she has been in a coma for several years.  On this visit he decided to rub her left breast instead of just talking to her.  On doing this she let out a sigh.  The man ran out and told the doctor who said that was a good sign and suggested he should try rubbing her right breast to see if there is any reaction.  The husband went in and rubbed her right breast.  This produced another moan from his wife.  He rushed out and told the doctor.  The doctor said this was amazing and a real breakthrough.  The doctor then suggested the man should go in and try oral sex, saying he would wait outside as it is a personal act, but this might be just the thing to get her out of the comma.  The man goes in, then came out about five minutes later, white as a sheet.  He told the doctor his wife is dead.  The doctor asked what happen to which the man replied, "She choked."<br><br>Joke 5:<br><br>A small white guy went into an elevator, when he got in he noticed a huge black gy standing next to him.  The big black guy looked down upon the small white guy and said, "7 foot tall, 350 pounds, 20 inch dick, 3 pound left ball, 3 pound right ball, Turner Brown."   The small guy fainted!!  The huge black dude picked up the little white guy and brought him to, slapping his face and shaking him.  He asked the small white guy, "What's wrong?"  Our petite friend said, "Excuse me, but what did you say?"  The black giant looked down and repeated, "7 foot tall, 350 pounds, 20 inch dick, 3 pound left ball, 3 pound right ball, my name is Turner Brown"  The white guy sighed, "Oh, thank God!  I thought you said 'Turn around!!'"<br><br>Joke 5:<br><br>An old lady is rocking away the last of her days on her front porch, reflecting on her long life, when -- all of a sudden -- a fairy godmother appears in front of her and informs her that she will be granted three wishes.<br>"Well, now," says the old lady, "I guess I would like to be really rich."<br><br>*** POOF *** Her rocking chair turns to solid gold.<br><br>"And, gee, I guess I wouldn't mind being a young, beautiful princess."<br><br>*** POOF *** She turns into a beautiful young woman.<br><br>"Your third wish?" asked the fairy godmother. Just then the old woman's cat wanders across the porch in front of them.<br><br>"Ooh -- can you change him into a handsome prince?" she asks.<br><br>*** POOF *** There before her stands a young man more handsome than anyone could possibly imagine.<br><br>She stares at him, smitten. With a smile that makes her knees weak, he saunters across the porch and whispers in her ear:<br><br>"Bet you're sorry you had me neutered."<br><br>Joke 6:<br><br>A man was walking along the street when he saw a ladder going into the clouds. As any of us would do, he climbed the ladder. He reached a cloud, upon which was sat a rather plump and very ugly woman. "Screw me or climb the ladder to success" she said.<br>No contest, thought the man, so he climbed the ladder to the next cloud. On this cloud was a slightly thinner woman, slightly easier on the eye. "Screw me hard me or climb the ladder to success" she said. "Well", thought the man, "might as well carry on.<br><br>On the next cloud was an even more attractive lady who, this time, was actually quite desirable. "Screw me now or climb the ladder to success" she said. As he turned her down and went on up the ladder, the man thought to himself that this was getting better the further he went.<br><br>On the next cloud was an absolute beauty. Slim, attractive, the lot. "Love me hard and long or climb the ladder to success" she flirted.<br><br>Unable to imagine what could be waiting, and being a gambling man, he decided to climb again.<br><br>When he reached the next cloud, there was a 400 pound ugly man, arm pit hair showing, flies buzzing around his head.<br><br>"Who are you?" the man asked.<br><br>"Hello" said the ugly fat man said, "my name's Cess!"<br></div>

She spent a weekend with the Marines.<br><br>*Please excuse Jason for being absent yesterday.<br>She was in bed with gramps.<br><br>*Gloria was absent yesterday as she was having a<br>gangover.<br><br>*Please excuse brenda, she has been sick and under<br>the doctor.<br><br>*Maryann was absent December 11-16, because she<br>had a fever, sore throat, headache, and upset<br>stomach. Her sister was also sick, fever and sore<br>throat, her brother had a low grade fever and<br>ached all over. I wasn't the best, either, sore<br>throat and fever. There must be something going<br>around, her father even got hot last night.<br><br>------------------<br>It takes a moment to have a crush on someone,an hour to like someone,and a day to love someone,but it takes a lifetime to forget her.</div>
