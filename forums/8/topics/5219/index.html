Maybe you'll luck out and catch yourself a big one!"<br>Determined, the blonde turned and headed for the swamps, set on catching herself an alligator.<br>Later in the day, the shopkeeper is driving home, when he spots the young woman standing waist deep in the water, shotgun in hand. Just then, he sees a huge 9 foot alligator swimming quickly toward her.<br>She takes aim, kills the creature and with a great deal of effort hauls it on to the swamp bank.

The conversation was<br>slow going so I thought we should go off somewhere more<br>intimate so we could talk more privately. So we went to<br>this restaurant and he is still acting a bit funny and I am<br>trying to cheer him up and I start to wonder if it is me or<br>something else. I ask him and he says no. But you know<br>I am not really sure.<br><br>Anyway, in the cab back to his house, I say that I love him<br>and he just puts his arm around me.

            <div class='col-md body'>What does the first letter of ur name means???<br>a<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You are not particularly romantic, but you are<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; interested in action. You<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; mean business. With you, what you see is what<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; you<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; get. You have no<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; patience<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; for flirting and can't be bothered with someone<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; who is trying to be coy,<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; cute, demure, and subtly enticing.  You are an<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; front person. When it comes<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; to sex, it's action that counts, not obscure<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; hints. Your mate's physical<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; attractiveness is important to you. You find the<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; chase and challenge of<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; the<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; "hunt" invigorating. You are passionate and<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; sexual, as well as being much<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; more adventurous than you appear; however, you<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; do<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; not go around<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; advertising<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; these qualities. Your physical needs are your<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; primary concern.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; b<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You give off vibes of lazy sensuality. You enjoy<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; being romanced, wined and<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; dined. You are very happy to receive gifts as an<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; expression of the<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; affection of your lover. You want to be pampered<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; and know how to pamper<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; your<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; mate. You are private in your expression of<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; endearments, and particular<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; when<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; it comes to lovemaking. You will hold off until<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; everything meets with your<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; approval. You can control your appetite and<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; abstain from sex if need be.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; You<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; require new sensations and experiences. You are<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; willing to experiment.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; c<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You are a very social individual, and it is<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; important to you to have<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; a relationship. You require closeness and<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; togetherness. You must be able<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; to<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; talk to your sex partner-before,during, and<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; after.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; You want the object of<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; your affection to be socially acceptable and<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; good-looking.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You see your lover as a friend and companion.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; You<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; are very sexual<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; and sensual, needing someone to appreciate and<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; almost worship you.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; When this cannot be achieved, you have the<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; ability<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; to go for long periods<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; without sexual activity. You are an expert at<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; controlling your desires and<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; doing without.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; d<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; Once you get it into your head that you want<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; someone, you move full steam<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; ahead in yoursuit. You do not give up your quest<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; easily. You are nurturing<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; and caring. If someone has a problem, this turns<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; you on. You are highly<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; sexual, passionate, loyal, and intense in your<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; involvements, sometimes<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; possessive and jealous. Sex to you is a leasure<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; to<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; be enjoyed. You are<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; stimulated by the eccentric and unusual, having<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; a<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; free and open attitude.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; e<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; Your greatest need is to talk. If your date is<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; not<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; a good listener, you<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; have<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; trouble relating. A person must be<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; intellectually<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; stimulating or you are<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; not<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; interested sexually. You need a friend for a<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; lover<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; and a companion for a<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; bedmate. You hate disharmony and disruption, but<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; you do enjoy a good<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; argument once in a while-it seems to stir things<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; up. You<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; flirt a lot, for the challenge is more important<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; than the sexual act for<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; you. But once you give your heart away, you are<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; uncompromisingly loyal.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; When<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; you don't have a good lover to fall asleep with,<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; you will<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; fall asleep with a good book. (Sometimes, in<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; fact,<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; you prefer a good<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; book.)<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; f<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You are idealistic and romantic, putting your<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; lover on a pedestal.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You look for the very best mate you can find.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; You<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; are a flirt, yet<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; once committed, you are very loyal. You are<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; sensuous, sexual, and<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; privately passionate. Publicly, you can be<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; showy,<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; extravagant, and<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; gallant. You are a born romantic. Dramatic love<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; scenes are a favorite<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; fantasy past time. You can be a very generous<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; lover.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; g<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You are fastidious, seeking perfection within<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; yourself and your lover. You<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; respond to a lover who is your intellectual<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; equal<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; or superior, and one who<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; can enhance your status. You are sensuous and<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; know<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; how to reach the peak<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; of<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; erotic stimulation, because you work at it<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; eticulously. You can be<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; extremely<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; active sexually-that is, when you find the time.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; Your duties and<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; responsibilities take precedence over everything<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; else. You may have<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; difficulty getting emotionally close to a lover,<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; but no trouble getting<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; close sexually.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; h<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You seek a mate who can enhance your reputation<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; and your earning ability.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You will be very generous to your lover once you<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; have attained a<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; commitment.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; Your gifts are actually an investment in your<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; partner. Before the<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; commitment, though, you tend to be frugal in<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; your<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; spending and dating<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; habits, and equally cautious in your sexual<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; involvements. You are a<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; sensual<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; and patient lover.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; i<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You have a great need to be loved,<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; appreciated...<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; even worshipped.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You enjoy luxury, sensuality, and pleasures of<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; the<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; flesh. You look for<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; lovers who know what they are doing. You are not<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; interested in an amateur,<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; unless that amateur wants a tutor. You are fussy<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; and exacting about having<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; your desires satisfied. You are willing to<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; experiment and try new modes of<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; sexual expression. You bore easily and thus<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; require sexual adventure and<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; change. You are more sensual than sexual, but<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; you<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; are sometimes downright.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; j<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You are blessed with a great deal of physical<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; energy. When used for<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; love-making, there is nothing to stop you,<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; except<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; maybe the stamina of<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; your<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; partner (you could have danced all night.) You<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; respond to the thrill of<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; the<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; chase and the challenge of the mating game. You<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; can carry on great<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; romances<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; in your head. At heart you are a roamer and need<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; to set out on your own<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; every so often. You will carry on long-distance<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; relationships with ease.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; You<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; are idealistic and need to believe in love. The<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; sex act seems to satisfy a<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; need to be nurtured deep within.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; k<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You are secretive, self-contained, and shy. You<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; are very sexy, sensual,<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; and<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; passionate, but you do not let on to this. Only<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; in<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; intimate privacy will<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; this part of your nature reveal itself. When it<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; gets down to the<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; nitty-gritty, you are an expert. You know all<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; the<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; little tricks of the<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; trade, can play any role or any game, and take<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; your love life very<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; seriously. You don't fool around. You have the<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; patience to wait for the<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; right person to<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; come along<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; .<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; l<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You can be very romantic, attached to the<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; glamour<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; of love. Having a<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; partner<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; is of paramount importance to you. You are free<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; in<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; your expression of love<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; and are willing to take chances, try new sexual<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; experiences and partners,<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; provided it's all in good taste. Brains turn you<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; on. You must feel that<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; your<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; partner is intellectually stimulating, otherwise<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; you will find it<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; difficult<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; to sustain the relationship. You require loving,<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; cuddling,wining, and<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; dining<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; to know that you're being appreciated.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; m<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You are emotional and intense. When involved in<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; a<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; relationship, you throw<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; your entire being into it. Nothing stops you;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; there are no holds barred.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; You<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; are all-consuming and crave someone who is<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; equally<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; passionate and intense.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You believe in total sexual freedom.  You are<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; willing to try anything and<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; everything. Your supply of sexual energy is<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; inexhaustible. You also enjoy<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; mothering your mate.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; n<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You may appear innocent, unassuming, and shy;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; but<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; we know that appearances<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; can lie. When it comes to sex, you are no novice<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; but<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; something of a skilled technician. You can<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; easily<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; go to extremes, though,<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; running the gamut from insatiability to boredom<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; with the whole idea of<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; sex.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You can be highly critical of you mate, seeking<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; perfection in both of you.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; It is not easy to find someone who can meet your<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; standards. You have<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; difficulty expressing emotions and drawing close<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; to lovers.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; o<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You are very interested in sexual activities yet<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; secretive and shy<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; about your desires. You can re-channel much of<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; your sexual energy into<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; making money and/or seeking power. You can<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; easily<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; have extended periods of<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; celibacy. You are a passionate, ompassionate,<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; sexual lover,<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; requiring the same qualities from your mate. Sex<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; is serious business; thus<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; you demand intensity, diversity, and are willing<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; to try anything or<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; anyone.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; Sometimes your passions turn to possessiveness,<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; which must be kept in<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; check.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; p<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You are very conscious of social proprieties.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; You<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; wouldn't think of doing<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; anything that might harm your image or<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; reputation.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; Appearances count.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; Therefore, you require a good-looking partner.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; You<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; also require an<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; intelligent partner. Oddly enough, you may view<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; your partner as your<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; enemy...a good fight stimulates those sex vibes.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; You are relatively<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; free of sexual hang-ups. You are willing to<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; experiment and try new<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; ways of doingthings. You are very social and<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; sensual; you enjoy<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; flirting and need a good deal of physical<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; gratification.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; q<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You require constant activity and stimulation.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; for<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; a partner to keep up<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; with<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; you, sexually or otherwise. You are an<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; enthusiastic lover and tend to be<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; attracted to people because of ethnic groups.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; You<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; need romance, hearts and<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; flowers, and lots of conversation to turn you on<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; and keep you going.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; r<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You are a no-nonsense, action-oriented<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; individual.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; You need someone who<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; can<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; keep pace with you and who is your intellectual<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; equal-the smarter the<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; better. You are turned on more quickly by a<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; great<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; mind than by a<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; greatbody.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; However, physical attractiveness is very<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; important<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; to you. You have to be<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; proud of your partner. You are privately very<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; sexy, but you do not show<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; this<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; outwardly. If your new lover is not all that<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; great<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; in bed, you are willing<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; to serve as a teacher. Sex is important; you can<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; be a very demanding<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; playmate.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; s<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; For you, it is businessbefore pleasure. If you<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; are<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; in any way bothered by<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; career,business, or money concerns, you find it<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; very hard to relax and<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; get into the mood. You can be romantically<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; idealistic to a fault and are<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; capable of much sensuality. But you never lose<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; control of your emotions.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You are very careful and cautious before you<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; give<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; your heart away-and<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; your body, for that matter. Once you make the<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; commitment, though, you<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; stick<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; like glue.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; t<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You are very sensitive, private, and sexually<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; passive; you like a partner<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; who takes the lead. You get turned on by music,<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; soft lights, and romantic<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; thoughts. You fantasize and tend to fall in and<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; out of love. When in love,<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; you are romantic, idealistic, mushy, and<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; extremely<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; changeable. You enjoy<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; having your senses and your feelings stimulated,<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; titillated and teased.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; You<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; are a great flirt. You can make your<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; relationships<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; fit your dreams, all in<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; your own head.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; u<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You are enthusiastic and idealistic when in<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; love.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; When not in love,you are<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; in love with love, always looking for someone to<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; adore. You see romance as<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; achallenge. You are a roamer and need adventure,<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; excitement, and freedom. You deal in potential<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; relationships. You<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; enjoy giving gifts and enjoy seeing your mate<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; look<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; good. Your sex drive<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; is strong and you desire instant gratification.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; You are willing to put<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; your<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; partner's pleasures above your own.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; v<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You are individualistic,and you need freedom,<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; space, and  excitement.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You wait until you know someone well before<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; committing yourself.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; Knowing someone means psyching him out. You feel<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; a<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; need to get into<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; his head to see what makes him tick. You are<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; attracted to eccentric types.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; Often there is an age  difference between you<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; and<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; your lover. You respond<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; to<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; danger, thrills, and suspense. The gay scene<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; turns<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; you on, even though you<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; yourself may not be a participant.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; w<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You are very proud, determined, and you refuse<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; to<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; take no for an<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; answer when pursuing love. Your ego is at stake.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; You are romantic,<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; idealistic, and often in love with love itself,<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; not seeing your partner<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; as he or she really is. You feel deeply and<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; throw<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; all of yourself into<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; your relationships. Nothing is too good for your<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; lover. You enjoy playing<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; love games.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; x<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You need constant stimulation because you get<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; bored quickly. You can<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; handle<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; more than one relationship at a time with ease.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; You can't shut off your<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; mind. You talk while you make love. You can have<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; the greatest love<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; affairs,<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; all by yourself, in your own head.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; y<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You are sexual, sensual, and very independent.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; If<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; you can't have it your<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; way, you will forgot the whole thing. You want<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; to<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; control your<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; relationships, which doesn't always work out too<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; well. You respond to<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; physical stimulation, enjoy necking and spending<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; hours just touching,<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; feeling, and exploring. However, if you can<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; spend<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; your time making money,<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; you will give up the pleasures of the flesh for<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; the moment.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You need to prove to yourself and your partner<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; what a great lover<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; you are. You want feedback on your performance.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; You are an open,<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; stimulating, romantic bedmate.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; z<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You are very romantic, idealistic, and somehow<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; you<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; believe that to love<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; means to suffer. You wind up serving your mate<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; or<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; attracting people who<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; have unusual troubles. You see yourself as your<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; lover's  savior.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; You are sincere, passionate, lustful, and<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; dreamy.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; You can't help falling<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; in<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; love. You fantasize and get turned on by movies<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; and magazines. You do not<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; tell others of this secret life, nor of your<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; sexual fantasies. You are<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; easily aroused sexually.<br>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 12-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Three  turtles, Joe, Steve, and Poncho, decide to<br>go on a picnic. So, Joe packs the picnic basket<br>with cookies, bottled sodas, and sandwiches. The trouble is, the picnic site is, 10 miles away, so the turtles take 10 whole days to get there.  By the time they do arrive, everyone's whipped.Joe takes the stuff out of the basket, one by one. He takes out the sodas and says, 'Alright, Steve, gimme the bottle opener.''I didn't bring the bottle opener,' Steve says.  'I thought you packed it.'Joe gets worried.  He turns to Poncho.  'Poncho, do you have the bottle opener?'<br>Naturally, Poncho doesn't have it, so the turtles<br>are stuck ten miles away from home without soda.<br>Joe &amp; Steve beg Poncho to turn back home<br>and retrieve it, but Poncho flatly refuses,<br>knowing that they'll eat everything by the time he<br>gets back.  Somehow, after about two hours, the<br>turtles manage to convince Poncho to go, swearing<br>on their great-grand turtles' graves that they<br>won't touch the food.<br>So, Poncho sets off down the road, slow and<br>steadily.  Twenty days pass, but no Poncho.  Joe<br>and Steve are hungry and puzzled, but a promise is<br>a promise.  Another day passes, and still no<br>Poncho, but a promise is a promise.  After three<br>more days pass without Poncho in sight, Steve<br>starts getting restless.  'I NEED FOOD!' he says<br>with a hint of dementia in his voice.<br>'NO!' Joe retorts.  'We promised.'<br>Five more days pass.  Joe realizes that Poncho<br>probably skipped out to the Burger King down the<br>road, so the two turtles weakly lift the lid, get<br>a sandwich, and open their mouths to eat.  But<br>then, right at that instant, Poncho pops out<br>behind a rock, and says, 'Just for that, I'm not<br>going.'<br><br>------------------<br>It takes a moment to have a crush on someone,an hour to like someone,and a day to love someone,but it takes a lifetime to forget her.</div>

He took a deep breath and said," It smells like shit."<br><br>The last guy also went forward. This time he poked his finger into the thing and tasted it.

            <div class='col-md body'>This my favourite joke, no punchline though.<br>Ko-Kidd, please skip this...<br><br>There was a female researcher trying to make a documentary on Red Indians. After living amongst them for sometime, she never understood the significance of the number of feathers on the headband. The next day, she went to ask one indian with only a feather on his headband.<br><br>"Excuse me, why do you have onbly one feather?"<br><br>"Me, one wife. One feather."<br><br>She didn't believe what he said and went to ask a guy with four feathers.<br><br>"Me four feathers, me four wives."<br><br>Although she still didn't believe him, she was quite amused by it. To amuse herself further, she decided to ask the Chief who has a headband full of feathers.<br><br>"Me Chief! Me Fuck 'em all! Tall, short, fat, thin, me fuck 'em all!"<br><br>"Argh! You don't have to bee so hostile."<br><br>"Horse style! Bear Style! Wolf Style! Me Fuck 'em all!"<br><br>The researcher got really disgusted and screamed," You ought to be hunged!"<br><br>"You damn right! Me Hunk! Big as buffalo, Long as snake!

While Johnny waited in the outer office, the teacher explained to the principal what the situation was... The principal  told the teacher he would give the boy a test and if he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the first grade and behave.  The teacher agreed. Johnny was brought in and the conditions are explained to him and he agrees to take the test.<br><br>Principal: " What is 3x3? "<br>Johnny: "9"<br>Principal: "What is 6 x 6 ?"<br>Johnny: "36"<br><br>And so it went with every question the principal thought a third grader should know.
