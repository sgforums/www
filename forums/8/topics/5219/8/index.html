            <div class='col-md body'>Bill Gates died in a car accident. He found himself standing in front of God ..<br>"Well Bill," said God, "I'm really confused on this call. I'm not sure whether to send you to Heaven or Hell. After all, you enormously helped society by putting a computer in almost every home and yet you created that ghastly Windows 95. I'm going to do something I've never done before.I'm going to let you decide where you want to go!"<br>Bill replied, "Wow, thanks, God. What's the difference between the two?"<br>God said, "I'm willing to let you visit both places briefly if it will help you make a decision."<br>Bill said, "OK, then, let's try Hell first."<br>So Bill went to Hell. There was a beautiful, clean, sandy beach with clear waters. There were thousands of beautiful women running around, playing in the water, laughing and frolicking about. The sun was shining, the temperature was perfect. Bill was very pleased.<br>"This is great!" he told God. "If this is Hell. I really want to see Heaven!<br>"Fine," said God and off they went. Heaven was a high place in the clouds, with angels drifting about playing harps and singing. It was nice, but not as enticing as Hell.<br>Bill thought for a quick minute before making his decision. "I think I prefer Hell."<br>"Fine," said God, "as you desire." So Bill Gates went to Hell.<br>Two weeks later, God decided to check up on the late billionaire to see how he was doing in Hell. when God arrived in Hell, he found Bill in a dark cave shackled to a wall, being burned and brutalized by demons.<br>"How's everything going, Bill?" God asked.<br>"This is awful" cried Bill. "This is not at all what I expected. What happened to that other place with the beaches and the beautiful women playing in the water?"<br>"Oh," God said: "...that was the screen saver!!!"<br>he he he <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>George Bush has a heart attack and dies. He goes to hell where the devil is waiting for him. I don't know what to do here, " says the devil. You are on my list but I have no room for you." You definitely have to stay here, so I'll tell you what I'm going to do." I've got three folks here who weren't quite as bad as you. I'll let one of them go, but you have to take their place. I'll even let YOU decide who leaves." George thought that sounded pretty good, so he agreed.<br>The devil opened the first room: in it was Richard Nixon and a large pool of water. He kept diving in and surfacing empty-handed over and over and over. Such was his fate in hell.<br>No!" George said. "I don't think so. I'm not a good swimmer and don't think I could do that all day long."<br>The devil led him to the next room: in it was Tony Blair with a sledgehammer and a room full of rocks. All he did was swing that hammer, time after time after time.<br>No, I've got this problem with my shoulder. I would be in constant agony if all I could do was break rocks all day!" commented George.<br>The devil opened a third door. In it, George saw Bill Clinton, lying on the floor with his arms staked over his head, and his legs staked in spread eagle pose. Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky, doing what she does best.<br>George Bush looked at this in disbelief for a while and finally said, "Yeah, I can handle this."<br>The devil smiled and said...................................................<br>......................................<br>.............................................<br>...........................................................................................................................................<br>...........................................................................................................................................<br>...........................................................................................................................................<br>...........................................................................................................................................<br>...........................................................................................................................................<br>.........................................................................................................................<br>...................
