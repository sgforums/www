The aforementioned removal transaction shall include, but not be limited to, the following steps:<br><br>1. The party of the first part (lawyer) shall, with or without elevation at his option, by means of a chair, step stool, ladder or any other means of elevation, grasp the party of the second part (light bulb) and rotate the party of the second part (light bulb) in a counter clockwise direction, said direction being non-negotiable. Said grasping and rotation of the party of the second part (light bulb) shall be undertaken by the party of the first part (lawyer) to maintain the structural integrity of the party of the second part (light bulb), notwithstanding the aformentioned failure of the party of the second part (light bulb) to perform the customary and agreed upon duties. The foregoing notwithstanding, however, both parties stipulate that structural failure of the party of the second part (light bulb) may be incidental to the aforementioned failure to perform and in such case the party of the first part (lawyer) shall be held blameless for such structural failure insofar as the non-negotiable directional codicil (counter-clockwise) is observed by the party of the first part (lawyer) throughout.<br><br>2. Upon reaching a point where the party of the second part (light bulb) becomes seperated from the party of the third part ('receptacle'), the party of the first part shall have the option of disposing of the party of the second part (light bulb) in a manner consistent with all applicable state, local, and federal statutes.<br><br>3. Once seperation and disposal have been achieved, the party of the first part (lawyer) shall have the option of beginning the installation of the party of the fourth part ('new light bulb'). This installation shall occur in a manner consistent with the reverse procedures described in step one of this self same document, being careful to note that the rotation should occur in a clockwise direction, said direction also being non-negotiable and only until the party of the fourth part (new light bulb) becomes snug in the party of the third part (receptacle) and in fact becomes the party of the second part (light bulb).<br><br>Note: The above described steps may be performed, at the option of the party of the first part (lawyer), by said party of the first part (lawyer), or by his or her heirs and assigns, or by any and all persons authorized by him or her to do som the objective being to produce a level of illumination in the immediate vicinity of the aforementioned front (North) door consistent with maximisation of ingress and revenue for the party of the fifth part, also known as 'The Firm'.<br><br>------------------<br>To luf someone is nothing, to be luf by someone is something, to be luf by the one you luf is everything.....</div>

So slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver she reached behind her and unzipped her skirt a little thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg.  Again she tried to make the step onto the bus to discover she still could not make the step. So, a little more embarrassed she once again reached behind her and unzipped her skirt a little more. And for a second time she attempted the step and once again, much to her chagrin she could not raise her leg because of the tight skirt.  So with a coy little smile to the driver she again unzipped the offending skirt to give a little more slack and again was unable to make the step.<br><br>About this time the big Texan that was behind her in the line picked her up easily from the waist and placed her lightly on the step of the bus.  Well, she went ballistic and turned on the would-be hero, screeching at him "How dare you touch my body!! I don't even know who you are!! " At this the Texan drawled " Well ma'am, normally I would agree with you but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured that we was friends."<br><br>------------------<br>To luf someone is nothing, to be luf by someone is something, to be luf by the one you luf is everything.....</div>

She heard the train<br>stop and her son said 'all you sons of bitches who<br>are getting off-get the hell off now, and all of<br>you sons of bitches who are getting on-get your<br>asses on the train cause we're leaving right now.'<br>The mother went into the living room and told her<br>son, 'we don't use that kind of language in this<br>house.

When you come out, you may play with your<br>train but you must use nicer language.'<br><br>Two hours later, Her son came out of his room and<br>resumed playing with his train.  Soon the train<br>stopped and the mother heard her son say, 'All<br>passengers who are disembarking the train, please<br>remember to take all of your belongings with you.<br>We thank you for riding with us today and hope<br>that you will ride with us again.  For those of<br>you just boarding, we ask that you stow all hand<br>luggage under your seat.  Remember that there is<br>no smoking except in the club car.

            <div class='col-md body'>A butcher in his shop, and he's real busy, and<br>he notices a dog in the shop.  He shoos him away.<br>But later, he notices the dog is back again.  So<br>he goes over to the dog, and notices he has a note<br>in his mouth.  He takes the note, and it reads<br>'Can I have 12 sausages and a leg of lamb, please.<br>The dog has money in his mouth, as well.'  The<br>butcher looks inside and, lo and behold, there is<br>a ten pound note there.  So he takes the money,<br>and puts the sausages and lamb in a bag, placing<br>it in the dog's mouth.  The butcher is well<br>impressed, and since it's close to closing time,<br>he decides to shut up shop and follow the dog.  So<br>off he goes.  The dog is walking down the street,<br>when he comes to a level crossing.  The dog puts<br>down the bag, jumps up and presses the button.<br>Then he waits patiently, bag in mouth, for the<br>lights to turn.  They do, and he walks across the<br>road, with the butcher following him all the way.<br>The dog then comes to a bus stop, and starts<br>looking at the timetable.  The butcher is in awe<br>at this stage.  The dog checks out the times, and<br>then sits on one of the seats provided.  Along<br>comes a bus.  The dog walks around to the front,<br>looks at the number, and goes back to his seat.<br>Another bus comes.  Again the dog goes and looks<br>at the number, notices it's the right bus, and<br>climbs on.  The butcher, by now open-mouthed,<br>follows him onto the bus. The bus travels through<br>the town and out into the suburbs, the dog looking<br>at the scenery.  Eventually he gets up, and moves<br>to the front of the bus.  He stands on 2 back paws<br>and pushes the button to stop the bus.  Then he<br>gets off, his groceries still in his mouth.<br><br>Well, dog and butcher are walking along the<br>road, and then the dog turns into a house.  He<br>walks up the path, and drops the groceries on the<br>step.  Then he walks back down the path, takes a<br>big run, and throws himself -Whap!- against the<br>door.  He goes back down the path, runs up to the<br>door and -Whap!- throws himself against it again.<br>There's no answer at the house, so the dog goes<br>back down the path, jumps up on a narrow wall, and<br>walks along the perimeter of the garden.  He gets<br>to the window, and beats his head against it<br>several times, walks back, jumps off, and waits at<br>the door.<br><br>The butcher watches as a big guy opens the door,<br>and starts laying into the dog.  Kicking him and<br>punching him, and swearing at him.  The butcher<br>runs up, and stops the guy. 'What the hell are you<br>doing ?  The dog is a genius.  He could be on TV,<br>for God's sake !', to which the guy responds<br><br>'Clever, me arse.  This is the second time this<br>week that he's forgotten his key.'<br><br>------------------<br>To luf someone is nothing, to be luf by someone is something, to be luf by the one you luf is everything.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Last summer, the circus came to town.  And with it, they had a clown. He had a very interesting act....as he also played the harp.<br><br>That evening, the ringmaster wanted the clown to play the harp on the high-wire as it had never been done before.  The clown practised all day and when 8pm came, he was ready.  He slung his portable harp over his shoulder and climbed the tower to the high-wire.  There he grabbed the pole and proceeded to walk the wire.  Once he was halfway out, he was going to sit down  and play his harp to the crowd below.  When he got about 5 feet from the middle, a string on his harp broke and one of the ends dug into his back causing him some agonizing pain. He reached back with his right hand to move the string and tumbled to his death.<br><br>You know, it's sad when a clown dies from a broken harp.<br><br>------------------<br>To luf someone is nothing, to be luf by someone is something, to be luf by the one you luf is everything.....</div>
