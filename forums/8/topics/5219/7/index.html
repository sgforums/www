            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Computer Gender</strong><br><br>An English teacher was explaining to his students the concept of gender association in the English language. He stated how hurricanes at one time were given feminine names and how ships and planes were usually referred to as "she."<br><br>One of the students raised their hand and asked "What gender is a computer?"<br><br>The teacher wasn't certain which it was, so he divided the class into two groups, males in one, females in the other, and asked them to decide if a computer should be masculine or feminine. Both groups were asked to give four reasons for their recommendation.<br><br>The group of women concluded that computers should be referred to in the masculine gender because:<br><br>*    In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on.<br><br>*    They have a lot of data but are still clueless.<br><br>*    They are supposed to help you solve your problems, but half the time they ARE the problem.<br><br>*    As soon as you commit to one, you realize that, if you had waited a little longer, you could have had a better model.<br><br>The men, on the other hand, decided that computers should definitely be referred to in the feminine gender because:<br><br>*    No one but their creator understands their internal logic.<br><br>*    The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else.<br><br>*    Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for later retrieval.<br><br>*    As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half your paycheck on accessories.</div>

The wife did not<br>&gt; &gt;want to<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get pregnant and requested the husband to buy condom<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from the shop nearby. When the husband went out, the wife waited<br>&gt; &gt;anxiously<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the room with all<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the lights switched off...<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While the husband was out, an Indian thief came into the room. The<br>&gt; &gt;wife<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; did not notice and thought that it was her husband. She grabbed the<br>&gt; &gt;Indian<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and happily screwed away. The wife was so exhausted<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that she fell asleep immediately. In the mean time, the husband had<br>&gt; &gt;a hard<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time looking for a shop<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that sold condoms and when he finally found one, he realised that<br>he<br>&gt; &gt;had<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only one 20-sen coin.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He asked the shop owner to sell him one piece of condom and the<br>shop<br>&gt; &gt;owner<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asked him which quality that he wanted. "The white condom, lowest<br>&gt; &gt;quality,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is 15 sen each. The black condom, average quality,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is 20 sen each. And purple condom, the higest quality, is 25 sen<br>&gt; &gt;each".<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, the husband chose the black condom as he had only 20 sen with<br>&gt; &gt;him.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When he reached the hotel, he found his wife sleeping. Without a<br>&gt; &gt;warning,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he jumped onto his wife and<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; started making love. The wife was surprised that the husband was so<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; energetic after the "first"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; session. A year later, the wife gave birth to a "black" baby boy.<br>&gt; &gt;When the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; baby grows up,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he asks the father, "Pa, why am I black and you are white?" The<br>&gt; &gt;father<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; replied, "You are damn lucky  already, 5 sens more and you are<br>&gt; &gt;PURPLE<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; COLOUR now!!!!!!<br><br>------------------<br>To luf someone is nothing, to be luf by someone is something, to be luf by the one you luf is everything.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A thermodynamics professor wrote a take home exam for his graduate<br>students. It had one question: "Is hell exothermic or endothermic?<br>Support your answer with proof."<br><br>Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law or<br>some variant. One student, however, wrote the following:<br><br>"First, we postulate that if souls exist, then they must have some<br>mass. If they do, then a mole of souls can also have a mass. So, at<br>what rate are souls moving into hell and at what rate are souls<br>leaving? I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to<br>hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for souls<br>entering hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the<br>world today. Some of these religions state that if you are not a member<br>of their religion, you will go to hell. Since there are more than one<br>of these religions and people do not belong to more than one religion,<br>we can project that all people and all souls go to hell. With birth and<br>death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in hell to<br>increase exponentially.<br><br>Now, we look at the rate of change in volume in hell. Boyle's Law<br>states that in order for the temperature and pressure in hell to stay<br>the same, the ratio of the mass of souls and volume needs to stay<br>constant.<br><br>1. So, if hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which<br>souls enter hell, then the temperature and pressure in hell will<br>increase until all hell breaks loose.<br><br>2. Of course, if hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase<br>of souls in hell, than the temperature and pressure will drop until<br>hell freezes over.<br><br>So which is it? If we accept the postulate given me by Therese Banyan<br>during our freshman year, and take into account the fact that I still<br>have not succeeded in having sexual relations with her, then # 2 cannot<br>be true, and hell is exothermic."<br><br>------------------<br>It takes a moment to have a crush on someone, a hour to like someone, a day to love someone.....but it takes a lifetime to forget her.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At the station, three New Zealanders each buy a ticket and watch as three Aussies buy just one ticket between them.<br>"How are the three of you going to travel on only one ticket?" asks one of the New Zealanders.<br>"Watch and learn," answers one of the Aussies.<br>They all board the train. The New Zealanders take their respective seats but all three Aussies cram into a toilet and close the door behind them.<br>Shortly after the train has departed, the conductor comes around collecting tickets. He knocks on the toilet door and says, "Ticket please."<br>The door opens just a crack and a single arm emerges with a ticket in hand.<br>The conductor takes it and moves on.<br>The New Zealanders see this and agree it was quite a clever idea. So after the game, they decide to copy the Aussies on the return trip and save some money (being clever with money, and all that). When they get to the station, they buy a single ticket for the return trip.<br>To their astonishment, the Aussies don't buy a ticket at all!! "How are you going to travel without a ticket?" says one perplexed New Zealander.<br>"Watch and learn," answers an Aussie.<br>When they board the train the three New Zealanders cram into a toilet and soon after the three Aussies cram into another nearby.<br>The train departs.<br>Shortly afterwards, one of the Aussies leaves the toilet and walk over to the toilet where the New Zealanders are hiding.<br>He knocks on the door and says, "Ticket please."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The beautiful secretary of the president of a bank goes on a sightseeing tour with a very rich African king who was a very important client. The client out of the blue asks her to marry him. Naturally, the secretary is quite taken aback. However, she remembers that her boss told her not to reject the guy outright. So, she tries to think of a way to dissuade the king from wanting to marry her.<br><br>After a few minutes, the woman says to the man, "I will only marry you under three conditions. First, I want my engagement ring to be a 75-carat diamond ring with a matching 200-carat diamond tiara." The African king pauses for awhile. Then he nods his head and says, "No problem! I have. I have."<br><br>Realizing her first condition was too easy the woman says to the man, "I want you to build me a 100-room mansion in New York. And as a vacation home, I want a chateau built in the middle of the best wine country in France." The African king pauses for awhile. He whips out his cellular phone and calls some brokers in New York and in France. He looks at the woman, nods his head and says, "Okay, okay. I build. I build."<br><br>Realizing that she only has one last condition, the secretary knows that she'd better make this a good one. She takes her time to think and finally she gets an idea, a sure-to-work condition. She squints her eyes, looks at the man and says, rather coldly, "Since I like sex, I want the man I marry to have a 14-inch penis."<br><br>The man seems a bit disturbed. He cups his face with his hands and rests his elbows on the table, all the while muttering in African dialect. Finally, after what seemed like forever, the king shakes his head, looking really sad, and says to the woman, "Okay, okay. I cut. I cut."</div>

The guy went to a farm and after a couple of days he was very bored, and he asked the farmer to give him some job to do. The farmer told him to clean the shit of the cows.The farmer thought that to somebody coming from the city, working for the whole life sitting in an office, it will take over a week to finish the job,but to his surprise the manager finished the job in less than one day. The next day,the farmer gave to the Manager a more difficult job: To cut the heads of 500 chickens. The farmer was sure that the Manager will not be able to do the job,but at the end of the day the job was done. The next morning,as most of the jobs in the farm were done, the farmer asked the Manager to segregate a bag of potatoes in two boxes, one box with small potatoes, and one box with big potatoes. At the end of the day the farmer saw that the Manager was sitting in front of the potatoes bag, but the 2 boxes were empty.The farmer asked the Manager: How is that you did such difficult jobs in the first few days, and now you cannot do this simple job? The Manager answered: Listen, all my life I'm cutting heads and dealing with shit, but now you ask me to take decisions.</div>
