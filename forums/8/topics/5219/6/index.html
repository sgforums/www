            <div class='col-md body'>Once there was man named Jim, who let his dog out to pee late one night.  He watched some tv, and then remembered to let the dog back in.  When he opened the door, he was shocked at what he saw!  In his dog't mouth was his neighbors cat, dead!  "Bad dog!  BAD DOG!", said the panicked man.  I took the cat away and looked at it.  He couldn't bring himself to tell his nieghbor what happened, so he decided to clean it up and leave it on the nieghbor's porch.  He took the cat into the bathroom and washed off all the blood and dirt.  It took him forever, he had to wash it four time, to get it all cleaned. He brushed it's beautifull white fur as he blow dried it, and put it's collar back on.  Since it was so dark, he snuck into the neighbor's yard, and layed the cat down on the porch, in front of the door.  The next day, he was on his way to the car to go to work and his nieghbor was outside.  "Hi," he said.  "Hi," replied Jim, nervously.  His neighbor said, "something weird happened last night."  "Oh yeh?  What's that," asked Jim, sweating now.  "Well, my cat died yesterday, and we buried him, and this morning he was lying on my front porch!"<br><br>------------------<br>To luf someone is nothing, to be luf by someone is something, to be luf by the one you luf is everything.....</div>

Any similarity between you and a human is purely coincidental!<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 3. Are you always so stupid or is today a special occasion?<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 4.

It isn't as ugly<br>as<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; your face!<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 7. Brains aren't everything. In fact, in your case they're nothing<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 8. Careful now, don't let your brains go to your head!<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 9. I like you. People say I've no taste, but I like you<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 10. Did your parents ever ask you to run away from home?<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 11. If I had a face like yours. I'd sue my parents!<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 12. Don't feel bad. A lot of people have no talent!<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 13.

He has a mind like a steel trap -- always closed!<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 20. You are a man of the world -- and you know what sad shape the<br>world<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;is<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 21. He is always lost in thought -- it's unfamiliar territory.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 22. He is dark and handsome. When it's dark, he's handsome.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 23. He is known as a miracle comic. if he's funny, it's a miracle!<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 24.

He is so short, when it rains he is always the last one to know.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 27. He is the kind of a man that you would use as a blueprint to<br>build<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;an<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; idiot.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 28. How come you're here? I thought the zoo was closed at night!<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 29. How did you get here? Did someone leave your cage open?<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 30. How much refund do you expect on your head -- Now that it's<br>EMPTY.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 31. How would you like to feel the way you look?<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 32. Hi! I'm a human being! What are you?<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 33. I can't talk to you right now; tell me, where will you be in ten<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; years?<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 34. I don't want you to turn the other cheek. It's just as ugly.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 35. I don't know who you are, but whatever it is, i'm sure everyone<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;will<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; agree with me.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 36. I don't know what makes you so stupid, but it really works!<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 37. I could make a monkey out of you, but why should I take all the<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; credit?<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 38. I can't seem to remember your name, and please don't help me!<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 39. I don't even like the people you're trying to imitate! (if you<br>are<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;at<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; all !)<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 40. I know you were born silly, but why did you have a relapse?<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 41. I know you're a self-made man. It's nice of you to take the<br>blame!<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 42. I know you're not as stupid as you look. Nobody could be!<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 43. I've seen people like you, but I had to pay admission!<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 44. WHY ARE YOU SO STUPID TODAY??????? ANYWAY I THINK THAT IS VERY<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;TYPICAL<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; OF YOU!!<br><br>------------------<br>To luf someone is nothing, to be luf by someone is something, to be luf by the one you luf is everything.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An elderly husband and wife noticed that they were<br>beginning to forget many little things around the<br>house. They were afraid that this could be<br>dangerous, as one of them may accidently forget to<br>turn off the stove and thus cause a fire. So, they<br>decided to go see their physician to get some<br>help. Their physician told them that many people<br>their age find it useful to write themselves<br>little notes as reminders. The elderly couple<br>thought this sounded wonderful, and left the<br>doctor's office very pleased with the advice.When<br>they got home, the wife said, 'Dear, will you<br>please go to the kitchen and get me a dish of ice<br>cream? And why don't you write that down so you<br>won't forget?'<br>'Nonsense,' said the husband, 'I can remember a<br>dish of ice cream!'<br>'Well,' said the wife, 'I'd also like some<br>strawberries on it. You better write that down,<br>because I know you'll forget.'<br>'Don't be silly,' replied the husband.<br>'A dish of ice cream and some strawberries. I can<br>remember that!'<br>'OK, dear, but I'd like you to put some whipped<br>cream on top. Now you'd really better write it<br>down now. You'll forget,' said the wife.<br>'Come now, my memory's not all that bad,' said the<br>husband. 'No problem--a dish of ice cream with<br>strawberries and whipped cream.'<br>With that, the husband shut the kitchen door<br>behind him. The wife could hear him getting out<br>pots and pans, and making some noise inconsistent<br>with his preparing a dish of ice cream,<br>strawberries, and whipped cream.<br>He emerged from the kitchen about 15 minutes<br>later.  Walking over to his wife, he presented her<br>with a plate of bacon and eggs.  The wife took one<br>look at the plate, glanced up at her husband and<br>said, 'Hey, where's the toast?'<br><br>------------------<br>To luf someone is nothing, to be luf by someone is something, to be luf by the one you luf is everything.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An ant saw a lake and decided to bathe in it. He took out his cock and buried it on the bank, then proceeded to go for his bath. A horse comes along and decides to bathe in the inviting waters too. He plucks out his cock and proceeds to bury it in the same spot as the ant's. Then he went for his swim. Soon, an elephant walks past and feels in need of a bath as well. So he buries his cock in the same spot as the ant's and the horse's cocks.<br><br>After a few minutes, the horse comes out first, cos he runs the faster. He looks for his cock and was pleasantly surprised to find it has grown bigger! (It's the elephant's cock.) So he merrily puts it on and that is why until now, the horse always raises his forelegs to show his cock and neighs, "Mine is very big! Mine is very big!"<br><br>After that, the elephant comes out from the lake, and he digs out the horse's cock. "Wah! How come so small liao!" he said. And that is why until now, the elephant always shakes his head while taking his bath, muttering, "I go take a bath and it shrunk."<br><br>Finally, the ant comes out of the lake. He's the last to come out cos he has tiny legs. When he reached the bank, he frantically digs through the sand, screaming, "Where is it!? Where is it?!" This is why until now when ants meet each other, they use their antannae to communicate with each other, "Hey you got see my cock?"<br><br>------------------<br>If I had the letters "HRT", I can add "EA" to get a "HEART" or a "U"and get "HURT".

            <div class='col-md body'>1. There was once a woman who was constantly horny. One day, her businessman husband has to leave on an overseas business trip and but was concerned that his wife would look for other men in his absence. So he went to a sex shop to look for sex toys to occupy his wife for the 3 days that he's away.<br><br>He saw a life-size model of a man, but decided that it resembles a real man too much, and so decided against buying it. He then asked the shopowner for recommendations. The shopowner then took out an ordinary-looking box containing a very ordinary-looking dildo.<br><br>"What's so good about this dildo?"<br><br>"This is a voodoo dildo."<br><br>"Yah right."<br><br>"I'll show you if you don't believe me. Voodoo dildo the door!"<br><br>The voodoo dildo then jumps out of the box and proceeds to thrust powerfully at the keyhole of the sex shop's door. The thrusts were so powerful that cracks appeared on the door and its glass panel started to break. Then the shopowner said, "Voodoo dildo come back!" and the voodoo dildo returned to its box.<br><br>Suitably impressed, the businessman bought the voodoo dildo for $700. When he got home, he told his wife that everytime she feels horny, all she has to say is, "Voodoo dildo my pussy." And so the businessman left for his business trip happily.<br><br>Sure enough, after the businessman left, the wife started to feel horny. She wanted to look for male companions at first, but she remembered the voodoo dildo and decided to try that. So she said, "Voodoo dildo my pussy." The voodoo dildo then proceeded to give her the best fucking she ever felt. The strokes were so powerful that she orgasmed twice. She finally felt immensely satisfied and exhausted, but started to panic as she did not know how to stop the voodoo dildo! Her husband forgot to teach her the commands! So she got dressed and made her way to the car, hoping to get to the hospital for help, all the while with the voodoo dildo pumping at her rapidly between her legs.<br><br>She stumbled into the car and stepped on the accelerator. On the road, she had another orgasm and her car swerved. A traffic police noticed that and stopped her.<br><br>"I saw your car swerve. What's the matter?"<br><br>"I have a voodoo dildo stuck in my pussy and I'm rushing to the hospital to get it out!"<br><br>"Yah right. Voodoo dildo my ass!"<br><br>2. A couple lives in a neighbourhood where crime is rampant. The husband had enough of living in constant fear everyday and told his wife to get themselves a big guard dog for protection.<br><br>However, when the wife reached the pet shop, she was told that all the guard dogs were sold out. They only haf one small dog left, called the 'Karate Dog'.<br><br>"But it's so small! What can it do?" the wife questioned the shopowner.<br><br>"Watch this. Karate Dog the table!" and the small dog smashed up the coffee table with a karate chop.<br><br>Visibly impressed, the wife bought the Karate Dog and brought it home. She explained to her husband what her latest buy was, and her husband replied, "Yah right! Karate Dog my ass!"<br><br>------------------<br>If I had the letters "HRT", I can add "EA" to get a "HEART" or a "U"and get "HURT". But I'd rather choose "U" and get "HURT" than have a "HEART" without U<br><br>[This message has been edited by Malbordus (edited 22 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guy's opinion<br>Makes some sense...<br>1.. We're not as big of perverts as you think we all are.<br><br>2.. No matter what you say, your ex-boyfriend is an asshole.<br><br>3.. We like you to give us hugs and kisses sometimes too.<br><br>4.. Don't argue with us when we call you beautiful.<br><br>5.. Don't treat us like crap, what goes around comes around.<br><br>6.. We know you're pretty, that's one of the reason's we're going out with you.<br><br>7.. Don't go into detail about your period.  It scares us.<br><br>8.. If you have cramps and we ask you what's wrong, just tell us it's that time of the month and nothing more.<br><br>9.. If you really liked us for us, you would let us think that our mustache, beard, or sideburns looked cool.<br><br>10.. We never shave our legs.  Get over it.<br><br>11.. NEVER ask us if you can put make up on us.  It's just wrong.<br><br>12.. Don't make bets about us, because one of your friends will tell us, if you don't.<br><br>13.. When we tell you that you're not fat, believe us.<br><br>14.. We absolutely do not care about, The Backstreet Boys, NSYNC,98 degrees, or what any other guy looks like for that matter.<br><br>15.. We may not be able to pee acurately all of the time, but at least we can stand up and go pee.<br><br>16.. Just cause you think you're always right, doesn't mean that you dont't have to apologize when you do something "wrong".<br><br>17.. You expect us to say and do sweet things for you, but it would be nice if you did the same every once in a while.  We like to know that you love us.<br><br>18.. We can't always be spontaneous, so try to help us make the plans sometimes.<br><br>19.. Don't ask us to beat up another guy for you, cause you might just get what you wish for.<br><br>20.. Never kick us in the nuts "just to see what we would day".<br><br>21.. Never pretend like you are going to break up with us and laugh when we believe you.<br><br>22.. Pamela Anderson's boobs aren't fake anymore, but we like yours better anyway.<br><br>23.. Size doesn't matter, except to idiots who don't want a relationship&gt;<br><br>24.. PMS is not an excuse.<br><br>25.. If you want us to put the seat down when we're done, you should put it up when you're done.<br><br>26.. Don't tell us how cute your ex-boyfriend was.  That doesn't turn us on.<br><br>27.. And always remember:  The way to a guys heart is through his stomach.....and maybe .... oh nevermind.<br><br>28.. And last but not least:  We know you're not always right,but we'll pretend like you are anyway<br><br>------------------<br>To luf someone is nothing, to be luf by someone is something, to be luf by the one you luf is everything.....</div>

But if we<br>try several different positions, and if I shoot from six or seven angles, I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results."<br><br>"I hope we can get this over with quickly," gasped Mrs.  Smith.<br><br>"Madam, in my line of work, a man must take his time.  I'd love to be in and out in five minutes, but you'd be disappointed with that, I'm sure."<br><br>"Don't I know!", Mrs.  Smith exclaimed.<br><br>The photographer opened his briefcase and pulled out a portfolio of his baby pictures. "This was done on the top of a bus in downtown London."<br><br>"Oh my God!", Mrs.  Smith exclaimed, tugging at her handkerchief.<br><br>"And these twins turned out exceptionally well when you consider their mother was so difficult to work with."<br><br>The photographer handed Mrs.  Smith the picture.<br><br>"She was difficult?" asked Mrs.  Smith.<br><br>"Yes, I'm afraid so.  I finally had to take her to Hyde Park to get the<br>job done right.  People were crowding around four and five deep, pushing to get a good look."<br><br>"Four and five deep?" asked Mrs.  Smith, eyes widened in amazement.<br><br>"Yes", the photographer said.  "And for more than three hours, too.<br>The mother was constantly squealing and yelling.  I could hardly concentrate.  Then darkness approached and I began to rush my shots.<br>Finally, when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, I just packed<br>it all in."<br><br>Mrs.  Smith leaned forward.  "You mean they actually chewed on your, uh ...  equipment?".<br><br>"That's right.  Well, Madam, if you're ready, I'll set up my tripod so that we can get to work."<br><br>"Tripod?" Mrs.  Smith looked extremely worried now.<br><br>"Oh yes, I have to use a tripod to rest my Canon on.  It's much too big<br>for me to hold while I'm getting ready for action.<br><br>Madam?

A week after arriving back home in the States, he awakes one morning to find his dick covered  with bright green and purple spots.<br>Horrified, he immediately goes to see his doctor.  The doctor, never having seen anything like this before, orders some tests and tells the man to return in a two days, for the results.<br>The man returns a couple of days later and the doctor says,"I've got bad news for you. You've contracted Mongolian VD. It's very rare and almost unheard of here. We know very little about it."<br>The man looks a little relieved and says, "Well, give me a shot or something and fix me up, doc."<br>The doctor answers, "I'm sorry, there's no known cure. We're going to have to amputate your penis."<br>The man screams in horror, "Oh no! I want a second opinion!"<br>The doctors replies, "Well it's your choice. Go ahead if you want, but surgery is your only choice."<br>The next day, the man seeks out a Chinese doctor, figuring that he'll know more about the disease. The Chinese doctor examines his dick and proclaims, "Ah yes,Mongolian VD.<br>Velly lare disease."<br>The guys says to the doctor, "Yeah, yeah, I already know that,but what can you do? My American doctor wants to operate and amputate my penis!"<br>The Chinese doctor shakes his head and laughs, "Stupid Amellican doctor!<br>Amellican doctor, always want to opulate. Make more money, that way.  No need to to opulate!"<br>"Oh thank God!" the man replies.<br>"Yes!" says the Chinese doctor, "You no worry! Wait two weeky.
