I'm sure attitudes are changing now.  Most companies today are losing their 'old guard' along with 'old attitudes'.  But noticed I said about the example being a real life one?  Well, they divorced.  It was the wife and not the husband who couldn't handle the shame.  Materialistic woman?  Maybe.  Career biatch?  Perhaps.  Wanted someone who could support her so that she could become a house wife?  That was her answer.  Go figure...<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>
