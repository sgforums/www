Centres give free advice<br><br>And no, there's nothing lewd about it. Rather, fertility awareness group, aLife, with centres in Bukit Batok and Ang Mo Kio, has been dishing out free advice to childless couples. WONG SHER MAINE reports on its progress<br><br>SEX twice a day, several days in a row, in every imaginable position. For nearly two years, Mr Michael Lim (not his real name), 33, and his wife, 31, would follow this procreation routine with clinical precision.<br><br>They were desperate for children but, month after month, Mrs Lim's period came with unerring regularity. Until the two spoke to a counsellor from fertility awareness organisation aLife four months ago.<br><br>Mr Lim's beaming wife, an administrative assistant, is now 10 weeks pregnant.<br><br>The IT system administrator believes the counsellor's advice helped them to have sex when it would work best, as his wife had been advised to take her temperature at the same time every day to pinpoint the time she ovulated.<br><br>Mr Lim now laughs at the thought of how he and his wife were so clueless - for two years - about the 'right' time to make babies.<br><br>He heard of aLife by word of mouth.<br><br>The organisation, founded by consultant obstetrician gynaecologist Peter Chew, opened quietly in June.<br><br>Its centres in Bukit Batok and Ang Mo Kio receive, on average, 20 clients a month altogether. Most are women who have trouble conceiving or are planning to have a baby, and want some fertility advice.<br><br>Showing them the way are 25 volunteers from the health-care industry, including a retired doctor, and they man the centres for 5 1/2 days every week.<br><br>Today, the Bukit Batok centre begins a five-day fund-raising event at the West Mall shopping centre to raise money for its annual expenses, which are about $100,000.<br><br>The Southwest Community Development Council is helping aLife to fund and organise the activities, which include a baby photo exhibition, dance performances and a panel discussion about family life.<br><br>Dr Chew, who runs a clinic at Gleneagles Hospital, was prompted to open the centres after treating numerous childless couples in Singapore. Fertility expert Christopher Chen of Gleneagles Hospital had estimated in an earlier Straits Times report that one in five couples here have difficulty conceiving.<br><br>'A lot of young people think it's easy to have a baby. They take their fertility for granted,' said Dr Chew, adding that the best time for a woman to conceive is between age 22 and 26, as the quality of her eggs are best then.<br><br>'They think that if worse comes to the worst, they can go for IVF. But that is a very traumatic and expensive process.' He hopes that before trying invasive procedures such as in-vitro fertilisation (IVF), these couples would conceive after counselling.<br><br>The aLife counsellors, who spend up to an hour with each couple, try to find out about the couple's relationship and their sexual habits.<br><br>Said counsellor Jennifer Chee, 55: 'Sometimes they are too busy to try and make a baby. They have sex once or twice a month but, in that month, the woman's ovulation lasts only 24 to 36 hours.'<br><br>She also tries to find out if couples, like the Lims, are so focused on having a baby that sex becomes a stressful rather than pleasurable activity.<br><br>The counsellors then teach the couples how to accurately chart the woman's temperature, and instruct them on the best time to try to have a baby.<br><br>Said Madam Chee: 'If they successfully conceive, I feel like Santa Claus, like I have given them a gift.'<br><br>Mr Lim said: 'We have waited and tried for so long. I can hardly believe my wife is really pregnant.'<br>Copyright @ 2003 Singapore Press Holdings. All rights reserved.</div>
