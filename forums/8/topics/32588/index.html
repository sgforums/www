            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br><br>To:  National University of Singapore<br><br>It does strike me that the much hyped Â“world class institutionÂ” that the National University of Singapore (NUS) aspires to be, is nothing but a chimera, or if u please, an illusion of an oasis in the middle of the desert, only for the cruel reality to dawn upon the poor thirsty souls upon further inspection. Many hopes were raised upon hearing about this worthy goal and it was widely anticipated that the problem plagued administration would be ameliorated by the arrival of world class information super systems and an efficient administration.<br><br>Alas, after much of the initial brouhaha, it became apparent that such hopes have little basis in reality. A system to be based upon the much vaunted US model flopped miserably as the mad rush for certain modules leaves one feeling rather involved in some kind of Â“ Great Singapore SaleÂ”. Yet this can be constituted as an insult to the event itself for during the Sale, if one were to rush for a particular good, one would be more or less assured of acquiring it if one got there first. Not so for the NUS way of acquiring modules. Attempts from the administration to provide a fair means of acquiring modules have resulted in the Â“ballotingÂ” system whereby students enter their names into a kind of Â“lucky drawÂ” and if their luck holds, they Â“winÂ” a much coveted prize of a place in that particular module.<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>A particularly infuriating bone of contention many raise (amongst a host of other problems) is the fact that this balloting system is used for place distribution in Cross Faculty Modules, Unrestricted Modules (which really is an oxymoron since selection of such modules are, as any NUS student would tell you, severely restricted by lack of choice), General Education Modules, Singapore Society Modules and even for Faculty Modules! This in itself is not the problem even though it does happen to apply to all modules. The problem arises when certain modules are oversubscribed. Many Year 2s and Year 3s are left seething when they are not allocated the modules they apply for and if this happened for one module, it is understandable. But to happen for four or five modules especially for Unrestricted Modules whereby the scope has already been slashed down, is simply unacceptable, not least when it occurs for consecutive semesters of module allocation!</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Furthermore, the Arts students are being short-changed for there are already few modules they are able to do. With pre-requisites such as A level pass in one of the science subjects or requiring one to have done at least one level 1000 module in a math or science option, there is little avenue for the Arts student to broaden his or her horizons as was intended (so they say) by the initiators of this fine education system. In modules whereby they are able to apply for, a deluge of applicants flood in regardless of which faculty they are from thus ensuring that many Arts students are left to contest for a miserable number of seats. However, the other modules that the students from other faculties are able to take, but for whatever reason eschew, have vacancies literally by the hundreds. Would it not be better to increase the number of places in the popular modules and close down those modules that have little or no applicants? Certain modules are even Â“equippedÂ” with double-standard pre-requisites which only serve to further disenchant Arts students with an already limited choice of cross-faculty modules. Â“Genes and SocietyÂ”, a compulsory module for all 1st year engineering students, as well as a cross-faculty module, has a pre-requisite which disallows students with passes in A-level biology to take it. This rule, however, only applies to students outside of the engineering faculty and who wish to take it up as a cross-faculty module. Are students outside of engineering faculty, with no prior knowledge of biology, supposed to compete at an equal footing with those in engineering who have studied the subject at A-levels before? The rationale for installing such a decree truly boggles the mind, and is just one of many other instances.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>A similar quandary arises within a faculty itself, when certain modules are exclusively more popular amongst students, while others are deliberately shunned. Again, as any student would tell you, the reason for this is simply because the former modules are more interesting and/or easier to score in, while the latter are downright tedious and/or risky for one aspiring for good grades. And here we realise that luck begins to play a large part in oneÂ’s grades, rather than oneÂ’s abilities, as ensured by the balloting system of module allocation.<br><br>I have never had the privilege of studying in a world class institution, and thus have no inkling of how one is supposed to operate (though it seems queer that friends studying abroad have never faced such problems in their schools). All I know is, when students are not guaranteed the chance to select areas of study according to their interests (both within and without a subject they are majoring in), this institution only succeeds in limiting the studentsÂ’ potential abilities as well as nurturing frustration towards the institution (as is the case now). It is reasonable that a system cannot please everyone at the same time, but it becomes farcical when everyone is displeased.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This letter was written in the hope that by pointing out the problems and contradictions within the system, improvements can be made so as to ensure a more conducive learning environment. To acquire a broad based education should not just be a matter of simply taking any module for the sake of fulfilling university requirements. One should have an interest in what oneÂ’s doing. Furthermore, many are doing modules not to their liking just to fulfil the requirements. This often leads to a bad grade in the module taken, which drastically lowers their Cumulative Average Points (CAP) score which in turn, may affect their chances of doing honours. Is this fair then, to penalise students for the structural problems within the education system?<br><br>Too many fellow students share the same concerns stated above. If NUS wishes to achieve itÂ’s lofty ambition of being a world class institution, it should accept the feedback of the students and implement changes accordingly. Go on, dare to ask the students what they think about the school system and administration.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>The Undersigned<br><br></div>
