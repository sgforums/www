            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>The first main area is the field of engineering. Within this chapter, the development of iron and steel is the greatest<br>achievement. The development of iron and steel led to other advances. By at least the 4th century the Chinese have developed blast furnaces to obtain cast iron from iron ore. This was 1200 years before the first blast furnace showed up in Europe.<br></blockquote>Iron age  3500BC where the use of iron was 1st documented.(Egypt)<br>Steel(as in adding impurites to make iron stronger) 1st used to great effects in the west by the Hitties 1600BC<br>Dunno about blast furnance since the book i have states the modern version at 13th centary so i wont argue that.<br><br><blockquote>The Chinese invented the chain pump in the first century AD The<br>chain pump allows water to the pumped from lower to higher elevations. The chain pumps were used for draining and pumping in civil engineering, but what is more important is it was used for irrigation. Irrigation allows for greater and more intense farming, thus resulting in a better crop yield. European chain pump appeared in the sixteenth century, and was a direct copy of the Chinese version. The most recognized Chinese invention is in the field of domestic and industrial technology, paper.<br>Paper was invented around the second century BC and was used as clothing. One might not believe that paper could be used as clothing, but the paper made at that time used thicker and tougher paper fibers. Not only was paper used for clothing, it was also used for military body armor. The Chinese found out that pleated sheets of paper could stop the penetration of arrows. The paper armor was standard issue with Chinese land and sea units.<br>PaperÂ’s writing property was not discovered till about one century<br>after its discovery. The earliest example of writing on paper was<br>found an abandon military post. The paper found dates back to 110 AD and contained two dozen readable characters.<br></blockquote>Dunno what you mean by Chain pump the closest i can get is a vertical wheel or a archimedes screw...the former was invented in the 5th century BC while the latter is 3rd century BC<br>Paper is a chinese invention and was discovered in 2nd centBC<br>but it was used for clothes.The paper used for writting was discovered somewhere in AD 80-106 thereabouts.<br><blockquote>The area that let China grow and expand was the innovations in the area of agriculture. The greatest achievement in the field of<br>agriculture is row cultivation and intensive hoeing. In Europe, as<br>with the rest of the world, they practiced scatter seed farming.<br>Scatter seed farming is the practice of throwing the seed onto the<br>fields at random. By throwing the seed randomly, half the seeds would not grow and make it impossible to weed the field. The Chinese on the other hand, planted individual seeds and rows, thus reducing seed loss. The planting of crops in rows also allowed for intensive hoeing, which in turn reduce weeds. Another major advancement in the field of agriculture is the seed drill. The seed drill complements the row farming of the Chinese. The seed drill is a device that plants the seed into the ground. It replaces the farmer to plant the seeds by hand, thus allowing the farmer to plant more acreage. The first seed drill was introduced to Europe in sixteenth century, 3500 years after the Chinese had invented it.<br></blockquote>I think you mean a seeder rather then a seed drill.That is credited to the Chinese.However ploughing and  placing the seeds properly is a parrallel invention. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote>The suspension bridge, invented by the Chinese in the first century AD, is still the bridge of choice when one has to span a great distance. </blockquote>Suspension bridge invented by chinese in the 6th cen AD<br><br><blockquote>The greatest area of Chinese invention is in agriculture.<br>The Chinese excelled in farming, not only did they discover the seed drill, they discovered row farming that is still used today.<br>I would recommend this book with one wants to read about the past<br>glory of China and the huge potentional of the future. It gave<br>in-depth views into each Chinese invention, while not over doing the techical explaination. He gave many examples of<br>Chinese invoation, and how the rest of the world copied the Chinese.<br>Not did the rest of the world copy Chinese inventions, they claimed<br>that they were the first to invent it. The author opened my eyes to<br>the greatness of anicent China.</blockquote>Actually both the Chinese and the all those living in the fertile cresent and egypt share the same level of competance in argiculture.<br><blockquote>numbers and mathematics were invented by the chinese. and though the numbers we are using now like 1 2 3 4 etc are arabian, recent research shows that they were had originated from china, by arranging sticks in orders similar to current chinese characters.<br></blockquote>Maths cannot be pinned down to 1 particular culture 'inventing" it.<br>1st written numbers was during 3rd millennium BC by the Babylonians while the ancient Mayans had a base 20 number system where by they counted their toes and fingers(no kiddin)Greeks had their own numbers using alphaberts while the Egyptians and Chinese used scratch marks or sticks<br><br>That said<br><blockquote>What Rob is saying is true. Just go to any Chinese (as in China) forum or read any Chinese publication, you'll see that he's right. They just seem to over-dramatise every achievement, and keep labelling them as 'world-class'.... I mean, to those Chinese reading them, sure, will boost their ego, but to us outsiders and westerners, they be laughing at how they blow up their achievements. (This is not to say that China's achievements are not significant. They are, but they've got to be reminded that they are still years behind in many respect compared to the west and until then, better to be more low-key, right?)<br></blockquote>While i admit the Chinese tend to place alot of weight on they're pride and ego and infact do things for them like you said their achievements are not insignificant<br><br><blockquote>a space launch may be a very expensive PR exercise, but it is also a very important advancement in engineering and technology, this simply shows that the chinese are now capable of space launch technology, which also means they have the capability to launch a rocket to anywhere else in the world -&gt; military power.<br><br>advancement of technology should never be discouraged.<br></blockquote>Frankly speaking the EU have had the ability to launch rockets into space for the pass 20 odd years.But they never bothered to spend the money on sending a man out into space because they know it's useless when the Russians and US can do it for you!<br>notes:interesting that at the height of the space race the leading researchers on both the Soviet and US teams were germans <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> !!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Rob Chen:<br><strong>China made significant progress for itself to be the 3rd country to launch astronaut into space.  [b]However, it isnÂ’t such a big deal as they described themselves Â– Â‘zhen han shi jieÂ’ i.e. bringing global shock/surprise. </strong> They isnÂ’t the 1st nation, the Russian &amp; Americans went before <strong>already some 40 years ago</strong>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This fact alone isnÂ’t much of a global surprise or shocking development </span>Â– of course to chinaÂ’s Chinese and some overseas Chinese.<br><br>Moreover, while <span style="text-decoration: underline;">China say it is indigenous technology </span>(i.e. no foreign technical assistance required), <strong>everybody know that too many Russian scientists/engineers were employed to assist in design and other consultation</strong> (since Russian space programmes went virtually broke and could not longer employ so many former scientist/engineers).<br>Even the <strong>rocketÂ’s and space module look almost a replica</strong>.  Their astronants even <strong>used the Russian 0 gravity planes, what 'indigenious' techno they are trying to lie to </strong>- maybe only to their own people and overseas chinese who believe 100%  the CCP's govt.<br><br>Moreover, it is only natural China is the 3rd  nations capable of human space programmes. only China has the land, manpower, resources and madness i.e. Â‘patriotic madnessÂ’ to become the 3rd nation.  <strong>Only a handful have the land mass, e.g. Russia, China, USA, Australia, Canada or Brazil (country either already a Continent like Australia or with similar vast land area)</strong> otherwise, your space craft will likely in another country.  Manpower and resource (including technology), this factors cannot be met by Brazil.  For madness, Australia, Canada definitely <span style="text-decoration: underline;">donÂ’t need to Â‘clean the hundreds of years of shameÂ’ like China and have no such Â‘madnessÂ’. </span>  This also applies to <strong>other Western powers like France, UK, Germany etc.  <span style="font-style: italic;">They know they isnÂ’t the first and no point wasting space money to be no. 3 or 4 or 5. </span> </strong>They spent on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">more practical purpose Â– nuclear deterrence and non-human space programmes for scientific/commercial benefits.</span><br><br>The <strong>Chinese are a great people, u need to meet some Â‘averageÂ’ Chinese graduates to fully understand what I mean.  </strong> I truly believe <span style="text-decoration: underline;">they have the capabilities/potential to do it alone but I also truly believe that this space launch is merely a RUSHED PR project </span>that involved huge Russian expertise and copied technology from US and Russia.  This is also <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nothing much more than a nation wanting to prove its Â‘capabilitiesÂ’ despite many other problems yet to be solved in the interior of the nation, joblessness, diseases, hunger, corruption. </span><br><br>This also point to <strong>one cultural weakness of the Chinese, they like to claim world first, East AsiaÂ’s first or claim surprise/technology of global significance but in fact only choosing to ignore the facts </strong>Â– <span style="text-decoration: underline;">they are not the first, technology is not so new, <strong>it is only giving their own nationals a false sense of pride </strong></span>Â–<br><br>these are the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">very same reasons why China first suffer the hundred years of shame that started with the opium war</span>.  1 reason that <strong>really pissed the British and other Westerners was that originally, Qing China refused to talk/negotiate on equal footing and terms with foreigners</strong>.  They hence have the excuse (before other westerners/civilized nations) to use firepower to force equal negotiation rights.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">China believed they are the best in the world in terms of everything</span> and <strong>when the facts revealed they are not (losing the opium wars), they still ignored it for around 50 years Â– suffering another humiliating defeat to the Japanese which ceded Taiwan to Japan in 1894.  </strong><br>[/b]</blockquote> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> its necessary for china to pump some false pride into her nationals to retain her talent pool before they figure they deserve greener pastures and head for US or maybe S'pore (which we oways kao-bei-kao-bu). but they should know their limits and dun go the way of imperial Japan. also don't behave superior either at home or otherwise.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>many assumed i m anti-china but i guess non really bother reading my entire original article in detail which i also mentioned other aspects. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><strong>I also said that Chinese are a great people - their 'average graduates' are much better than ours, it is the cultral mindset that they need further fine-tuning</strong> -<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">if they are indeed the best, say it loud but also show the prove </span>, <strong>if they are not i.e. only 3rd or 4th best, just admit your current ranking and improve further, don't boost too ridiculously e.g. using 'Zhen han shi jie' - otherwise it is detrimental to China's own developments and growth... like in the 1850 - 1890s</strong>,<br><br>after losing opium wars, Qing China believe<strong> it is only due to technology, forgetting about education, continuous improvement, political system, corruption etc </strong>affecting the nation.  They went on to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">buy 'modern' fleets of warships from the West to show off their 'improved modernity/technology' to the westerners &amp; foreigners</span>.   <span style="text-decoration: underline;">China also sent military officers to the west for training in tactics and other modern military warfare.</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Very happy about their 'purchased technology'</span> and <strong>Claiming to be world 3rd or 4th and THE Best Naval Fleet of the Far East i.e. East Asia .</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">However, technology is ever improving and other uncorrected faults of the political systems cause their  warships to be obsolete soon and no money to fund/maintain and supply the 'now older' warships</span>, what happen is they Japan overtook in technology , education and purchased even more modern and more powerful  warships.....<br><br>China therefore lost to Japan in the Jiawu (1894) war and had to cede taiwan and pay huge sums of $$.<br><br>INVENTIONS<br><br>it is related to my point above too, true, many ancient inventions are from China, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but many stagnated from there, gunpowder had many forms - Chinese used and discovered the earliest /weakest form </span>and <strong>never developed much further</strong>,<br><br><strong> a Ming dynasty emperor (which THEN had the BEST GUN TECHNOLOGY IN THE WHOLE WORLD) had the silly idea that once he keep HIS BEST GUN technology a secret (lock up the gun technology, design and chemical formulae), only China (ming empire) can have access to it and other nations will never be able to threathen or overtake Ming China.</strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>However, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tartars, Mongols and other East Asian mercenaries that fought against the Chinese </span><strong>spreaded the technology to Central Asia, South Asia (India), West Asia (Arabia/Middle East) and then these cultures spread the basic concept of explosives to Europe to developed into modern powerful guns, artillery and howitzers.....</strong><br><br>Qing China lost the opium war because many of their big guns are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">still from the Ming-era and never developed further...., their armies also mostly not armed with rifles, (few only with muskets).  </span><strong>Technology must be constantly improved</strong>,<br><br><strong>having developed a wooden wheel doesn't mean you can claim credit for a motor car. </strong>   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I am concerned that China today might be adopting a similar attitude as in the late 1800s, <strong>claiming superiority to make their domestic audience happy and contented but never really bothering to constantly improve or improve their other underlying faults of their nation....,</strong><br><br>US knew it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">pointless to match Russian for human space travel </span><strong>since Russia already made history of being 1st human in space, so US made it a point for 1st man flight on the MOON.

            <div class='col-md body'>wah so much discussion..<br><br>anyway wat i was trying to say is that China is itself a strong country.. if not for setbacks (e.g. closing of trade, discouraging research) they encoutered in history, they would be different from what they are now..<br><br>true enough, china is using the launch as propoganda.. governments use propoganda as a tool to rally people together.. which government doesn't use such tools to garner support?</div>
