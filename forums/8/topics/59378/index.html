I only remember the facts that our ancestors may be from China, but I'm now a Singaporean. I don't feel for them, for my roots are deep into the soils of this small island country. I am Chinese but it does not make me interested in such recognition. I rather look into myself to see what I am capable in the future, rather than wonder what others are capable of as long as it does not pose a threat.<br><br>Well, we do have more pressing issues in our lives that we should treat with more care. If you are always debating about such issues, it make you no different from the old man in the hawker centre. He could lead a good life, happy, instead of cursing the government and claiming Chinese were but a superior race.<br><br>Sincerely.. do these issues really affect you emotionally?

Their astronants even <strong>used the Russian 0 gravity planes, what 'indigenious' techno they are trying to lie to </strong>- maybe only to their own people and overseas chinese who believe 100%  the CCP's govt.<br><br>Moreover, it is only natural China is the 3rd  nations capable of human space programmes. only China has the land, manpower, resources and madness i.e. Â‘patriotic madnessÂ’ to become the 3rd nation.  <strong>Only a handful have the land mass, e.g. Russia, China, USA, Australia, Canada or Brazil (country either already a Continent like Australia or with similar vast land area)</strong> otherwise, your space craft will likely in another country.  Manpower and resource (including technology), this factors cannot be met by Brazil.  For madness, Australia, Canada definitely <span style="text-decoration: underline;">donÂ’t need to Â‘clean the hundreds of years of shameÂ’ like China and have no such Â‘madnessÂ’. </span>  This also applies to <strong>other Western powers like France, UK, Germany etc.  <span style="font-style: italic;">They know they isnÂ’t the first and no point wasting space money to be no. 3 or 4 or 5. </span> </strong>They spent on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">more practical purpose Â– nuclear deterrence and non-human space programmes for scientific/commercial benefits.</span><br><br>The <strong>Chinese are a great people, u need to meet some Â‘averageÂ’ Chinese graduates to fully understand what I mean.  </strong> I truly believe <span style="text-decoration: underline;">they have the capabilities/potential to do it alone but I also truly believe that this space launch is merely a RUSHED PR project </span>that involved huge Russian expertise and copied technology from US and Russia.

            <div class='col-md body'>copied frm somewhere...<br><br>The World is forever in debt to China for its innovations. Ancient China was extreme advance and many of its discoveries are still in use today.<br><br>The Chinese excelled in many other areas, including <strong>mathematics, warfare and transportation</strong>, to name a few. Eleven fields invention, I feel that these three sections contain the greatest examples of Chinese innovation, and the debt that the modern world owes China.<br><br>The first main area is the <strong>field of engineering</strong>. Within this chapter, the <strong>development of iron and steel </strong>is the greatest<br>achievement. The development of iron and steel led to other advances. By at least the 4th century the Chinese have <strong>developed blast furnaces </strong>to obtain cast iron from iron ore. This was <strong>1200 years before </strong>the first blast furnace showed up in Europe.<br><br>Another major invention of the Chinese, that led to other<br>achievements, is <strong>steel.</strong> The common belief today is that Henry Bessemer discovered the process of refining iron into steel. The fact is Chinese had developed the process to refine iron into steel in the second century BC The Chinese learned that by injecting oxygen into the blast furnace, they could remove the carbon from the iron. But then, no one else could have done so at the time, since iron existed nowhere else but in China.<br><br>The Chinese invented the <strong>chain pump </strong>in the first century AD The<br>chain pump allows water to the pumped from lower to higher elevations. The chain pumps were used for draining and pumping in civil engineering, but what is more important is it was used for irrigation. <strong>Irrigation </strong>allows for greater and more intense farming, thus resulting in a better crop yield. European chain pump appeared in the sixteenth century, and was a direct copy of the Chinese version. The most recognized Chinese invention is in the field of domestic and industrial technology, <strong>paper. </strong><br>Paper was invented around the second century BC and was used as clothing. One might not believe that paper could be used as clothing, but the paper made at that time used thicker and tougher paper fibers. Not only was paper used for clothing, it was also used for <strong>military body armor</strong>. The Chinese found out that pleated sheets of paper could stop the penetration of arrows. The paper armor was standard issue with Chinese land and sea units.<br>PaperÂ’s writing property was not discovered till about one century<br>after its discovery. The earliest example of writing on paper was<br>found an abandon military post. The paper found dates back to 110 AD and contained two dozen readable characters.<br><br>The area that let China grow and expand was the innovations in the area of agriculture. The greatest achievement in the <strong>field of<br>agriculture is row cultivation and  intensive hoeing</strong>. In Europe, as<br>with the rest of the world, they practiced scatter seed farming.<br>Scatter seed farming is the practice of throwing the seed onto the<br>fields at random. By throwing the seed randomly, half the seeds would not grow and make it impossible to weed the field. The Chinese on the other hand, planted individual seeds and rows, thus reducing seed loss. The planting of crops in rows also allowed for intensive hoeing, which in turn reduce weeds. Another major advancement in the field of agriculture is the <strong>seed drill</strong>. The seed drill complements the row farming of the Chinese. The seed drill is a device that plants the seed into the ground. It replaces the farmer to plant the seeds by hand, thus allowing the farmer to plant more acreage. The first seed drill was introduced to Europe in sixteenth century, <strong>3500 years after the Chinese had invented it</strong>.<br><br>In conclusion, I believe that the author has proved his original<br>idea, that the modern world is in debt to China. The author has given many examples of Chinese innovation and intelligence that are seen in use today. <strong>Chinese innovation in agriculture has not only allowed the Chinese to grow, it has also allowed the modern world to grow. </strong><br><strong>The growth of these other countries is directly linked to the<br>inventions that they copied from the Chinese</strong>. Many of the Chinese<br>engineering feats are still practiced today. The process of refining<br>iron into steel is still used today, though the process has been<br>refined. The <strong>suspension bridge</strong>, invented by the Chinese in the first century AD, is still the bridge of choice when one has to span a great distance.<br><br>The greatest area of Chinese invention is in agriculture.<br>The Chinese <strong>excelled in farming</strong>, not only did they discover the seed drill, they discovered row farming that is still used today.<br>I would recommend this book with one wants to read about <strong>the past<br>glory of China and the huge potentional of the future.</strong> It gave<br>in-depth views into each Chinese invention, while not over doing the techical explaination. He gave many examples of<br>Chinese invoation, and how the rest of the world copied the Chinese.<br>Not did the rest of the world copy Chinese inventions, they claimed<br>that they were the first to invent it. The author opened my eyes to<br>the greatness of anicent China.<strong></strong><strong></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What Rob is saying is true. Just go to any Chinese (as in China) forum or read any Chinese publication, you'll see that he's right. They just seem to over-dramatise every achievement, and keep labelling them as 'world-class'.... I mean, to those Chinese reading them, sure, will boost their ego, but to us outsiders and westerners, they be laughing at how they blow up their achievements. (This is not to say that China's achievements are not significant. They are, but they've got to be reminded that they are still years behind in many respect compared to the west and until then, better to be more low-key, right?)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>numbers and mathematics were invented by the chinese. and though the numbers we are using now like 1 2 3 4 etc are arabian, recent research shows that they were had originated from china, by arranging sticks in orders similar to current chinese characters.<br><br>then again. history is history. if somebody's great grand father gave your great grand father a piece of bread that saved his life, would you continue being a slave to his descendants?<br><br>no point harping on and on about past successes when the present is what's more important.<br><br>a space launch may be a very expensive PR exercise, but it is also a very important advancement in engineering and technology, this simply shows that the chinese are now capable of space launch technology, which also means they have the capability to launch a rocket to anywhere else in the world -&gt; military power.<br><br>advancement of technology should never be discouraged.</div>
