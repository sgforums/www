            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>I believeÂ…<br><br>Hi everyone... I am a newcomer here; though I have been reading this forum for several months.<br><br>I have something on my heart and wanna to pour it outÂ…<br><br>I loved this girl for 2 years; she's the loveliest girl I could ever set my heart upon.<br><br>We got together because both of us were being dumped by our exsÂ… I thot it will only be a short-term companionshipÂ…. But I was very wrongÂ…<br><br>There's this saying that claims first 3 months of courtship is the sweetest of all... but not mine, she was in the bad patch over her ex, and facing with a social stigma over her education path, (she was to be going to uni, but end up quitting her JC due to stress) she took it very badly and I could only carry on with her with my perseverance.<br><br>Many times I wanted to break up with her, but many times, I realised I can't leave her in lurch... Though there wasn't much love for her in the first place, it grew strongly and steadily...<br><br>She ended up going to poly, and became the top student there... when she was invited on stage and told the whole world on stage that she wants to thank her boyfriend for all the support shown... even more than her mum did I put in my effort to guide her, encourage her and even tutored her, I was so proud of herÂ…<br><br>I though I was the luckiest guy on earth. Cos she has never treated a guy as good as me<br>before, willing to peel prawns for me, cook for me n her prospective parents-in-law, looking after my nephew, even going out with my mum to please me and my mum etc.<br><br>I loved her in return, very very much, so much so that I would always rush home just to stay with her to listen to her daily stories, to the expense of my tutorials... I nearly ended up being kicked out by my dean... But I dun mind, cos I know she will always be there supporting meÂ…<br><br>Time fliesÂ… she became very popular in her school, well known among her lecturers and peers. During the 2 yrs of being together, she made me felt the meaning of loved, and the meaning of being lovedÂ…<br><br>Slowly, I took her for grantedÂ… I am not a expressive kind of person, so I dun really know how to sweet-talk or do little sweet stuffs to my gf. Flowers and food are the best I can think out of. I began to boh-chup herÂ… though we still go out very oftenÂ… I never bought her a single flower for a very very long time, cos I was a stingy bastardÂ… And I never complimented on her looks and dresses anymoreÂ… though she is, in the eyes of many ppl, a very confident and chio girlÂ…<br><br>I thought she is definitely mineÂ… How wrong I wasÂ….<br><br>One of her long time friend on IRC went out with her, and told her he like her very much. He is just a winner with honeyed wordsÂ… so she began to like himÂ…<br><br>It was only 3 days ago when suddenly, she wanted a break-upÂ…<br><br>How shocked I was!!!<br><br>Never in my heart have I ever expected thisÂ… It was only after much questioning that I know of this bastard existenceÂ….<br><br>I was very very hurtÂ… To think of all the sacrifices I made for her, the effort I put in, the care and time I invested, the sweat and the bright career I almost forsaken for herÂ…<br><br>But I wonÂ’t blame herÂ… cos I know she is just too in need of attention from others. Something which I never gave herÂ… ItÂ’s all too late nowÂ…<br>All I blamed is that bastard who sweet talked my gf and made us ended up in this situation!!!<br><br>Last night, I went Boat Quay and drank down 1 mug of beer by myself, to drown myself in sorrowÂ… I was never a drinker, and ended up being drunk. Several times I just ended up crying on the middle of the road, cos so much memories were flowing in every place I went. Luckily my friends were there to console me, to look after me in case I was drunkÂ…<br><br>Today, I went to visit her. She said the reason is that she couldnÂ’t find any direction in this relationship, and that she needs to be mentally prepared in order to aim for the top student position every year.<br><br>She told me to wait for her for 3 more years, till the day I graduateÂ…<br>She said she isnÂ’t that foolish to give up on this relationship just bcos of that jerk.<br><br>I was very happy, yet very sadÂ… cos she wanted us to be just close friendsÂ… If only I could just forget the memories we shared together, cos everywhere I went, I just see us happily laughing away silly on the streetsÂ… the food we shared, the games we bought and played together, the Â“Xiao XinÂ” cartoons we enjoyed very much, the groceries we bought together to cook togetherÂ… All thisÂ… so very precious to meÂ…<br><br>But I believe that she will keep her wordsÂ…<br><br>Why?<br><br>Cos I just believeÂ… </blockquote>Hi everybody...<br><br>Just want to update everyone....<br><br>For the past one month, I tried my best to woo her back. I cajoled, begged, cried, buy stuffs... but to no avail...<br><br>Almost every night, I cried myself to sleep.... I tried all kinds of ways and means ro woo her, but in the end, she blocked my e-mail address and cut off her handphone...<br><br>I will never forget that night when I asked her out for the last time (after we broke off). I asked her if its possible that she would wait for me till I graduate? She told me possible, but never gave me a confirmed answer. I was very confused..<br><br>I took her to the Turkish restuarant at Shaw Tower. There, I looked at her and just wept quietly... cos the thought that I would never see her again just saddened me... I dun noe why, but I just felt a premonition...<br><br>I told her to hug my hand to show how much she still love me... She hugged very tightly....<br>She looked so beautiful that night under the soft glow of the candlelight....<br><br>I wanted to take her to sit on the bumboat which was how we spent our 1st valentine Day... But, Heaven wills that it starts to rain before we even start going...<br><br>In the end, I have to send her home. When she got back, she was very tired n just went straight to bed. I sat by her side, gently stroking her hair, staring at her lovely face, and silently wept... with my tears gently dripping on her shirt... while thinking why must I ever have to let go of a woman whom I wanted to marry...<br><br>I told her quietly while she is sleeping, that all I have done is the purest form of love to her... I am not a sweet-talker, I never will... I wondered if she had listen to what I said...<br><br>An sms beeped... I read it. It was that guy, the bastard who stole the woman whom I wanted to spend my life with...<br><br>I thought since there isn't much chance anymore so I replied back asking him to take care of my girl should she chose him in the end... I also told him 10 things she loves in her man... I dun know why suddenly, I just became self-sacrificial...<br><br>Few days later... I sent her an e-mail... but somehow, I sensed she blocked my e-mail address or never bother to reply. I felt strange but took no further action. 2 days after that, she sms me to ask me to cancel her hp line...<br><br>I was very shocked! Why? I called her up n the reply I got is that she wanted to start her life afresh again.... I felt devasted... I really felt devasted.... That's too cruel of her....<br><br>But I told her and myself, if she really love me, pls tell me when she's attached...or I will wait for as long as she wants. She never replied....<br><br>Yesterday night, her friend sms me telling me she saw my beloved girl holding hands with a guy who's shorter, plumper and bespecatcled. How shocked I was!!!<br><br>I thought she would hv told me the truth at least... when's she attached... I just couldnt bear it and ended up weeping on the MRT....<br><br>Every night when I came home after a weary day at school, I would look up at my block and see a window brightly lit... I knew she's at home safe and sound... at least I know she's only 20 m away form me physically... cos she lives upstairs....<br><br>If she ever read this thread, I hope to tell her I wish her happiness... perhaps that guy is better than me...<br><br>At least once... I believed she really loved me with all my heart...<br><br>Why?<br><br>Cos I just believe...<br><br></div>

If you really love her so much then spend more time on your studies..get good results, a good job and then when you're all financially stable and capable - to try for her again.<br><br>If she's already taken then - just take it as fate that you're not meant to be with her. On the other hand - if she's still unattached then, at least at your new status, you'd be giving her more reason to choose you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes, human (not just women) wants to have someone that can and will love them deeply.  They may not feel much for that person showing all the love but being humans, it feels good to know that someone is always out there for you and will be there for you once you call for it.<br><br>Personally I feel that you should let go.  Of course she can't bear to let go of you totally as after all, you are all that nice to her.  But the fact that she can be with someone that fast after she left you shows that things are really not meant to be for the 2 of you all.<br><br>Let go...breathe some fresh air...go date other girls...and see if you can forget her and let go.<br><br>The hardest thing to do is not to hold on to something that hurts...but rather, to let go of it.<br><br>Reality bites but we don't live in a fairtale world.</div>

He took it for granted that it was not neccessary to tell me that I looked great or that he appreciated me for taking time out to go with him to wherever he liked or for cooking for him.<br><br>I don't know you and I don't know her but I am a woman too.

I did threatened her.. in fact I was on the very verge of shaming her in her school for all the things she has hurt me after what I had done for her....<br><br>But in the end, it was the chanting of a Buddhist chant that calms me down n helps me to realise that to hurt her means I have never even loved her in the beginning....<br>I chose to let go of my hatred...<br>Somehow, I think I <strong>know </strong>you....<br><br>you are right, I did wanted to take revenge on her, but in the end, I chose to let go.... Do not think its very very easy to let go of a person whom you put in all ur feelings to it, even if I never express myself of her things she done...<br><br>I am a action-oriented guy, not a expressive guy. Having a less than others sense of expression isn't my fault. It's inborn in me...<br><br>Still, the very action of letting her go even when I could have my best chance of revenge proves my affection. If you think that just by peeking into sms means the whole relationship MUST go down, may I ask you.....<br><br>How many guys or gals here can SWEAR they never did, even if its a harmless peak???</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Enough has been said but well IMHO, trust between a couple is very important.  Trust is always given freely or rather should be given freely but once received, it should never be taken for granted.  When you think that you are beginning to doubt your partner, ponder for a moment if you are being over sensitive.  Take a breather...go out and have some fresh air.  If you feel that your partner doesn't seem to trust you, ask yourself if you have given him/her any cause for doubts.  If your conscious is clear, perhaps you should also ask yourself if you have given him/her reasons to trust you.<br><br>Trust is important between couples.  I once had a gf that betrayed my trust over and over again but I gave her chances and I often closed one eye to her antics.  But end of the day, I was in pain.  Friends (my friends, our mutual friends and her friends) questioned me all the time if it's worth my while showing so much love for her.  Well my ex tells me that if I love her I should trust her.  But she had lied to me and end of the day when we broke up, she was still lying about things.  I had made many great sacrifices to be with her and of which I will not recount here but my point is, YES YOU SHOULD TRUST YOUR PARTNER BUT WHILE TRUST IS GIVEN FREELY, BOTH PARTIES HAVE A PART TO PLAY.  TRUST IS GIVEN MOST OF THE TIME AND SELDOM DO WE REALLY EARN THE TRUST BUT TRUST IS THROW OUT OF THE WINDOW BY US MOST OF THE TIME COS WE FAILED TO LIVE UP TO THE TRUST.<br><br>End of the day, to love is to be loved and to be loved is to love with all your heart and with all your soul.  Being in love shouldn't be painful.<br><br>Cutecuteboy, I suggest you move on.  She's not worth one moment of your time anymore.  The truth is, she's tired of you.  All the things she said about wanting you to wait for her and stuff, well in my opinion she is just treating you as a spare tyre.<br></div>
