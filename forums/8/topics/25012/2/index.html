Yes it's not going to be easy but then again, no one said it would be so.  But remember this, you are living your life for yourself and not to prove anything to her.  What goes round comes round.  I believe in retribution.  Just forget about her and move on.</div>

Pure entertainment?? If that girl truly loves me, perhaps she shld write to me explaining in details what exactly happen.<br>Remembeer trust breeds trust?? yeah...

So that when u bumped into her in the streets one day, make her realise what she had been missing and how u are enjoying life without her. That would be the sweetest revenge.<br><br>best of luck!<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Hey friend... Dun need to slam me till like that lah... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I also understand its kinda stoopid for me to let her go so late.<br>But I really do loved her, and I think its also not appropriate for me not to ignite some passion into our relationship....<br><br>But I guess all is lost already.<br>Nvm... luckily I still have quite alot of friends and a whole bright future for me to look toward to..<br><br>Thanks anyway, though you sounded mean... but I sure appreciate it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Enough good advices and opinions on this thread and MORE than enough rubbish crap in this thread too.<br><br>Enough said, if a woman or a man have a change of heart....they can have one thousand and one excuses for leaving but the fact remains that he/she has a change of heart.  Excuses can only 'beautify' the breakup but it's still a breakup.  If he or she truly loves you and wants to be with you...there can be one thousand and one excuses to leave you but he/she will not do that.<br><br>End of the day, move on and forget about them.<br><br>Time will heal.  I think I have been through enough crapshessh in love to say that and be convinced in that.  Time will heal.<br><br>End of the day, nothing in this world is worth everything in this world.  Things happen for a reason and if shessh happens and you can't see the reasons why...if you keep thinking that "hey I been so nice blabblabblab...why should all these happen to me...I don't deserve it"...well it doesn't help you thinking all that.<br><br>My advice to you...hardened yourself...be cruel if you have to to others.  People don't deserves to be treated badly...but NOT everybody deserves to be treated nicely.<br><br>Well should you hate your ex then?  I did hate one of my ex. I put in all that I could...feelings, time, money and for her, I even put my career on the line and make a damn freaking big sacrifice that can change the whole course of my life and till this day, I dare not tell anybody because anyone that hears it will think I am either the greatest lover or the greatest idiot. FOR ALL THAT, I GOT DUMPED and her ONLY REASON TO ME IS "Sorry but I can't love you as much as you love me and that's why I must leave you".  Well do I hate her now?  Have I forgiven her? Like I said earlier, time can and will heal everything.  I am no longer angry but I have not forgiven her because there is nothing to forgive anymore.  I hardened my heart and have put her out of my mind.  Now when I look back and think of her, there are no more tears swelling in my eyes.  And everyday I live now is a reminder to myself that I should never be so dumb and put in EVERYTHING.  I am living the mistake I made back then.  God knows how much I got to redeem myself EVERY SINGLE DAY because of the sacrifices I made.  Cuteboy...you have just lost ur heart to her.  There are things worse than just losing a heart and I SHOULD KNOW.  I lost not only my heart but more than that...my career and my livelihood...everything was affected.  But do I blame her now?  I don't.  I only have myself to blame.  Like I said, nothing in this world is worth everything.<br><br>Today I am working real hard to get back my life again.  My heart is hardened yes...but I will open it up again but I will need a very good reason to do it again.  And you cuteboy, you are still a student.  Your life is just beginning.  Move on and stop thinking about her.  Don't be sorry for yourself, don't hate her, don't wish her happiness, DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT HER ANYMORE.  It's history and you should move on.<br><br>It's hard to climb up from a fall.  Sorry to say this bro but you havent done enough or made enough sacrifices for your ex to be whining the way you do.  Like I said, there are things far worse than losing just your heart.  Move on bro.  Nobody said it's going to be easy but nobody said it's impossible.  I done it.  You can too.<br><br>DOn't be so ready to give all your heart to someone again.  The only person worth all that should only be your future wife.  Sometimes you got to learn to be cruel and sometimes you got to give in.  There is a time and place for everything and it's time for you to drop that bitch out of your mind.  Concentrate on your studies.<br><br>Enough said from me too.  Hahaha</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi cuteboy...im not trying to slam u for what happened, really.<br><br>Just that when i read that story of urs...its rather similiar to my case. yes, i was a wuss myself, been there, done that.<br><br>I remembered I waited for my ex the whole nite under her flat (8 f@cking hours just to talk to her) cos i couldn't understand why she wanted a break up, she's mean enuff to ignore my calls completely and suggest a break up thru email.

And it took a while for me to figure that out. I just hope that u don't crack ur head like me, pondering over a lost love.<br><br>Im rather strong with my words in my previous post, cos i dun want u to dwell over those useless memories. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Trust me, some time later, u will realise there's nothing more important to you than yourself.

I knew already all was lost... that's why I can ask the other guy to take good care of my once beloved girl...<br><br>frankly, from my point of view, I did not neglect in the sense I was not around in her presence anymore. I felt that she thinks I neglected her because I did not make sweet things or say sweet nothings to her anymore...<br><br>The fact is, I do say, but I really doesn't want to argue these anymore... I just sincerely hope she made the right choice.<br><br>Thanks anyway...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
