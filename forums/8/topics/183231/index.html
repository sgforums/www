            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Wrote this article for a website sometimes ago while on a mission, decided to improve on it by filling more details.<br><br>1. Desperado - Guys who wan girlfriend badly without actual understanding of real love. Some just break up with old girlfriend then straight away try to find new ones using their "sad cases" to win sympathy. They seriously don't mind looks, weight, race, or nationality, and not even illness! As long as you got a real hole is enough.<br><br>2. Sickos - Guys who wan girls' stuff like used panties, bras, old school uniforms. They like to smell them, wear them and add to their collections.<br><br>3. Bastards - Guys who target on young primary or secondary school girls when they are already super old like 30s to 40s. Their common line is "Love has no age limits".<br><br>4. Sugar Daddies - Guys who got too many spare cash and seeking pleasure (usually target on girls 10 to 20 years younger than them). But it seems a trend that 16 to 20 years girls are hot in demand by them as they are the common ones without income. The age ranges from 28 to 45. It is not surprising sometimes to know that their daughter is as old as the targeted girl.<br><br>5. Scammers - Wolves in sheep clothes. They plot too well to win your trust, heart and even body. They run fast with your money and feelings as well. Sometimes, they tend to be married but they always say they are single and claim that last relationship was donkey years ago. A scammer is the hardest type to catch most of all as he has lots of patience with girls.<br><br>6. Actors - Pretend as girls to intro themselves to other openminded girls. They sometimes act as younger girls so that they can ask the girls naughty questions. But common actors usually have no patience, so they are very likely to let the cat out of the bag.<br><br>7. Gigglo Weaklings - Guys who only interested in older women, and they basically just want to spend women' money without working. Most are good in attacking the spot of loneliness in older ladies. It is not surprise that most of them are blessed with good looks.<br><br>8. CMI* "Hunks" - Guys who think they are so suave and muscular or whatever and that all girls must like them. They tend to add hunk or muslcular or big to their nicks and they commonly own a webcam to show the girls' their muscles and that "precious thing"! Due to the owning of webcams, they are super crazy to web meetings with girls.<br>* CMI= abbreviation for Singlish term "Cannot Make It".<br><br>9. Gonecases - Guys who only have sex in their minds forever, everything they do is related to sex. They are somehow rather the most straightforward guys, as their very first question they ask you is whether you keen to have sex with them or not.<br><br>10. Attention Seekers - Guys who really want people to give attention to them or else they will die like that. They usually advertise themselves in very "creative" way to get the attention of people, such as pasting of song lyrics or asking people silly questions.<br><br>11. Yandao Fling Seekers - Guys who are really goodlooking, got nice cars and good command of English - very popular among girls but they only out for flings and "free of charge" one night stands and no commitment of real love. Their common line is "Let's go for a ride" during wee hours where the sky is dark and the place is empty like graveyard.<br><br>12. Perverts - Guys who only like to chat dirty and do dirty things with girls. Some are good in multi-tasking by trading their "collection" of videos and pictures with others at the same time.<br><br>13. Gays - Do I need to say more? =p Okay. They tend to get smarter by using girl nicks nowadays to get more chatters.<br><br>14. Ah Beng Kias - Guys who can only scold vulgar very fluently such as KNNCB or FU but their English in conversations really turn you off. The most problematic one is their spelling as they are really bad in spelling full words, not to say Han Yu Pin Yin.<br><br>15. Intelligent Scholars - Guys who forever look down on girls, who only seek for intelligent pretty women to match their status before they chat. From ITE? No thanks. Over 50 kg? No thanks. Ugly? No Thanks. Get the meaning?<br><br>16. Boring Dudes - Guys who chat on boring topics such as politics and economics, asking your father, mother or even your pet mouse!<br><br>17. Shy Nerdy Polluted Boys - Guys who just start on becoming a sicko or pervert, they usually chat decent but they try to ask the girls more dirty questions in slower pace as they aren't bold enough to do so.<br><br>18. Lame Jokers - Guys who have group of friends to chat with them in main channel so they don't usually seek private chats. They usually like to tease the girls in main but they are somehow kind-hearted in nature.<br><br>19. "God Sister" Seekers - Guys who are out there finding god sisters but usually with bad motives. Why? Because they can get intimate with god sisters by hugging or kissing them as a god brother. They are very generous with their money on you but they expect you to be generous in letting them to touch you anywhere as well.<br><br>20. Dirty Lobang King - Guys who got many job lobangs, especially those designed for girls. But their motive behind to introduce these jobs are very obvious.<br><br>21. Experienced Weirdos - Guys who are already perverted to an extreme that they want to share their experiences (perverted acts) with certain type of audience such as girls in netball team. They will not response to you when you are not their expected listeners.<br><br>22. Impure Religion Followers - Guys who keep telling their religion stuff and wanting you to join them. They keep telling you that the reasons why you have certain misfortunes are due to the "fact" that you are under the spell of evil spirits or unclean things. They will invite you to have a "Clean Up Process". Don't be surprised when you smell something that makes you fell asleep easily and end up on their beds.<br><br>23. Mr House Friendly - Guys who are very friendly to invite you to their houses for a chat or watch the latest DVD. Their houses are forever pretty and nice especially their beds. When you visit their house, it will be always "Nobody At Home" even if they told you beforehand some of their family members were at home to ease your guard. Their hands start to be "itchy" to move around your body when both of you are in the room (more like traproom).<br><br>24. CareBears - Guys who are very nice, very caring, very understanding and great listeners to your problems. They always try to ask you to come out to give them a chance to "console" you. It is not surprising that the targeted girl may tend to have a nick starting or ending with "Sad" or "Cry".<br><br>By writing this article, it doesn't mean that the whole world of guys are bad to the core or incorrigible. I believe guys are bad by nature no matter how innocent they are. But it really depends on the intelligence of the girls to judge and know which guy is real to them.<br><br>I seriously hope this article can be a valuable tool to all girls out there.</div>

They can still be applied to other areas, even in forums and MSN as well if you bother to realise the patterns.<br><br>Actually, situation gets worse since now got lots of websites like Friendster and WhoLivesNearYou.<br><br>Guys out there get to choose the types of girls they like since they get to see the pictures of the girls and study their profiles. The typical  24 types get into mixture and thus may be harder to identify as well.<br><br>They are more tactical now since their faces are being exposed to the public. But still, the basic rules are still there.<br><br>1) They message the person that they wan to widen their circle of friends.<br>2) They always complain they are very boring thus asking you out.<br>3) They always want to date the girl out alone.<br>4) They treat the girl generously to make them happy.<br>5) They always start to tell the girl they like or love them at first sight.<br>6) They want the girl to be their stead after one or two dates.<br>7) Some may bring them to see their parents also.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Hardly less than a week, they want to touch the girls here and there.<br>9) Hardly less than a forthnight, after the girl has been conned into believeing they are in love with this guy, the guy gets tired of touching and want to do more than that.<br>10) Perhaps a month or later, when they start to get tired of the girl, they start to find new victim and repeat step 1 to 6.<br>11) Then they start to find excuses to dump the old girl.<br>12) Usually when they break up, its not surprised to know the girl is pregnaent already.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>That is what happening now to many girls out there.... and also some of my friends.<br><br>You may think I joking or what.
