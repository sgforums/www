            <div class='col-md body'>nothing we really can do abt it. there are of course, there are some pple who want to move away and this en-bloc thingy is a pretty good chance to do that, you can't say that they are money-hungry, as everyone here(admit it alright) is in a way money-hungry.<br><br>anyway, money really doesn't matter. you have been living there for(17 years??) and before the year of 1997, you must have had a good realtionship with most of the neighbours. as for the community spirit thingy, well, it was kinda of childish of him to say that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting topic Sexguy,<br><br>Must be u only want to talk about things that make ur blood boil...like my post about football...:-)  ha ha...<br><br>No that en bloc sale thing is the shits man.  The problem is that people will be people...and it has nothing to do with community spirit, but more to do with their own selfishness.  Because 3 houses stand in their way of making money, it becomes a very good excuse to say that these 3 don't have good community spirit....aiyah, they're just trying to make things go right for themsleves...that's all that matters...It is the $$$$$ Ka-ching!!!<br><br>And even if it was really about spirit, then why bother giving in anyway because u aren't going to be living in the same community anyway.  Those fools will be living it up with their new money in some other part of town...so what the hell does community spirit have to do with it...<br><br>i say,...the excuses people make when greed and selfishness gets in the way...<br><br>I would have to say that u have the right to stay put, and what about a counter-suit?  Can u do that in singapore?  Sue the bastards for suing u?<br><br>It's too bad u have to leave ur home where u spent so much of ur life in....but blame it on greed and ur "good neigboors"...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>regarding your topic on enbloc sales, you have to agree that there can only be two sides of the argument: firstly, some residents would want to stay put for sentimental reasons, whether be it for fostered friendships or age-old reminiscences. the other side would be that, the windfall that the owner reaps in the event of an enbloc sale. we all know that if a property is older than 10 years, 80% of the residents have to agree before the sale can take place, as compared to 100% (currently) if the property tendered is less than 10 years old. now: 80% of the residents have decided to reap the monetary rewards from a good decision to buy the property years ago. the other 20%, seem to want to do all that want to stop this 80% from making their millions? isn't that a tad selfish? now, one might say that it could take years or friendships and sentimental values aside could well disappear along with the property, but i ask you this: if your friendships are that strong, can't the money, (often at least twice the market value) buy a new residence close to your friends, or enough to bring what sentimental value along with you? not many singaporeans get the chance to make a million dollars or more overnight, and it is a lot of hard work - the people who are against the enbloc sale merely heighten their difficulties and show others how selfish they  are by planting their posteriors firmly on a pot of gold.</div>
