Court also will not make a order so one will land up bankrupt.<br><br>But I see that what you have mentions in this case "Lumpsum Settlement". Also meaning that court sees this man has the abilities to do this. If not he have to prove he cannot. </div></blockquote>That's what I'd wonder too. If the fella has to re-mortgage property to keep his business afloat, obviously his company isn't doing too good . He would have bank documentation and such to show this, right?<br><br>Thing is, can the court really order a lumpsum settlement if the guy has no means to pay? Based on my understanding, these days, lawyers for the women often suggest that their client try to push for lumpsum rather than monthly alimony, esp if they are able to support themselves comfortably and earn more than their husbands.<br><br>I remember someone telling me, too, that if a debt were to be incurred during the marriage, for the benefit of both parties' lifestyles, the wife can be made liable for part of the debt as well?</div>

Even doctor lie to get out of what he did. No shame as been higher educated. A huge shameful soul in him.<br><br>Greed is in everyone, too bad Singapore System sided much on women.

It's the own self need to prove himself/herself is talking the truth. Court have seen too many people lie to get what they want.<br><br>As your case, you have to prove it's not the matrimonial house. She also will try hard to prove that it was both matrimonial house.

            <div class='col-md body'>I would point out that maintenance is usually both parents need to come out an equal sum. Just too many people mis-understood this. Especially women cover their own ass.<br><br>I would point myself as example :<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> I pay $250 maintenance for my 2 kids. It's not just this $250 for both kids. Ex-wife will have to pay at least another $250 for the same 2 kids. Court assumes this becuase she have the custody. That's $500 a month for 2 kids. Is this not enough???? Would says it's enough.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> Too many women cover the second part. So to gain concerns &amp; to cover her own money responsibilities towards the kids. Getting the custody is not only about taking care of the kids. She too need to come out her own $ for the kids. Having custody should be out of love, not saving $.<br><br>And keep shouting it's not enough maintenance?? By the way how much is enough? (Never)<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Too bad my mother-in-law surffer most. She pocketed the $250 maintenance &amp; did not even come out a single cent. I learn this directly from my ex-mother-in-law who personnelly requested me to give her the $ rather then transfering in ex-wife account. I told her I have a court order behind me. Only if she compliant to court that ex-wife did not cover her duty, then the order will change. Else it's her own family problems.<br><br>Maintenance is usually 50% of the total expenditure of the children. Or who ever can pay higher, or the party has the custody pays higher. Bearing in mind that court will try the highest payable maintenance on the payer side first. Because there is options for the payer to reduce it later. Go figure this out.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> My example again:<br>I was ordered to pay $600 a month maintenance for both kids. Meaning $1200 a month from both parents to just 2 kids under 5 years old. Was this extreamly high because court trys me on the highest payable maintenance. Was reduce to $500 immediately after 1 month. Then reduce further to $250. Because she cannot prove 2 kids of under 5 years old could spent that much. Also I proves that I cannot pay that much. Be patient. You can get a reductions with proves. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Court only put husband on the chopping board first. It's fair. You have to protect yourself in court. Even if you loves your wife now &amp; she loves you now, it does not means you won't see her in court for divorce issue in your life. Life is pretty un-expected. Example: "Desperate House Wife".<br><br>I have stated, usually court will tries the husband first. Then the wife. If husband earns $1200 &amp; wife earns $2500. Of course, it's clearly the husband can only pay a small sum for kids maintenance.<br><br>For kids maintenance, it's fair &amp; square for both to parents to pay. Only the husband is put onto the chopping board first that's all. Once husband can proves he cannot pay for higher maintenance, the wife will be "LOOKED INTO". I feel it's fair to some sense.<br><br>Only to suggest to Singapore Court to state clearly on paper that party who has the kid's custody are liable for the other 50% of the total maintenance for the kids. Currently only state on Court's Order how much the paying party pays. If this is been clearly stated how much for both parents, it will clears public's view that maintenance is actually a lot from both parents. Not current views that it only comes from a single paying parents.<br><br>Why age of 7 usually goes to mother? Simple, the "Women's Chapter" says "It' is recommended custody of children goes to mother because of their young age." Only child that is 7 years &amp; above &amp; mental able that can stand in Court to choose his/her own custody parents. Usually kids more then 7, court chooses that party who have more $ &amp; supports (Like Own house, company...)<br><br>For cases where kids are under 7, because of the above mentions in "Women's Chapter" it's usually goes to the mother. Except if there are proves that mother is "violent in nature", "will harm kids", "Insane", "Handicap", "Medical Reasons", "Unable to take care kids (Example Jail)" or she gives up the custody.<br><br>Example of above:<br>1) Mother have tried to commited suicide.<br>2) have consulted doctors for insane reasons, Medical Reasons, Dieases ....<br>3) Post Natal mood swing.<br>4) Actual incidents that she have harm the kids.<br>5) Handicap is pretty clear cut.<br>6) serving jail terms or having an on-going that will bear jail terms<br><br>Under a more moral views: Mother single handed to take care kid(s) is not a easy job. Kid(s) is also a burden for re-marriage. It's constainly reminding her of the failed marriage. Takes up most of her time. Have much more worries for them in everything, even worry weather they have enough for that dinner. I can tell you, many divorcee(espically women) regretted to divorce deeply inside their heart.<br><br>I would highlight that lossing custody is not lossing your kids. You still have your rights to sue his/her ass big time if kids was not properly taken care. Court &amp; police takes this pretty seriously because custody is granted base on love towards the kids. Once abuse, police will also sue his/her big time.<br><br>Custody of kids means the basic physical living stuff of the kids only. Like which schools to go to, live where .... so so Nothing that can over rule the child's life. You are their parent by birth, it's a life time relationship. No court order can change this. As long as you have love &amp; provide time &amp; support your kids, your kids loves you back. It's no custody or court order can change this. Only Love. Also wife &amp; husband's relationship can broken, not Parent &amp; child relationship.<br><br>Only if you allow your relationship with your kids to broken down, not court order can. I know some may only have limited assess to the kids because of violent issues. Do you know this also can be change if your apply for more access toward your kids? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>

Once abuse, police will also sue his/her big time.<br><br>Custody of kids means the basic physical living stuff of the kids only. Like which schools to go to, live where .... so so Nothing that can over rule the child's life. You are their parent by birth, it's a life time relationship. No court order can change this. As long as you have love &amp; provide time &amp; support your kids, your kids loves you back. It's no custody or court order can change this. Only Love. Also wife &amp; husband's relationship can broken, not Parent &amp; child relationship.<br><br>Only if you allow your relationship with your kids to broken down, not court order can. I know some may only have limited assess to the kids because of violent issues. Do you know this also can be change if your apply for more access toward your kids? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>

There is always a divorce paper to counter react marriage certificate.<br><br>Protect yourself even if you have a perfect marriage.<br><br>Luckily I did protect myself. How to protect yourself?<br><br>1) If you are paying the house hold items, pay from your personnal account &amp; keep all receipt.<br>2) Do proper filing for all your house hold receipt. Easier way, use GIRO. It's recorded in the bank account.<br>3) There is no reason if wife is working &amp; not supporting the family. I am talking fairness between both sex where all women are shouting.<br>4) if you want to give your partner a large sum of $, transfer by bank account. Using only personnel account transfered to personnel account.<br><br>Doing this may not feels good in a relationships. There are always proper reasons for doing so, like "Both should have personal space." "Receipt Book keeping is healthy for family $ control." "It's dangerous to handle large sum of cash. Better transfer by the bank." "Family is both partner to support. It's responsibilities &amp; commitment towards a healthy family"<br><br>If you don't cover your own ass, nobody will do for you in court.<br><br>Tell all a joke:<br><br>Chinese says "Lau Po" (old wife) it's basically means Old liao then is truely your wife. Young wife also need public attention sometimes.<br><br>Chinese says "Chang Fu" (Yard Husband) Basically Means within a Yard distant then he truely feels is your husband.
