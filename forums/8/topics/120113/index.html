            <div class='col-md body'>Reasons to bring this up is to clear up a lot of doubts &amp; too many are making use of laws to hurt the husband's or wife's. Be fair. I know this will raise a lot of issues.<br><br>Many do not know how to survive the maintenance issue. Know the rules better for you.<br><br>Each child monthly maintenance lowest is about $300. This amount is provided by both parents. 50% each. It's fair. For the women side, actually not a big amount to be expected. If she work during the family, expect about $100 or less. Reason being she can support herself &amp; not being a burden of the husband in the future. If she did not work, then it's a case by case issue. Usually court will order her to go work. So women cannot just seat back &amp; suck from her ex-husband's salary. This is fair also.<br><br>I will throw some points here. I myself have sucessfully reduced maintenance 2 times from $600 per month to $250 per month for wife &amp; 2 kids. How I manage to do that.<br><br>First : Good record. I take my steps to do it. For the first year I pay faithfully $500 per month for everything. On date, not a single cent less or a single day delay.<br><br>Second: Keep all receipt spend on kids, also the bank's record when transfer your maintenance.<br><br>Third: Write down whatever your expense per month. Most forget to add in is to mainten your own parents, your insurance policy, your food, Hair cut, Clothes, phone bill,  petrol or transport fee, PUB bills, medical bill is any, Dental, TV &amp; radio licence fee, Town Council fee, Course fee if you are attending, Loans you are paying, Maintenance for current wife/girlfriend, savings for your own wedding (second marriage), add in a small amount for other misc items .... But everything must be logically sensible amount &amp; best if supported with actual receipt (No Photostated)<br><br>Fourth: if driving, downsize you car or state reasons why you cannot sell. Example market value too low would be selling with debt. State out how much. Best if some car re-sale company can offer a written letter to estimate your vehicale. Or it's a company needed car. Or best still ride a bike. Myself ride a small bike so there is no argument at all.<br><br>Fifth: consolidate all informations on a written letter, (Hand written). Including your pay slip, CPF statment, Bank account book (Updated), whatever tax or expenses you paid, medical statement. State that your case is sincere &amp; have been faithfully paying maintenance on time for the pass "X" months. You still loves you kids &amp; will support them faithfully. Then go for the review. You must be reasonable in your case. Remember time is on your side. Don't go for review often, once per year it's ok. As long as you pay your maintenance faithfully your words weights more.<br><br>What they may ask?<br>Can you change a higher paid job? Can you reduce your expenses? What is the amount you can afford to pay? Prepare for all these questions. Think for your kids when answering these.<br><br>Basically the maths is : Income - total logical expense = If greater then $150 per child you pay this amount, if smaller then you pay whatever you can.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>I have been ask weather I can go to work as a constructions worker. I told them I have medical reasons, I can go work but I request that my ex-wife be responsible for me if I am injure. Medical reason was confirmed my ex-wife.<br><br>Hope I have raise a BIG issues. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

You want the custody you come out more effort simple fact but not many people especially women can understand. Not being a $ sucker on the other party. Will you follow directions of smaller share partners when you the bigger share in a company? Sure not. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> Bigger shares have the say.<br><br>Having Custody should be out of love not any other reasons. Sadly too often custody &amp; maintenance are been mis-use to harm the other party. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Too often people not been thru divorce don't understand how it feels. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Also too often 1 party keeps the kids from seeing the other parent.

            <div class='col-md body'>o...i dare not say often men are those who have extramarital affair now..but usually, they are the ones. They probably just cant be bothered to fight for the custody of the kids so they rather just pay for the sake of paying.<br>well... kids ranges from 1mth to 21yrs old. Parents ARE suppose to with hold the responsibilty to make sure kids have "average" lifestyle...go to sch. For $300,they probably will lose out to those normal kids with dad! That mere $300 cant even replace daddy's love. O...for goodness sake, for $300, think these kids wont even open their mouth to call them dad. How many of them will do it? Maybe next time when they realise their "DAD" are only paying $300 per month for their daily expenses.<br>Money is going to depreciate.Living expenses is going to increase again. Think about that, next time when u r old n haggard, u nid money. Will your kids give u $300 per month then?<br><br>Dream on<br></div>

I myself have sucessfully reduced maintenance 2 times from $600 per month to $250 per month for wife &amp; 2 kids. How I manage to do that.<br><br>First : Good record. I take my steps to do it. For the first year I pay faithfully $500 per month for everything. On date, not a single cent less or a single day delay.<br><br>Second: Keep all receipt spend on kids, also the bank's record when transfer your maintenance.<br><br>Third: Write down whatever your expense per month. Most forget to add in is to mainten your own parents, your insurance policy, your food, Hair cut, Clothes, phone bill,  petrol or transport fee, PUB bills, medical bill is any, Dental, TV &amp; radio licence fee, Town Council fee, Course fee if you are attending, Loans you are paying, Maintenance for current wife/girlfriend, savings for your own wedding (second marriage), add in a small amount for other misc items .... But everything must be logically sensible amount &amp; best if supported with actual receipt (No Photostated)<br><br>Fourth: if driving, downsize you car or state reasons why you cannot sell. Example market value too low would be selling with debt. State out how much. Best if some car re-sale company can offer a written letter to estimate your vehicale. Or it's a company needed car. Or best still ride a bike. Myself ride a small bike so there is no argument at all.<br><br>Fifth: consolidate all informations on a written letter, (Hand written). Including your pay slip, CPF statment, Bank account book (Updated), whatever tax or expenses you paid, medical statement. State that your case is sincere &amp; have been faithfully paying maintenance on time for the pass "X" months. You still loves you kids &amp; will support them faithfully. Then go for the review. You must be reasonable in your case. Remember time is on your side. Don't go for review often, once per year it's ok. As long as you pay your maintenance faithfully your words weights more.<br></div></blockquote>Huh? Maintenance for a girlfriend?

My understanding of the WC for a variation to an existing maintenance order is that the courts will only vary it if the applicant is able to show a material change in his circumstances or if he is getting married again.  The ex-wife can also apply to increase the maintenance order as the child gets older and requires more contribution towards necessities like education, isn't it?</div>

Too many falls into the trap that after marriage you trust the other party 100%. Marriage is a legal paper only, it does not equal to trust even till into old age. Best is to keep separate account. Marriage is not everything together, there is a divorce paper anytime.<br><br>I feel sad for you .... My recommendations for you: She can do want ever she likes. You first must hold your patients. Don't proceed to divorce. Drag the case. Try to earn as much $ as possible. Also try to reduce maintenance in the proper &amp; legal way. Don't let her change the surname of your kid. If she is holding Taiwan Passport she may have problems with a Singaporean kids to travel with a different surname. If she don't grant you to see the kids, you can give your monthly maintenance to your lawyer until she rsponse to you. Or there is no written letter back from her, you can write to local Singapore ambassy for help. It's a long run, you need to take care for yourself. Another faster way, use $ to buy over the custody but talk in private only.<br><br>First: People will wake up after a number of years of fighting. Your child was given to both by nature. Even if both cannot be together, your child is still belongs to both of you. Walk along this path. I am sure the Judge will see it.<br><br>Second: If your ex-wife is over 30 or close to 30, 95% she will want to re-married fast. Women ages pretty fast after 30. With a child, it's not doing any good. (That's why time is on your side)<br><br>Thirdly: If she does not have the abilities to support or takecare of the kid, in the long run, she will tried out &amp; hand over the kid to you willingly. To run her down even faster, find ways to reduce maintenance &amp; try to get evidence that she hurt the child or mis-treat the child.<br><br>Fourth: Your kid should be taking injections to prevent some dieases. Bang on this. If she is too busy &amp; heart not with the kid, it's pretty easy to over-look. Also on the look out for "SARS" or public sickness in Taiwan. You can raise a issue of health care of your kids to root her in Singapore. Just only logical issue, don't talk nonsense in court.<br><br>Fifth: Don't sign any divorce papers, always tell court that both are in discussion. Working on "something", drag the time (Run her down of $). Really too bad even divorce, MONEY also plays a important part.<br><br>My ex-wife was beating my daughter when maintenance was reduced, which cause her a lot of problems. I bought my daughter to K.K. Women &amp; Child hospital upon access my kids. Those scares makes the doctor &amp; police call her immediately. And she temporary lost her custody to the kids because of this.</div>

It can goes up. But it does not look good in the first place. If the party that have the custody is asking for higher $, it's shows he/she is nearing in capable of $ supporting the kids. Not good. Also  in the mind of court he/she without custody may re-marrys, have sickness, unemployment...... just too many situations to have a Variations Order to lower maintenance. Bear in mind, without custody have much more freedom which in turns much higher chance to re-marry faster. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>There are two major factor tojuge maintenance:<br>First: reasonable total expenses of kids &amp; wife.<br>Second: How much that paying party can pay.<br><br>My ex-wife requested $600 only for kids(2) nursery school fee. It's a pretty good school. $345 per month for a child school fee. In the eyes of the court, it's good for kids to have this, but it's not at the expenses of the paying party. Just one reason I told, "If I have the custody, I can let the kids study in a $5000 per month school &amp; let her pay $4000 of that school fee. Then I will be a better parent to have custody of the kids." The court trys me by "You can go earn a higher salary job?" I said "I have medical reason for some jobs. I am able to submit my medical report in 3 weeks time. She can work 2 jobs to help since she wants the best for the kids, I am sure she don't mind taking 2 jobs for the kids?"  Court ask her "How much she earns?" She replied "$600 per month for part-time sales, I am part-time studying."  Court sees her un-reasonable.<br><br>If she were to request just $200 for school fee, it's a difference story.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is interesting, Surfer. Perhaps it's just maintenance issues that one can play around with bec of the time factor. I've been told that at the initial stages, the court can order something as unreasonable as this scenario: man share a small business operation with a sibling, his property (shared with a sibling but used as  his matrimonial home) is re-mortgaged to secure loan for their business. The wife holds a high paying job. The court can and will order that the man sell his property to pay his ex-wife's lumpsum settlement, despite the fact that this will essentially mean his business, his bread and butter, folds.

What you have mentions, the man should raise his problems. Like if he sells his property, he will be in great debt or made a bankrupt because of the re-loan. He "MUST" prove this. Court also will not make a order so one will land up bankrupt.<br><br>But I see that what you have mentions in this case "Lumpsum Settlement". Also meaning that court sees this man has the abilities to do this. If not he have to prove he cannot.</div>

I use to believe in Singapore justice system... now I only can say it is worth nothing to me.<br><br>The values taught in school and upbringing doesn't holds.
