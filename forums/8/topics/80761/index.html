            <div class='col-md body'>From the Strait Times webby:-<br><br>Breaking wind: clearing the (foul) air<br><br>THE technical name for flatulence is 'flatus', or 'rectal gas'. It is actually intestinal gas released via the rectum, referred to also as 'fart' or 'cutting the cheese'.<br><br>Gas gets into our digestive system in various ways: by swallowing air, which accounts for very little; production within the intestinal tract, which accounts for a lot; and diffusion from the blood.<br><br>The gas that is diffused from the blood is mainly nitrogen and constitutes part of the rectal gas.<br><br>Gas is usually removed from our body via belching and breaking wind.<br><br>Each time a person swallows food or liquid, he swallows some air. The more frequently a person swallows, the greater the amount of air entering the stomach.<br><br>Most air that is swallowed comes out the way it went in. Hence, everyone belches occasionally, often after eating. Since the stomach does not produce air or gas on its own, belching is simply the release of swallowed air from the stomach.<br><br>To find out more about flatulence, we have to understand how our intestinal tract works.<br><br>Solid food and liquid travel down our throat to the stomach via the oesophagus or gullet.<br><br>In the stomach, food is churned into small pieces, partially digested, and then emptied into the small intestine.<br><br>How quickly the stomach empties varies, but generally, it happens in one to two hours after eating. The small intestine gently contracts, moving these food fragments down the intestinal tract.<br><br>Digestion and absorption of the food substances continue in the small intestine. Here, amino acids, glucose, minerals, vitamins and other nutrients are absorbed.<br><br>The indigestible liquid waste then reaches the large intestine, or the colon. Here, much of its water is reabsorbed, leaving behind the more solid stool.<br><br>Flatus is gas produced as a result of bacterial activity in the colon, which has hundreds of different bacteria growing in it. These bacteria live peacefully there and provide certain positive health benefits to the body.<br><br>In other words, they are harmless and cause no problems. They rely on the indigestible food we eat for their own nutrition.<br><br>Certain foods are more likely to cause certain types of bacteria to thrive. Some of these bacteria are called 'gas formers'.<br><br>Gas-forming bacteria generally feed on three nutrients: carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Carbohydrates produce the most gas.<br><br>If the amount of carbohydrates is reduced or eliminated from the diet, rectal gas or flatus can usually be reduced significantly.<br><br>An individual's response to certain foods is also a factor in producing rectal gas. Two people eating the same amount of the same carbohydrate can produce different amounts of rectal gas.<br><br>On average, we have about 14 'toots' per day. How often they happen do not seem to be determined by gender, age or the ability of an individual's colonic flora.<br><br>What about the noise? What makes some people break wind loudly?<br><br>Contrary to popular belief, the sound is not due to the flapping of the butt!<br><br>It is produced by the vibrations of the anal opening.<br><br>The loud toots are basically a result of three things - the volume of gas, the force and velocity with which it is expelled, and the tightness of the anus' sphincter muscles.<br><br>The presence of haemorrhoids and other anatomical features that could resonate also affects the sound.<br><br>People with large haemorrhoids, for example, will sound off louder than people with lax anal sphincter muscles.<br><br>Vegetarians, who actually pass out a lot of gas, would be quieter because they have large, bulky stool and looser sphincters. Their breaking wind will be detected socially only if what they let off is foul-smelling.<br><br>Carnivores may have less gas but, since they have tighter anal sphincter muscles and may be more constipated, their toots could be high drama!<br><br>Studies have shown that the actions related to flatulence - contractions of the colon, together with a rise in pressure in the rectum and early relaxation of the anal sphincter - are similar to those observed after swallowing, believe it or not!<br><br>Assistant Professor Diana Ang<br>National Institute of Education<br>Nanyang Technological University<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The art of farting is practiced by many, perfected by few. Perfecting the art of farting is a somewhat long, difficult but rewarding road to travel down. It is the symphony of foods and body function that causes this reaction we all long to occur. This guide teaches you the methods and mind set used by some of the worlds leading fartology organizations.<br><br>1. Your mood will play a major role in farting. Having an "I can't do it!" frame of mind will not accomplish anything. When it comes down to those final moments when its release or hold time, you just have to repeat again and again, "Just let it happen... its ok..."<br><br>2. Diet is another heavy influencer. If you're a grazer (or vegetarian as they preferred to be called) you're partly on your way. If you're older and are using shit assistance substances such as prune juice, you too have a good start. The real winners are your average North American men. Statistically Sunday is prime time nation wide for fart releases. Not only fart releases, but the cream of the crop, wake up the neighbors farts. Why is this? Have a look at the diet of a typical American male aged between 20 and 30 watching football on TV... Peanuts, chips, beer, can someone say, fart city? Its about evaluating your diet, removing the foods that don't assist farting, and focusing on the ones that do.<br><br>3. Important, yet largely unexplored scientifically is the fart event position and location. These two variables can make or break a fart taking it from a stellar world class event, down to an unmentionable discouragement. Try telling a world class pianist that they must perform standing, or telling a tuba player he must lay down during their performance. Farting is no different, it requires positioning that best maximizes the bodies ability to expel gas. Location of the fart event sets the scene and adds emotions such as amusement (elevator farts), excitement (bus farts) and challenge (church farts). Lets travel forth and delve into the world of position and location...<br><br>Leg Lift "Elevator" Position<br>Standing upright with a slight curve to the back, lift either leg (almost like doing the jig, except with your leg off to the side - never to the front) and allow the fart event to occur. This one is by far the most popular. Ranked best position for elevator farts for its ability to expel farts quickly and accurately between floors. The signature of a leg lifter in an elevator is the smile of glee on their face as they exit, as you unknowingly enter.<br><br>Pros: Amusement of only being able to guess how many floors the unknowing new occupants must endure. High buildings that you will most likely not visit again are a bonus.<br><br>Cons: After a successful execution of the fart, you leave the elevator and the unknowing others enter, which is fine. However, you realize you are on the wrong floor and must re-enter the same elevator. Truly a bad call.<br><br>"Imperial" Throne Position<br>Just a reminder that your mind associates this position with a lack of bodily control. This one involves sitting, squatting or bending down into a huddled position. Some of the worlds most fermented and catastrophic farts were achieved using this very position. Think of it as a game of leap frog, but without the leaping (or at least voluntarily).<br><br>Pros: Incredible leverage, captures the true potential of the fart.<br><br>Cons: Similar to when taking a shit, which could confuse mind and cause "dyer" consequences. This one in the car in a new suit on route to a job interview is not recommended.<br><br>Wal-Mart Fart Position<br>There have been so many reports of this position and its success of creating "brown air" that have won it accolades world wide. Shop as you normally would at Wal-Mart. Locate a desired purchase (at least the weight of say, a clothes detergent box) at the bottom shelf in an unoccupied isle. As you are lifting the heavy load in a squatting position, let the magic happen. You will be pleasantly surprised. At first you may point out the similarities to the throne position, but you will be in awe by what the additional weight load achieves. Weight lifters doing squats after a heavy meal know how well weight can affect fartage potency and volume.<br><br>Pros: Due to the narrow, almost encapsulating design of the isles, farts can remain lingering for hours after initial production. Many more people can enjoy their shopping due to your efforts versus the leg lift position.<br><br>Cons: Eager and usually frantic discount shoppers change isles with a furor only matched by 9am shoppers at a department store boxing day blow out sale. This can result in a by standard surprise attack and the very terrible mission abort consequence.<br><br>Power Arching<br>Lean your hands onto a counter top or table (or if available, hang onto your towel rack) while arching your back. If this is difficult for you to visualize, think back to your last visit to the car repair shop. Similar to the "ass pounding" position you take when getting the quote to have your car's transmission replaced. Power arching is excellent for "customer service" counters at department stores; local Radio Shack stores when reaching over and examining an expensive and ridiculous keychain that has a flashlight, time telling in 12 languages, compass and calculator all in one; a supermarket you do not usually visit.<br><br>Pros: The arching of the back allows your power conduit to be fully utilized. Less conspicuous than the Throne Position.<br><br>Cons: A warning to people with small houses or apartments: power arching in the small confines of a room in your house has been known to cause carpet, wall and even ceiling damage. Even more so, lasting damage to newly blossoming relationships with girlfriends and not so blossoming marriages.<br><br>All positions and locations have their pros and cons, it is the duty of an aspiring fart master to leverage the situations and environments available to him or her. With a bit of thoughtful planning you can start off the day with some power arching in the library; do a bit of leg lifting at the food court for lunch; and wind up the day with an all out assault on your senses with a satisfying throne position fart in the car on the way home. Remember, its all about position, location and a "can-do" attitude!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
