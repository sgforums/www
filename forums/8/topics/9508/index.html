            <div class='col-md body'>I used to think that perhaps I needed some serious anger management classes. I've recently been talking to some people about this and I found out that I'm not the only person with gaming angst. Wouldn't you know it, there is an entire virtual population of frustrated people out there just waiting to snap at any given moment. It is the venting of this gaming frustration that so many of us share that often leads to some very menacing comments and hurtful remarks. I've seen people lose their game accounts on Ultima Online, Asheron's Call and other online games because of this. After looking back later, they must realize that if they had just stood up and walked out of the room, they would have been able to return to the games they so loved to play.<br>A couple of years ago I began playing Ultima Online and until this time I really thought I knew frustration. I thought frustration was an old friend of mine. Little did I know that Ultima Online was about to school me in the new and improved ways of frustration. It was at this point in my gaming career when I was introduced to what I like to refer to as 'lag frustration.' Nothing says lovin' like being hacked to pieces by creatures or other players while you flee for your pitiful life in slow motion because you're lagged, literally, to death. I found myself in situations such as this many times where I've had to physically stand up and exit the room for fear of tossing my beloved computer out a seventeen story window.<br><br>Now, I'd like to consider myself a video game veteran. I'm one of those people who remember playing Missle Command on the Atari 2600 for hours on end. I remember marveling over the graphics on our brand new ColecoVision console. I mean, Donkey Kong was done so well that you could actually tell the various fruits apart! Well, obviously a lot of time has passed since then and through all of the various video games I've played, from Space Invaders to Sacrifice, one thing has remained the same: I hate losing. It is this desire of mine to win that has caused many long nights without sleep. It is this same desire that has drawn me to levels of frustration that few humans have ever been able to provoke. Broken game controllers, tables tipped over, the poor family dog kicked and siblings being growled at menacingly are but a few results of my desire not to lose.<br><br>People who don't play the games simply don't understand. The situation is quite similar to that of a drug addict. At that one point in time, nothing else is more important than the high, the feeling, the game. You become loath to pull yourself away from it and thoughts such as keeping a nice handy cup next to you to avoid potty breaks enter your head. At one point in time this became such a problem for me that I almost lost my relationship of two years. After playing Ultima OnCrack... err Online for so long I finally made the transition to Asheron's Crack, doh! I mean Call. I remember the evening well.<br><br>She walked out of the bedroom in a beautiful dress, hair done, smelling sweet and fresh. I hardly noticed as I furiously rushed back to my corpse to retrieve my quest Hoary Mattekar Robe. "I'm ready to go," she said. I began my violent protest in a futile effort to explain to her, "...how important this piece of eq is! It can't be replaced!". Yadda yadda, and then I saw that look in her eyes. There it was, the look she never used unless she was serious beyond words. Something inside of me snapped. For the brief span of a few seconds I stood outside myself looking on, listening to my words, watching my actions, seeing my face, seeing hers. How pathetic I had become, how lost. How ironic. In an instant I was back inside my own body mind. Suddenly, the game wasn't as important anymore. I didn't even bother logging out that night. I simply reached down and pressed the power switch on the computer, stood and took her hand in mine. Her smile and that look was all the reward I'd ever need.<br><br>Many times in the past I've been able to help those who are plainly suffering from gaming frustration. They don't think they are afflicted with it at the time. They feel at the time that whatever is causing their gaming frustration may very well cause the end of the world as we know it. Of course this isn't true, and if people can begin to recognize this epidemic for what it is, we may be able to cut down on the amount of gaming frustration in the world today. Most people are genuinely good until you put them in front of a video game. After that point, it is anything goes. Remember, sometimes it is important to keep in mind, that it is after all "just a game".<br><br>Just a game.<br>By: Michael Oliver<br>10/09/2000<br><br></div>

Gamers will know. Games which allows you to interact with other people. Back a while then, I was pretty addicted to this game so call, Counter-Strike. Everyday, I spend at least 4 hours to a max of 8 hours on it. It seems that games can really take away the life of many. Granted that we only have 24 hours a day, gosh, if I play a max of 8hours game a day, I live 1/3 of my life to play game.<br><br>On another note, something totally unbelievable happened to my friend. Happened that he was pretty addicted to a game, and on that very day, he was playing the game while his girlfriend was at his home. Of course his girlfriend was very upset to see him playing game so much and asked him, "You want your game or me?" and he told his girlfriend 2 word, "Fuck off!". Of course he regretted what he said then but what has happened could not be change and he never managed to win back his love's heart.<br><br>Now, are games more of a hobby or is it more of a drug? I wonder.</div>
