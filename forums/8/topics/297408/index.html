            <div class='col-md body'>Interview with a priest of nazarne church :<br><br>) You have just dropped quite a bombshell! Was not the Holy Grail supposed to be a goblet? Can you elaborate?<br><br>A) We have all heard of The Holy Grail. Most think of it as a goblet that held the blood of Christ shed upon the cross. This goblet was said to hold the presence of Christ and have mystical powers. But consider the following: would not a child of Jesus and the Magdalene be a vessel filled, quite literally, with the blood of Christ? The most ancient stories of the Grail call it by the name, Sangreal, which means Royal Blood. And all the early Grail legends refer to "the Grail Family". In an ancient text called the Perlesvaus, the Grail consists of a changing sequence of images, the first being a crowned king crucified, and the second being a child. The Essene scrolls even give us the name of the child of Jesus and Mary Magdalene; his name was Gebiya. And guess what Gebiya means in Hebrew? Goblet!<br><br>Q) We know Jesus was crucified, but what became of the rest of the Â‘Grail FamilyÂ’? Where did Mary Magdalene take the Grail Child and her adopted daughter?<br><br>A) After giving birth to her son, Gebiya, the Magdalene took him and her adopted daughter to France. There is a lot of evidence to support the assertion that the Magdalene went to France with the Grail Child.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Q) The DaVinci Code portrays Mary Magdalene as the wife of Jesus. Do you agree with that? If so, where do you part company with The DaVinci Code? Or do you agree with all of it?<br><br>A) Yes, Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married. In the Essene scrolls, Jesus and Mary Magdalene are the couple that was wedded at Cana, where Jesus turned water into wine. In his book, Boodline of the Holy Grail, Laurence Gardner provides convincing evidence that the Catholic Church later deleted all references to JesusÂ’ marriage to the Magdalene. One of the points he makes is that it was the Hebrew custom in Bible times that the Groom provide the wine for the wedding. He correctly points out that in the New Testament story about the wedding at Cana, the people expected Jesus to provide the abundance of wine, which demonstrates that he was the Groom. When the Bible was edited to delete all references to the marriage of Jesus and Mary Magdalene, they missed that little detail. That is the Â‘smoking gunÂ’. So, we do agree with The DaVinci Code portrayal of Jesus and the Magdalene as being married. However, we donÂ’t agree with everything in the book. For example, in its effort to rediscover the historical Jesus, the book attempts to strip him of his divinity, not just in the fundamentalist sense but even in the New Age sense. There we part company with The DaVinci Code. We believe that both Jesus and Mary Magdalene were Avatars or Divine Incarnations.<br><br>Q) If Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married, did they have children?<br><br>A) Jesus and Mary Magdalene had one child together, a son. And just after the crucifixion, the Magdalene adopted a seven year old girl whose parents were killed at the crucifixion. In regard to the son, the Essene scrolls even tell us when he was conceived. Do you remember the New Testament story about the last night in the garden at Gethsemane? That was the last night before JesusÂ’ arrest and subsequent trial. We are told that none of the disciples were able to stay awake with him that night, all being to sleepy. But in the Essene version, there was one who did stay awake with him that night: His wife and co-Messiah, Mary Magdalene. And that is when they conceived their child. They did so in the full knowledge that Jesus was about to be arrested and put to death. They wanted to preserve his seed. And that child of Jesus and Mary Magdalene is known today as The Holy Grail.</div>
