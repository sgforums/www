We need to know why this happened,' he said.<br><br>Took, who disappeared shortly after Huang Na went missing, surrendered to police on Saturday and was charged in court on Monday.<br><br>He is a former colleague and flatmate of Madam Huang.<br><br>Madam Huang said on Monday she will not have a wake for her daughter.
