Madam Huang, 27, broke down in tears when told how her child had died.<br><br>Her husband said: 'It is horrible enough knowing she's dead, but knowing that she was suffocating and in pain makes it so much worse.'<br><br>SHE'LL BE CREMATED IN THIS FAVOURITE DRESS OF HERS<br><br>PHOTO -- WANG HUI FEN<br><img src="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2004-11-04/h1.jpg"><br>This white dress will be what Huang Na will wear for her cremation on Monday. According to the eight-year-old's mother, Madam Huang Shuying, this was her daughter's favourite dress.<br><br>Madam Huang, 27, said: 'Everyone - neighbours, workers at the market and her teachers and classmates - remember her as a lively, adorable and well-liked girl.<br><br>'That is the way I will dress her when she is cremated.'<br><br>Huang Na liked the dress her mother bought for her so much that she made Madam Huang take a picture of her in it to show her stepfather in China.<br><br>'I will make her look pretty at her funeral so she can go happily,' the grieving mother said.<br><br>Mr Zheng, 28, said his wife cannot forgive herself for leaving her daughter alone when she had to go back to her hometown in Fujian, China to visit a sick relative.<br><br>The eight-year-old could not tag along as she had to study for her exams at Jin Tai Primary School.<br><br>Mr Zheng said: 'My wife tosses and turns in bed and doesn't sleep all night. I try to talk to her about other things, but this is the only thing on her mind now.'<br><br>According to Mr Zheng, Huang Na's biological father, Mr Huang Qingrong, will not be coming for the funeral.<br><br>Mr Zheng said that despite reports, Huang Na didn't know she was his stepdaughter. He has now changed her name to Zheng Na as this was 'what my daughter would have wanted'.<br><br>The grieving couple had spent the day making funeral arrangements and thanking volunteers who had helped search for their missing daughter.<br><br>In the morning, the couple and close friends burned incense, made offerings and said prayers outside the storeroom at the Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre where it is believed Huang Na was attacked.<br><br>Later, they visited the Singapore Buddhist Lodge near River Valley Road to arrange for her cremation. The chairman of the lodge, Mr Lee Bock Guan, said he would waive the $650 funeral fees.<br><br>Meanwhile, the public outpouring of sympathy and generosity that greeted Huang Na's disappearance continues unabated.<br><br>Stall owners at the Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre, who doted on the child, have bought dozens of soft toys, especially Huang Na's favourite Hello Kitty items, for her.<br><br>At the Telok Blangah Hill Park where Huang Na's body was found, strangers had also left notes, soft toys, chrysanthemum flowers and packets of food and water. Mr Zheng said the gifts will be burned at her cremation.<br><br>Malaysian Took Leng How, 22, a former colleague and flatmate of Madam Huang, was charged with Huang Na's murder on Monday.<br><br>The couple said they want to stay and attend Took's trial to 'understand why our child died'.<br><br>But they will leave Singapore for good after that. Mr Zheng said: 'It will be just too painful to stay here.'<br></div>

Perhaps, she trusted her friend who is also her flatmate.

It might complicate things (the relations) if he also comes to Singapore.  They divorced due to 3rd party (husband's side).</div>
