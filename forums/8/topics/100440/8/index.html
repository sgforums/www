The first one is on the 3 robbers who managed to infirate into puala ubin after their heist in JB... this happened early this year if you remember. Hence, rather than getting into the rush of closing the Huang Na case(even the body's identity is not even confirm), the police should give the public a good explaination on how did Ah Hao managed to escape to M'sia under the police's nose.

            <div class='col-md body'>well.. no matter how hard the govt tries.. no security is ever 100% wan la.. everyone must work together. i really applaud the police's hard work, and the people's love and support to help search for the missing girl.. although the girl is dead.. at least her body is found.<br><br>i believe if 30 years ago, singaporeans have the same spirit as the singaporeans of today. maybe, just maybe the people who went missing last time, could be found, may they be dead or alive.. anything is better than not even knowing if they are dead or alive..<br><br>everyone need to work together, to provide security.. the police force isn't enough.. singapore is so big..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oso i dun tink its totally right to blame the police la. i've lost my wallet recently, and the police took the effort to contact me and stuff lor. i think its not bad la, considering other countries, singapore's police force is really much better. would you rather your case be handled by singapore police, or malaysia police? or indonesia police, or china police?<br><br>think about it before saying singapore police is bad. no security is ever 100% foolproof la.. even firewalls all that oso not 100%.. they just do all they can. having critisizm won't improve their morale to keep us safe.. encouragement and recognision for their work is better..</div>

Likewise, when the body was first found, they only say the police believed it's Huang Na, instead of saying her body was found.</div>
