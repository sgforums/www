            <div class='col-md body'>This story was printed from channelnewsasia.com<br><br>Title : Singapore police believe body found is that of missing girl<br>By :<br>Date : 31 October 2004 1857 hrs (SST)<br>URL : http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/114549/1/.html<br><br>SINGAPORE : Police made a grisly find of a naked body of a young girl with long hair at Telok Blangah Hill Park on Sunday morning.<br><br>And based on investigations, Police strongly believe the decomposed body in a box is that of missing 8-year-old girl Huang Na, and are currently conducting forensic tests to determine this.<br><br>The find comes more than 12 hours after Police brought back 22-year-old Malaysian Took Leng How from Penang on Saturday night.<br><br>Took, who has been on the run, is a prime suspect in the case.<br><br>A man will be charged in court on Monday morning for the little girl's murder.<br><br>The heavily forested area in Telok Blangah Hill Park is where the search for 8-year-old Huang Na resulted in a tragic discovery of the box.<br><br>Police discovered the box below a 30-metre slope.<br><br>It took them 20 men and half an hour to discover the medium-sized brown packing box.<br><br>Despite the fact that it was tightly sealed with masking tape, investigators say there was still a strong smell of decomposition coming from it.<br><br>A naked body of a young girl with long hair had been stuffed into the small box.<br><br>The girl's identity has yet to be confirmed because of the state of decomposition of the body.<br><br>Police had been led to the area after the arrest of Mr Took.<br><br>He had been on the run in Malaysia after being implicated in Huang Na's abduction, but later surrendered to the Malaysian police.<br><br>Huang Na's mother is said to be distraught as she awaits the outcome of forensic tests to confirm the identity of the body.<br><br>Police say other investigations have also revealed more about where Huang Na may have been attacked.<br><br>Tan Puay Kern, police spokesman, said, "Over the last two weeks, we have conducted investigations that have led us to believe that the primary scene where Huang Na disappeared was actually a storeroom in the Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre. We have obtained some physical evidence there."<br><br>Police have now called off their search for Huang Na while awaiting the forensic results.<br><br>After her disappearance three weeks ago, the search for Huang Na has been in the news.<br><br>The 8-year-old Jintai Primary student first came to Singapore from China 18 months ago with her mother Madam Huang Shuying.<br><br>But the girl went missing on October 10.<br><br>Madam Huang had returned to China for a short trip, and left the girl with a friend.<br><br>She rushed back to Singapore, and together with police, friends, volunteers and ordinary Singaporeans, started searching for Huang Na.<br><br>The search was even extended beyond Singapore's shores.<br><br>Police interviewed many people in connection with the disappearance, including Malaysian Mr Took, who was last seen with Huang Na at Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre.<br><br>Both Madam Huang and Took worked together at the centre.<br><br>Mr Took had been interviewed by police twice in connection with Huang Na's disappearance, before he himself vanished.<br><br>A warrant of arrest was later issued.<br><br>The vegetable packer, who is married with a son, turned himself in to Malaysian police in Penang on Saturday, after nine days on the run.<br><br>With Mr Took's surrender and the discovery of a girl's body at Telok Blangah Hill Park, police have now ended what they say was their 'biggest hunt for a missing person in five years'.<br><br>The search for Huang Na had also brought together many members of the public as they formed search parties to comb the island to search for her and give out leaflets.<br><br>But the news that Huang Na's body was found left many at the civic group, Crime Library, in tears.<br><br>They had given out 70,000 leaflets in the past two weeks to try and find Huang Na.<br><br>"When I heard the news this morning, I was really very devastated and very sad," said Joseph Tan, a member of the Crime Library.<br><br>"It's so terrible. I mean, how can this happen?.....I just don't want to accept it, unless the police confirm it's Huang Na. I just really hope that the forensic group.......thoroughly investigate the whole matter to find out who's the culprit and get to the bottom of this," said Chua Juyin, another member of the Crime Library.<br><br>"I had hoped that she (Huang Na) was in Malaysia. I was going to give some flyers to my cousin to ask him to help find her. But now, I guess I don't have to anymore," said Crime Library member Amy Ho, crying.<br><br>However, Crime Library said the entire incident has shown the willingness of Singaporeans to do their part to help find missing persons.<br><br>"I sincerely hope that the members of the public can learn from this lesson, that we should come together as a unity and community," said Joseph Tan.<br><br>Members of the public are also upset that Huang Na's story has ended in tragedy.<br><br>"I feel quite bad. We spent so hard finding her, and now we found her dead. My heart aches," said a member of the public.<br><br>"I feel sad about it, so young a child," said another.<br><br>"It's a very sad case. Why should she be missing and why are there such people in this world, I just don't understand," said a third.<br><br>As for Crime Library, they intend to continue their search for other missing persons. - CNA<br><br></div>

He has been arrested for murder.<br><br>The search ended three weeks to the day that Huang Na, a China national, disappeared on Oct 10, sparking the biggest hunt for a missing person here in five years.<br><br>Her body was crammed into a brown cardboard box measuring 50cm by 40cm by 30cm. Huang Na was 1.2m-tall, so her assailant had forced her into what pathologists described as a 'crouching position'.<br><br>The girl's clothes - she was last seen wearing a long-sleeved blue denim jacket and bermudas - were nowhere to be found.<br><br>The box had been sealed with masking tape, but the odour that emanated from it left police investigators, who combed the area for about half an hour before finding it, with little doubt as to its contents.<br><br>When pathologists opened the box at the mortuary, they found that Huang Na's body was so badly decomposed that it could initially be identified only as belonging to a 'young girl with long hair'.<br><br>Because of its state, there was also no way to immediately identify any wounds, or whether there were any signs of sexual assault.<br><br>Police said further forensic tests would be conducted to confirm that it was Huang Na, although they added that it was very likely to be the Jin Tai Primary School pupil.<br><br>The girl was also visually identified by her mother, Madam Huang Shuying, 27, a China national who works here as a vegetable stall assistant. Her grief-filled wails filled the mortuary as she confirmed the find and she had to be helped out of the area by friends.<br><br>Read The Straits Times on Monday for the full story.<br><br></div>

Should we tighten our borders by screening potential foreign workers stricter?
