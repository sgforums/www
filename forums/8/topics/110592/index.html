And they also want their independence seperate from indonesia.<br><br>After this incident I think many muslims in acheh will begin to realise that such an extreme thinking is their own undoing, if they had their way and were earlier seperated from indonesia even with all the oil and gold in their province being the richest and most abundant in all of indonesia today they will be in deep deep trouble, they will not be equipped to handle this disaster as shown.<br><br>If they were already independant, the world may have labelled them as a country sponsoring extremism or terror may be relunctant to come and help them.<br><br>The survivors will now realise how fortunate that they are still part of indonesia and have a government and the rest of the world to send them aid.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You have 2 fishes in your fishbowl. One day you remove one of them, and hold it in your hand and watch it gasp for air. When it's about to die, you put it back into the fishbowl. Guess what happened?<br><br>The fish will tell the other one: I saw god! I felt his anger! I could not breathe at all, it felt like nothing I've ever felt before! It was so amazing! It was so bright, I could almost see a faint outline of his eyes and maybe a head. When I was almost dead from his glory, he put me back into this world. I must go and meditate, and hopefully understand what god tried to tell me just now.<br><br>To answer all your questions, just imagine you are the fish that was taken out of the tank, trying to understand the world around you. We live in a time zone, there is past, present and future. God is different, the universe as we know of is based on our time zone perspective, not His timeless perspective.<br><br>And to understand what I've just said, you are the other fish.... totally no idea what the first fish is talking about.<br><br>Think about it.<br><br></div>
