            <div class='col-md body'>What created Earth?<br>The same guy who created mars and Uranus.<br><br>What started evolution?<br>When dumb monkeys decided to be smart(er) monkeys.<br><br>Who created big bang?<br>This is a theory by a scientist. so its not a question of who. (same analogy, you don't get the answer to who farted.)<br><br>Who made humans?<br>Refer to the answer on monkeys<br><br>Who was the one who made humans?<br>refer to above<br><br>Why can't we know what happened before to us before we were babies?<br>because there are several halves of you that are doing competitive swimming.<br>and are too busy trying to bang through the wall to actually remember (and perhaps hit on the head too hard to really remember)<br><br>Why does God impose so many strict rules...but he isn't here to enforce it?<br>Everything done goes through the heaven/hell spam filter. So if you are a MLM email sales agent, you know where you belong.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Is there really God?<br>Yes, there is such a word in the dictionary. You can look it up.<br><br>Why does almost 80% of people believe in something they cannot see?<br>For hell yeah I believe some dumb kid farted in the same lift as me. I sure don't think I wanna see his fart.<br><br>Why does God allow kids to die?<br>Coz they are too dumb to continue the journey of life? Remember darwin's law? The smart/stong survive?<br><br>If so many pple are allowed to die is death a good thing?<br>Thats the dumbest question, everybody dies in the end,  it is of course a good thing. Keeps population in check. So that humans don't procreate and stifle the earth resources with their crap plastics and CFCs.<br><br>SO HOW DID I ENDED UP ON THIS EARTH?<br>So happens that we are the only parasites that can live comfortably and procreate there.<br></div>

But if's rely "punishment", what sins have the children commit? And the ppl in those affected areas... they are already god damm poor &amp; leading miserable lives, why (if god existed) makes things more difficult for them??<br>And the most successful ppl, whether in business or life, are usually the most hard hearted scum bags... &amp; they usually lead the best life (materialistically at least)</span><br>everything happen for a reason, sometime is difficult to see it at first but later normally after a while we do see the big picture. sometime hardship come as blessing in disguise, often the hardship is to prepare you for worse to come as the hardship teaches you valuable lessons.<br><br>I'm just conjecture here, my chinese friend whose hometown in bandar acheh now in ruins once told me the muslims in bandar acheh are too strict, they don't want schools or hospitals or better infrastructure they just want the government to build more &amp; more mosque which I find very disturbing. And they also want their independence seperate from indonesia.<br><br>After this incident I think many muslims in acheh will begin to realise that such an extreme thinking is their own undoing, if they had their way and were earlier seperated from indonesia even with all the oil and gold in their province being the richest and most abundant in all of indonesia today they will be in deep deep trouble, they will not be equipped to handle this disaster as shown.<br><br>If they were already independant, the world may have labelled them as a country sponsoring extremism or terror may be relunctant to come and help them.<br><br>The survivors will now realise how fortunate that they are still part of indonesia and have a government and the rest of the world to send them aid.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Must die so many ppl then a lesson can be delivered? All things equal, we might as well turn to the Devil.. at least u get to fulfill some worldly desires before perishing a inevitable end?<br>I'm not advocating any beliefs of any religions... but jus that looking at the world it is, whether on a macro or personnal level, there seems no rational or any justice.<br>Things jus happen!! Frm a evolutionary point of views, its basically survival of the fitness--- kids get killed the most because they are physically the weakest. Maybe many scumbags who deserve to die escape unscapth in the disaster.. jus a tod??<br>Any it seems faith, religious or justice means nothins... things jus occur, &amp; based on ur luck, actions &amp; mentality, an outcome is determined??</span><br><br></div></blockquote><span style="color: #444444;"></span></div>
