            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, I would agree that this coming Presidential Elections is going to experience the lowest votersÂ’ turnout in American history. And the 3 reasons you mentioned are pretty relevant too.<br><br>1) The candidates were not focusing on issues closer to the average family.<br><br>What would you deem as issues close to the heart of the average family? I believed Al Gore had pretty comprehensive plans for the middle and lower income families in his policy plans and yet, most Americans believed that he and George W. Bush are not dealing with THEIR problems in depth. And this begets the question of, how comprehensive can you get? We know that in order to win, you must adopt a shift to centre politics and hope to garner as many votes as possible. Bill Clinton and his erstwhile partner over in Downing Street Tony Blair both changes their leftist party image into one of a more acceptable centrist one. And they go the votes! As such, it would not be too surprising to see both candidates skipping core issues like abortions and guns control, both political explosive issues.<br><br>2) The voters were experiencing good times and do not care who is running the country<br><br>I would choose to disagree with this sentence. In fact, Times ran a pretty interesting article on why Al Gore should rope in President Clinton to help him in the presidential race. And one of the major factors is the economy. If Gore kept on stressing the economy issue and how he and his partner in the White House are going to continue running it the same way as before ala let the good times continue to roll, he might just have the race wrap up. And this, I believe, is a very good reason why those who are experiencing the good times would care who is running the country.<br><br>3) VotersÂ’ ignorance of the basic rudiments of the American government<br><br>This is a very interesting point that continues to baffle the rest of the world! The fact that they have a rather complex form of governance and voting system, (they get to elect every 2 years, for both Houses of Senate and Representatives as well as the Presidency) does not excuse the average AmericanÂ’s knowledge about their government. However, that is assuming we are talking about the rudimentary of governance or the name of their senators, most Americans know, identify and are keen on their President and the elections. Thus, we would see a more turnout from the Americans as compared to when they are voting for their senators or congressmen. (Others would disagree with me over the provincialism issue) Yes, they do not know much about how the country is ran but they do know the office the President symbolise and what it means to them. Thus, the third reason is not compulsive to me.<br><br>We see a shift of the Presidency since the beginning of the 20th century, as in the strengthening of the Executive Office. From F.D Roosevelt, the trend is pretty clear. And this has a large galvanising effect on the American public. To them, it was clearly the man in the White House who represent them in the international arena and the man to lead them in domestic affairs. The race had always been a closely watched event and thus, to suggest a fundamental reason why there is a low turnout is not the key point. After all, most elections suggest almost the same percentage of votersÂ’ turnout. The key point is, this is one of the most boring Presidential Races ever. Between Al Gore and George W. Bush, there was not much differences in their policy (as they both subscribe to centrist politics) and usually, when this occurs, itsÂ’ the most charming and engaging man who wins. And frankly, as one voter mentioned, both are just as boring. Thus, if Bill Clinton was offered a third term, this election would most probably be a no-event.<br><br>------------------<br>The heartless and souless fool.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One of the main grouses of presidential hopeful George W. Bush is that he has the global knowledge of a high school dropout and that others would make a much better president than he will. However, that is missing the point entirely. Domestic politics are clearly tied in with the foreign exploits of the United States and whatever limitation Bush Junior might have, he is a pretty shrewd politician. And the mark of a successful president is to glue the nation together and lead it. After FD Roosevelt, none of the presidents can exactly be called experts in foreign affairs. Nixon depended largely on Kissinger for his containment policy via Red China and Eisenhower had his Dulles. Thus, you do not need to be an expert in international relations, but rather, the ability to attract men of talents to you. And that is the essence of modern government, a highly bureaucratised organisation ran by a manager.<br><br>------------------<br>The heartless and souless fool.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, President Bill Clinton was the governor of Arkansas before continuing on his way to the White House and if I am not mistaken, he had never being voted into the office of Senate, and thus did not sit on any subcommittees. As a result, his foreign diplomacy is as well versed as me, which is saying none at most. In fact, in the 1992 elections against Bush Senior, he constantly came up short against his competitor on this issue. And frankly, his first term was short on foreign policies achievement. This was only to change by his second term, as witness by his appointment of Madeline Albright and his foray into the Northern Ireland issue and his drive to search for peace in the Middle East. In fact, we have this Clinton Doctrine of American foreign initiative vis-Ã -vis human rights and the Â“freedomÂ” ideology.<br><br>Who will be BushÂ’s Secretary of State? If I am not wrong, they are trying to rope in General Colin Powell. I have yet to hear more about his appointments but we shall be wiser after the November period, if he wins that is. And seriously, being a Sec. Of State is a cushy appointment that people will not hesitate to take, regardless of their personal feelings towards George W. Bush.<br><br>Regarding the by-elections in one of the ward in Singapore, I must admit my knowledge in that area is foundering. As far as I can see, it is technically possible to hold one by-election for it is well known that when they voted in the PAP team, itÂ’s as a whole. Thus, if one of the members is unable to carry out his duties, it stands to reason that they hold another elections. I think the reason the PAP machinery churn out was that it is not NECESSARY and that itÂ’s a waste of tax payerÂ’s MONEY to conduct another elections. Furthermore, I believed they mention that the current team was voted into office as a PAP TEAM and that if they choose to replace one of them, elections are not necessary. If voters are unhappy about this issue, they can only make their displeasure known in the next election, most probably carried out in 2002.<br><br>An interesting point to note, the first opposition member to step into parliament after several years of non opposition after the withdrawal of Barisan Socialis members of parliament was JB Jeyaratnam in the early 1980s if I am not wrong. And he contested it through a by-election when one of the PAP MP was unable to carry out his duty. I would say memory runs long in the prevailing government.<br><br>------------------<br>The heartless and souless fool.</div>
