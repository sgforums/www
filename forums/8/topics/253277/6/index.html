            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Im an volunteer adult leader myself, heres my two cents worth.<br><br>I can understand the agony you r experiencing right now. On one hand, you r trying to do your part to sjab but parents are pushing you down instead. I am a JC 2 student leading my scout unit in a in one of the top schools in singapore thus parents r always buzzing around complaining and lementing about our systems. I have returned to scouts as i feel whatever i have today, scouts have given me and im trying give back in whatever ways i can.<br><br>I always belive in this saying '' Discipline is the tool by which talents become abilities". Discipline if enforced in the right way is beneficial as it keeps us focused and steady. However, use it the wrong way and it backfires. I dont agree that the best instructors are that which are feared. Rather, i believe that the best instructors are the ones who are respected. Fear only gives the weakest form of respect one could attain from his peers. If your boy is giving you problems, search for the root of it. Something must be sparking off that behaviour. The purpose of PT is to keep fit but its primary goal is that of healthy development by boosting self confidence that you must try to understand.<br><br>"My sadistic friend" if these are the terms you use on your fellow leaders, i shudder imagining the type of values ur leader is teaching the boys. Reagarding your outburst when faced with criticism, again a leader is expected to maintain his cool. This is a value we try to teach boys and you should try to lead by example, punishment cannot teach this. The forumite who critised you was right,  if the boys are calling you names perhaps u have failed as a leader.<br><br>I appologise for my harsh tone in this post. Please take no offence as we all share the common purpose of bettering our boys and fufilling our duty as civil citiizens.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>dude, i'm pretty much in the same situation as you. in charge of a uniformed group nowadays is rubbish. but i gotta agree on the point that it's the morales we instill in them. a very impt question: why are you pumping them? cause they did something wrong, not fast enough, didn't reply loud enough etc? will pumping improve the situation and how so? explain it to your cadets. let them decide their own punishment. the more self-disciplined ones will understand. don't spoonfeed your cadets. i let my cadets decide on their punishment and they do it. yeah but still parents will complain. and since your cadets are only 13 yearold kids, go slowly. instill self discipline slowly. i understand what the fruck parents always like to do, send complaint letters like lucky draw coupons. i receive a lot from my cadets' parents too. take it easy dude.<br>yeah and what the fruck la. people like to say SJAB is a loser cca. look la if your cca group was faced with such discrimination, doubt you like it so shut the fruck about calling other associations as losers. they don't deserve that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Before I begin: For those who are bringing their outside arguments into this thread, please grow up. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>From what I can see, there are people flaming the TS because physical fitness is important to him. I find this funny. Who doesn't want to be physically fit? I'm saying "physically fit" and not "physically strong" because 10 push-ups isn't an astronomical figure. You can argue that different people have different levels of strength, so 10 might seem alot to the kid. Good luck to him in NS then.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>There are ZERO disadvantages to being physically fit.</strong></span> Why not help the kid start early?</div>
