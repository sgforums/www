              <p>Not only was the wayang malingerer eating cut fruits, the father who's been posting in Asiaone forum and SGforum about his son being oppressed by Mindef to practise his 'priesthood', admitted in Asiaone before the ST story ran, that the wayang had been eating fruits in DB.</p>
              <p>Father felt heart pain, revealed that his son was only given an apple and a pear in spite of his self-imposed hunger strike, he also tried to accuse the officer in charge of DB claiming that a full COL told him "only if there is more fruits, would he be given some". If you read, you'll see an Asiaone forumer asking "I thought he is on hunger strike?" <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> Father also asked for milk for son.</p>
              <p>Tattva Vit Das is the newly created handle of the father in Asiaone forum. This is the thread he started. http://forums.asiaone.com/showthread.php?t=21491&amp;page=5</p>

                                      the victim, Sundar Gopal Das got an appointment with his son, Madana
                                      Mohan Das at the Detention Barracks.<br> <br> Now, Madana Mohan Das is given only one apple and one pear at lunch
                                      time and nothing else throughout the day. This has been happenning for
                                      the last 48 hours. He is already on drips now, being extremely weak.<br> <br> His father asked the colonel in charge of the Detention Barracks to at
                                      least provide Madana Mohan Das with more fruits. The colonel flatly
                                      replied that if he has, he shall give, otherwise he shall not. He
                                      pleaded to the colonel whether he can at least give him some milk. He
                                      said that he cannot do so as there is no milk in the camp at all. Upon
                                      pleading, he agreed to give some condensed milk if he had some to give.<br> <br> The poor boy, how long will he able to sustain himself like this? And there is no clue as to when the court marshal is.<br> <br> Now WHAT IS THIS? HELL ON EARTH? Why are they torturing him? What
                                      nonsense? What is his mistake? This is the punishment for being a
                                      simple priest? Even an ordinary criminal is given better treatment
                                      inside the DB.<br> <br> Is this the behavior of a developed nation? What's going on? Where is justice?"</p>

              <p>"MR SHRINIWAS Rai, Hindu representative of the Inter-Religious Organisation, said Hindu priests can eat food prepared outside a temple, as long as it is vegetarian. He added that priests should be trained in India, and not everyone can claim to be a priest."</p>
              <p>So food is no problem, so long as it is vegeterian .<br><br>And I quote<br>"His father, Mr Sundar Gopal Das, described himself and his son as priests at the Sri Krishna Mandir, a Hare Krishna temple in Geylang Lorong 29.</p>
              <p>He maintained that as priests, they could not cut all their hair and had to keep a tuft at the back of the head. As for meals, he said they could only eat food prepared at the temple as prayer offerings. "</p>
              <p>So cut and keep a tuft at the back of the head lah. This is no issue at all. Why he made a ho ha out of it and went all the way to politicise it?</p>

              <p>CO5 was kind, but didn't necessarily show sound command. Here's my take on why. I think he did NOT make a sound sound decision giving in to the malingerer.</p>
              <p>its 100% untrue that when a commander helps his man, it's because he's afraid for his career (if he's a regular) or afraid to get into trouble (if NSF). In fact,<strong> the opposite is true. </strong>The easier way to cruise and be fucked up leader is to Throw The Book. It's very simple. Even Spiderman said, with power comes responsibilities.</p>
              <p>The burden of leadership is one thing only: responsibility. The easiest way to dodge this responsibility is the path of least resistance. And let me assure all of you a commander's path of least resistance is to throw the book and cruise, thereby washing hands off real command and the need for respect.</p>
              <p>In other words, the easiest way to spot a fucked up leader is the one who perpetually throws the book without EVER standing up for his men or thinking for them for a sec. This type we see in abundance don't we? Make no mistake, don't think this 'unbending' leader is good and not scared of breaking rice bowl. Don't be silly. The bookthrowing unbending 'leader' is the kind scared so shitless he's clutching his ricebowl with his dick.</p>
              <p>Yet, the mark of sound leadership means standing up for your men, but only in a judicious and sound manner. It means you don't let them monkey you and take you for a fool.</p>
              <p>In this case, CO5 showed that he was kind and not the wayang fuck type who just throw-the-book to save his ass, but he also showed lapse in sound leadership in his decision.</p>
              <p>In his eager beaverness to be a good leader to the wayang, he didn't realise the following: Wayang claimed he could only eat special food that had to be sanctified by his lim peh's temple and thus asked to book out 2/3 times a week. This involved a permanently (for as long as he's in BMT) different and special routine from the rest of the guys in BMT. He claimed he had to keep a ponytail. This means a marked different appearance from everyone else. The booking out already smacks of kenging desires. What recruits wouldn't give to stay out every night!</p>
              <p>It was wise of CO of driving school and subsequently the generals up there to put wayang in his place and tell him to shut up and sit down. Army means you conform to army needs above religious. The sihlks' turban was a legacy passed down from the British army that SAF decided to honour. Not the same. If like that, any ah kow, ah meow next time can say he's priest, pastor or medium and need to book out 4 times a week to bathe in talisman water. CO5 was kind and put himself on the line (in vain), but didn't show sound leadership.</p>
              <p>An example of sound leadership and command decision I witnessed? One of the men of a coy asked for two days off in the middle of ATEC prep to attend a outward bound course mandatory for the new job he's been offered. This job requires employee to go through the course and the course only takes place twice a year. If the man who will ORD a month after ATEC misses the course, he has to wait for half a year to take again.</p>
              <p>He asked his OC. OC assessed, my man needs to take two days off although it clashes with ATEC training. If I don't let him go off, he has to waste 6 months of his life after he ORDs just because I didn't let him go. He needs the job for his livelihood, and he's serving his NS, FOR THE COUNTRY, under my command. The 2 days off is a one-off. Not a repeated occurence of unfairness. So the OC assessed and let that man go for 2 days.</p>
              <p>My OC, who's a scholar no less, was well aware that if shit hit the fan, let's say the guy meets with a motorbike accident when he's out &amp; investigations show that this NSF 'illegally' let off by his OC to go out when he's supposed to be in camp,  he (my OC) will GET IT! The OC himself explained to his PC his thought processes and said well, if he gets into trouble while outside, it's my cross to bear. He's serving the country and fights for me and has been a good soldier. Two days off for his future job. It's only right I 'fight' for him too.</p>
              <p>Thats what a good leader does. He stands up for his man. He knows his men fight for him on the field. When he can, he will 'fight' back for them and stand up for them.</p>
              <p>Contrast to another OC in the same unit, who's well known to indiscriminately charge people over any little thing and never ever looking out or helping them, because all he cares about is his ass. Going By The Book is the easiest way for fucked up commanders who don't give a damn about leadership or the organisation or his men and cares only about his ricebowl. This sort of insecurity usually comes from a self awareness that the ricebowl is very small and full of cracks.</p>

              <p>The truth had prevail. For those who had taken sides even before finding out more details, please ask yourself if you have been fair. It appear that someone had thought that using religious would help him personally. In the end, this incident must have done more harm than good to the religion instead.</p>
              <p>I'm sure we can find this sort of people in every religion and this just happened that this has been publicised (by their own doing). These people's action normally has nothing to do with the religion itelf as it is more of the person's integrity that is the problem.</p>

(See <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Indian-Malaysian/message/35441">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Indian-Malaysian/message/35441</a>). What temerity!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The government should seriously look at <strong>Tattva Vit Das</strong>' and his <strong>temple</strong>'s <span style="color: #ff0000;">questional and dangerous</span> conduct. They do not have any allegiance to Singapore, and her people. They seem to have their own exclusive agenda detrimental to the well-being of our society.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One thing that should disturb anyone's mind is the cult's origin in Singapore. In the 1970s, the Singapore government banned their founder, <strong>Prabhupada</strong>, who mixed freely with the Hippies in the US, and who preached a brand of religion/Hinduism, which the mainstream Hindus here and elsewhere did not approved of, from entering Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sometime in the 80s, however, the cult, which is commonly called the 'Hare Krsnas', struck roots in Singapore. Sundar Gopal Das, the man who begot Madana Mohan (the NSman in the midst of the controversy) headed the cult.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ever since, Sundar Gopal and his cult members have had been in constant clashes with the law enforcers. In 1988, for instance, under the leadership of Sundar Gopal, the cult did an outrageous act that angered the Hindus and Tamils in Singapore. The incident was mentioned in a White Paper that was submitted to the Parliament. Between 1988 and 2007, there were a number of complaints of various types against the cult.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In 2007, Sundar Gopal Das and his cult illegally occupied a place in Norris Road. The proprietor sought the court's help, and an Eviction Order was issued against the cult. The man, as what he has done in his son's case now, went public about his perceived 'injustice', and posted his petition <strong>against</strong> the Singapore government and the judiciary on the net. That again caused much embarrassment to the judiciary, government and Singaporens.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And now, he got embroiled in yet another controvery.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is about time that the government looked into this cult, which is predominantly made up of foreigners: Tattva Vit Das is an Indian national, Govardan and Ragupathy are Malaysians. (Perhaps, in the recent months, they may have gotten their PR, I am not sure of this). But the point to note is, except Sundar Gopal Das, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>none</strong></span> of these men have served NS, and none has any avowed allegiance to Singapore. And the irony is, of all, it is these foreigners who have stirred up so much trouble about our national service.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Seriously, the authorities must look into all the troubles that they have caused us, and remove them from us.   </p>
