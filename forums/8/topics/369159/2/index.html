              <p>How can one claims to be supporting NS when one asks for special
              priviledges, priviledges that only he alone can get while others
              are denied?</p>
              <p>Thus is or is not the petitioner supporting NS? NS is about
              youths being taught defensive skills to protect our society to be
              prepared for adverse situations inclusive of outright conflicts,
              which is total and incorporates all aspects in engagement of
              defensive battles, details which are regimented down to the food
              they eat.</p>
              <p>Should there be an outbreak of hostilities between nations and
              the 'priest' is called to war, will he be allowed to eat his
              special meals, or partake in whatever that is avaliable, in order
              to be ready for battle?</p>
              <p>Why should other Singaporean boys be made to take on
              further responsibilities that the 'priest' should rightly perform
              as is his duty to society for being given the priviledge of
              citizenship even if by birth?</p>
              <p>All in all, this is nothing to do with 'religious persecution',
              but more an outright attempt to assert and impose one's religion
              for special priviledge in our secular society.</p>
              <p>Where do we draw the line then, when special priviledges are
              called for, in an equal secular society? This we must sorely
              ask, before we sign on the dotted line to petition. We are not
              India with adoption of their caste system in our society, or Muslim
              Iran ruled by clerics. We are Singapore, an independent secular
              republic.</p>

              <p>agree.. when war comes.. don't tell me he will be exempt from protecting the country just because of his religion? He should know about regimentation and that being a Singaporean male means sacrificing part of his daily routine/ritual/habits here or there all in the name of protecting the nation</p>

              <p>Maybe his superiors should allow his family to deliver his food every meal time. $4.50 x 3 per day of SAF and taxpayers dollars saved.</p>

              <p>our 1st class gahmen don't practice what they preach.</p>
              <p>can't they just take into account his religious duties and let him serve NS without compromising his faith?</p>
              <p>some people treat their religions very seriously and we should respect people like this indian priest for that.</p>
              <p>i suggest the temple contact the CO or get the MP to write to the CO, since the CO was the one who suggested him to be clerk in the 1st place and CO is also somehow involved.</p>
              <p>if the CO cannot solve this simple crap, then we might as well as strip him off his 2 crab or 3 crabs.</p>
              <p>this is why i will be traitor to my country if war breaks out, as this land of crap is not worth serving. after this incident, i'm wholly ashamed to say i'm singaporean and am fully embarrased of my own gahmen.</p>

              <p><br>You are the only odd one out. Even the certified nutcases who had stayed before in IMH did their NS properly in my unit. The only pre-requisite for the nutcases to serve is to have their meds on time and on target, else they go amok.</p>
              <p>If the Hindu priest can eat sanctified dried rations which by right, should last for a whole week, then he could jolly well prepped the rations way ahead of time. Else, why bother to serve the national service in the army? Second, before enlistment(i.e at CMPB), Madana should have enquired as to whether he should be transfered to another service like Police or SCDF due to his religious practices.</p>
