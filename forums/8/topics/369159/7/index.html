              <p>Wow.. This is such a pity. I come from the same caste and religion as the priest. Being a brahmin, I understand how important it is for priests to follow their rules and procedures.</p>
              <p>Its just like how Muslims are required to eat Halal food and Jains are not allowed to consume even Onions or Garlic.</p>
              <p>Just for that small request that he mentioned, some of you labelled him as shit stirrer and all kinds of low level words. Shame on you. Shame on your upbringing.</p>
              <p>This person is spiritually far advanced than any of us will ever be in our entire lives. He has dedicated his life to being a priest and sacrificed his personal interests along the way.</p>
              <p>All he is asking is special dietary requirements and to keep his tuft of hair. Isn't the SAF sensitive enough to allow this? Are they so ignorant to understand other people's religious requirements?</p>
              <p>Its not like he has committed any sin. He is obeying all the requests and performing NS too.</p>
              <p>Back in India, if you are a soldier, you are respected more than anyone else. Over here, if you are a soldier, you are laughed upon and insulted upon and sometimes even asked not to take public transport because you are too smelly. It shows to go the difference doesn't it?</p>
              <p>I hope this Pujari gets his request fulfilled as soon as possible. I
              would like to request MINDEF to properly go through his request and at
              least arrive at some compromise for both parties. I hope SAF takes
              proper action to help this young man's plight.</p>
              <p>This will show how much of a heart SAF really has. Lets see.</p>

              <p>Eh... Castes doesn't mean I am differentiating people or anything. I am just stating it in the exact same manner that you will say that you are a Christian or a Muslim. You are talking about equality? So what now? Muslims must eat normal non-halal food? Castes and Religions are but just words. At the end of the day they are differentiating people based on the rules they want to follow in their lives.</p>
              <p>I bet you are contradicting your ownself when you say "why should you be
                                      special just because you were born as someone "different" ?" So, again Muslims are supposed to eat the same as everyone else from your perception I believe? Sheesh.. Your shallow thinking is laudable..</p>
              <p>And if indeed, this chap is a fake, then so be it. He will get what he deserve. Thats karma. But if he is indeed true to his religion and he is indeed a real Pujari, then it would be a sad failure on our part for not helping this boy and witholding humanity.</p>

              <p>Seriously can't the food be taken from the temple, frozen, and then he can heat up in the microwave in camp?</p>
              <p>I mean the whole issue is that the food must be prepared by believers and offered to Krishna first right?</p>
              <p>There shouldn't be any problems with that since he is already bringing rations in every Tuesday and Thursday back to camp.</p>

So please stop wagging ur tongue and chalking up wrong accusations if you do not have a credible argument to make.</p>
              <p>He just needs his food to be special. Why did you assume that he asked for being booked out everyday? Why did you assume that just because of an officially qualified Hindu priest, every other religious fanatic will demand for a waiver of NS? Why did you assume that ANYONE can proclaim that their religion needs them to do this or that? This is a particular case where the person concerned is a priest and for your information, not just anyone can become priests in Indian Temples. You need to go through a certain procedure which also involves examinations and you are finally CERTIFIED by a proper official authority from India. So not everyone can just anyhow make these requests.</p>
              <p>Your statements and arguments are just based and concentrated plainly on backlashing at other sensible posts and outrightly denying any weightage to other's factual based discussions.</p>
              <p>You are not even worthy of properly discussing la.. Go wake up your idea before you reply to me again.</p>
              <p>I am NOT trying to help my own kind. I am trying to help a fellow human who is probably being subject to unfair treatment because of him being minority. Again, you ASSUMED.</p>
              <p>The only thing you probably got correct was that I didn't serve my NS here.</p>

              for the reasons given, how unlikely that a whole bunch of SAF
              officers would commit collective career suicide, how unlikely that
              the SAF would be doing this out of bloodymindedness or
              discrimination <strong>ESPECIALLY AFTER</strong> this fellow has
              stirred up a shitstorm among MPs, Ministers, and even the President
              !!! ... GET IT ? ...</p>
              <p>likely you don't .... cos you have not even served NS before,
              you have not worn the uniform of this country before, and you don't
              know how that organization operates ..... </p>
              <p>hey, door's always open, just close it on the way out ...</p>

              <p>Oh, so that means that if I didn't do the NS then I can't comment on a topic concerning them? What kinda reasoning is that? Besides, you don't know me and you do not definitely know the kind of people I support and try to help. They come from all kinds of faiths, religions, races e.t.c. So I do know that I am supporting this chap just because I feel like he is being treated unfairly and it is an added fact that he is of the same faith as me so I automatically understand better of his plight and at the least try to help.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, are you working for SAF? Because, your arguments are dogmatically inclined towards supporting SAF.</p>
              <p>Its quite interesting to see the way you structure your thoughts and puke them out on the forums:</p>
              <p>"so
                                      you're saying that at as a brahmin (your words), and coming from
                                      the same religion (your words again),you're on this chap's side,
                                      not because he's of the same stripe ? .... riiiiiiiiiiiight. &lt;= <strong>Your Assumption</strong>."</p>
              <p>Well done Mr Assumption guy.</p>
