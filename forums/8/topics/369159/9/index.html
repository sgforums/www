              <p>i'll like you more if you be my shadow and agree with everything
              i say. girls like that really turn me on. like, ok? not love.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for those of you guys who belong to the camp of saying this
              Brahmin guy is trying to chao-keng, fine. How come SAF doesn't shed
              any light about this? does the press (Straits Times) know about
              this?! i hope the temple writes to the ST and get MINDEF to clarify
              things.</p>
              <p>btw, is the guy an Indian from India? if so, how come foreigner
              is serving NS?!</p>
              <p>on behalf of the people of Singapore, i apologize sincerely and
              unabashedly to the good people of India and Krishna. It is a shame
              to have our military behaving in this manner. I just hope the guy
              gets released soon and be treated with dignitity in DB.</p>
              <p>btw, the thought of a decent, good and clean Brahmin monk being
              thrown into a stinky DB cell disgusts me. I hope he doesn't share
              the same cell with those gangsters etc.</p>
              <p>as far as i know, some things are "covered up" in the SAF.</p>

              <p>He doesn't have to be an Indian from India, as a Singaporean Indian can also go over there to take the religious tests to be a Brahmin.</p>

              <p>As for the cutting of the hair, if singh is allowed to keep

              <p>As mentioned by TS, unless some details were left unmentioned, I
              feel that since majority race can have their religion rights in
              camp without disrupting the training schedule, I see no reason
              minority race should be left out in this case. I tot Gahmen also
              emphasied on racial tolerance? What I see in TS letter is that
              Gahmen is not upholding what they preached.</p>

As much as PAP groupies think the government is perfect, they do screw up on a regular basis. My police vs army example is a prime example. The Hindu priest guy is another.)</p>

              <p>In fact, that NSF's "priesthood" was conferred by his father, who is the "chief priest" of the temple in Geylang. Just google Hindu priest and you can find the online petition, which has been closed (hahah) and this http://www.krsnamandir.org/home.php</p>

              the 1st place and CO is also somehow involved.</p>

              <p>Don't waste your time talking to that loser idiot Nikar7. He whole day curses the country, the government and SAF. The only thing he can do is talk big using his asshole which is as loose as a 70 year old Geylang whore talking about abandoning SG in the event of war. Why wait for war? It will never come because regionally we're the most heavily armed and powerful armed force so the enemies will unlikely try their luck as long as this maintains.. SO GET THE FUCK OUT ALREADY! Why keep crapping through the asshole on your face about fucking off instead of actually doing it?</p>
