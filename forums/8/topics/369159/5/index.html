              This one new trick to Chao Keng leh. 
              
              I should start a religion in Singapore and the followers can only eat food blessed by me, can only cut hair after marriage, have to fast certain weekdays (weekend no need). If not, I will complain to say that they are against human rights and bully the minority.

                  for the Brahmin caste. What about the other indian castes of
                  Kristhayas, craftsmen, untouchables? How about the muslims, toaist
                  Chinese, confusionists, the other denominations of christians, etc,
                  etc?</p>
              <p>Might as well scrap NS. Close down the army. Save taxpayers
                  money. Let any enemies walk all over our country. Let them
                  take over our banks, our schools and determine who gets to study
                  and who dont. Let them take control of our industries, and who gets
                  employed and who dont. Let the rich flee. Let the
                  poor Singaporeans who could not flee become slaves to the
                  conquerors. Let their citizens get their perks while we become 6th
                  rate slaves, etc, etc.</p>
              <p>Let's all flee. I have an international passport. I have skills,
                  talent and connections to live a good life in US. Do you? Does
                  anyone else in Singapore have what I have? I am sure there are some
                  like me. What about the rest?</p>
              <p>What about Ah Seng, your mechanic who honestly fix up your car.
                  What about Ah Lian, her rice noodles are always tasty as well as
                  her winsome smile. What about Aunty Lim, who always dotes on you
                  whenever you visit her, even though she is not related to you, only
                  that she had been your teacher? What about John, your buddy who
                  always invite you for a boy's nite out whenever you are down with
                  fellow buddies? You wanna flee, and leave them to their fate?</p>
              <p>Who the fuck is being sanctimonious and care about only himself

              <p>What's getting special food which is not even the typical good diet a normal Singaporean usually eats got to do with the caste system or whatever crap you spouting. The fella has already enlisted and did what is required for him as a Singaporean.</p>
              <p>Its not as if he demanded something unachievable, like a caviar and champagne diet. It wont even cost SAF a cent.</p>
              <p>Dont be over dramatic in suggesting to abolish NS just because a lad needs to eat a special diet. It sounds lame.</p>
              <p>The SAF has already allowed certain religious requirements for servicemen, like the Muslims 5 times a day prayers and Friday prayers, provided it doesnt clash with training. Hindus are also allowed to excuse shaving when a death occurs or like some certain festivals. There are also Taoist who are allowed to wear amulets and Sikhs who allowed to wear a turban and go without helmet. Overall as long as it does not affect the ops readiness of the military, then i think his commanders should be flexible.</p>
              <p>The last time i checked, the SAF serves to defend the country and people, and our people have different etnic backgrounds and religions. To deny this lad his religious right to eat what is required for him as a priest is just gonna alienate people who practise Hinduism. Dont equate asking for small provisions as a way of trying to keng or malinger.</p>
              <p>Last point, the lad readily enlisted into the army and not escaping to some other countries or feinting illness. Unlike some faggot violinist who just paid a fine and forget about it.</p>

              <p>In fact I believe in , SOP and reality is very different. I had expereinced it myself in unit. i dont blame the org. But the people who run it.. Like i said Inexpereinced force + conscripts waiting for 2 year to be over + regular who need income = U know what. And add in the fact that our immature army is not active duty of combat like other countries, petty things  take mainstage. If u lookd at other countries armies, they have already crossed this stage and see the big picture. Time that we move on to a professional army.</p>
              <p>Even if this priest NSF wan to to stir up shit because of something else we dont know of,  it tells a lot about our current generation. They are not happy, maybe. Which means SAF needs to revamp its system.</p>
              <p>I used to know  colonel ( a good friend of mine) from the ammo dump unit. I was a small fry corporal then . He is an amazingly  nice fellow, humble and no airs about him who has been there for more than 25 years. We used to have drinks together at the spec mess and even my OC knows he is my good friend as he has seen us together .</p>
              <p>All of subordinates all like him and they talk to him as a good friend and someone to confide him. I really felt that he is the wrong guy at the wrong place. He always says that SAF is inflexible and overly paranoid about things.</p>

              <p>how is he screwing up a unit operations?</p>
              <p>is taking care of his food and other misc needs so hard?</p>
              <p>food wise, the unit's ration master will take care of it and it's very easy (btw, i'm in charge of my camp's meals last time). the other issues are not the main problem as it is mostly food causing issues in this case.</p>
              <p>is it because he is Indian from India and that's why SAF treating him like this?! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></p>
              <p>and considering that SAF will lose any war it fights, let's not talk about operations cos' we have none.</p>

              <p>Well, if they can prove that he is indeed a priest, the SAf should make some allowance.</p>
              <p>For some chinese, they don't take beef. For muslim, they don't take pork.</p>
              <p>Since they make an effort to deliver what that kid can only eat, then SAF should at least give the respect in allowing them to do so. It is not like giving the kid special treatment but showing respect for the religion.</p>
              <p>It is like forcing the muslim to take non halal food and focing the singh to shave their heads.</p>
