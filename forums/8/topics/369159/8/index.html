              <p>Oh, so that means that if I didn't do the NS then I can't
              comment on a topic concerning them? What kinda reasoning is that?
              Besides, you don't know me and you do not definitely know the kind
              of people I support and try to help. They come from all kinds of
              faiths, religions, races e.t.c. So I do know that I am supporting
              this chap just because I feel like he is being treated unfairly and
              it is an added fact that he is of the same faith as me so I
              automatically understand better of his plight and at the least try
              to help.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, are you working for SAF? Because, your
              arguments are dogmatically inclined towards supporting SAF.</p>
              <p>Its quite interesting to see the way you structure your thoughts
              and puke them out on the forums:</p>
              <p>"so you're saying that at as a brahmin (your words), and coming
              from the same religion (your words again),you're on this chap's
              side, not because he's of the same stripe ? .... riiiiiiiiiiiight.
              &lt;= <strong>Your Assumption</strong>."</p>
              <p>Well done Mr Assumption guy.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>of course ... you cannot put a direct answer to the arguments I have posted ...... you cannot respond directly to what I have to say about how the SAF is behaving towards this case ....</p>
              <p>because .... you have not served ... you have not put on the uniform of this country before ... you have not put in your time in that organization before ... you have not been under, and worked in, the system before .....hey, it's not even your army, eh ? you are only here on sufferance ....</p>
              <p>does that make you a qualified, unbiased observer, especially when in the very first post, you affirm where you stand by stating that the fellow is your caste and religious brethren ? ..... hardly, eh ? ...</p>
              <p>so what about your assumptions, then ? .... you assumed that the SAF is unfairly treating your caste and religious brethren .... that is your first assumption .... and you persist in defending him even after people point out that it's highly unlikely his story is ..... so you are telling me that you jumped into this without your own assumptions and bias ? ..... *snorts </p>
              <p>but hey, of course, that's only understandable, that your first reaction would be to defend your own kind ..... </p>
              <p>and again ... the door out is always open ... just close it after you leave ....</p>

              <p>Somehow I feel that this thread is getting out of hand.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who had never served NS, I think you should not and are not qualified to even comment on the runnings and operations of SAF.</p>
              <p>True, most of us hate it, but we do hold good memories, even in doing Shit jobs. It's really different and cannot be explained with words until you serve it fully.</p>
              <p>Now, for a case in DB, there must be a section which the soldier has to be charged at. Definitely not charging a person for promoting masterbation (though it is possible) or extra services in geylang.</p>
              <p>Thing is, to land someone in DB, there must be a valid charge reason to put him there. As much as there are injustice going around, no one ends up in DB without proper reasoning. And there is the ever so powerful section 25, can't remember what is says but it means charging a person with actions against the good will of SAF... anyone can help refresh me memory on section 25?</p>
              <p>So, the priest dude, probably he did something very very wrong and ended up there. If you think commanders love or like to charge anyone, think again.</p>

                                you have to be against him. I have seen and knew a few of these
                                myself. They are often viewed by others to be pious, but when you
                                know them better, you realise that they all have motive and agenda
                                at the back of their mind. Some behave so petty and calculative and
                                expect things to be presented to them free or below cost just
                                because of their status.</p>

                                <p>For this priest, ask him to make a vow infront of his God that
                                he had never once thought of making use of the religion to get an
                                easy way out from NS. If he really believe in God he will not make
                                the vow. Because being human, it must have crossed his mind.</p>

              <p>For those who had never served NS, I think you should not and
              are not qualified to even comment on the runnings and operations of
              SAF.</p>
              <p>True, most of us hate it, but we do hold good memories, even in
              doing Shit jobs. It's really different and cannot be explained with
              words until you serve it fully.</p>
              <p>Now, for a case in DB, there must be a section which the soldier
              has to be charged at. Definitely not charging a person for
              promoting masterbation (though it is possible) or extra services in
              geylang.</p>
              <p>Thing is, to land someone in DB, there must be a valid charge
              reason to put him there. As much as there are injustice going
              around, no one ends up in DB without proper reasoning. And there is
              the ever so powerful section 25, can't remember what is says but it
              means charging a person with actions against the good will of
              SAF... anyone can help refresh me memory on section 25?</p>
              <p>So, the priest dude, probably he did something very very wrong
              and ended up there. If you think commanders love or like to charge
              anyone, think again.</p>

              <p>for those of you guys who belong to the camp of saying this Brahmin guy is trying to chao-keng, fine. How come SAF doesn't shed any light about this? does the press (Straits Times) know about this?! i hope the temple writes to the ST and get MINDEF to clarify things.</p>
              <p>btw, is the guy an Indian from India? if so, how come foreigner is serving NS?!</p>
              <p>on behalf of the people of Singapore, i apologize sincerely and unabashedly to the good people of India and Krishna. It is a shame to have our military behaving in this manner. I just hope the guy gets released soon and be treated with dignitity in DB.</p>
              <p>btw, the thought of a decent, good and clean Brahmin monk being thrown into a stinky DB cell disgusts me. I hope he doesn't share the same cell with those gangsters etc.</p>
              <p>as far as i know, some things are "covered up" in the SAF.</p>

              <p>Sure, the lad may not be trying to evade NS totally, but he's an idiot for reasons that I mentioned 2 pages ago. And there must be a reason why easily-granted concessions were withheld from him - I suspect that the petition is hedging the truth about his innocence and actions.</p>
