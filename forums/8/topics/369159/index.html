              his compulsory National Service as a Private at Jurong Camp 1), is a Hindu
              Brahmin priest and as a priest, he has to follow strict dietary principles of
              our faith by not eating meat, fish, eggs, onion, garlic and mushrooms. We are
              not allowed any intoxication including coffee and tea. Our priests only eat
              food cooked as prayer offerings, technically called Prasadam.</span></p>

              to have his food brought in from the temple. Upon completion of his BMT, he was
              posted as a driver. The commanding officer then made a request for him to be
              posted as a clerk so that he could be allowed to have his food brought from the
              temple and perform his national service without compromising his faith.</span></p>

              disallowed to have his meals to be brought to him from the temple. We have sent
              a letter dated 15 May 2009 to Mindef about this situation but they flatly
              denied providing any assistance. He is allowed to book out of the camp every
              Tuesday and Thursday evening and the weekends. Only then has he the chance to
              eat a proper meal at the temple whereas the rest of the days, he is sustaining
              on dry ration brought from the temple on Tuesdays and Thursdays.</span></p>

              and have asked him to cut off his Sikha, the tuft of hair kept by Hindu
              priests. They charged him twice; once for food and once for the sikha. He chose
              to go for court marshal. He was told that the trial would be in two weeks%u2019
              time. While he was waiting for his trial, they suddenly charged him again for
              the same %u201Coffence%u201D and took him on the 20th of July, 2009, to the
              Detention Barracks (DB), the army jail for an indefinite period of rigorous
              punishment. But Madana Mohan Das is going on a hunger strike until death,
              inside the jail as he would not eat anything except Krishna Prasadam
              (sanctified food), being a full-time temple priest all his life.</span></p>

              provision to have Halal food. The Sikhs are allowed to keep their long hair
              covered with a turban. Why then can't a Hindu priest be given facility to practice
              his religion peacefully? Is it because we are a minority that we can be played
              around with? Is this what our country's much-advertised multi-racial and
              multi-religious harmony stands for? We don't think so. But we are confused by
              this incident.</span></p>

              would like to emphasize that we fully support Madana Mohan Das serving his
              national service. But we are very much disturbed by the insensitivity shown by
              his superiors towards his religious faith.</span></p>

              think that the citizens of Singapore in general, regardless of race, religion,
              caste, creed and color, agree that everyone has the right to practice his/her
              religion freely. We humbly request you to spread this word around for the sake
              of upholding justice. Please send this to as many people as possible.</span></p>

              <p>everyone have their religious convictions too, some of the old catholics I know .... die die must go for morning mass everyday ....</p>
              <p>so a kid comes along and say "I also ! " ... he gets everything lah ? ....</p>
              <p>so a kid comes along and say "I must go to church and cell meetings 3 times a week ! it's my religious right !" .. so no need night training liao lah  ? .....</p>
              <p>so a buddhist kid comes along and say "I must niam keng at the temple every morning, cos I'm a novice monk ! it's my religious right !" .... he gets to stay out or skip NS lah ? ....</p>
              <p>or a sikh kid comes along and say "I must carry a sword with me at all times, as commanded by my religion, it's my religious right !" ... so how ?!?! (and it has already happened, in canada !)</p>
              <p>wah ! ...... good idea to chao keng eh ? ..... play the religious card ... so they won't dare to touch you ? Remember, when you claim some rights for yourself, you're also taking away some rights from others, what is fair to one person would be unfair favouritism for others ....</p>
              <p>as to the fellow, I think he should shut up and serve, instead of stirring up shit and making trouble ....</p>

              <p>so back to the question .... where do you draw the line ? ......</p>
              <p>take those charismatic churches for example ..... everyone can be a cell leader, can lead a church, can be a pastor ...........they are not just "anyone" in that religion too, eh ? .....</p>
              <p>so "Sir ! ... I want nights off on monday ! wed ! and friday ! and I cannot do any sort of duty or training on the weekends ! cos my church cell and flock needs me to be around ! ... it's my religious right !"</p>
              <p>what does it sound like ? favouritism ? ... playing the religious card ? .... chao keng excuse ? .... what would the other men in the same unit as someone like this, who has to shoulder the responsibilities of this "special" man, think ?</p>
              <p>so if some obscure and unknown tibetan buddhist monk comes along and point out some 18 yr old singapore boy as the incarnation of some ancient monk, he gets to skip NS ? ....</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; line-height: 13.5pt;"><span>My dear brothers and sisters of Singapore and
              humanity in general,</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 13.5pt;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; line-height: 13.5pt;"><span>We request your urgent attention!</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 13.5pt;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; line-height: 13.5pt;"><span>Madana Mohan Das (a full-time Hindu Priest, IC No.:
              S9029832A, serving his compulsory National Service as a Private at
              Jurong Camp 1), is a Hindu Brahmin priest and as a priest, he has
              to follow strict dietary principles of our faith by not eating
              meat, fish, eggs, onion, garlic and mushrooms. We are not allowed
              any intoxication including coffee and tea. Our priests only eat
              food cooked as prayer offerings, technically called
              Prasadam.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 13.5pt;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; line-height: 13.5pt;"><span>When he was enlisted into Basic Military Training
              (BMT), he was allowed to have his food brought in from the temple.
              Upon completion of his BMT, he was posted as a driver. The
              commanding officer then made a request for him to be posted as a
              clerk so that he could be allowed to have his food brought from the
              temple and perform his national service without compromising his
              faith.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 13.5pt;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; line-height: 13.5pt;"><span>However we were told that this request was rejected
              and he has been disallowed to have his meals to be brought to him
              from the temple. We have sent a letter dated 15 May 2009 to Mindef
              about this situation but they flatly denied providing any
              assistance. He is allowed to book out of the camp every Tuesday and
              Thursday evening and the weekends. Only then has he the chance to
              eat a proper meal at the temple whereas the rest of the days, he is
              sustaining on dry ration brought from the temple on Tuesdays and
              Thursdays.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 13.5pt;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; line-height: 13.5pt;"><span>In the meantime, his superiors forced him to eat the
              food at his camp and have asked him to cut off his Sikha, the tuft
              of hair kept by Hindu priests. They charged him twice; once for
              food and once for the sikha. He chose to go for court marshal. He
              was told that the trial would be in two weeks%u2019 time. While he
              was waiting for his trial, they suddenly charged him again for the
              same %u201Coffence%u201D and took him on the 20th of July, 2009, to
              the Detention Barracks (DB), the army jail for an indefinite period
              of rigorous punishment. But Madana Mohan Das is going on a hunger
              strike until death, inside the jail as he would not eat anything
              except Krishna Prasadam (sanctified food), being a full-time temple
              priest all his life.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 13.5pt;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; line-height: 13.5pt;"><span>Is this justice? In the national service, the
              Muslims are given provision to have Halal food. The Sikhs are
              allowed to keep their long hair covered with a turban. Why then
              can't a Hindu priest be given facility to practice his religion
              peacefully? Is it because we are a minority that we can be played
              around with? Is this what our country's much-advertised
              multi-racial and multi-religious harmony stands for? We don't think
              so. But we are confused by this incident.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 13.5pt;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; line-height: 13.5pt;"><span>The victim is not against serving his national
              service, nor are we. We would like to emphasize that we fully
              support Madana Mohan Das serving his national service. But we are
              very much disturbed by the insensitivity shown by his superiors
              towards his religious faith.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 13.5pt;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; line-height: 13.5pt;"><span>Fervent appeals to different ministers of
              influential disposition were to no avail. So we are appealing to
              you people for support in a bid to uphold justice and basic human
              rights.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 13.5pt;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; line-height: 13.5pt;"><span>Therefore, we are here on a campaign to let
              everybody know about the injustice and religious intolerance shown
              to an 18-year old Hindu priest. We think that the citizens of
              Singapore in general, regardless of race, religion, caste, creed
              and color, agree that everyone has the right to practice his/her
              religion freely. We humbly request you to spread this word around

              <p>And especially when it comes to religious and medical issues ..... which SAF commander you know, would dare to mess around with these issues, unless he's absolutely sure that what he's doing, is right, and covers his own ass, right ? ..... </p>
              <p>it's only when the NSFs try to rock the boat too hard and play punk or think it's his father's army would they bestir themselves and lash out ....</p>
              <p>I've seen too many examples ... fellows getting excuses for nipples pain ... fellow who keng to service side, and then keng stay out by producing some dubious doctor's letter saying the camp is too "dusty", "rusty" etc ... all sorts of excuses .... most COs would just nod their head just to get you out of their offices, they want no trouble and just peace too, neh ? .... it's only when you cross the line ... push the envelope, took a yard instead of an inch ... then they'll say, okie, hold on boy ! ....</p>
              <p>I have no sympathies for this fellow ... but I definitely feel sorry for the fellows who have to deal with this twerb, and especially those fellow NSFs who have to put up with this man.</p>

              <p>How can one claims to be supporting NS when one asks for special priviledges, priviledges that only he alone can get while others are denied?</p>
              <p>Thus is or is not the petitioner supporting NS? NS is about youths being taught defensive skills to protect our society to be prepared for adverse situations inclusive of outright conflicts, which is total and incorporates all aspects in engagement of defensive battles, details which are regimented down to the food they eat.</p>
              <p>Should there be an outbreak of hostilities between nations and the 'priest' is called to war, will he be allowed to eat his special meals, or partake in whatever that is avaliable, in order to be ready for battle?</p>
              <p>Why should other Singaporean boys be made to take on further responsibilities that the 'priest' should rightly perform as is his duty to society for being given the priviledge of citizenship even if by birth?</p>
              <p>All in all, this is nothing to do with 'religious persecution', but more an outright attempt to assert and impose one's religion for special priviledge in our secular society.</p>
              <p>Where do we draw the line then, when special priviledges are called for, in an equal secular society? This we must sorely ask, before we sign on the dotted line to petition. We are not India with adoption of their caste system in our society, or Muslim Iran ruled by clerics. We are Singapore, an independent secular republic.</p>
