              <p>The problem with SAF regular ( not the org) is excessive
              paranoia and ignorance. As usual SAF is run by people, the same
              sucky people u find else where in the workforce. Their paranoia
              blinds them from seeing truth to the point that everything becomes
              questionable to them. I afraid that such mentality during war , the
              enemies can deceive the SAF ( which has no war expereince) by
              manipulating it and then finally defeat them in their own ground. I
              am very sorry , but this is one of the things said in the Art of
              War - Deception using paranoia. Time and again it has been used in
              the world wars and before it to great effectiveness...</p>

              <p>80% of SAF are NSF who are forced to serve against their wishes and are just waiting for the 2 years to pass by. The remaining 20% of Regulars some are being tricked into signing on while some sign on because they need the money and some others are just waiting for retirement.</p>
              <p>With such type of people in SAF, it isn't a surprise that respecting other people's religion such a simple issue they also don't understand</p>
              <p>What can you expect from such an orgainisation? Expect them to be able to defend singapore? Wait long long lor.</p>

              <p>Just to reply to some of these posts:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>1) Everyone should serve NS unconditionally, it doesn't matter what race/religion you are from.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>OK, if you really think that, then stop halal &amp; vegetarian food from being served in canteens, and don't allow Islamic scholars to keep their beards or Sikh men their turbans and beards. If the army can make these accommodations for other religions, then a full-time Hindu priest should be allowed to keep his tuft of hair. He has the grace to have meals prepared at the temple without incurring inconvenience to the SAF cooks and only asks that it be allowed onto army grounds.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The comparison to JWs is ridiculous - the petition clearly states that he fully intends to serve his NS term engaging in all the activities and training that a soldier needs in order to be contigency-ready (even though as a priest, his personal convictions would lean towards non-violence).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>2) He is stirring up shit.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After making pleas to his officers, senior officers, being charged twice for the same offences, being forced to cut off his tuft and eat non-sanctified food,and writing to MINDEF, when finally ministers/MPs are approached that's considered stirring up shit? Please.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>3) He is trying to reinstate the caste system.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yeah, because in the petition he totally refused to touch other servicemen, right? Most Hindus in the caste system today don't ven follow that archaic convention, whether you're Brahmin, Kshatriya Dalit or anything else. Please don't hold these false notions about what Hindus today do and do not practise.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I agree that there are limits to accommodation, which occur when you infringe on someone else's rights. He is hurting noone by doing this, and the 5 minutes it would take to check his food packet as a precautionary measure is nothing compared to the wholehearted service he is willing to engage in. This whole episode is probably a bureaucratic mixup anyway, because I have enough faith in our army to believe that they would not as a whole unit violate any faiths.</p>

              <p>There are critial mass to other faiths if tomorrow thousands of hindu priest enter NS, SAF also lan lan must cater also.</p>
              <p>But thats not the case, if other hindus who are not priest can manage day-to-day meals why can't he? Plus, ask any NSF, why he can so good book out every tuesday/thursday? Does that mean he does not need to do duty on that day also? Wah! So good ah! There are ppl who have finacial difficulties, sole bread winner who kena screwed everyday and can only book out on weekends, then these ppl how?</p>
              <p>Dude, the line must be drawn and SAF did. Ask your friend to compromise abit, this world is not fair, u dun get ur way everytime, I am surprised as a priest he cannot comprehend this fact.</p>
              <p>Plus, all we heard is TS one side story what about the other side? The full story? Most SAF officers can "close-one-eye" when it comes down to faiths, to me something must have happen to make SAF draw the line so clearly.</p>

              <p>How can one claims to be supporting NS when one asks for special
                                  priviledges, priviledges that only he alone can get while others
                                  are denied?</p>
              <p>Thus is or is not the petitioner supporting NS? NS is about
                                  youths being taught defensive skills to protect our society to be
                                  prepared for adverse situations inclusive of outright conflicts,
                                  which is total and incorporates all aspects in engagement of
                                  defensive battles, details which are regimented down to the food
                                  they eat.</p>
              <p>Should there be an outbreak of hostilities between nations and
                                  the 'priest' is called to war, will he be allowed to eat his
                                  special meals, or partake in whatever that is avaliable, in order
                                  to be ready for battle?</p>
              <p>Why should other Singaporean boys be made to take on
                                  further responsibilities that the 'priest' should rightly perform
                                  as is his duty to society for being given the priviledge of
                                  citizenship even if by birth?</p>
              <p>All in all, this is nothing to do with 'religious persecution',
                                  but more an outright attempt to assert and impose one's religion
                                  for special priviledge in our secular society.</p>
              <p>Where do we draw the line then, when special priviledges are
                                  called for, in an equal secular society? This we must sorely
                                  ask, before we sign on the dotted line to petition. We are not
                                  India with adoption of their caste system in our society, or Muslim
                                  Iran ruled by clerics. We are Singapore, an independent secular
                                  republic.</p>
