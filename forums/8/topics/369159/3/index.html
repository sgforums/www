              pre-requisite for the nutcases to serve is to
              have their meds on time and on target, else they go amok.</p>
              <p>If the Hindu priest can eat sanctified dried rations which by
              right, should last for a whole week, then he could jolly well
              prepped the rations way ahead of time. Else, why bother to serve
              the national service in the army? Second, before enlistment(i.e at
              CMPB), Madana should have enquired as to whether he should be
              transfered to another service like Police or SCDF due to his
              religious practices.</p>

              <p>yes each religion has their own set of rules, but let me also say that if a particular religion is allowed to be practiced in singapore, it must also accept the singapore system and practices and in this case the saf.</p>
              <p>and if a particular rule is of importance, the saf will accomodate that particular religion's request such as muslims having friday prayers, being served halal food, sikhs being allowed to wear their turbans etc.</p>
              <p>so im afraid your theory of the saf have got no case just because the priests rules are in black and white does not stand.</p>

              singapore, it must also accept the singapore system and practices
              and in this case the saf.</p>
              <p>and if a particular rule is of importance, the saf will
              accomodate that particular religion's request such as muslims
              having friday prayers, being served halal food, sikhs being allowed
              to wear their turbans etc.</p>
              <p>so im afraid your theory of the saf have got no case just
              because the priests rules are in black and white does not
              stand.</p>

              <p>The problem with SAF regular ( not the org) is excessive paranoia and ignorance. As usual SAF is run by people, the same sucky people u find else where in the workforce. Their paranoia blinds them from seeing truth to the point that everything becomes questionable to them. I afraid that such mentality during war , the enemies can deceive the SAF ( which has no war expereince) by manipulating it and then finally defeat them in their own ground. I am very sorry , but this is one of the things said in the Art of War - Deception using paranoia. Time and again it has been used in the world wars and before it to great effectiveness...</p>
              <p>18. All warfare is based on deception.<br><br>19. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable;<br>    when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we<br>    are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away;<br>    when far away, we must make him believe we are near.<br><br>20.
