              <p>how is he screwing up a unit operations?</p>
              <p>is taking care of his food and other misc needs so hard?</p>
              <p>food wise, the unit's ration master will take care of it and
              it's very easy (btw, i'm in charge of my camp's meals last time).
              the other issues are not the main problem as it is mostly food
              causing issues in this case.</p>
              <p>is it because he is Indian from India and that's why SAF
              treating him like this?! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">and considering that SAF will lose any war it fights, let's not
              talk about operations cos' we have none.</span></p>

              <p>i agree totally. Totally. Nowadays, if you read SAF magazines (Pioneer etc) or read news, SAF is talking and raving non-stop about it's latest purchase of the latest fighter planes, latest submarines, latest howitzers, latest destroyer, latest gadetry (how about that handheld network PDA where one carries into the battlefield and use that atrocious stylus pen to send info back to HQ.......u think wartime conditions will let u use PDA as if you're in office environment).......anyone who follows the news will know what i'm refering to.</p>
              <p>i sincerely, as a Singaporean, plead with MINDEF to stop dreaming and instead focus more on the troops. Ever since all these 3G crap started, MINDEF seems obsessed with the latest gear and hardware. In battle, the most important thing is soldiers, get real.</p>
              <p>making people serve conscription, nobody is happy. The least they can do is to provide better welfare. Every truthful NSF here who served 2 years army knows how low morale is during our NS years. Come on, no need to deny.</p>

              <p>i agree totally. Totally. Nowadays, if you read SAF magazines
              (Pioneer etc) or read news, SAF is talking and raving non-stop
              about it's latest purchase of the latest fighter planes, latest
              submarines, latest howitzers, latest destroyer, latest gadetry (how
              about that handheld network PDA where one carries into the
              battlefield and use that atrocious stylus pen to send info back to
              HQ.......u think wartime conditions will let u use PDA as if you're
              in office environment).......anyone who follows the news will know
              what i'm refering to.</p>
              <p>i sincerely, as a Singaporean, plead with MINDEF to stop
              dreaming and instead focus more on the troops. Ever since all these
              3G crap started, MINDEF seems obsessed with the latest gear and
              hardware. In battle, the most important thing is soldiers, get
              real.</p>
              <p>making people serve conscription, nobody is happy. The least
              they can do is to provide better welfare. Every truthful NSF here
              who served 2 years army knows how low morale is during our NS
              years. Come on, no need to deny.</p>
              <p>In NS, my camp mates always keep reminding each other of ORD
              dates and the slogan was "Serve and fark off". U think with
              mentalities like this, Singapore can win war?!</p>

              <p>Bro,Relying too much on technology  when it fails. its all over."Serve and fark off" mentality came about because</p>
              <p>1) the constant abuse NSF face during NS demoralises them</p>
              <p>2) NS itself is too long</p>
              <p>3) Reservist</p>
              <p>4) low salary</p>
              <p>There are ways that mIndef can save $$$.</p>
              <p>Let NSF stay out for higher morale, save on food costs</p>
              <p>cut down on reservist saves a lot of cost</p>

They are often viewed by others to be pious, but when you know them better, you realise that they all have motive and agenda at the back of their mind.

              <p>Dun ask me for names as it does me no good.</p>
              <p>For this priest, ask him to make a vow infront of his God that he had never once thought of making use of the religion to get an easy way out from NS. If he really believe in God he will not make the vow. Because being human, it must have crossed his mind.</p>
