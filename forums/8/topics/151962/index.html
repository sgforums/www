            <div class='col-md body'>The most happening class!. So many funny characters. The year was in 1997, last year of my sec school.............<br><br>There was this good looking street-smart Indian guy who always talk sh%t and likes to get into trouble with teachers. He said something, everyone laughs. Havving long hair at the back , he was a romeo as well always hooking up the Malay Indian girls and some Chinese girls too talked to him .Normally he YAH-YAH around with his Tamiileh Makalz rapper group, appeared on local Indian TV variety shows and likes to play soccer. And always talking loud. He made a bug fuss when his precious long hair at the back got cut after inspection one day. As expected , He flunked his O's. The last piece of news I heard of him was that now married and having a kid probably shotgun. given his stylo-milo attitude,  high likelyhood he will be still be in the clubbing and street scene now...Nice guy though but with a wrong attitude towards life.<br><br>Then there was this sexy chiobu who was always lonely and never talked much to anyone except for a few girls like her from the other classes and has that "femme fatale", sexy kitten thingie about her..mostly the Indian guy talked to her. But she was still into the rest of us as she turns up sometimes but minimally for our class parties but usually with her boyfriend<br>Even the teachers didnt disturb her. All the guys fantasised about her big boobs  but she had an older guy as her boyfriend at the time who used to pick her up after school. She too didnt make it thru her Os. Saw her working in Takashimaya some time after the 0's graduation. IMO given her image, she will have no problems hooking a rich guy and settling down in life<br>According to sources  still the same sexy kitten..No news of her since.<br><br>Then there was this really sad depressive girl who suffered an inferiority complex was always lonely. She was not good-looking. Basically everyone of us ignored her. She didn even turned up for allo ur class gatherings and outings..She was non existent to us. But i guess these kind of people goes to JC which she did exactly. She could have gone  to University and now holding a degree. Maybe now  i guess she's feeling pity for the rest of us. I recall once think did see her on a bus or well she could have matured now..hopefully in a emotional way.....<br><br>Then there this Mat wearing Oakley/Rayban type of glasses , like a typical Malay, likes to act nerdy-cool , don funny hair cuts and likes to bring his guitar to school...... "relak one corner" kind of  Mat.....seldom talks a word, slow watchful &amp; calculative..His Kaki were me and the Indian guy though not close. Even when the DM catches or scolds him for something, he remains calm and cool and says "relak ah".....One day his guitar  sh%t got confiscated.AHAHA!. But this guy managed to pass his Os and few years ago when i met him , he was studying in poly doing his final year. Maybe he didnt "relak" too much afterall......<br><br>Then there was this lively cheerleader sporty type of girl who was always popular with the guys. She was just average looking but imo had a great sense of humour, innocent attitude  friendly to everyone and possess leadership qualties. Likes to listen to grunge and rap music. She was also the teachers' pet and always supported our class. Actively involved in ECA and sports.The centre of attraction in all our BBQ parties. Good natured girl though She passed her Os with flying colours and made it to , as u guessed it - Poly as the environment there was more suited to her attitude and thinking.Many will wish her all the best. ....Probably she will still be in involved in the vibrant social scene<br><br>Then there was this really rich Ah Beng who comes to school not to study but enjoy himself getting attention. Well he treated us poorer guys very well always paying for out food and outing. Organises parties and BBq all the time. Realli good guy. Spends money like water.... He doesnt need to study for all the wealth he had. He didnt either. He flunked his O's , maybe probaby he's taking care of his father's business now. Could be riding on the same high lifestyle again.Truly fit for a king<br><br><strong>And finally there was and there is the only me </strong>- the most cunning character in the class. I practically made use of everyone for my favours. From the Rich Ah Beng to the nerd girl. Indian romeo and sexy chiobu.I dont want to blow my own trumpet. In short i was the  manipulator, the puppet master working behind the scene backstage.   Ok well, that's about it.<br><br>Now back to 2005. Time to work<br><br>Anyone  wish to share your own version , by all means do so.</div>
