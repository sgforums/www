            <div class='col-md body'>ever since i've come out of a serious relationship sometime back, i haven't met anyone whom i actually fancied. 2 yrs now. last night, i met this girl at the building i stay (3doors down), she had the face of an angel and her hair flowed like the sea. her moves were so smooth that they were sensual to almost sexual. i approached her, but i was just so entranced by her eyes that i lost all control of myself and blurted out how beautiful i thought she was and what beautiful eyes she had. thing is, i kinda screwed uped the way i said it. i kinda went "look!i just don't want u to get the wrong idea but i just told my friend how absolutely stunning i tot u were and how mesmerizing ur eyes were". That freaked her out really badly. she brushed me off and never gave me her number and has avoided me ever since.she's a heavy clubber and party girl though her style and grace did not say so - SHE'S NEVER AROUND EVERY NIGHT ! even the day. Anyway.. I managed to get her number off a friend eventually.. and I called her and I could tell that she didn't want to talk to me. She walked by me a few times pretending I wasn't there. Today I met her at her door.. and she looked at me for a sec then looked away and just walked off .. leaving me in the midst of "hey..".. my heart's broken  and there's this guy that looks like ****, attitude really bad and all always with her .. she just broke up with her overseas bf 2 weeks ago .. so its really fast that she has a new bf ..  *heartbroken sad* .. anyway how should i mend my broken heart?? based on how she treats me, how should i react whenever I see her now (quite often)??</div>
