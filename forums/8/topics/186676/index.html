            <div class='col-md body'>..... It is great place to be if are a nature lover, the magnificent outdoor. It is called the Northern Territory of Australia..best known as the Outback. The weather is almost liked Singapore. It is different from other cities liked the Brisbane, Gold Coast, Melbourn, Perth or Sidney, where you can shop or the night life are more colourful. There are one or two Shopping areas in Darwin at the Casuarina. Besides this and the Mindil beach casino, the rest of the town is very quiet especially after 5pm.<br><br>The best things to do in Darwin is rent a car or jeep and drive out of town to discover the outback. This I assured you, no word can described the experience. Go to Howard Spring, the water is crystal clear and you can just dive in and swim, don't worry no crocodile. Yarawongar Zoo, you will see the biggest crocodiles, pat and feed the kangaroos and others local animals. Doctors Gulley, wait for the tide to rise and go in the water, lots of fish swim around the shore, big and small one, buy some bread and feed them. Sometimes they were swim around your legs and nibbled. There is a place where you have row and row of giant ants hill, amazing how these small creatures can bulit!!<br><br>Go to a small town call Alice spring, lots of local products to buy and don't forget to climb the Ayers rock, it changes colour at different times of the day. Watch the sunset, Incredible scene. At night in Darwin are just pubbing and drinking nothing much. Don't forget to go to the nude beach though, it's far out mann... all the naked people walking around liked nobody buisness and camera allow. Can take lah but don't get caught.<br><br>Make friends with the locals they are very friendly. If you are lucky, they might invite you to their home for a tea party. Also make friends with the Aboriginals, the natives of Australia. They might looked fierce, but amicable and fun. Darwin is a laidback town, to relax and idle is ideal, not much of excitment. Unless you drive and go out of it, then the wonders await you. The food there nothing to shout about, fish n chips ,hamburgers, hotdogs and some chinese restaurants. If you are craving about shopping then Darwin is not the right place. Strictly for the outdoor type.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
