These tradesmen can earn Â£2,000 (S$6,380) a week because of the shortage of plumbers in virtually every city and town in Britain<br><br>By Alfred Lee<br>STRAITS TIMES EUROPE BUREAU<br><br>LONDON - Thousands of British graduates are taking up courses to be plumbers, gas fitters or car mechanics, because they cannot find work or because these jobs pay far more than their current work which required university degrees.<br><br>With 280,000 young people graduating from higher education institutions in Britain last year - over 70 per cent more than a decade ago - a third either cannot find work or have been forced to take part-time jobs, such as hotel receptionists, street research interviewers or supermarket cashiers.<br><br>Plumbing has emerged as the most popular 'must-have' job for many graduates, not only the ones out of work, but also others who want a lucrative career change.<br><br>A shortage of plumbers in virtually every city and town in Britain means that these tradesmen can earn Â£2,000 (S$6,380) a week, because there is so much work available to them and because emergency night-time call-out rates often top Â£130 an hour.<br><br>When Hackney Community College in East London advertised 33 places for people who wanted to be trained as plumbers, they were swamped with 800 applications. About 140 of them were university graduates.<br><br>The college's head of plumbing, Mr Ken Daniels, said: 'I'm teaching one guy who has a degree in anthropology, one with a degree in political science and a lady with a degree in Asian history.'<br><br>Degree holders also flooded the Eden Allied Trades College with applications after it started plumbing courses for 50 people. Of the 920 applicants, 180 were graduates - including a university lecturer who had just obtained a job with a salary of Â£25,000 and a senior lecturer earning Â£44,000, after 17 years.<br><br>The college's chief plumbing instructor, Mr Graham Richards, told The Straits Times: 'I know of six plumbers earning more than Â£100,000 a year. Yes, they work six or sometimes seven days a week, but the number of call-out jobs they can get from homes and companies are almost unlimited.<br><br>'We had planned to have courses for 100 people, but we had to halve that, because two of my lecturers have quit to become plumbers themselves.'<br><br>Meanwhile, Birmingham University is losing a key researcher into the effects of electromagnetic fields on the human body.<br><br>Dr Karl Gensberg, who has a PhD in molecular biology, is abandoning his academic career to become a gas fitter, installing household hot-water boilers and connecting ovens to gas mains.<br><br>Dr Gensberg, 41, who earned Â£23,000 at the university, is confident of tripling his income after completing his course.<br><br>He said: 'I spent seven years reaching the post and the salary I had at the university, but I can earn far, far more than that, as soon as I start working as a gas fitter.'<br><br>Mr Colin Murphy, 29, who has a master's degree in international finance, has given up his job with a large City of London bank to learn to be a car mechanic.<br><br>He expects to double his income. 'I don't mind that the job means dirty hands. It's the money that matters.'<br><br>Copyright @ 2004 Singapore Press Holdings. All rights reserved.<br><br></div>
