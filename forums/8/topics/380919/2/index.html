              <p>Allow me to hazard a guess.</p>
              <p>Stage one.</p>
              <p>Yes, indeed you woke up 12+, but unfortunately, in that sleepy
              state of mind, you thought you woke up, but decided to just close
              your eyes for a few seconds or minutes more, without realizing that
              you slept till 3pm.</p>
              <p>You woke up at 3pm+, but did not look at the clock. You just
              simply went into the shower, and then the next time you saw the
              time was 3.30pm.</p>
              <p>Usually, since you slept early in the morning, your daily
              schedule may had been unbalanced, and thus the need to sleep longer
              a bit more without realizing it, espacially if it had been a
              dreamless sleep. This is common. Happens to many,</p>
              <p>Stage 2</p>
              <p>You came out of the shower at 3.30pm. But then, this was not the
              time you step out of your house. You were still in the zombie
              imbalance state of mind. You probably took some time to do other
              things before leaving the house, perhaps at 3.55pm. WIth your blood
              flowing normally thru your mind by excercising thru a walk, your
              mind is sharpened, at more aware now of the time on reaching home
              at 4.20pm.</p>
              <p>But the time before that was the result of your tiredness and
              long hours of sleep. Not to worry, you are not mad, or gone thru a
              time warp, or abducted by aliens..hahaha. There is always a logical
              explanation for everything, if you just stop, analyse every moment
              carefully, and fill in the blanks with logic and reason first.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
