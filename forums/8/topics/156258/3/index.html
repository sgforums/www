            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Apparently Majusri principal allows that lor.<br><br>My friend who works as a counsellor often goes to school to counsel the delinquent students or give talks at the assembly. When I asked him about Majusri, he only has negative things to say about the school cuz the discipline master always cry for help.<br><br>If I am not wrong, if I remember correctly, the discipline master ever got beaten up by the students or the students' "bradder" . And you know what is worse? The parents think he deserves it, cuz they say that he was too strict to the students.</blockquote>What's the name of your friend? My dad also works as a councelor in the school and have never seen any students beating up anyone. The allegations of the discipline master getting beat up by students or his "bradders" are unfounded and untrue. If your friend really has proof of such incidents isn't he obliged to tell the principal or even the police?<br><br><blockquote>My parents, aunties etc kept insisting that it is a good school just because of its Buddhist based. So what if it is a Buddhist school? It is not run by the monks. They don't impose strict rules and discipline like Shaolin Temple. </blockquote>So you're telling me that a school run like Shaolin Temple would be good for students? .... Right...<br><br><blockquote>From what I know (from the ppl there), every student will "go steady" as early as Secondary One. And by Sec Two, every other student will "join secret society". Nowadays still got this kind of thing one ah?<br></blockquote><blockquote>BGR thingy.... yes... even good schools have kids doing that. But Majusri ratio is 100%. Every single soul has early BGR there. Nobody there will say "I wanna concentrate on my studies first. BGR later." </blockquote><blockquote>SS activities... I always thought this is a passe thing already. Anyway, to have almost everyone in the class to be involved in that? </blockquote>You tell me which school doesnt have students who "go steady" at Secondary One. Just tell me 1 school if you can. By the way, if ur sources are reliable,  <strong>every</strong> student having a girlfriend/boyfriend at Secondary 1 seems way too far-fetched to me.  But that would be good right? Singapore aims to have more babies.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Oh, by the way, not one school have students who do not join secret societies. Sure, many don't. But there is a small number who do and Manjusri is no different. Assuming that Manjusri has a high population of these secret society members is again, your conclusion, not the truth.<br><br><blockquote>A number of them (I dunno the exact percentage lah) quit school by Sec 4.<br>Some will come back after a year, some dun. The school actually allows that.</blockquote>Again, please state how you know that many quit at Sec 4? From what I've read, you're either ignorant or just foolish enough to believe hearsay. Do you know the reasons why they quit school (assuming they did) ? It could be due to financial problems or perhaps even parents being relocated abroad.<br><br>So before you go off and start criticising another school, at least get your facts right (its Manjusri, not Majusri) and not base your criticisms on hearsay and rumours. Hell, if you'd say which school you came from, then perhaps others might have similar negative views on your school. Seems to me that you just prefer slaggin off a school which has nothing to do with you just so that you could feel better about your school.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm a graduate of <strong>Manjusri </strong>secondary school recently... although the school does had its past of bad reputation, but having to say that the school has 100% bgr and ss it aint correct and totally a bias comment. Every school will bound to have its problems and a small population of bad eggs so it's only a minority not as serious as to say 100%. From what i know during my stay with the school, the school does had its bad past but it's been changing through the past few years and for the better. Take me for example i was been gun pointed by my parents to go into the school, but i have indeed benefited through my 5 years of stay, be it in CCA or studies and i'm now currently in poly now. My friends although some are involved in bgr but there are some which doesn't. Moreover even if you're involved in bgr it doesn't mean it will 100% affect your studies if you can balance well with CCA, studies and bgr it aint a problem. As for SS in mjr, i should say it's in the past, as it's been cleaned up, but what is left are just some minority of bad eggs that's all. So please don't base your judgements on views or rumours from the public. Thank you</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ha. My turn to speak.<br><br>I'm also a recent graduate from manjusri (it's MANJUSRI btw) and i admit for the four years i've been there i spent 3 years hating it like crazy. But things change.<br><br>It's very easy to generalise when it comes to neighbourhood schools. Plenty of us get looked down on just because we're not from neighbourhood schools. BGR not EVERYONE has a sec 1. There are plenty in manjusri who up to sec 4 has never even gotten close to holding a girl's hand, let alone going steady. And no, in 4 years i've never heard of anyone joining secret societies. Of course there will always be those few cases of fighting in school but that doesn't mean that you should throw away all your eggs just because of a few rotten ones. You'd be surprised how many of us have good conduct. The very worst trouble i've seen my batch get in was coming to school late. Serious.<br><br>And beating up the discipline master? Hahaha. not very likely. In most cases the management has been quite unresonable to some of the students.<br><br>As for people dropping out during sec 4... I've never seen or heard of any cases, but i'm not saying there isn't lah. But does dropping out of school make a person bad? Does having BGR at sec 1 make a person bad?<br><br>I think not.<br><br>I've spent 3 years hating the school's guts. I've even become famous for being the person that hated the school most during my years there. But since last year i look back and think about everything, the school isn't that bad. It's given me wonderful friends, it has teachers that are VERY DEDICATED to their students and its given me a great secondary school life.. There's no reason to sterotype manjusri students and call all of us bad. Hey, we have 9, 10, 11 pointers alpenty for this year's o level results too. Not too shabby for a neighbourhood school huh?<br><br>So, take this from a former student and hater of manjusri<br>One who's decided to stick up for it<br>and this is my conclusion:<br><br>Manjusri rocks. =)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Allow me to contribute my 2 cents worth in opinion.<br><br>Every school has black sheep and not only MJR has, but that does not mean the whole school is flooded with black sheep.<br><br>BGR happens anywhere in any other schools and not only MJR has. I think it's rather normal as long as it does not at all affect the results of each individual.<br><br>MJR has tried all means to attain  better results for the past years, and should be proud to add that it's a value added school. There is a percentage of Manjusrians attained good results with 8 - 9 distinctions and are already in some JCs.<br><br>People shouldn't be splashing cold water at the Manjusri just by judging from 'hear say hear say'  from the public....without looking into the indepth of the school itself.  The school has handful of caring and dedicated teachers guiding the Manjusrians throughtout.  It's quite an unfair statement to conclude that MJR is a lousy school.<br><br>I'm proud to be a Manjusrian...coz it's here that drills the confidence in me!!<br></div>
