            <div class='col-md body'>I have never seen any good student in Majusri.  (Sorry hor, if anyone here is from there.  You may want to correct me, if you feel wrong).<br><br>My parents, aunties etc kept insisting that it is a good school just because of its Buddhist based.  So what if it is a Buddhist school?  It is not run by the monks.  They don't impose strict rules and discipline like Shaolin Temple.<br><br>My mom even forced me to choose this school in case I don't get into the SAP schools around the East side.<br><br>From what I know (from the ppl there), every student will "go steady" as early as Secondary One.  And by Sec Two, every other student will "join secret society".  Nowadays still got this kind of thing one ah?<br><br>I have seen good students from Gan Eng Seng.  I have also seen civilised students from Bowen.  But what the farking hell is wrong with Majusri???<br>Is it because of its "strategic location" (being in the heart of Red Light District)????</div>

But none is as much as Majusri.  Really.<br><br>SS activities... I always thought this is a passe thing already.  Anyway, to have almost everyone in the class to be involved in that?<br><br>BGR thingy.... yes... even good schools have kids doing that.  But Majusri ratio is 100%.  Every single soul has early BGR there.  Nobody there will say "I wanna concentrate on my studies first.  BGR later."<br><br>Bad things are part of growing up, I agree.  I wasn't a goodie student who only hold books everyday either.  But to grow up in an environment with only 100% bad students and none good?  The school is abnormal.<br><br>Teacher-student problem.... To the extent of joining gang and beat up the discipline master?  Now the discipline master dare not punish the students anymore.  He is afraid of the students already.</div>

I wasn't a goodie student who only hold books everyday either.  But to grow up in an environment with only 100% bad students and none good?  The school is abnormal.<br><br>Teacher-student problem.... To the extent of joining gang and beat up the discipline master?  Now the discipline master dare not punish the students anymore.

            <div class='col-md body'>I got a fair share of bad students in my Sec School too.  SS activities... teacher problem etc.<br><br>SS activities.... some guys join the gang.  Not happy with one of the schoolmate staring.  Got the bradders from the same school and neighbouring school to beat him up.  The discipline master made no hesitance in involving the police and sack the students.  Other students who were suspected involved in this case (they were just merely on good terms with these expelled students before the incident) were given warning letters.  Any student who receives a total of three warning letters will be expelled.<br><br>But those who were directly involved were not given any chance.  One of them is a foreign student and has to be sent back to his own country.<br><br>I didn't come from the same school as LKY or LHL.  Just another school.  But how come my teachers could deal with bad students with a snap of fingers?<br>One of the reasons : the bad students are just the minority.  In the case of manjusri, how to deal with the bad majority???<br><br>Even if MOE trsf my discipline master to MJR, he cannot do anything.  Cuz there are just too many of them.... too many liao.</div>
