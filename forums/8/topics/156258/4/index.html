            <div class='col-md body'>hi! i would like to point out and ask u a few qns.<br><br>firstly, u pointed tat mjr students go steady as soon as they are in sec1 and join secret socity as early as they are in sec 2. may i ask how true it is, and whether where u get ur statistics from. i beg to differ this point, i was an ex student of mjr, but sad to say i wasnt in any secret society as u had mentioned.<br><br>u said that u had seen good students from gan eng seng sch and civilised pupils from bowen sec sch. may i ask why are u holding such a bias view towards them. haven u really witness fights in their sch or to put it in ur terms gansterism  in their schools. perhaps u might one to reconsider this issue.<br><br>most importantly, the veri fact that you said mjr is not a good sch, u are holding prejudice towards us, students of mjr and u are actually making a generalisation. can i ask u, how do u define a good sch? if mjr is not a good sch, if will not produce good students. take myself for example. i may not be the top student in mjr. but i noe that mjr had tought me really values and intergrity. one that u might not even be taught of. if jr is really not a good school, then why am i a high five awardee. perhaps if u dunno wat it is, i shall tell u wat it is. it is an award awarded by the central singapore cdc for outstanding leadership and good academic performances. may i ask if there are such awards given to ur sch.<br><br>i might sound abit to harsh. but pls think twice before making any comments.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey hey.. manjusri is definately not a bad school okie?<br>although i admit that we have early BGR during our sec years...<br>but.. its just isnt rite to say tt 100% of its pupils has BGR in MJR...<br>Its not fair to judge us this way...<br>if its fair, then we can also judge u that u are now quite old from ur posting n replies...<br>which is definately not true rite?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>Thus, u cannot generalise us as a bad school,<br>just because of some rotten eggs in our school,<br>you cannot assume its totally bad rite?<br>Last year, we had 7 or 8 distinction from one of our pupils,<br>this alone can show tt we can produce good and intelligent student,<br>and not jus RI or RGS or some other reowned schools<br>Although we cannot definately produce the best student,<br>we can indeed produce some of the intelligent student.<br>You jus cant say tt we are a bad school.<br>You might encounter some of the bad students,<br>but have you encounter the good students?<br>Do you know that last year, the Buddhist Interact Club students from mjr help to collect unwanted clothes newspaper and old stuffs from the flats around Sims Drive and donate it to some old folks home?<br>We worked from 2pm to around 8pm<br>Although we are drained and wear out, we felt happy that we contribute to the society.<br>Do you consider this as BAD?<br>I certainly DO not think so..<br>Or do you consider MOST of last year sec 4 batch came back to MJR school anniversary to visit the school and teachers as a bad thing to do?<br>I feel that they had a sense of belonging towards the school and sense of gratitude towards their teachers.<br>Do you think bad students would do that?<br>You cant also say that the discipline teacher is afraid of its students and the discipline is not strict enough..<br>One of my sec one student in MJR got into a fight with one of his friends.<br>Being the victim (as he did not attack back), he was sent to 3 days of detention, just because he was beaten up and the attacker was caned by the school.<br>Do you think that school doesnt have enough discipline?<br>If not, can you tell what discipline is truly like?<br><br>If people can stop thinking that MJR is a bad school, which is not true, students in MJR would not act as bad pupils.<br>Just because people thinks that MJR is a bad school and show poor attitude towards the school as well as the students, students in the school also shows poor respect and attitude towards outsiders as the outsiders THEMSELVES show poor respect towards them.<br>This is just a vicious cycle tt continues,<br>and we should stop this cycle.<br><br>So, in conclusion, we cannot generalise that MJR is a bad school just because there are just a handful of rotten eggs in the school.<br>I believe that other school also have some too.<br>We cannot also definately say MJR is a good school made up of good pupils cause we indeed has some rotten eggs.<br>So, its just not very fair that you say that MJR is a bad school<br><br>I hoped my thoughts down here might somehow change their attitiudes towards the school<br><br>MJR rockx~!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>By making side judgements based on rumours and views it's like looking from the inner of a well and saying the well is the biggest place in the world... It aint wrong to hold a perception against something, but you have to remember that what you typed in this forum is gonna be seen by forumers out there. Every word that you typed in this forum can affect the reputation of the school. To base your opinion on rumours and views of the public you will need solid evidence to support what your typed. Even if you encounter unpleasant experiences of MJR students in public be reminded that what you see may be the minority. You need to experience or be in the school to conclude opinions of the school.<br><br>MJR has come a long way to achieve what it is today, be it in academic or CCA achievements. Although some unpleasant past do happened in MJR before but it's thrieveing to achieve better stardards of students and academic results. Through the past few years the school has achieved several awards in terms of CCA of arts, music and uniform groups. Individual awards were also achieved by students of the school; Central Singapore CDC HI-5 youth awards just last year... As for academic achieves the school has improved it's stardard of results just last year in the GCE-O levels.<br><br>Well i would like to finally remind the thread starter that holding individual perceptions is not a wrong but always remember that there are thousands of eyes surfing the net and i truely don't wish to see the reputation of my mother school be tarnished by side comments. I would like to emphasise to fellow forumers that the thread starter is no wrong, he's just standing at his own ground of opinion. Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry, but anyone who say that Manjusri is not a good school.. i think u will have bad karma.. True, our school might have bad students. They are only part of it. Not every school guarantee all good students. Nothing wrong with the school, the principals, the teachers.. it is only with the students. And among the students, there are good, generally ok, and bad. So why insist that MJR is not a good school? who are u to criticise our school? we as alumnis, are proud to be part of manjusri. And no one is to criticise. because we have a sirit on, to persevere. why insist that MJR is no good. before saying anything, please la, look around yourself. Are u perfect? are ur friends all perfect? if no, please shut up.. manjusri may be a buddhist school, but, they take any students that are willing to learn. is that wrong? the problem is with the students.. NOT THE SCHOOL! if u are saying the school.. it is related to MOE may i first tell anyone that criticises manjusri..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sup people.<br><br>100% BGR at Sec 1<br>Strategic Location, being the school near the RedLightDistrict<br>Students beating up teachers or whatsoever<br>Students joining secret societies<br>Quitting school at Sec4<br><br>These accusations are a-b-s-o-u-l-u-t-e nonsense.<br>Yes, there are a FEW delinquents or so-called PaiKias. HOWEVER, which school<br>doesn't pocess such people. This school has its own pros and cons, odds and ends. In fact, all schools do.<br><br>"I have seen good students from Gan Eng Seng. I have also seen civilised students from Bowen. But what the farking hell is wrong with Majusri???<br>Is it because of its "strategic location" (being in the heart of Red Light District)????"<br>1st off, it's manjusri.  <strong>M-A-N-J-U-S-R-I</strong><br>It's a neighbourhood school with a cluster of HDB flats and markets around. Do you actually get to see hookers or prostitutes from the RedLightDistrict?<br>I doubt so. In Fact, i can assume you'll object to my statement just because of some other twits who don't know how to judge.<br><br>"BGR thingy.... yes... even good schools have kids doing that. But Majusri ratio is 100%. Every single soul has early BGR there. Nobody there will say "I wanna concentrate on my studies first. BGR later."<br>I have no intentions of flaming anyone here but what the hell, This statement reminds me that age cannot be linked to maturity. Every SIngle soul ? After reading this, i have this immense urge to rip your mouth. Let    me    guess. Are you going to say " aI  hear   thissss   onEe  waat. "<br>Dun bother.<br><br>Those who made criticisms and ONLy criticisms to the school sure have the ability to make one mad. But seriously, Schools like RI do have their share of bad eggs. You people who criticised the school dont even know to spell its name. How  civilised.<br>FYI, I'm a graduate from Manjusri and i DID develop a hate for the school. But i regretted doing that. The friends and teachers i met there, it's priceless.<br><br>And so, it all boils down to generalisation. Those who do it, it shows your mentality. And it's not a good thing in this context (duh).<br>So it's manjusri's a bad school, i would rather believe Ruhua's hot.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its because MJR students feel that its right to protect their school reputation, thats why most of them had just signed up ( like me ) to fight for whats wrong, in this case, the wrong perception on the school  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
