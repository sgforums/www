Perhaps that corner of sg finds it hard to attract good teachers and motivated principals.<br><br>I think that its best to be safe than sorry ... I believe Sec education is very important to find a good school. If there's doubts, its best to go elsewhere since there's lots of schools around...<br>And being Buddhist or mission school does not guarantee its going to produce good studnents. My mom was pratical. She told me Mission school is very strict so I go even though she's a buddhist.<br></div>

I believe Sec education is very important to find a good school. If there's doubts, its best to go elsewhere since there's lots of schools around...<br>And being Buddhist or mission school does not guarantee its going to produce good studnents.
