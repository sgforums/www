(Sorry hor, if anyone here is from there.  You may want to correct me, if you feel wrong).<br><br>My parents, aunties etc kept insisting that it is a good school just because of its Buddhist based.  So what if it is a Buddhist school?  It is not run by the monks.  They don't impose strict rules and discipline like Shaolin Temple.<br><br>My mom even forced me to choose this school in case I don't get into the SAP schools around the East side.<br><br>From what I know (from the ppl there), every student will "go steady" as early as Secondary One.  And by Sec Two, every other student will "join secret society".  Nowadays still got this kind of thing one ah?<br><br>I have seen good students from Gan Eng Seng.  I have also seen civilised students from Bowen.  But what the farking hell is wrong with Majusri???<br>Is it because of its "strategic location" (being in the heart of Red Light District)????</div></blockquote><span style="color: brown;"></span><br><br>I came from Manjusri Secondary School too. But I 've not visited the Red Light District before. I believe you have not seen some of the best students in Manjusri. I'm not one of the best in the school but I believe I do my school proud. I scored well for my O' levels and now I am in United States having my Bechelor Degree. I have no means to show off, but I think you are too biased over Manjusri Secondary School. There is always some bad eggs in the basket. And every individual has his own responsibility for his own well being. I read in one of your threads regarding your friend, a councellor in Manjusri. He or she should look around the school rather than sitting in his or her office.  I admit Manjusri was once a gangster school in the past, but have you seen the recent Manjusri has turned into? I graduated on 2004, and I believe there are good teachers in Manjusri. Anyway, Manjusri had variety of strict rules, because of the pressure from the public.(I really had a bad time with the rules since I'm always late) Manjusri students who quit school because it's a buddhist school. Every one has the right to be given the chance to study again. It's compassionate to do that. The difference between Manjusri Secondary School and some of the Top Schools is, Manjusri is not really result oriented. Top Schools are competing to be the Top vigorously, and forgot the meaning of school.  But the quality of both schools are not much a difference.</div>
