            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Fratyr:</div><div class="quote_body">Hello Everyone!<br><br>My name is Boris, im 21yrs old and im from Israel.<br>I finished serving in our army, and now i want to study. (War is not for me)<br>I thought about many possibilities i have, and this is my prologue first:<br><br>I can try to get in Israel's University but its very very very VERY hard.<br>You need to get a score in Psychometric test for about 700-720 (of 800 max)<br>and only 2% of all our students get this score.<br>Im talking about medicine and computer science faculty.<br>I even dont wanna try - im not stupid, but this is almost impossible.<br>Only genious pass...<br><br>I decided to study abroad. Not a bad idea, but.. Israeli shekels is nothing outside of this Country...<br><br>I tried US, Canada, UK -&gt; you need to be a richie rich to pay for yourself as foreign student and pay for your living there too, and to work a lot and still it will be not enought...<br><br>My friend, was in Singapore and he said he really liked Nanyang or NUS ...<br>He told me to try. So i wanted to ask some details...<br><br>1) Which University in Singapore is good for international students? :-) (Medicine and Computer Science)<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Chinese Medicine or Western?<br><br>Chinese - Nanyang Technological University (NTU)<br><br>Western - National University of Singapore (NUS)<br><br>Computer Science - Both offer it</span><br><br>2) University i need, is to teach students in English. Which one? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Teaching medium in Singapore = English<br><br>So no worries.</span><br><br>3) What is the admissions to your universities instead of my high-school grade, any tests i need to pass to get some scores, english tests?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">I believe high school grades are needed as well. SAT (not sure) and yes, English tests.</span><br><br>4) Is there enought job for foreign people like me? I mean, if i move there to study i will work too (at evenning and nights and weekends) to pay for myself (living, books, food, house, cloth, UNIVERSITY FEES). Im talking about jobs like.. PHP programmers? if no -&gt; ISP tech support, if no -&gt; guards, waiters, bartender, cook etc... to work at night :-)<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Answer is yes. But please don't break laws. I don't think anyone on student pass are allowed to work, unless granted.</span><br><br>5) What is the minimal wage in Singapore? how much in $ or S$?<br>Everything can be fine, i need to pay university fees about 7000$(USD) each year + my own spendings for living... but, if ill get 200$ from the work every month it will never be enought. I think it should be about 1000-1500$ USD each month to be OK in Singapore.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">There's no minimum wages here. The more competitive it gets, the lower your wages will go, unless it's an executive job</span><br><br>6) How much i will pay for apartment/house? something poor, for a student.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">A few hundred dollars. According to my foreign friends. You will need a few to share the load, the bills can be high.</span><br><br>7) How much you people spend on your life each month?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">On what?</span><br><br>Please guys, im desperate, so i beg you.. help me :-) im tired of looking for a good country (cheap, english studies, good)... i want to study T_T<br><br>Hope to hear from ya. If you feel you need to contact me -&gt; i have an icq in my profile. Thanks.</div></blockquote></div>

              <p>maurizio what site is that sia. looks more like a site trying to earn money thru google adsense. why dont you take a site that the world universities use? newspapers like our straits times. even the new york times.</p>

              <p>if NUS is nowhere near the top, than London's School of Economics is trash too i guess? read my above post to why NUS and NTU ranking dropped. while NUS dropped from 19 to 33. London School of Economics dropped from 17 -50+ .</p>
              <p>go see NUS vs the 21st placed King's College,see which faculty NUS got lose out.i should say, NUS thrashes King's College in every aspect.</p>
              <p>i always preferred to see Asian universities occupying the top 20 spots. Somehow many in this forum reall hate NUS/NTU or something lol</p>

              <p>Both research methodology differ, the weight for Times in Peer Review is 40%.</p>
              <p>The Times Higher-QS World University Rankings are a composite measure in which six criteria are added together to produce an overall table. One measure, peer review, accounts for 40 per cent of the possible score, while two others account for 20 percentage points each, with one worth 10 per cent and the other two worth 5 per cent each.</p>
              <p>Peer review: 40%</p>
              <p>Employer review: 20%</p>
              <p>Staff / Student: 20%</p>
              <p>Citations / Staff: 10%</p>
              <p>International staff: 5%</p>
              <p>International student: 5%</p>

              <p>Quality of Faculty: --</p>

              <p>Peer review and employer review are all very subjective, as opposed to using Nobel Prize &amp; Fields Medal winners which is objective.</p>
