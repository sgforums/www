            <div class='col-md body'>There is some truth in Da Vinci Code story and of course a lot of fiction. The fiction are needed to weave an interesting and captivating story and best of all it revolves around the Catholic Church a highly volatile topic.<br><br>I believe there is a Constantine and setting up the Council of Nicaea etc are all truth. The part about Mary Magdalene being Jesus wife seem to be concocted fiction from Dan Brown fertile imagination. We cannot say if it is the case but it gives us a new dimension to what is truth and what is fiction.<br><br>Read in Internet Mother Mary was not even brought into the Council until the second or third sitting when someone (who i dunno) elevate her status to ascend to heaven like a Mother of God. This status is invented? Real? No one knows.<br><br>Go read about the Fatima incident about three kids having a vision and word of Mary to appear before them. The meeting at Fatima was witnessed by 70,000 people. In the end only one child is left and she become a nun where 24 years later she write 3 letters about the words transmitted to her at Fatima. The third letter was only revealed in 2001 and there were conspiracy theories about the content that threaten the foundation of the Catholic faith so it is read by high rank pope but put back into the envelope and resealed during the long interval of 1960 to 2001. 1960 being the year indicated by the nun where the contents are to be revealed.<br><br>There another potential story for Dan Brown for his next book <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Ah the Fatima timetable</strong><br><br>Dig more info in Internet and you will know the Miracle of the Sun is being concluded by some researchers as UFO coming to Earth to transmit messages. Hence the phenonmenon observed by 70,000 witnesses. If it is true, it will further bolster the claim that our gods maybe astronauts from outer space? If this knowledge is being announced, the foundation of some religions will be shattered to pieces and tat is why the contents of the 3rd letter cannot be revealed. Even if it is revealed, it muz be doctored for easier consumption by the mass followers.<br><br>So we ask ourselves again, what is truth? What is fiction? Word of God called Bible? Nay.... open up your horizons to other more possibilites. If you ask me, I am inclined personally to believe my gods were astronauts cuz I have been having dreams about them intermittently since I was young.</div>
