              <p>The burden of proving lies on the person making the extraordinary claim. Since it is never observed heaven or hell exist, the burden of proving it to be true lies on the person making tis claim. It is stupid to ask people to "disprove" something otherwise it becomes "true". If tat is the case, then every stupid monters, theory, fiction and fairytales r true.
