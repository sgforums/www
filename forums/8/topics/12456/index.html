            <div class='col-md body'>by a substantial amount/percentage. like even the AMD athlon 1.2GHz beats Intel Pentium 4 1.6GHz.<br><br>and even worse, a Dual Pentium 4 XEON (for servers) at 2GHz is outperformed by a 1.13GHz Pentium 3 XEON. yes! NEW chipset outperformed by OLD chipset.<br><br>just wondering the statistics of the people who knows that intel actually makes a poor performance new chipset (pentium 4) which can give a very high clock speed (2 GHz) but in actual has very poor performance as a means of marketing strategy to manupulate the thinking of buyers (those who knows little about computer technology).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just out of curiosity, since you talk so confident. do you know that even an Imac G4 at 733MHz can out-performed a pentium4 at 1.4GHz? it's really a problem with how intel design their chip and i have read the whole review even long long time ago.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>AMD with same speed is faser than Intel, that is from Pentium I generation ...<br><br>But:<br><br>1. For the same size, AMD chip has more semiconductor than Intel. This make AMD run very fast, smaller gap between semiconductor make electron run/jump even faster, thus make the speed increased. But the temperature will be the problem, semiconductor will melt easily in high temperature (fast moving of electron generate heat), no matter how many fans you add, you cannot reduce inner temperature ...<br>So, for home or hourly use, AMD is good for it is fast, but to make it as server (ftp/web/file/mail server which on-line for years), then better not ... AMD won't be able stand the heat, unless you create a good air circulation system ... Intel is the best for server.<br><br>2. AMD resale value is lower than Intel, Cyrix is ever worse (is the worst) ... Have ever heard micro-processor melt like porridge? that happened with Cyrix processor before ...

            <div class='col-md body'>i just jumped from a pentium 3 500 coppermine to AMD 1.2GHz. using the cheapest board with DDR - ECS K7S5A and a taisol 760 heatsink fan. it runs moderately cool and much more quite than my old p3 500 heatsink from sanyo denki. it seems to be a very good system with no stability issue or Blue screen of death. i ran lots of computer modelling stuff with each model lasting for hours and yet i never need reboot once. actually it's as good as my old BX board but much much faster only. initially, i was planning to get DDR once i had the system checked for stability issue. seems like i couldn't be bother now as it's so fast i don't think i can tell the difference.<br><br>i think AMD chip is on par with the stability of intel. actually the old BX for intel is better as i heard, not even the latest 8XX stuff can give the equivalent stability. and heat issue of AMD has always been a negative point.<br><br>it seems as if many people in singapore still prefer the intel brand. but over here in the UK more and more demands are for AMD. maybe in asia the weather is hot so a major problem.<br><br>so would it be correct for me to assumed that most of you guys here in this forum owns an intel P4 and will stay with intel even in the future? asking because i am glad to jump over to AMD for the cheap price with great performance.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi, actually from what i know is that P4 poor performance is not really due to that the software isn't optimised for it. it's more of a lantency problem with the architecture build inside the chip. I saw a video clip from Imac presentation in the USA. whereby Imac discuss in details why P4 has such poor performance. It's due to the hyper long pipelines that control the flow of information while Imac G4 has very short pipeline. when there's a faulty signal coming thru those pipeline, all the data signal within the pipe must then be clear completely before the new cycle of signal can come in. because of the long pipeline in the P4, significant amount of data will be lost when there are random error signal comming in. while the G4 has very short pipeline which only suffer minor losses in each cycle. that's why a P4 must require super high clock speed cycle to compensate the number of error signal received to catch up with the amount losts in each signal cycle. So basically the fault of P4 performance is the design architecture within it. What i don't understand is why Intel make such long pipeline? perhaps has better cooling effect so they can scale their processor speed to 10GHz so everyone knows little knowledge about computer start to think that P4 kickass and no imac or AMD chip can beat them.<br><br>For stability, i can tell you that my old BX with the p3 coppermine is on par to my current SIS 735 with 1.2GHz only much cheaper. AMD had to scale down their chipset price because not many people know that MHz to MHz AMD kicks P4 to oblivion. only heat issue seems to loose out to intel chip. I have to admit intel chip has the best heat sensor which AMD had like not in existance. go to tomshardware to watch how good is intel chip when it comes to heat control and how AMD chip becomes a 300+ Celcius frying pan!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The most scary thing is that the chip overheats and blows up, and u see smoke coming out of the comp. I heard that the Celeron chips also generate a lot of heat.<br><br>But this can be solved by using a double fan. More expensive but is worth it for a cheaper chip with abt the same clockspeed.<br><br>------------------<br>Thomas Edison definition of genius :<br>"1% inspiration, 99% perspiration"</div>
