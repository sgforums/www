Singapore is small, but that doesn't mean that we are smacked in the face, we shun away. We RETALIATE!! Please, u are acting like a spoiled kid I see in Orchard Rd. Grow up and serve your NS like another guy. For your info, I finished my NS 4 yrs back and it is supposed to be more "siong" than what u are having now. I am not at all surprised if u tell me u are in the service vocation. Serve your due and quit whining.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>excuse me, did u say u sign on? then why grumble so much? the reason why regulars get more dirty work than NSF is because it's their rice bowl and they need to perform in order to get their promotion. come on and be reasonable. NSF get paid $300plus and regulars are paid in the thousands.<br><br>Sometimes I really dun understand why people go and sign on and when they later regret , they start complaining as if the whole world owes them because of the situation he's in.<br><br>It's true that nobody choose to live in a poor family. But if that's ur fate, then stop grumbling and start working. So what if u see a lot of people die in front of ur eyes? If that's a benchmark to life achievements, then the mortuary people must be the greatest ard.<br>No matter how the person died...even it's a freak accident, life still goes on! We never stop just because somebody died, we just take that as a lesson and move on.<br><br>Yet,we must try our best to prevent such accidents from happening. Why ? Just because every single life is precious.<br><br>So we come back to the point.... do males need to serve NS? I wun give my opinion again... I post a few questions and u ponder over it.<br><br>Is every life precious? So we must do our best to save and protect lives. yes? If u are sadden seeing ur buddy die in front of ur eyes? Then in the event of a war, how will u<br>feel seeing not only ur buddies but also ur gf/wife, parents, children dying because of the bombing and shelling and not able to do anything. If u are capable, would u not sacrifice ur life to save all of them? Do we fight enemies with pens and papers like what we are doing now? No! We get out and fight them with guns! So to be capable to defend your loved ones, NS provide a way to equip ourselves to do it!<br><br>I give an analogy. Have u ever stepped on an ant's nest? Although an ant is so small and you can crush them so easily. Do they hesistate in defeding their home? No! All the ants will rush to your feet and bite u. Do we say the ants are stupid? No! Though eventually you will kill all the ants that climb onto ur legs, but will u reckon before stepping on an ants nest again?<br><br>Singapore is like an ant nest. Small and vulnerable. Ants know they are weak but yet sacrifices themselves for the good of the whole community. Are u not worse off than ants if u dun even want to protect ur own homeland?<br><br>[This message has been edited by chch (edited 20 December 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cheers Larry n Chch! Glad to hear your views on NS.<br><br>Miken80: Nobody says NS is going to be easy and smooth going. It had its ups and down. Its bitter at times nevertheless sweet at others. Ever reminiscences about the comraderie when you r on course and roughing it out with ur coursemates? That feeling of ur friends fighting beside you, u r never alone. U eat together, train together, kanna fucked together and sleep together. Still remember the times when we were punished doing endless push ups. Yes, we were tired, throughly shagged out but everyone persisted, not wanting to disappoint their team mates. Not wanting to cost them further punishments. These are what I would call a bunch of chopsticks, united they stand, divided they fall. When you have built up such deep feelings for one another in the team, you will fight and die for one another cos you would not bear to see even one of the chopsticks being separated and broke into two by others.<br>About the part on vulgar language, u must be implying my sentence on getting urself a kukujiao. I apologise if you r hurt or annoyed by my comment. Its not meant to be taken in an extremely bad manner. It meant to ask you to stop complaining and do something about what you thought can be improved upon.<br><br>Furthermore you have made the choice to sign on and made it your career. Whether its a good/bad choice with help of your hindsight, you will have to be responsible for your decision. Learn to adapt and you will come out of the armed forces a better man.<br><br>Something to add on...yes, I know there are many cases of death in the armed forces, some of them happened to my friends or acquintances. Cases like the road marshall who was knocked down by a speeding car(191km/h), pointing a GPMG at another platoon mate and accidentally pulling the trigger, Guardsmen falling to their death while repelling down UH-1H, mortar blinds going off taking with it the head of another soldier and many more.... All these are unfortunate incidents but to discontinue NS and henceforth placing the lives of many Singaporeans in doubt is definitely not an option. Furthermore all these incidences had an element of human error/carelessness in them. This is inevitable in many places, not only in SAF.<br><br>Forgot something else... I have got nothing to be ashamed of...<br>As requested, I m from Air Defence System Division(ADSD), Republic of Singapore Air Force.

What are you trying to say?!<br>What has this protected species got to do with biology aspects of human bodies?! This is only just a typical sterotyping and taking for granted attitude that you are trying to impose on  yourself. It becos you are too comfortable with your life as a gal in Singapore that you simply take things for granted and all the dirty jobs should be done by guys! Just becos you are a gal, do not imply that they are devoid of responsiblities. Just becos Singapore gals do not have to serve NS compulsory does not mean that they do not have to in the near future. Other countries do adopt such policies. You should be put under 5 months of BMT to let you understand what we guys have gone thru and let you better understand that we cannot take things for granted in life. We guys are human too...and we are also scared and need to protect ourselves too.<br>Since you mention that gals are protected species, then they should not demand equal status as guys and demand the same amount of benefits as guys, since guys simply do more dirty job like stupid NS and contribution to the country. Biological weaker does not make you a protected species, as you should fend for yourself too.<br><br>Wish can slap you, to wake you up. I simply depise gals like you. Go to hell!<br><br></div>

What are you trying to say?!<br>What has this protected species got to do with biology aspects of human bodies?! This is only just a typical sterotyping and taking for granted attitude that you are trying to impose on  yourself. It becos you are too comfortable with your life as a gal in Singapore that you simply take things for granted and all the dirty jobs should be done by guys! Just becos you are a gal, do not imply that they are devoid of responsiblities. Just becos Singapore gals do not have to serve NS compulsory does not mean that they do not have to in the near future. Other countries do adopt such policies. You should be put under 5 months of BMT to let you understand what we guys have gone thru and let you better understand that we cannot take things for granted in life. We guys are human too...and we are also scared and need to protect ourselves too.<br>Since you mention that gals are protected species, then they should not demand equal status as guys and demand the same amount of benefits as guys, since guys simply do more dirty job like stupid NS and contribution to the country. Biological weaker does not make you a protected species, as you should fend for yourself too.<br><br>Wish can slap you, to wake you up. I simply depise gals like you. Go to hell!<br><br></div></blockquote>Hmmm...maybe i shd have put a disclaimer...wat i said was something i read in the newspapers and not my own view!!!! pls read my post PROPERLY....and dun go around anyhow slap ppl...i DIDNT say dat i WONT serve NS, i was just stating a past newspaper article that explained why women are usually not required to serve NS.  in no part of my posting did i mention that i did not want to serve NS.  pls read properly before u jump to conclusions...U HAVE TOTALLY MISUNDERSTOOD ME!!!!  and how dare u wanna slap me when u didnt even read my posting correctly!!!!!!!!???????!!!!!!!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys.........just like to post some of my thoughts. I have read through most posts; I agree with people like Larry that NS is essential in the defence of the nation. Since Singapore is so small..we definitely need NS to survive in a war. Even if we do fall but we fall after a fight, not some kuku fat sitting duck like other countries.<br><br>But I think the Army and Air Force (I have neber been in the Navy) are a bit lost in their focus. This is especially true for Army. Sometimes we just fail to recognise the true purpose of havint NS. NSF sometimes I must admit are being abused. Like for example, when National Day comes, the unit or Division in charge of the event have to give up so much on their training commitment and do the stupid rehearsals and preparations. And to sum it all up, we are not being appreciated by the public at all. Maybe people will think more postively if the public shows some appreciation towards the NS poeple.<br><br>------------------<br>Where is Montgomery?
