            <div class='col-md body'>From my point of view, it is not a waste of time. Yes, it does take up 2yr 4mths to 2yr 6mths of your time, but it builds up your physical prowess, mentality and responsibility skills. Most people believe that they are mature enough at the age of 18-23. I am not saying that it's not but they can do better after going through training, be it NS or not. Then they are ready for society.<br><br>From the stradegic point of view, I doubt u know much of Singapore's technology. The government do not have to tell u what they have. It's confidential.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NS is there for a wholesome purpose i.e protect Singapore. It's true to say that Singapore is a nothing more than a pea-sized island on the map and that a few bombs can  level down the buildings. But remember, Singapore also has an arsenal capable of inflicting great amt of damage on others. Recently SAF has a project to built an underground ammo-base, primarily for safety and land conservation purpose. But probably, they hid the fact that SAF wanted to expand their stockpile of mortars and bombs and deliver them as presents to our invaders. Judging by this, SAF serves as a great deterrence to would-be invaders. Certainly enemies won't want a big hole in their city just for invading a small sized Singapore. As u all can see, being a small country also has it's advantage. Singapore has no natural resources as well. Provided that they still want to make use of Singapore's strategic position as a port, they would have to spend a huge sum of money to rebuilt what they have destroyed. Anyone who has a basic sense of economics will think twice before bombing what they want to capture.<br><br>So back the the point as to why all guys has to serve army. I think SAF dun have much choice. The certainly dun like those ar-gua,<br>sissy and weak guys. But we just dun have enuf guys to go ard. And why dun girls need to serve NS? I think because of limited resouces available. We will need twice of everything that we are spending on defence.<br>Next is woman's physio/psychological factors. They have their monthly inconveniences and are physically weaker. Some girls are terrified of loud sounds. M16 is enuf to make them quiver and jump in hysteria. Some just look too endearing to be sent for such ardous stuff.( I simply luv these type of girls  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ) Guys, the govt is doing us a great service by not sending the girls to NS. Think, would u want to have a demure &amp; homely wifey or the muscular Xena type 'hubby'?<br><br>I have my own share of NS stories to tell. But not now. Basically it's shit. But my characters are built on these shit. Dun laff! Some got the better out of it, but some just got worse. You still have to serve 2 1/2 yr whether u treat it as a life experience of a short trip to hell,depending whether u like it or not. I think in army, just do what u are told to do and dun pretend u are too stupid. Moderation is the key word to everything.<br><br>And I survived! Yes! Now happily studying in a local uni and it's my holidays now. NS to me is just a dream, albeit a bit too long. I have my bad days, but it's all over now! What matter most is that I have a bright future. So NS guys out there... your life isn't going to end there...in fact it's just that beginning when u ORD!<br><br>Guy... most girls prefer guys who served NS b4... hehe. Those who are Singaporean males and not eligible for NS... i think something is wrong up there or down there.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Gals... if ur s'porean bf never been called up for NS... I think u can change bf already   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Signature ?<br><br>[This message has been edited by chch (edited 12 December 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I used to think that NS is a waste of time.<br><br>In regards to the war thing, I can only say that you must have faith in your own country. We are, though small, capable of many things which most are unaware of. I used to think that, yeah, S'pore so small, one bomb we all die, but it's not that simple. Maybe you only see the things around you, as of the vocation you're in, but you need to be exposed to other vocations in SAF to know that, wow, there're lots of things you dunno.....hehe.... serious, the govt doesn't let on too much.<br><br>I suggest you look at it in a new direction. This period of 2 years plus will not be a waste if you know what to do with it. I used this time to be in touch with my inner self... not trying to sound crazy here but I'm saying that NS gave me lotsa time to reflect and think. Who I was, who I am and who I want to be. I guess I'm lucky that I met a great fren, a bro, in my NS life, who helped me a lot and guided me thru.<br><br>I dun think it's a waste.<br><br>As for gals, it's a pity this is a priviledge they can't enjoy.

            <div class='col-md body'>well..everything serves a purpose right?<br><br>the army stint is to prepare the guys physically n mentally...cos singaporeans TOO PAMPERED liao!!!<br><br>as a recruit, u r same rank as everyone else .. irregardless of the amt of money ur parents have in the bank .. so i think it serves as a humbling experience for some.. n for others .. u learn to work with other ppl of different backgrounds..race...religion ..<br><br>n at the same time u can build up your contacts or networking skills which can be of use in your carreer at a later stage..<br><br>yes it does in a sense "rob" the guys of 2.5 yrs of their time to catch up with the ladies... but hey...u worry wat ?? u have a lifetime to work u know..so whats 2.5 yrs as compared to another 30/40 yrs of working life til ur retirement????<br><br>anyway we would need you guys to protect us in times of need...who knows...when tensions mount with our neighboring countries.. we will need all the help that we can help... n if singaporeans dun do it..who will?<br><br>anyway it might be good that the ladies serve NS as well but i think economically not viable as we are already short of manpower....<br><br>whatever the argument... i dun think NS will be scrapped .. so u guy s juz accept that u have to go thru it n make the best outta it..<br><br>we ladies .. give u .. our fullest morale support !!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the hint in my previous msg is too subtle. I've said Singapore Govt dun have much choice but to accept those sissy boys who feared going thru the process of NS. It's these kind of people that make the public shake their head and wonder whether Singapore is capable of defending herself.<br><br>At one hand, a narrow and immature mind has difficulty understanding the purpose behind NS and on the other hand the same mind is trying in futile enthusiaism to rationalise that NS is plain useless. I dun wish to explain further. You can pull the horse to the river, but u can't force it drink. Bottomline, NS is necessary period.<br><br>Not sounding arrogant i hope.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Miken80: quit whining and juz do your NS; you give guys a bad name.<br><br>So what if a few bombs can level much of Singapore? Does that mean we stop fighting and let everyone step over us?<br><br>I am sure you would not mess around with a bee even though it is so small. You know that it will give you a painful sting, even though the act of stinging will rob it of its life. But because of this, you will steer clear of the tiny bees, won't you?<br><br>Shouldn't Singapore do that too? Or should we juz lay down on the ground and invite the enemy to steal our wealth and then tell them:"hit me, kill me, I will not fight back..."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FI:<br><br>it's quite vague as how popularity is defined over here. You've certainly posted a lot of in here thus make quite a name for youself already. However, it's not the amt of msg or new topic u post.<br><br>I give a little bit of illustration...<br>I will search thru 1000 crappy stuff just to read a thoughfully prepared msg laid down by someone. I feel sgforum has too much crap stuff. I know I wun offend anyone here cos those who are writing craps stuff wun know that they are doing it. And if they rebuked me, then they automatically declare that they are crappy. I've been reading sgforum for a yr now and look forward to read intellectually stimulating threads. A very example is posts by Prodigal. They were written passionately and it resonates in the sentiments of others. Bringing forth an avalanche of msg.<br><br>I think it's they way u reply personally to people's msg. And sometimes it just strikes a chord in them. even if it doesn't, at least they feel tangibly that their msg is read by someone. No point spending time typing furiously on your keyboard when nobody replies to u right? They might as well talk to the wall.<br><br>i believe with your popularity in sgform, u can get a lot of army stories if u post a new topic asking for it. and it helps better if u make the topic clear &amp; appealing.<br><br>whether ur popularity is incidental or accidental,it's always good to keep in check of it. In simple words, just be careful lor.<br><br>I'm not an intellectual chap. Wait till I get my results next wk...</div>
