I go there often. So do China girls.<br><br>On Sunday afternoons, lithe young women with straight long hair will be there, accompanied by their heartlander men.<br><br>You can tell them from Chinese Singaporean women because they are fairer and slimmer. And once they speak, well, that's that.<br><br>They are there too in top-class lounges in top-class hotels. Lithe and lanky, but better-dressed than their kopitiam sisters, they hang onto the arms of men I recognise as members of the establishment.<br><br>They are everywhere and they make me uncomfortable.<br><br>In fact, all the recent news about China women makes me uncomfortable.<br><br>Here's a sample:<br><br>China women staking out coffeeshops in Geylang, or hanging out in Chinatown and outside MRT stations, and openly offering their sexual services.<br><br>China women swopping elderly folks' savings for plastic bags of red apples.<br><br>China women vanishing from tour groups in Singapore and ending up in the vice trade or other illegal work.<br><br>Is this China woman phenomenon something to be concerned about? I think so.<br><br>Their approach to living and thinking seems so different from the ways of the people here.<br><br>We are no strangers to vice, and men here know where to look for their bit of fun. And the women who service them do so discreetly.<br><br>The aggression of these China women, on the other hand, is astounding. They pounce on men in broad daylight.<br><br>One reader called to complain that one girl opened the passenger door of his car while he was waiting in it. She got in, buckled up and made her pitch.<br><br>It seems that the Singapore man, young or old or fat or ugly, is a ticket to the good life for some China girls.<br><br>And Chinese Singaporean men do fall for them, if anecdotal evidence is anything to go by. I just hope they are bachelors who have finally found love.<br><br>I acknowledge that for some women, desperation drives them into the trade. We have heard it all: the need to feed the family back home, put children through school, tend to sick parents.<br><br>One prostitute from China told of how she had been duped by her boyfriend into giving his potential employers sexual favours. He left her high and dry, and she now works for a pimp.<br><br>A sad story, but it does make you wonder about the kind of people we are letting into the country.<br><br>The fact is, Singaporeans are getting mightily miffed about the problem.<br><br>Shopkeepers in Chinatown, for example, are dismayed by the presence of China women because they are keeping legitimate customers away. The women worry about dirty old men looking them up and down, while the men worry that their wives will misunderstand their presence there.<br><br>The China girls' presence in Geylang is upsetting even brothel owners because the girls negotiate their own rates.<br><br>The single-mindedness with which they seem to pursue their prey is so at odds with everything that most of us here have been brought up to believe in.<br><br>And there are simply too many stories of marriages wrecked because the husband has a mistress from China.<br><br>I suppose some people would argue that nothing should be done, and that the men should either get their kicks or get what they deserve - depending on how you look at it.<br><br>I disagree.<br><br>There is no way of counting the lives that have been wrecked by these women.<br><br>And if there is - rightly - such a fuss about the lives that will be ruined by a proposed casino, this issue deserves a more thorough looking at as well.<br><br>There have been some government moves recently to contain the number of China nationals here. For one, it has turned off the tap for construction workers from China (men though) and quietly dropped an experiment to introduce China maids in homes.<br><br>When the private education boom here brought not just China students but also their mothers, restrictions were placed on what sort of jobs these 'study mamas' could moonlight in.<br><br>While visa rules have been relaxed, there is still a security bond that agencies have to put down in case their China visitors 'vanish'.<br><br>The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority declined to give figures on tourists from China who have 'disappeared'. One can only speculate that it is a sizeable problem, or it would be no big deal for the ICA to say the numbers are negligible.<br><br>The number of tourists from China in the month of May, by the way, was about 70,000, and the target for this year is 770,000.<br><br>There are, I'm sure, men who go missing as well. And I am sure those that do aren't giving away free lessons in biculturalism.<br><br>It is time to put a stop to it. We cannot close our borders, but a way must be found to make sure the tourists we let in are really here for the sights.<br><br>Right now, Singapore tour agents rely on agencies approved by the Chinese government to vet customers and make sure they are genuine. Obviously, this is not working as well as it should.<br><br>One idea would be to get Singapore firms themselves to set up offices in China to do the vetting.<br><br>There is talk that Malaysia will require single China women below the age of 25 to be accompanied by a family member if they want to enter Malaysia. If they are married, their husbands must accompany them.<br><br>Should we go the same route?<br><br>I say we should think seriously about copying the move.<br><br>Or is the China tourist dollar so big that we will look the other way?<br><br>I hope not, because, at the risk of sounding old-fashioned, the moral structure of our society does not need to come under further strain.<br><br>So can we please stop importing more problems than it can take?<br><br>The writer is News Editor of The Straits Times.

            <div class='col-md body'>I actually know this ex-married couple, both in their late 30's now.  The husband is the Chinese contractor/businessman type, but very rich.  He's the type who goes on interpersonal sentiments....if you're his friend, he'll treat you well.<br><br>I never liked his wife, who came across as arrogant. One day, he caught his local wife playing around with angmohs she met on the internet and from work (she was in the travel industry, working in town).<br><br>He divorced his wife and took up a 23-year-old China girl (student here).  He gave this China girl a condo and a Merc.  The condo is under his and the girl's name.  The car is under his name only.  But still, this young China girl really tarn-tio!  Anyway, if its her capability to get such perks and both parties are willing....then OK lor.<br><br>I've lost touch with them and one thing I never found out was what happened to their 3 kids after they divorced.<br><br></div>
