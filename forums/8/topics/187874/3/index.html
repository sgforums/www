I can see how some guys are indeed immature screwballs who can't think to save their own lives and don't know how to respect women.<br><br>At the same time, it's not fair for you to be painting ALL Singaporean guys in the same light. Just because there are a few screwballs around doesn't mean that all of us guys are. I've come across many a local girl who b*tched and backstabbed me behind my back - but do you hear me ranting about them?<br><br>And what the heck is a 'growing upple'? I'm guessing that you actually mean 'growing up people', right?

Sometimes it can be the everyday things u see, like when u go out with friends and u see the way some of the guys behave, etc. Its the things that u keep seeing that can make one jaded. For u guys I guess sometimes because u're so used to thinking its acceptable because its a guy thing, that u don't notice how offensive some of your actions can be.<br><br>Anyways, if she wants to rant here, why not? U know i often rant about guys here too. That feeling that singaporean guys have all done something wrong to her? thats the way it can sometimes feel, looking at the way u guys behave. It just gets to under your skin that u can't stand it u know? Like when guys are being sleazy and think they're acting cool or being attractive, etc. Sometimes u see the things guys do to get girls and sex, online, in the clubs, whatever where-ever, and it makes me think: "Geez get a life u sad f*ck!"<br><br>So no I don't think its totally fair to think she's just ranting without a reason without looking at the way guys GENERALLY behave.</div>

Its not very fair to assume that its a single or even a few experiences that lead her to feel that way. Sometimes it can be the everyday things u see, like when u go out with friends and u see the way some of the guys behave, etc. Its the things that u keep seeing that can make one jaded. For u guys I guess sometimes because u're so used to thinking its acceptable because its a guy thing, that u don't notice how offensive some of your actions can be.<br><br>Anyways, if she wants to rant here, why not? U know i often rant about guys here too. That feeling that singaporean guys have all done something wrong to her? thats the way it can sometimes feel, looking at the way u guys behave. It just gets to under your skin that u can't stand it u know? Like when guys are being sleazy and think they're acting cool or being attractive, etc. Sometimes u see the things guys do to get girls and sex, online, in the clubs, whatever where-ever, and it makes me think: "Geez get a life u sad f*ck!"<br><br>So no I don't think its totally fair to think she's just ranting without a reason without looking at the way guys GENERALLY behave.</div></blockquote>Wah then my tolerance level on the Beeches i've seen must be damn high.<br><br>I'll attribute it to individual lifestyle.<br><br>I'm ok with ranting or even stating sensible points like BabyRS did.<br>I'm against generalisation.<br>Like i've mentioned, i definitely don't know her. So don't make herself like a victim by every singaporean guys or the world.<br><br>Ok ok....i'm a jerk in my way.<br>BUT i definitely don't deserve her condemnation!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Tmd....i like this thread!!!</div>

Even the nice onces. See the problem is that some things that are deemed acceptable to guys, can be rather... annoying actually. The problem is, just in everyday living alone, u see so many guys behaving rather "jerk"-some, and in the end u just CAN'T HELP painting them all in a bad light even if u don't want to.<br><br>As for guys not ranting about girls, well i get the feeling girls don't have that much of a problem getting involved in a lesbian act, as guys have getting involved in a gay act. Guys who rant about girls lose out because they're not gettin any at the end of the day. Girls don't exactly see sex as the most important thing in life so even if they rant about guys, they don't lose out. I really don't think that the reason most guys don't rant about girls and paint them all in the same light is that noble, even if yours is.</div>
