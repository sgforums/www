I didn't care about what he had implied or what you had actually said. Try comprehending my posts first before asking me to comprehend yours. So far your "debate" against chelzea I had not said anything about the content so what is there to comprehend about?<br>In fact I agreed with you and your points against chelzea even if basically all he wanted to say was not to generalise sg men but he came out wrongly and approached the whole issue wrongly.<br>What you had posted against chelzea is more or less of a similar "character" when I had posted against the threadstarter and her first post, hence I used what you said against me back against you.<br>Am i making this personal? Definitely not on my part, but are you taking it personally? Probably.<br>Its good for the fact that you are trying to correct some statements but please do not be snobbish about it.<br>"go play somewhere else where u're not out of your league, or don't come out to play at all." Sheesh... Don't try to make me sound so small and stupid, girl.. I didn't show you disrespect..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>wrong again. your comprehension is getting worse. i also see u're running out of ideas. now u need to steal the things that i say u're doing to accuse me back.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>HE very clearly SAID i implied so and so. he did not imply. He said this is what u're trying to imply blah blah blah. THAT is putting words into my mouth because i never implied anything of the sort. His miscomprehension lead to his misidentification of a non-existant implication.<br><br>now u are contradicting yourself. 1st u said,<br><br>"I believed he used the word "implying""<br><br>therefore, u SAID that HE said I was implying. don't try to twist your way out of this because its crystal clear. now either you really have dropped in your level of comprehension, or worse, your comprehension of what u're saying has dropped. and that would be really sad because it does seem that u no longer understand what even you yourself is saying.<br><br>once again, u screwed up. how did him saying that i was implying something AND u saying that he said i was implying something, to becoming u saying that he was implying something? no, no no. There is no miscomprehension on my part. but for u to totally not understand what u're saying anymore, and then TURN AROUND and say i don't comprehend u, is so ironic and absurd that its hilarious. Please, go READ your own previous post again and see if u've actually just committed the cardinal sin in debating, of misunderstanding YOURSELF.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>And what I post against chelzea is NOTHING of the sort of what u posted. please don't make me laugh somemore. against chelzea, there is a debate and an exposure of flaws in his reasoning and arguments with counter reason. I don't think i ever attempted a "copy post analogy" for him. And no Im not trying to tell him that its bad to do whatever he did the same way u told the threadstarter. On the contary, I was pointing out to him that he CAN say whatever he wants, but when gals who have a thing against men AND gals who have nothing against men ALL start to tell him he'll be doing men a big favour by letting it go, its really time for him to zip up and stop damaging the fragile egos of men. I guess u could say that there were 3 of us here trying to save him in spite of himself. Its just that the other 2 gals are much nicer people than I am. Me? I'm just blunt, and if he's not making the cut then there won't be any meaninfgul debate to begin with, and he can just go home.<br><br>Next, I asked if u're making it personal. If u think my request clarification means im taking it personally, well once again, I know what im up against don't i?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>i am so sorry i make u feel small though. I don't set out to make anyone sound "so small and stupid". I tell it as it is. If along the way that means, well u get exposed for being that, I can only feel so sympathetic can't I? especially when u can't comprehend much here? Before I had that long debate with Chelzea, i'd already noticed u didn't seem to comprehend some things, but i reckoned u were more deserving of respect and hence did NOT point it out. But since u decide that yea u can keep trying to use everything i say against me without even knowing how to use it properly, thinking it makes u look real clever that way, that is disrespect as much as anything else, and I've already taken back some respect alright? so don't u come telling me i disrespect u because u've already done the same thing 1st without even realising it. i accord my respect readily enough, but i ALSO retract it readily enough. U look around and u see why there are people i don't disrespect EVEN tho they have differing views from me, before u even come n think about accusing me of being respectful to those whose views coincide with mine.<br><br>now im going to find a place to laugh my teeth out.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Unfortunately your inability to either do that or comprehend anything said in its entirety is hampering your having a meaningful debate here.<br><br>I said SOME women know blah blah... so those are the SOME woman who decide they might as well manipulate men for money. They stop being the ones who are manipulated for sex and turn it around to make $. I reserve my judgement here about women like that(not prostitutes, but women who milk a relationship only for the $) but i can say its not a very good opinion about them. so u've missed out a very important key word: SOME. that same 'some' which refers to the women who decide to manipulate men for $ instead.<br><br>and yes gals who marry for the sake of $ (or a citizenship, or other things) exist. but think about it hey. Doing this involves 2 legal processes, which are not like snapping your fingers. Guys manipulating a girl into a r/s for sex, is an entirely private affair, no legal wrangle whatsoever, no law processes to bear thru with, except in very rare cases. So do u SERIOUSLY think the number of people who do this are even anywhere near the number of guys who manipulate a girl into agreeing to sex? Do u seriously think so? U can say yes, I promise to try very hard not to laugh and drop my respect for u beyond ZERO.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>Girls can "manipulate" bfs for $. They just ask them buy this buy that. It do not require any legal processes. It is also a private affair. Actually whether its sex or $ when its consensual manipulation is too strong a word to use, as long as the guys dont rape their gfs and the gfs dont con their bfs $. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

There is no miscomprehension on my part. but for u to totally not understand what u're saying anymore, and then TURN AROUND and say i don't comprehend u, is so ironic and absurd that its hilarious.

I don't think i ever attempted a "copy post analogy" for him. And no Im not trying to tell him that its bad to do whatever he did the same way u told the threadstarter. On the contary, I was pointing out to him that he CAN say whatever he wants, but when gals who have a thing against men AND gals who have nothing against men ALL start to tell him he'll be doing men a big favour by letting it go, its really time for him to zip up and stop damaging the fragile egos of men. I guess u could say that there were 3 of us here trying to save him in spite of himself. Its just that the other 2 gals are much nicer people than I am. Me? I'm just blunt, and if he's not making the cut then there won't be any meaninfgul debate to begin with, and he can just go home.<br><br>Next, I asked if u're making it personal. If u think my request clarification means im taking it personally, well once again, I know what im up against don't i?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>i am so sorry i make u feel small though. I don't set out to make anyone sound "so small and stupid". I tell it as it is. If along the way that means, well u get exposed for being that, I can only feel so sympathetic can't I? especially when u can't comprehend much here? Before I had that long debate with Chelzea, i'd already noticed u didn't seem to comprehend some things, but i reckoned u were more deserving of respect and hence did NOT point it out. But since u decide that yea u can keep trying to use everything i say against me without even knowing how to use it properly, thinking it makes u look real clever that way, that is disrespect as much as anything else, and I've already taken back some respect alright? so don't u come telling me i disrespect u because u've already done the same thing 1st without even realising it. i accord my respect readily enough, but i ALSO retract it readily enough. U look around and u see why there are people i don't disrespect EVEN tho they have differing views from me, before u even come n think about accusing me of being respectful to those whose views coincide with mine.<br><br>now im going to find a place to laugh my teeth out.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote><span style="color: red;">"HE very clearly SAID i implied so and so. he did not imply.

What you have just posted is totally stereotyping SG guys. Just because a few of them disses you, you have no absolute right to condemn other innocent SG guys. You are no different from a terrorist. It goes to show your maturity level. Because of you, can I say that all SG girls your age, are senseless, immature, whiny b*tches. That would be unfair right? So think twice before posting.

The intended effect of me saying this "Because of you, can I say that all SG girls your age, are senseless, immature, whiny b*tches.

Maybe like you said I didn't realise it so quote me the first post I showed disrespect towards you first.

You had replied to my first post saying it was useless or something like that. And so I disagreed and started the "debate" with you. Now, the "debate" is heading nowhere.
