            <div class='col-md body'>i think maybe she nv study GP or forgot what she learnt in GP... making sweeping statements with no supporting evidence are no-no... when she commented that sg guys r like that it is most probably that she had experienced events or witnessed actions that involved sg guys behaving in that particular manner mentioned. However, such conclusions are narrow because 1stly, the behaviour of the guys she saw at the places she went are not representative of the general population. The reason is simple she cannot be observing every single guy in singapore so how to conclude <strong>sg guys</strong> are like that? Although non-representative, such thoughts stem from the fact that she always observe the same behaviour on the sg guys she saw. Have she ask herself why? <strong>Maybe</strong> because most guys freq K-pool r lik that<strong>?</strong> Is your circle of male friends really large enough to make such conclusions? Or is it your personality attracts such type of sg guys to become your friends<strong>? </strong> I hope the threadstarter can think more critically with an analytical mind.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>omg. i dont even know where to start - -;; but i'll try.<br><br>firstly, i hope you can start to give more credit to singaporean guys, or just guys in general... sure, some of them can be.... irritating... but you can just ignore them - -;; so what if a guy on the streets is not pleasing to your eyes... no one told you to look at him - -;; you're not living in a fashion magazine where all guys are models with 6 packs... &gt;&lt;;; most guys i know around me can be really annoying, but they can be super sweet too. for example, i have a guy friend.. whole night didnt sleep, just to make breakfast for his gf and send her to school.. awwwwwwww~~~~*<br><br>as suggested by other people, if you're really that upset with singaporean guys... then work on improving the situation... i.e. date a non-singapore or move outta the country...  sure, you've the freedom of speech to rant on here in sgforums... but im just suggesting you should channel your energy and time into something that might actually make you happier. reading comments generated here is probably gonna make you more bitter than you already are.<br><br>for one who has lived in several cities, i can only say you'll be surprised to find that at the end of the day, singaporean guys are actually one of the sweetest, nicest and caring people. i can bet on you not believing me, but that's my opinion anyways.<br><br>regarding the issue with the 1988 batch... i'll just say i hope you can give them more credit too. common, most people go through that stage of being rebelious and acting like the whole world owe them something, and nobody understands what they are going through except themselves - -;;; perhaps in general, the younger generation are turning more and more into brats. you probably heard grandparents lamenting, "kids these days... aiyahhhh" our society is changing; values and morals are changing with it~~* just live with it =)</div>
