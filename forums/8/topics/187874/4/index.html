As though u very man means u're a gd character and those people who are not very "man" are bad characters.<br><br>2ndly, isn't it a contradiction to 1st say men aren't desperate for sex, and then turn around and ask which man don't want sex? Thats the problem. Loads of men ARE so despo for sex.<br><br>And finally, u will have to cut your dick off. There are tens of thousand of men who don't want sex. There is a religious group in russia where devotes remove their dick or balls or both. And there are thousands of people in western countries who belong to the underground body mod scene who have removed theirs. What about those men who belong to the BDSM femdom scene who willingly volunteer for chastity roles (which means no sex at all) under female mistresses? they get a mental satisfaction from not having sex, so they are considered men who don't want sex. I would give u an advice, that being, if u don't know much about the world, don't bet something as important as your dick on something u have a VERY good chance of losing. So, since u say u're so man, are u man enough to do what u've SWORN to do? Or are u going to be a "sissy"?<br></div>
