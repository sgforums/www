Kids, I say KIDS, pls learn to be more mature. Instead of using bombastic words to rant, y not concerned more about ur society and ur envoirment??...Like what do u think about the education system?? Hav u think of a better way to improve it??  What do u think about those low income group ppl who is struggling to survive. Some have problem with their 3 meal some have finanical prob going to school...What will u do if u r them?? And what do u think the direction singapore is heading in the future?? Is casino really helping our country??? Mind u all this problem might directly or indirectly affecting u in our daily life and some serious issue might even affect ur bread and butter in the future.<br><br>I knew some of the teenage still cared about things happening around them. But many of them are focusing on flaming, complaining over these worthless issue or asking pervet question on s3x and hoping some babes with big breast hour figure will join them for gangbang session.  Guys please wake up ur idea. I am quite worried at the rate of the teenagers growing looking at the thread they post...<br><br>PS: To all the guys who wonder y gals not serving NS....Please be a real gentleman and a man and stop talking on this topic. Y u care the gals not urself?? Its not like ur ranting will stop this system. If u not happy why not migrate??? NS to me is the only way to differentiate man and women.
