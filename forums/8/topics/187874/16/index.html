            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HENG@:</div><div class="quote_body">right. lets face up to the facts. 1stly, u really wanna deny that men OFTEN manipulate women to agree to have sex? and u wanna deny that many men do that? Hey im not judging them too much here, but its a fact. Men live more for sex than women, ultimately. yea there sluts around, but can u honestly say there are more sl<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>uts than despo men? If there were, how come u see more men standing around at clubs not scoring? Because there aren't enough sl<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>uts to go around. Then they go after the nice girls and thats when nice girls get hurt. Hard? Of course hard. I don't agree with it, but the notion of idealised romance rests in the heads of too many girls and often makes them blind to how jerk some men really are.<br><br>2ndly, people get accused without truth often. Hey u can say nobody likes getting accused without any truth in it, but i'll point out to u as well, that people who've been hit bang on target with accusations that strike home act that way as well. Getting all insulted and defensive, as a bluster knee-jerk reaction. So which way u wanna swing? Or u wanna take a course of action where nobody can mistake u for being guilty of the accusation? Like, maybe NOT act so totally petty and scream and cry here?<br><br>Finally, sure u can have zero respect for me, if thats what u wanna hint. But truth of fact is, i "generalise" men as jerks, but i see people who are nice as individuals, as people. So i guess if thats generalisation to u, then too bad. But at least the feelings mutual, since about 3 posts ago, I lost all respect for u anyway.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>I want to make it short n sweet/ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>face up e facts ,wad abt women mainpulating man for$$$.<br><br>i am feel im nt petty but it all depend on how an individual intepret it.I am jus putting my point across abt MOST man are nt jerks.<br><br></div>

Guys who get manipulated for $, often get sex along the way as part of the manipulation anyway. Money, given out, can be returned. Sex, given out, how to return? In the end, sex worth more or $ worth more? Assuming all women in this world manipulate men for $ and men manipulae women for sex. And then after its all said and done, 10% of the women who got any financial gain of any sort return those gains. Who is still ultimately on the losing end as a gender? Women. So u wanna come n compare $ and tell me men being manipulated for $ is as bad as being women manipulated for sex, I suggest u crawl back into whatever MCP hole u crawled out from.</div>

U're a living, breathing, individual. U wanna call that generalisation, be my guest. Generalisation means not even giving u a chance to prove yself just because u're a guy. There is nothing extreme about feeling that one has to guard against men until u know them well to know they won't try that "i think we can be more than just friends sh<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>it" with u(or until they know u well enough not to dare to try).<br><br>U can feel sg women should not generalise sg men because they are nice. But truth is, ARE they? Nice as in, genuinely nice, or nice as in, pretend to be nice and then keep your disgusting sex-starved side away until u get into a club or get drunk?<br><br>And yes u are entitled to have zero respect for me. I don't really want someone i already have zero respect for looooooooooong and early on in this debate to respect me. I wouldn't like that better than having some random child-molester or sex-pervert I also have no respect for, respecting me. My skin'd crawl to be honest. Respect from people whom I mutually respect as well, is enough for me. At least I know these are people whose respect are worth their weight in gold.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Yea "bf" give them gifts la, but how often we see them either throw those gifts away or return them, because they become representation of bad memories? Guys who get manipulated for $, often get sex along the way as part of the manipulation anyway. Money, given out, can be returned. Sex, given out, how to return? In the end, sex worth more or $ worth more? Assuming all women in this world manipulate men for $ and men manipulae women for sex. And then after its all said and done, 10% of the women who got any financial gain of any sort return those gains. Who is still ultimately on the losing end as a gender? Women. So u wanna come n compare $ and tell me men being manipulated for $ is as bad as being women manipulated for sex, I suggest u crawl back into whatever MCP hole u crawled out from.</div></blockquote>DIs is an oxymoron,if dey know that dey are going to be manipulated for sex SO hw can it be considered 'manipulated'?<br><br>Den wad abt gals who marry guys for e sake of money and divorce him to get a portion of his assets when he truly love e gal? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Unfortunately your inability to either do that or comprehend anything said in its entirety is hampering your having a meaningful debate here.<br><br>I said SOME women know blah blah... so those are the SOME woman who decide they might as well manipulate men for money. They stop being the ones who are manipulated for sex and turn it around to make $. I reserve my judgement here about women like that(not prostitutes, but women who milk a relationship only for the $) but i can say its not a very good opinion about them. so u've missed out a very important key word: SOME. that same 'some' which refers to the women who decide to manipulate men for $ instead.<br><br>and yes gals who marry for the sake of $ (or a citizenship, or other things) exist. but think about it hey. Doing this involves 2 legal processes, which are not like snapping your fingers. Guys manipulating a girl into a r/s for sex, is an entirely private affair, no legal wrangle whatsoever, no law processes to bear thru with, except in very rare cases. So do u SERIOUSLY think the number of people who do this are even anywhere near the number of guys who manipulate a girl into agreeing to sex? Do u seriously think so? U can say yes, I promise to try very hard not to laugh and drop my respect for u beyond ZERO.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Like i said, and say again, the 2 key points i focused on are the age and nationality criteria.

'Guys' for this statement made by threadstarter, and the subsequent rebuttal by me, is a non-major consideration within the statements of facts of the sentence. Like i said, and say again, the 2 key points i focused on are the age and nationality criteria. In this case, since gender is not a criteria in my rebuttal, how can u thus infer anything else about the opposite gender from my rebuttal when there is NO emphasis given to gender in the identification of the fallacy of the subject statement to begin with?<br><br>so u've also not comprehended, and as such, while i agree that u do not have to say u're hungry to imply u're hungry, this still has no bearing on the verdict which is that to begin with, he assumed an incorrect and non-existant implication within the rebuttal. in essence it wouldn't be wrong to say u've gone off topic as well since u have no understood the crux of the matter. In any debate, u don't understand the crux of anything that's beind debated on, u're off topic, and thats it.<br><br>Now yes i won't deny i felt good saying it to him. I also say with great pleasure to u, that if u can't comprehend the statements made here as part of the debate, don't come out to play. It won't be pretty for u.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>Like I said I didn't care about the content. Just pointing out the fact that you had probably misread his post that's all. Try to comprehend my post better before telling people to comprehend yours... Sheesh..</div>
