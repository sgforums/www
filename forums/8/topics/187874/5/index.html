            <div class='col-md body'>other den condemning SG GUYS to arouse HUGE participants' attention in this topic.<br><br>generally I am talking about males who have a mindset like MC+Square, the 1990 boy who talks a lot in this thread (obviously).<br><br>i did not want to be too polite in the first place, or on the 1st post.<br><br>this topic doesnt need u to think that the thread starter (myself) to be emphatised with what she had encountered. (tho i met jerks b4, indeed).<br><br>GENERALLY speaking, like HENG@ said, it's bcos what we see everyday n thus become jaded. I went to k-pool, everywhere and i can see kids age 1990 batch, with many other age grp of pple, influencing each other, n tt's y there's nvr ending reproduction of guys like what i described in the first post.<br><br>Will anyone try to not think that sg girls are hard to pacify, instead, try to upgrade urself to be worth the respect from the women trying to dominate the world with 'women power'...<br><br>I believe that guys shld always be the ones that woman shld stand behind n support him all the way. Today, I see guys.. age (18-22).., some arent well mannered, or neat. n some may be lazy(/stress?)* to keep themselves be attracted to many other woman/girls.<br><br>I feel that reasons maybe because a guy is degrading himself from the past in which more woman feel attracted to, rather than now.. girls r more happy to see their idols than to see their bfs, at times.<br><br>i wish to see ur comments b4 i continue.<br><br>Sorry for offending u guys who have High self-esteem (that may lead ownself detestable by girls).</div>

Just because a few of them disses you, you have no absolute right to condemn other innocent SG guys. You are no different from a terrorist. It goes to show your maturity level.
