            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm after reading 9pages, what I can say is... quite informative :3<br><br>I believe that there is a better way to convey an individual's point-of-view, in a way that non-provocative, easily comprehended and accepted. No one wants readers to misread what he/she writes and started reacting to the post in a irritated manner rite? Constructive conversation/debates won't form when the participants go all out to step on each other's tails.<br><br>One of the forumities posted something I agree. We live in this world together and to co-exist together, we need to accept and tolerate. No one is perfect in this world, everyone is unique with their own way of thinking and views. There is really no need to pry on gender issues as there will bound to be black sheeps in any flock. Hehe but can't blame us for being biased in views, since humans often remember the bad more than the good. (Why a chinese saying "ming liu qian shi"   famous only for a thousand years, but "yi chou wan nian" infamous for ten thousand years)<br><br>Do to others what you want others to do to you. For others to give you respect you will have to respect others first. What goes around comes around. These sentences are not just passed from the past for nothing. They teach alot about acceptance and tolerance. So before pointing fingers at others, check yourself first, pointing only 2 fingers will direct at the person you point, but 3 fingers will be directing back at you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, regarding the unfair treatment regarding SG guys having to do NS. It's actually not that bad, there's alot of advantages to it too.<br><br>1) Making us more mature in thinking. How many of us who are proud and ignorant are actually humbled and more willing to co-operate as a team player due to NS?<br>2) Forging good friendship bonds. We get contacts much easier than females who are working outside. Due to deeper friendship rather than aquaintances we have in NS I believe that many of us still keep in touch with our NS khakis after the 2years of NS (my time is 2.5years)<br><br>Next we can't say SG girls have it easy as they don't do NS. When they conceive they have to carry the child in their body for 9months, suffer the pain when the child is born. And with an asian mindset, not many bosses will welcome when their employees take 3months maternal leave. Their jobs are at stake too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just expected such a flammable topic can reach 9 page....Boys Vs gals, Ns topic, S3x, blah blah blah, yada yada yada....I will be silly enuff to read all the pages.<br><br>I posting in this thread is not comment on it just bcos I interested to defend the guys but rather want to give u a message:<br><br>Life does not revolve around comparing who is better or why only guys should serve NS instead.... Kids, I say KIDS, pls learn to be more mature. Instead of using bombastic words to rant, y not concerned more about ur society and ur envoirment??...Like what do u think about the education system?? Hav u think of a better way to improve it??  What do u think about those low income group ppl who is struggling to survive. Some have problem with their 3 meal some have finanical prob going to school...What will u do if u r them?? And what do u think the direction singapore is heading in the future?? Is casino really helping our country??? Mind u all this problem might directly or indirectly affecting u in our daily life and some serious issue might even affect ur bread and butter in the future.<br><br>I knew some of the teenage still cared about things happening around them. But many of them are focusing on flaming, complaining over these worthless issue or asking pervet question on s3x and hoping some babes with big breast hour figure will join them for gangbang session.  Guys please wake up ur idea. I am quite worried at the rate of the teenagers growing looking at the thread they post...<br><br>PS: To all the guys who wonder y gals not serving NS....Please be a real gentleman and a man and stop talking on this topic. Y u care the gals not urself?? Its not like ur ranting will stop this system. If u not happy why not migrate??? NS to me is the only way to differentiate man and women. Without these, some of these boys will be just like a pieces of shit.<br></div>

This Poh Li Zhu studies in Simei ITE for your info.<br>This is a matter of Public Policy. As a citizen of Singapore, I have the right and DUTY to warn guys to steer clear of prostitutes who are out to get guys into trouble.<br><br>If you have sons around, the last thing you want is for a prostitute to hook up and seduce your son and then cry rape, isnt it? Guys and fellow Singaporeans, you have been warned. This is my duty to inform all of you.<br><br>I dont care if the girl or any brudders here ask if I am afriad of being sued for defamation. I have all the necessary evidence to vindicate my allegation that this girl is a Prostitute and a Congenial LIAR.. There is no harm in stating the FACTS. I will be like the old man Lee Kuan Yew who, with all the evidence, challenge opposition to sue him for calling them LIARs etc.<br><br>I am more concerned for brudders here who may be involved in these prostitutes.. it is the same as meeting Sherine the Hulk.<br><br>Guys, you are warned. Please remember this girl.<br>[/b]</blockquote>Show the proof or you may be sued by the threadstarter.<br><br>People have a right to privacy. Showing the address of a person online is illegal. Since you see it in another forum, obviously that person used illegal ways to trace her. And you post this right here, you can be charged under Computer Misuse Act for not warning that user not to post such things.</div>

He's already in deep trouble. Even if it doesn't refer to the threadstarter, saying all these outright here is just asking to be arrested. If he went to trace that person quoted, he's has more than one charges under him. If he didn't, other charges apply. People have already seen, and damages could have done.</div>
