Mahjong always have people cheating... they give each other signals... and they always only want to play with losers. They cut leg if the player win consistently.<br><br>You correct lah... I have met people from all over the world in my work and what you say rings true because a lot like that but not all... a big percentage of sg guys are very decent....<br><br>One Dutch Regional MD of an MNC even said to me... I know you singaporean guys... you go mad in bangkok... he is talking about sex. Anyway you should read my post in "Consensus Sex" thread and see what I wrote about 1 sg guy and that is a true story. I think it is in BAR, the thread I mean.<br><br></div>
