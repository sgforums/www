            <div class='col-md body'>I think that's the way society has been all the way, right till now.. that it's deemed to be rude and of course disrespecting to have a guy peeping right up a girl's skirt.<br>I mean if your a guy, and you find someone else doing that to your girlfriend, how are ya going to feel? Alright, so it's just see and don't touch, but then as a guy, I'm sure you would be protective enough not to allow some other fella looking up your girl's skirt.<br>ummzz.. then from a girl's point of view, think of it that your a girl walking on a road, and then there's this sudden gust of strong wind.. strong enough to send ur dress up high enough to allow some guys by the roadside to have a little glimpse, and then they start their wolf whistles, and stuff.. well, I think that's enough to make me blush so much that I'll go straight home and cancel all my other appointments I have later on.  Just think, if the fellows there didn't make any remarks or whistles etc. at least I wouldn't feel that embarassed ;<br>Whatever it is, for a girl, it's not going to feel good having someone look up her skirt, it's like an invasion of very personal privacy... and in the society, people who do this we call them perverts!<br><br>------------------<br>Nite after nite, I hear myself say, Y can't this feelin' juz fade away? There's no one like U, U speak to my heart; It's such a shame we'R worlds apart. I'm too shy to ask yet too proud to lose..</div>

Me not bothering to hide the undies just make it easier for them to ogle.  Don't believe me?  I asked some male friends and they said they check out girls behind, now what am I supposed to do about that?<br><br>Also, please don't ignore my most important point above, JUST DON"T DISTURB ME.  You can look, it doesn't hurt me so I don't go into any ridiculous length (no pun intended, hehehe) just to cover my panties AT ALL COST but the thing is, can I trust the people who see them to leave me alone and do not make any ridiculing noises?  Can I trust you won't laugh loudly with your friends and make catcalls?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks Cyro.... This is just my point. Should the quest of the forbidden fruit be deemed as perversion? After all voyeurs do not really harm the person as if it was rape or sexual molestation.<br>But do gers really mind guys peeping up skirts especially if they r willing to wear short mini skirts.<br>You see along Orchard Rd all these Ah Lians wearing extremely short skirts. It is just fashion or r they really flaunting it?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this might get me into trouble but here it is:<br><br>To me it's just a piece of double-triangle-shaped cloth, so I don't mind if anyone catches a glimpse of it as long as they<br>SEE but DONT TOUCH and DONT DISTURB me (like by leering oh so obviously or making noises).  I mean I'm responsible for my own clothes and you are responsible for your eyes and your mind...just as long as you keep a respectable distance etc.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is a voyeur in everyone of us. I can accept that there are a number of people who are not into eroticism and perversions, but most of us do have some (even if sub-consciously)level of desires.<br>I'm not supporting voyeurs and peeping toms, but just objectively expressing that its more or less human nature to want the 'forbidden fruit'.<br><br>And oh, of course there are girls who want men to look into their valleys and up their blouses. There are perverts in both sexes.<br><br>Until the day we are all morally upright and religion rules the world, let's just continue being ourselves... human.<br><br>BUT, to those sexually perverted young kids , don't do stupid things to innocent 14 yr old girls and stuff like that.. u people make me sick.. *pukes*<br><br>------------------<br>Is it cold in here, or is it just me?<br><br>CryoGenic: excellent response! i do agree that there are ppl who are perverted but are under control while others can't help themselves...to the latter...too bad.<br><br>in any case...i feel it's just a matter of control. that's something each of us have...</div>
