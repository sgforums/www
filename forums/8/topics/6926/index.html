            <div class='col-md body'>really missed those times in my younger days when i spent 4 days a week playing RPG.<br><br>i journeyed mainly in the Realms specialising as a priest of Azuth. hee...hee....a cleric who can cast mage spells....blade barrier with fireball, idea huh?<br><br>some of my other fave roles was as a elven fighter who uses 2 swords (obviously following the footsteps of my fave Realms character Drizzt Do'urden,though he's a dark elf, a ranger and uses 2 scimitars)<br><br>i did spend some time in Krynn. but no one could ever agree with the DM on how the Test of High Sorcery should be like...none of us can ever survive it in one piece and not too many of us were willingly to lose something....<br><br>Dark Sun....didn't really play much in it, though I did fiddle with Shadowrun and some others.<br><br>i wished i had the time to play paper based RPGs now. computer based RPGS are interesting but pale in comparision. c'mon, in Baldur's Gate, u can actually kill Drizzt by staying away and shooting tons of arrows at him. in the actual story, how can u do this??? Drizzt will ALWAYS be faster than u because of the bracers of speed on his ankles. the reason why you can kill him is because the AI isn't flexible enough for him to do a lot of things which a character of his skill would do to evade arrows instead of just being shot to his death.<br><br>the AI of computer-based RPGs is a worthy attempt, but nothing will ever replace the DM. simply because the AI is inflexible. computers are stupid after all.....which is why we always like to play against other humans.<br><br>enjoy yr days playing RPGs, darksun1, wished i was back in those days....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi!!<br><br>I was hoping that, since you guys are into RPG's , you can help me out.<br>Have any of you heard of the Lone Wolf gamebook series??<br>I'm a collector and i'm desperately seeking the last three books to complete my collection.I've enquired at most book dealers in Singapore, second hand dealers as well, but have met with little success.  One of the reasons is due to the books currently being out of print.  I'm currently looking for the UNABRIGED UK VERSIONS OF LONE WOLF BOOKS 14, 16 &amp; 20. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the books, and I would be eternally grateful if any of you could help me out.<br><br></div>

Leisure Craft at Orchard Rd(now Leisure Central after going through a 3rd change of management) is still around and going strong. You can still find gamers there every week, as well as Tournament Centre at Cantonment Road.<br><br>I myself am also running an AD&amp;D game every weekend for a group of *gasp* 8 players, after a hiatus of ten years from the game.

Thus I feel that it is for veteran role players.<br><br>AD&amp;D rules is simple thus is quite a good RPG for beginner. However, most players are obsessed with numbers (their stats) thus they neglected the role playing part.<br><br>For me, I prefer Ars Magica. It is a RPG where in the world, Mages are more powerful than other in that world. All story are based on the convenant (where the players lived and will protect) Each player will have 1 to 2 mages and a few companions. (Companions are characters with special skills - some good at fighting, other healers, etc) and each story, they will rotate either using their mages or companion.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>AD&amp;D is a very good RPG, just that all these RPG books cost an arm and a leg! You could juz get the basic books, and create whatever rules you need, but somehow, it is just too bothersome and sometimes inconsistent.<br><br>Torment and Baldur's Gate are great computer AD&amp;D games, and I'm looking forward to Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Night and Baldur's Gate II. Looks like Neverwinter Night is going to be the electronic version of the paper AD&amp;D, allowing you to create your own campaigns. Cool!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agree with Bluerf that he books are expensive,some more if using a secondary school's students allowance to buy it,can be quite siong on the pocket,i heard that they are also coming out with Pool of Radiance II,Ruins of Myth Drannor(if anyone remembers the original PC Pool of Radiance).It's going to be like Baldur's Gate,so i am guessing it won't be any bad  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">))</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>AD&amp;D depends on the players quite abit. I know of a group of players who run AD&amp;D for like a few years know, most of their sessions end up in arguments cause of rules.<br>(and it's the game where the DM is supposed to be a god.. go figure)<br><br>For beginner players, easiest game to pick up recommended by my friend is Cyberpunk 2020. All you need is the main book(currently 2nd Ed, 3rd Ed gonna be out by year's end I think) and Blackhand's Weapons supplement. Total Cost about $60. For inspiration go watch Akira, Ghost in the Shell etc.<br><br>I've played/run Vampire too much. Tired of the setting, even though it's great.<br>Sometimes I find rules too constricting, I prefer running what I term 'cinematic rpg'.<br>It's halfway between PnP and LARP. Skip the character sheets and the dice. Just run the game and let the characters immerse themselves into the world, but the DM/GM/ST has to be fair and of course his/her word is final.<br><br>Rare is the female who plays RPG... sigh.</div>

Rules are meant to be ignored if by doing so, the session will be more enjoyable. (However, the DM have to be consistent with his application of his rules)<br><br>Imagine, if you have an assassin who have sucessfully sneak into a victim house and is now standing before the victim sleeping body. Well, if you are a thief, how do you backstab that guy. Also, does the victim stands a chance if you are to assassinate him if he dun wake up. For me, I feel that the assassin will kill the thief in 1 blow (by cutting his throat) without need for dice roll.</div>
