"FATE" is a word i used to describe things i have no control over, even this example.<br><br>So. Shld MJ be blamed or be convicted? shld his character need a new reassessment? or shld the pple be wary of this 1993's incident &amp; prevent it from happening?<br><br>The family chose to settle the case outside court. to be blamed or convicted, only the involved parties know the truth. i can say that MJ wanna bury this whole incident from the world by using $$$ to settle everything. It sounds LOGICAL. Can i also doubt the testimony of the 13-yr-old kid? Can be too since the case wasnt allowed to carry on investigating. Did the kid's family accepted the $$$ coz that was what they have been after? Sounds equally LOGICAL to me as well.<br><br>These 2 sides of the story shall determine the character of MJ thereafter i suppose? It's all decided by all concerned individuals.<br><br>If this 1993's incident was really like the victim boy had described, the ONLY way to prevent it wld be not inviting the kids to MJ at all and this shld be again the parents' decision based on their discretion to analyze the 1993's incident.<br><br>Frankly speaking, everything happens for a reason. I choose to forgive a man who has such terrible childhood IF he was guilty in the 1993's incident. Everyone played a part, so who was to be blamed? Morever, I cant bring myself to 'convict' a man who's unsound to me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
