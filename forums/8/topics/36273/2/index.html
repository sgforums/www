            <div class='col-md body'>during the interview yesterday, he said that he didn't do a cosmetic change for his face and he said he only did it for his nose because his father said it's ugly which i think is not true. I think he even did it for his mouth and face.. He was very yandao last time but now, i think he is not as handsome as before..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

If a gal shares a bed with you does mean she have sex with you but how many will think that way. It's sharing something that you use everynight, a very personal thing... people always relate something bad with bed when bed is a place to rest.</div>
