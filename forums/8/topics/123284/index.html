Buy car, dine out frequently, shopping with no concern.<br><br>These people are living from pay cheque-to-pay cheque. You see, if for whatever reason their paycheque is halted just for a month, these people will panic and their whole world turn inside out.<br><br>I am also not saying you should scrimp and save until your last drop. A little luxury is always good.<br><br>I also have friends who keeps thinking about future future future, dump all their money into insurance, financial planning. Those monthly installments are like weight balls chained to thier ankle.<br><br>To each his own, but i think a few basic rule is always good.<br><br>1. Provide for you parents.<br>2. Save some money for raining days<br>3. Never spend future's money. (ie, installment, credit card. etc)<br>4. Keep credit card expenditure to minimum. Cash is king. Gold even better.<br>5. Buying of things: Do i need it? If no, don;t bother buying. If yes, cheaper alternative?<br>6. Don;t smoke. its expensive<br>7. Don;t drink. its expensive<br>8.
