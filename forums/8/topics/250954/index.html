We may be able to see some black holes here and there, but we should fear those black holes we CANNOT see all the more. Invisible black holes as scientists claimed it.<br><br>Do you know there is a slim chance that the sun may die faster than its supposed to? As in supernova and then it may expand and engulf earth along with many other planets? Or perhaps even becoming a black hole itself.<br><br>Woah woah! Hold your horses before your thoughts go any further.<br><br>Let us focus back on our tiny planet we call home. How much are we contributing to global warming? What drastic changes will there be in the weather in the next 10 or more years? What other natural resources will be depleted (besides oil) in the next 50 or so years? What about our ever expanding population growth? How can we cope with world hunger issues?<br><br>We can do our part in making it a better place for future generations BUT not all will think beyond our planetary climate and what we are causing. There are those who prefer to see what is in front of us, like study, work, dates, $$$, luxury and other human-related stuffs.<br><br>Some are ignorant of such cases. Some are too scared to think of such magnitude. So for those who think of the universe and such, well... Let us keep thinking and imagining further, shall we?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
