Your interest may last a short while.<br><br>Read the different kinds, like programming, creating websites, animation, 3D-rendering, etc. Download the softwares and try them out if possible. If you are still interested after doing them, go for it. If you find you are interested in only specific IT fields after trying them, look out for the relevant polytechnics for the courses.<br><br>Networking is hot course in the IT field. So is IT Security and animation.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Grades hover mostly around B and Cs lor.Only 5 As...</strong><br><br>Do you have very good grades for your final year Project modules and what did you do for the project? And your interest is very important. Do you like doing what you want to do? Even if you can get in based on your good academic results but if your job scope is mainly on software development due to customer needs then it is still a stressful job for you if you hate programming.<br><br>First and foremost, identify which area of IT are you interested in. Go read up Dummy ... books to get a overall view of each aspects of IT. Some ppl opt for database area, some on security, some on gaming and simulation, some on networking, some on software development etc etc.....<br><br>My advice is as a working developer and add on to ndmmxiaomayi posting. Course advisor will be good if they themselves have been in the IT line before and it is important to know which area are they specialising in during their tenure there. Sometimes their advice maybe skewed due to personal bias.<br><br>It is still possible to get IT jobs with minimal software development (assume you hate programming) like into database or systems analysis job scope.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
