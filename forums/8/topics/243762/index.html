            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, before you can say that this is a bash S'porean thread, please note that I will not give opinions here. Form your own.<br><br>1950: Reaches Tampines Int to take 72 home, was amazed to see 4 rows of people trying to board the bus. So I decided to get something else to while away the time.<br><br>1953: Bus is still in bus-bay as frantic passengers try to clamber into/onto the bus. I saunter to the side to witness the spectacle.<br><br>1955: Bus finally pulls away, and I become the 3rd passenger in line. Wait for the sparkling wheelchair accessible bus begins.<br><br>2010: Bloody sparkling bus finally arrives after I watched another 4 lines of humans form. I was then demoted to 5th position down the line when 2 aunties decided to cut the queue from the side.<br><br>2015: Bus manages to squeeze the last passenger in to my amazement (with shouts of: Please cooperate and move to the rear! in chinese and english). To SBST: If you are trying to make profits, this is certainly a step in the right direction. But I hope that the profits can be translated to cost savings for passengers.<br><br>2017: Passenger next to me alights, gets replaced.<br><br>2019: Passenger changes seat, only to get replaced.<br><br>2023: Start of trigger-happy bell pressing session, passenger next to me changes seat, replaced yet again.<br><br>2030: Bus reaches Old Tampines rd, and the bloody bell stops ringing. A view of the reflection of the windscreen shows 3 empty seats, so why the hell do passengers keep targetting my seat?<br><br>2031: Was happy almost too soon, noisy bell that goes "<strong>DEE</strong>! Ding-dong." gets replaced by some handphone blasting songs at maximum volume. This handphone phenomenon is the only one that gets comments from me. TURN THAT BLOODY THING OFF, IT'S NOT AS THOUGH THE SONGS ARE SO DAMN NICE!<br><br>2040: Bus crawls at 20km/h towards a bean-pole who stares impassively at the approaching bus. Bus starts to accelerate again when the idiot stuck his hand out and I closed my eyes.............. When I opened my eyes again, the bus was stuck at an awkward angle of 30 degrees from the road, and one half is still stuck outside oncoming traffic. Goodness knows how the driver manged to perform that stunt.<br><br>2045: Hokkien conversation starts behind me........loud old female voice. Things she said was in the line of: He got pig-brain, he is stubborn, he is good-for-nothing, ask him eat dog-sh<strong></strong>it, well you get the idea.<br><br>2050: Conversation ends with "Nvm, I'll deal with this when I come home. Ok? Bye-bye.".<br><br>2055: Observed this strange phenomena. Our bus was stuck behind 2 buses in the bus-bay, and the potential passengers refuse to walk 2 bus-lengths (20m) to board the bus. Is it the sun? No......it's night-time. Is it raining? No. Is there grass, mud etc? No. But before I thought about labelling them as lazy, something made me change my mind. Kiasuism. A splinter group of folks decided to beat the main group by 30s by walking the 20m forcing the driver to open the door. Bear in mind that there are other buses behind which started honking. So kiasuism or laziness? Take your pick. I choose laziness, slower but less chaotic.<br><br>2100: Leaves the bus and finds out why the seat next to me attracts folks. The 3 seats are occupied by a red plastic bag containing aromatic fried rice, a backpack, and an old female leg........yes, the one who spoke hokkien into the phone. A bit of yoga I guess, because 1 leg was on the next seat, the other on the floor. I definitely was also glad to leave the impromptu disco going on with the handphone being the deejay at the back of the bus.<br><br>All in a day's bus-ride.<br><br></div>
