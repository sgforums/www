The government has not taken a position on this yet. If we have to do something drastic, then we have to consider all the implications," he told reporters.<br><br>Naji said rising incidents of serious crimes committed by foreigners may have led police chief Musa Hassan to propose the idea.<br><br>"He must be very concerned about some of the crimes committed by foreign workers in the country," he said.<br><br>Human Rights Watch warned the resulting isolation would also put them at risk of other abuses, as demonstrated in the case of the approximately 300,000 migrant domestic workers in Malaysia.<br><br>"Instead of improving the situation, Malaysia's proposed foreign worker bill will make it dramatically worse," said Nisha Varia, senior researcher on women's rights in Asia for Human Rights Watch.<br><br>"It's shocking that Malaysia is even considering a proposal that would give employers freedom to lock up workers."<br><br>Indonesian domestic workers in Malaysia often work gruelling 16-18 hour days, seven days a week, and earn less than 25 US cents per hour. Some suffer physical or sexual abuse.<br><br>The two countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in May 2006 to regulate migration of domestic workers, but it allows employers to keep workers' passports and fails to introduce clear standards on a minimum wage, or a weekly day off.<br><br>"While creating the MOU was a step in the right direction, both Indonesia and Malaysia continue to drag their feet in guaranteeing the most important protections for these women," said Varia.<br><br>"Domestic workers have to rely on the whims of employers rather than the rule of law for decent working conditions."<br><br>Human Rights Watch said Indonesia and Malaysia should reform the MOU to include, at a minimum, a commitment to pursue legislative changes to extend equal protection under Malaysia's laws to domestic workers, and the right of workers to hold their own passports.<br><br>"Migration benefits both countries tremendously ... by providing important services to Malaysia and needed income to Indonesian workers," said Varia. </strong><br><br>http://sg.news.yahoo.com/070221/1/46u4b.html<br><br>u noe...sometimes the things our neighbour do simply makes me LMAO  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>i wont want to go to such a country which locks me up n restrict my freedom to work....<br><br>it is ironic, juz like johor blaming singaporeans for their high crime rates, or  blaming girls for wearing sexy skirt when rape happens.<br><br>haix....<br><br>[/b]</div>
