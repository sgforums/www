            <div class='col-md body'>Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, died peacefully in her sleep this afternoon at the age of 101, Buckingham Palace announced today. The Queen was at her mother's bedside when she passed away at Royal Lodge, her Windsor residence.<br><br>Weakened by a recent bad cough and chest infection, the Queen Mother's condition deteriorated this morning and her doctors were called. She died at 3.15pm.<br><br>Buckingham Palace said: "The Queen, with the greatest sadness, has asked for the following announcement to be made immediately: her beloved mother, Queen Elizabeth, died peacefully in her sleep this afternoon at Royal Lodge, Windsor."<br><br>The Queen Mother's coffin is expected to be taken to the Royal Chapel of All Saints in Windsor Great Park tomorrow morning. No decision has yet been taken on whether the Queen and the rest of the Royal Family will attend Easter service as planned at St George's Chapel at Windsor tomorrow.<br><br>Members of the Royal Family were informed of the Queen Mother's death before the news was released to the Press Association at 5.45pm.<br>The Prince of Wales and his sons Prince William and Prince Harry were informed in Klosters, Switzerland, where they are on a skiing holiday. They will fly back to England tomorrow.<br><br>The Duke of York, who was also abroad, was told the news in Barbados where he was on holiday with his ex-wife, the Duchess of York, and their children Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.<br><br>The Duke is understood to be making arrangements to return home. Other members of the Royal Family were already arriving at Windsor for their traditional Easter gathering.<br><br>Those at Windsor included Viscount Linley and his sister Lady Sarah Chatto, whose mother Princess Margaret died on February 9. The death of Margaret added to the strain on the Queen Mother, who had watched as her younger daughter suffered a series of strokes.<br><br>The Queen Mother attended Margaret's Windsor funeral six weeks ago in a wheelchair. The seemingly indomitable Royal matriarch was determined to be at the funeral but looked pale and drawn behind a black veil.<br><br>Senior royal advisers are expected to meet tomorrow morning to finalise details of the Queen Mother's funeral service. Other details, including opening condolence books for members of the public and possible charity donations, will also be decided.<br><br>Tony Blair paid tribute to her this evening: "She was part of the fabric of our nation and we were immensely proud of her. Along with her husband, King George VI, she was also a symbol of our countryÂ’s decency and courage.<br><br>"Her bravery when she refused point blank to leave London and her husbandÂ’s side during the Blitz epitomised both her own indomitable spirit and the spirit of the nation in its darkest hours. Later, as Queen Mother, she was a unifying figure for Britain, loved by all, sharing in its joys and troubles.<br><br>"She believed that the Royal FamilyÂ’s role and duty was to serve the British nation and she carried out that duty with total and selfless devotion.<br><br>"Our thoughts are with the Queen - and particularly so after the sad death of Princess Margaret - and with the Royal Family with whom Britain mourns, united in grief at our loss and giving thanks for a life of extraordinary service to our country."<br><br>The Government is in discussions with the Speaker and other political parties about a date for the recall of Parliament so respects can be paid to the Queen Mother, Downing Street said tonight.<br><br>The Union Flag was tonight flying at half mast at Buckingham Palace. A notice informing the public of the Queen Mother's death was placed on the gate outside.<br><br>It read: "The Queen with the greatest sadness, has asked for the following announcement to be made immediately. Her beloved mother Queen Elizabeth, died peacefully in her sleep this afternoon at Royal Lodge, Windsor.Â  Members of the Royal Family have been informed."<br><br>A large crowd began to gather almost immediately after the announcement outside the palace gates.<br><br>At Sandringham, a notice was pinned on the main gates announcing that the house, which had only just opened for the summer season, would be closed until further notice.<br><br>The notice, pinned on the gate by an estate worker, read: "Following the sad death of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, we will be closed to the public until further notice."</div>
