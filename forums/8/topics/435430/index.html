              <p>hi mancha,</p>
              <p>the thing is;</p>
              <p>administratorship has been agreed 3 months ago. sister has signed the waiver of rights, relinquishing her claim as administrator. the application has been submitted and approved by the court. now is just waiting for the Court to grant the letter of administration.</p>
              <p>what cheesed my wife and me off is after 3 months, out of nowhere; you changed your mind. i know our rights. she has signed the waiver of rights... there is no way she can contest it as she did it in front of the lawyer. </p>
              <p>CPF monies has been cleared. Public Trustee has issued 2 cheques in different sisters name respectively.</p>
              <p>Insurance companies have also paid out... all issued 2 cheques in different sisters name respectively. Everything has been agreed upon and it was simple. 50% each.</p>
              <p>now she wants us to take out whatever money that father left us, put it in a joint account and she wants to oversee the money... so, even if we take out $50K for the house renovations, she WANTS us to return the money back in instalment... </p>
              <p>i mean, is it ridiculous?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Is a matter of just include a name for administratorship, should have no issue on your side. Most importantly is the well beings and close relationship of your wife and her sister. It is good to save for your son future. The nice gesture of female especially married female is that they do think and care for the future of their child. In view of this lovely attribute, some way of doing may unwittingly arouse negativity from you. Probably, your wife and her sister can discuss to set aside 60-70 percents of that total sum. You'll may consider renting out and earn extra monthly income, for spending into the well beings of the economy.

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Now there only the HDB flat left. You wife as administrator can advise the lawyers to sell off the flat and divide the proceeds 50/50. I suggest she do that. Same for any other assets remaining. Just to get the matter over.</p>
              <p>Then comes the after the storm part. With each sister having their share of the inheritance. To discuss plans for the future of the deceased's grandchildren.</p>
              <p>This should be a separate issue from the inheritance. Emotional blackmail should not be used for leverage.</p>
              <p>If the sister-in-law is adamant to have her way with regards to the inheritance monies, tell her to go to the lawyers, who will advise that she will need to prove the intentions of your late parents-in-law regarding their monies. Are there letters of the grandparents wishes for the children?</p>
              <p>Her proposal to oversee the joint account with full transparency is a nice promise, but in reality will be very ugly.</p>
              <p>In family matters, there is always the incitement to delve into joint projects, by one member who usually have his/her own agenda, using family piety as a leverage. Guard against that.</p>
              <p>Family togetherness should be fostered by social activities, not by economic unions..</p>

              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">hi again... just seeking a general opinion from you guys. please be
              as frank as possible ;-)</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">if you have read my last post, my father in law passed away just
              recently and did not leave any will behind. my mother in law passed
              away a year earlier and in accordance to Singapre's intestate
              succession act, the assets, HDB flat and CPF monies would have to
              be spilt among the remaining children... my wife and my
              sister-in-law, just the 2 of them 50-50. should be quite clear, no
              dispute at all... Estimated amount about $100K each...</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">my wife and i are currently staying with my parents and just
              received the keys to our new flat this year at Punggol after
              waiting for 3 years. so of course renovations have to be done
              before we move in. we discussed and decided to use the inherited
              money to pay for the renovations, some outstanding credit card
              loans and invest some of it either in shares or whatever comes
              along.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">now the issue;</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">1) currently, my wife is applying to the court for the letter of
              administration as there is no will and HDB requires it to either
              sell it off or even rent it out. initially, the 2 sisters agreed
              that my wife will be the sole representative and all is in the
              midst of proceedings since last June... however, last night she
              asked us to retract the initial application and include her in the
              new application as joint administrator. her justification is that
              in the event my wife passed on and i inherit the "administrator"
              rights, i quote her, "if he wants to sell off the house, there's
              nothing i can do about it." </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">this is a little puzzling... i understand that in the eyes of the
              law, my wife and sister-in-law are the beneficiaries of the
              HDB flat... so no matter what happens if the flat is sold, they
              must receive their portion of the sale proceeds... am i wrong to
              say that? also, can "Letter of Administration" be passed on to the
              spouse so easily in the event of death?</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">2) she also suggested that whatever money that we will inherit be
              put into joint account between the 2 sisters and she will oversee
              the money. she will show us the bank book every month to verify no
              money has been spent or transacted. we can take out money from that
              account for the renovations BUT, i stress again BUT we have to pay
              it back to the account in instalments at no interest charged. she
              said it will be like a saving for my son in the future. </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Please share your frank opinions. Thanks!</p>
