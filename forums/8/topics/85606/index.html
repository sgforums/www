Those with synthesizer functions will cost more doe. Yamaha also has the 'Clavinova' series (sth like elec piano) ... which costs more but sounds awesome and with lots more sounds, functions and effects.<br><br>If you wan the feel of a piano, keyboards will not do as they simply feel flat and very little expression is possible. For a better feel and response, get the digital pianos and clavinovas have the hammer effect that feels almost like the real piano keys.<br><br>Yamaha would have the greater variety and range and they seem to be the more established here. Can also try Roland and for studioj or performance stuff, Korg is good.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there,<br><br>I think it will be a lot better if you start learning by reading the "dao gei" sheet music. In the future, if you find some piano score of any song that you like on the internet, you will be able to read and play it. How can anyone call themselves a pianist or keyboardist if they can even read standard sheet music?

In the future, if you find some piano score of any song that you like on the internet, you will be able to read and play it. How can anyone call themselves a pianist or keyboardist if they can even read standard sheet music? Yes, it is difficult for the total beginner to learn to read while playing, but with time and practise, anything is possible. </div></blockquote>i did read up a little on reading sheet music from books &amp; cd-rom, juz tat my memory is rusty now...need to go back &amp; recap wat i hav read.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> learning music is really an on-going thing....cannot afford to stray too long or else u will forget wat u hav learnt. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
