            <div class='col-md body'>I have 2 views regarding Singapore government imposing ban on this or fine for that.<br><br>Firstly, the government may think that the citizens are not mature enough. Nothing personal, but I think there's some degree of truth in it. Take for instance, one is given the freedom to chew gum. What does one do? He/she stucks the gum onto the door of the train and as a result cause the system some problems. Obviously, many people did that before the ban. Otherwise, they wouldn't have notice it and impose a ban.<br><br>On the other hand, I think the government always take the easy way out. It may be very efficient in solving problems. But does the end always justifies the mean? Instead of banning this and that, why not educate the people? Make them aware of the problems. Afterall, this is your country(me a foreigner), it should be the duty to keep the country nice for everyone. Perhaps, the government needs to instill some patriotism in the mind. I'm not sure if NS did any good, sure, they make you defend for the country when there's a war, but when there isn't a war, do you help maintain the country?<br><br>Think about these 2 views and tell me what you think? Perhaps, you have different views?<br></div>

I thought so too when i am in Singapore, but when i travel abroad, me and my frens actually have problems searching for rubbish bins and we are so used to throwing things into rubbish bins that we cannot simply throw it on the ground.

We may be considered as a "developed" country (at least near to it) in terms of economy but not so in terms of maturity.<br><br>Education is a very long process.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes it is difficult to change. Most people do not welcome changes. If there is no problem, then most people would not want to try and look for potential problems. They are content with their state. This is natural I guess. Sometimes, I do that too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I think that's why the government are trying in vain to cultivate national identity. Only when you're proud of being a citizen of a country, then you'll love her. The only problem is many young people in Singapore(no offence, and besides, I'm also young) think it's uncool to declare their love for their own country. Dunno why, that is what I observe.<br><br>I think it's difficult, like what LittleMan said. So, I think we just have to slowly change. People don't accept sudden change, they only go for subtle change. Doesn't matter if it take decades, as long as you take the first step. Afterall, you cannot build rome in one day   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not only is education a long process, it cannot stop everyone from not doing it. There will always be those who do not comform to what they are being taught! Agree?<br>So by giving it the ban i think it kinda stop most people from not having access to chewing gum in Singapore itself. However i am sure we always have our very own means. (ie buy from other countries)<br><br>Since the ban itself has not really stop everyone from consuming chewing gums, without the ban..i guess we will still be having gum stuck on our shoes, jamming our lift doors (it's real scary getting stuck in lifts) Well, surely you guys get the idea.<br><br>I welcome the ban and i don't mind having gums only a few times in a year. Absence makes the taste buds grow fonder for chewing gums! Hehe dont you all agree?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
