                  compare it to Filipino and Singaporean accents. You will know that
                  our accent is closer to the Americans. BTW, I don't trust your

              I've been to the Philippines many times and this is what I know, seen and heard in the Philippines.
              
              1.  Philippines national language is Tagalog.
              
              2.  Most of the students in the Elementary and High Schools are unable to speak English or are shy to speak English when spoken to. The college or university students in the Philippines speaks Taglish as the locals term it, which means they speak a mixture of Tagalog and English. Those Filipinos who are able to communicate in English to foreigners speaks with a Tagalog accents and not American accents. If you watch the Singapore television programmes that televised the documentaries about the Philippines for example, when he or she is being interviewed for instance, they speaks English with a deep tagalog accents. One of the main Singapore TV channel has a female Filipino correspondent in the Philippines and when you listen to her reporting in English...it is with tagalog accents, not American accents.
              
              3.  Most of the English movies shown in the various television stations in the Philippines are dubbed into Tagalog. And in their local daily television programmes, most of the Filipino artistes speak Taglish.
              
              My opinion is that those Filipinos having work in Singapore or in other English speaking countries for many years are able to speak English.or good English with or without the tagalog accents.
