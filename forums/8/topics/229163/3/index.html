"Eveyone live happily ever after" I thought it's something we only see in fairy tales?<br><br>Not that I want anyone of them to die lah, but can have more tragedy mah.<br><br>Amongst the Ten Villians, I also respect Du Sa the most. He is no different from any hero lor. He kept his words, protect his fellow "villians", I dare to bet that he dotes about Xiao Yu'er the most amongst the five villians that stayed in the valley. Whatever he did, it's just looks like an act by a hero. But he is also very ruthless and cold-hearted, I think these are the characterisic that made him into a villian.<br><br>(Tok later lah, I go return the novel)</div>
