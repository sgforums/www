KNN......the power difference in such cases for the super-villain too great liao until cannot believe..........haiz!<br>worse still, Marvel later introduced several more super-god villains like Carnage and i start thinking......spiderman fight also cannot win, why read? it's like human VS. God loh......KNN!!!!!!! lame. plus spiderman kenna r*pe and abused by Carnage so many times still can survive for further spider-abuse in the next release of the comic.<br><br>and to add to that, Onslaught even worse than carnage. in the x-men series, this super-villain himself can easily defeat the Fantastic 4, Dr. Doom, all the X-Men, Hulk, Spiderman, Captain America and the Avengers and all other Marvel heroes taking him on at the same time. he's like, without a sweat, can send Phoenix(so powerful already) to the astral dimensiona and trap her there......might as well say Marvel's comic heroes are fighting God all the time and losing every nano-second, with each time worse than the previous.
