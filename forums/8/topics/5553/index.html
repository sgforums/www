            <div class='col-md body'>While many of u would think that this subject would be pretty crude or lame or perverted or whatever, I think that it has real value in it...<br><br>I have often wondered if the size of a guys cock plays any part in his confidence level...It would be interesting to find out...<br><br>I used to (and still do sometimes)think that if my cock wasn't big enough, I shouldn't even bother trying to approach a woman.  Now I don't, but in my previous relationships, I used to be very self-conscious about it and it was one of the many self-esteem shattering things for me to worry about.  I won't go and tell u the length or whatever, but I "seem" to have an average size penis...or i keep telling myslef it's "at least" average...:-p<br>Sometimes it does bug me when I'm thinking about my girlfriends happiness or what...I'm sure some of u have had the same feeling before.  It must be a natural guy thing to feel this way...Especially after u spent years watching those big porn studs who are more hung than horses taking the women and watching the females loving every second of it.<br><br>Am I alone on this?<br><br>This isn't meant to be a smut issue, but more of a curiosity one.<br><br>i hope that women can comment this subject also as ur input would most like mean a lot.<br><br>P.S. -I "used" to be like this...things have changed already  :-)  I had an extension...<br><br>ha ha just joking.  I would never man.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Certainly an intruiging subject indeed Firewire....and I'd be glad to comment on it.<br><br>Let's just say that most Singaporean girls are rather "green" on this subject (unless you're counting some horny Ah Lian)....and what info they get on a guy's anatomy is usually from a school textbook at the age of 14 or 15. Worse, those who do not take Biology or have no active interest in a male's anatomy probably won't even know what the hell we're talking about !!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>For girls who are enlightened enough, I would say that most Singaporean girls do not exactly discuss the size of guys' manhood as part of their everyday conversations (this is only an assumption and any girl is free to dispel it !), UNLESS they have had sex before.<br><br>No kidding....women are like fire and ice when it comes to sex....those who are clueless about it are totally blur about it and some even see it as taboo, while those who have tried it before and love it are even hornier than the horniest male !<br><br>To elaborate on the main topic, I would say that only women who have experienced sex and an orgasm would even CARE about the size of their guy's manhood. Even for a woman who has experienced sex before, she may not consider that as one of the main stimulators for sexual pleasure....it could be other factors like foreplay, ambience etc....<br><br>Simply put, I don't think women in Singapore care enough about a guy's size.....and even if there were those who cared, they probably fall under 1) Horny ah Lians who cannot have enough of sex...2) Married women who are unsatisfied with their sex life and attribute their husband's "size" as the problem....<br><br>Cheers everyone !<br><br>P.S - From a personal point of view, penile size has never been a major concern of mine, as long as it could function normally...that's the most important issue isn't it ??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

I dread the day when it goes limp.  :-)<br><br>That's really interesting what u said about the sex part and different female's kowldege and lust for it.  Ur own personal observation maybe?  Or from somewhere else.<br><br>I've often felt that you know....I mean that women here are either in the know or they're not.  and the ones who have experienced it are hotter than satans boiling balls...a rather crude way of putting it.

But assuming "UNLESS they have had sex before" isn't correct either. Take it as a joke, secondary school girls does critize the budge in between the legs for fun, but on the whole, females don't even have this "thing" in the checklist for finding spouses.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is gonna be fun.<br><br>IMHO, size does play a part in affecting a male's self-confidence, at least at the beginning when he learns little about sex and love-making. But when he eventually gain experience in that field (sounds like some lecturer), he will know how to please a female species with his other skills like sweet talk, foreplay, after-play ... Those are things that count, maybe, not just the sex part.<br><br>And I do think that if the girl that you are making out with truly like you (I didn't use LOVE because that would be too-big a subject), the she will be enjoying the time rather than critisizing about the "size" thing.<br><br>I think Pink is right, little girl use that as a criteria for guys or bf ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sorry guys, i'm afraid size DOES matter.<br><br>some friends and i took an informal survey during our 1st year at university. the women surveyed - a mixture of sexually experienced and inexperienced women - had a choice of length and girth; they were also asked how much they thought size correlated to quality of performance; and given a choice assume two men shared identical qualities, would they perfer a generously endowed one or an 'average', or 'small'; and also how much they thought size correlated to notions of manhood.<br><br>the result of our survey<br>72% prefered a man with largeness in his pants<br>20% said 'doesn't matter'<br>8% prefered a 'small' man.<br><br>hope this helps. i could release the questionnaire if you guys want it.<br><br>cheerio</div>
