              <p>Very true. But i have lived in quite a few countries, yet I (and many other foreigners/travellers i know) whole-heartedly agree with all the points mr Cum-face talked about.

              <p>Aussie retards are retarded for different reasons. And so are the Americans, and don't get me started on the brits, they can REALLY be disgustingly dense. But at least we have empathy and expression, or at least a lot more of it than singaporeans.

              <p>You have a very good point about stupid aussies, dumb Americans, and retarded brits. Some of them really do take the cake. However, the empathy and expression you mentioned are very relevant to this case. This makes it somehow easier, in many cases, to reason with these errant souls. Now try reasoning with some S'porean Singlish punk or unruly Hokkien uncle. You'll probably end up not knowing whether to laugh or cry.</p>
