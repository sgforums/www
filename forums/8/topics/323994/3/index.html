              <p>TS may or may not be right, the thing is his attitudes
              suck.    He must be one who thinks a world of
              himself.   He should look himself in the mirror before
              sending this post then he can include a note there in the post if
              he is some or all he stated in the post.</p>

              <p>I went to the mirror, like you requested, and realized that I fall into points 8 and 10. More interestingly, I am like that only when I step into your godforsaken island. Yes, I am actually <strong>inclined</strong> to be so, thanks to you guys. 4 out of 5 encounters I have on your island are of the 10 points listed. I can only reiterate: what comes around, goes around.</p>
              <p>On a similar note, for those who have been out of your little well that is Sillypore, you will have noticed that lots of angmohs on your island are crude like you people, when such behaviour is but a tiny minority in their home countries. One phrase comes to mind: cultural assimilation. Your PAP likes to term this as 'melting pot'.</p>

              <p>Thanks for demonstrating the friendliness of Sillyporeans.</p>
              <p>I am not entirely unhappy here. Like I said, I like the place; the parks, reserves, wildlife. Luckily, I have a great bunch of buddies who keep me sane here. Unlike the majority, who are, well.. shit.</p>
              <p>I have to admit, I love this job that allows me to see so many cultures. Shall I even mention the money? Let me give you a hint: it's WAY above the average salaries on your island. (But sadly not as much as your beloved rulers are earning, though.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png">)</p>

While the small minority community in the Speakers' Corner complain about ridiculous issues like coup-ing the PAP when we do indeed have no reliable opposition, some of us just want to lead a contenting life. Of course, <strong>some issues they discuss are indeed relevant</strong> such as the ERP issue or high ministers pay. Thus we complain because the authorities will actually entertain &amp; even help us. Reality is you can't change Singapore politics in the near future, so why bother? If you can't oppose it, work with it. That's our mindset.</p>

              <p>To a certain extent, I agree.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">5. Think they look cool,

              <p>Singaporeans as far as I know are quite humble. If there's one trait I know, they do not like to show off or think they are so much better than the rest. You may be referring to the China/India elites who come here and boast.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">6. Quick at finding fault
                  in others, but never seem to be aware of their own.

              <p>Uhh...we are aware, but sometimes we just don't bother.</p>

              <p>I can't deny that. It is true for many Singaporeans, especially for students in the Science streams of Sec School &amp; JCs.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">8. Have an uncultured

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">9. Think they are a

              <p>Again, we do not boast about our achievements. Our government is the one that does that. When we're overseas and people ask abt Singapore, we don't boast "OH, how can you not know?

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">10. Are quick to take

                  spontaneity.</span></strong></p>
              <p>That's crap. I don't deny that Singaporeans are good at taking advntage of situations. BUT i oppose when you say that we're not sincere and spontaneous when showing appreciation. Singaporeans, as compared to many others in the region, actually know how to use "Please and Thank You"</p>
              I don't know what you have against us Singaporeans, but you must have mistaken us for some other nationalities. Maybe it is due to the excessive foreign talent infliction in Singapore...</div>

              <p>I don't know what you mean by this, but there are MANY shops and
              services around who provide good service. Just go to the malls and
              you will see. Of course, I won't deny that there are some, but very
              little shops who are left back in the "Shop is king" era.</p>

              <p>YAH RIGHT! Singaporeans now are considerate. OF COURSE, WITH THE
              200 000 NEW FOREIGNERS  that entered Singapore last year, they
              are socially less educated and thus you may be talking abt them.
              There are so many times where my other fellow S'poreans let me
              alight first, give way on the escalator and offered me seat when
              I'm carrying many stuff, and I have done the same.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">3. Sound brave and bold
