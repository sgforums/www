            <div class='col-md body'>The Waiter and the Spoon<br>Last night, I went with some friends out to a new restaurant, and noticed<br>that the waiter who took our order carried a spoon in his shirt pocket. It<br>seemed a little strange. When the busboy brought our water and utensils, I<br>noticed he also had a spoon in his shirt pocket.

After several months of analysis, they concluded<br>that the spoon was the most frequently dropped utensil. It represents a<br>drop frequency of approximately 3 spoons per table per hour. If our<br>personnel are better prepared, we can reduce the number of trips back to<br>the kitchen and save 15 man-hours per shift."<br>As luck would have it, I dropped my spoon and he was able to replace it<br>with his spare. "I'll get another spoon next time I go to the kitchen<br>instead of making an extra trip to get it right now."<br>I was impressed!<br>I also noticed that there was a string hanging out of the waiter's fly.<br>Looking around, I noticed that all the waiters had the same string hanging<br>from their flies. So before he walked off, I asked the waiter, "Excuse me,<br>but can you tell me why you have that string right there?"<br>"Oh, certainly!" Then he lowered his voice. "Not everyone is so<br>observant... That consulting firm I mentioned also found out that we can<br>save time in the restroom. By tying this string to the end of our "you know<br>what", we can pull it out without touching it and eliminate the need to<br>wash our hands, shortening the time spent in the restroom by 76.39<br>percent."<br>"Hhmmm...After you get it out, how do you put it back?" I asked<br><br>"Well," he whispered,<br><br>"I don't know about the others... but I use the spoon."<br></div>
