            <div class='col-md body'>blurblop:<br>sorry, i was mia cos i got prelims coming up <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>anyway, my stand on this issue is that girls should definitely be made to serve some form of NS equivalent to what men have to do. to say that men having to serve NS are under-appreciated is an understatement. its high-time LKY's original idea of having both men and women serve NS was re-hashed.<br><br>i agree with Xcert, and singapore's policy of exempting girls from serving any form of NS, has definitely made a lot of them pathetically apathetic and unappreciative of what men have to go through, to safeguard their interests. men serving NS regularly die or get seriously injured during training exercises (although i think this is more rare now), and this happens during peacetime. one of the purposes are military serve is that of deterrance, and the result is the peace we have. this peace is enjoyed by both singaporean men and women, but it is the men that have to pay the price for it.<br><br>may i ask what is the equivalent of NS that singaporean women have to do? as far as i'm concerned, the answer is NONE. some may argue women have to go through childbirth, however childbirth is a choice made by the woman. men have to serve NS whether they like it or not.<br><br>the consequence for women not serving their "NS" is no monetary incentives, no bundle of joy, etc, etc. the consequence for men not serving NS is a jail term, which is the punishment for what is considered a criminal offence in singapore. can anyone here tell me this is fair?<br><br>i was previously in NCC during my earlier secondary school days, and trust me, the female cadets could do everything the male cadets could do. march, shoot, run, and all NCC cadets both male and female were equally disciplined and task-oriented. mind you, these female NCC cadets aren't atheletes. they were just your run-of-the-mill, average singaporean girls. if they could go through what the guys did, which itself is proof that they can do time in the military, why wasn't NS implemented for them?<br><br>the reason for their initial exemption from NS when the NS act was implemented in the late 60's (i think), was due solely to economic reasons. at that time, singapore was still developing and the cost of maintaining a military force with both men and women would have been prohibitively high. thus, the idea was scrapped and only men were made to serve NS. is singapore still a fledging nation-state, fresh from independance with a flailing economy? i think this is hardly the case today, despite the economic gloom and as such, the exemption of women from serving any form of NS should be seriously and thoroughly reconsidered.<br><br>when i mentioned earlier that one of the purposes the singapore military serves is that of deterrance, i think that begs the question of why we are doing a half hearted job about it, literally. by exempting women from serving NS, we are effectively halving the size of a potential defence force we can muster up should the need arise.<br><br>should a conflict of the traditional kind break out, what purpose are women going to serve? the men would be out there making themselves useful, fighting or providing backup and logistics support, but the women would be huddled up together with the old folks and children in shelters, basically doing nothing, and being a liability since they are unable to defend themselves. how does this fit in with the government's motto of "total defence"?<br><br>all of what i have mentioned above, isn't even counting in the price that men have to pay during peace time, after we have finished serving our NS. men still have to report back yearly for in-camp training, severely disrupting their working schedules and as people have mentioned, deprive them of promotions, etc. after delaying the age by which men would have entered the working force by 2.5 years, is this all the thanks we get?<br><br>ok that's it for now, i wanna go eat my laksa for dinner....its getting cold. anyone got anymore points to bring up or questions to ask just post here and i'll try my best to find the time to reply <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
