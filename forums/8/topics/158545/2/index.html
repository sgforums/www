Strategies here are to make differential changes that add value to the product and to target new markets. Marketing moves away from promotion through personal selling toward more mass media advertising. Just as predators react to attractive targets, competition begins to build as awareness increases and sales momentum builds. Unit manufacturing costs begin to fall as fixed costs are spread over more production units and workers move down the learning curve. The firm attempts to stay in the growth stage as long as possible.<br><br>source: http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1038/is_n5_v39/ai_18736462<br><br></div>

The design was more or less the same across all models and had very simple functions. Consumers were not terribly excited about it as it was merely a basic (though relatively advanced) communication tool.<br><br>But in the past decade, technology development has made phones an integrated part of our life. Mobility aside, HPs can also be a personal entertainment centre (radio, games &amp; even video). Due to fast paced living, phones (be it mobile or fixed) are ESSENTIAL part of almost everyone's life to keep in touch with the critcal pple in one's life (be it core colleagues or family members). hence we have come to the stage that involvement with the product phone is so high that some pple simply "cannot live without it".<br><br>not sure if my above elaboration is applicable though. haha.</div>

Esp when a product tends to command a higher price should it be a niche product, the company needs to adds value to the core product. For instance, to provide superior after sales service/technical support, making it tougher for competitors to imitate. With such efforts, the customer will be more willing to pay the high price (should there by no close competition) even though a product is in the growth stage.<br><br>else, shld the product be a more general commodity where competition is rampant, the company may have to adopt a different pricing strategy in order to retain market share. for instance, throw in promotions to entice customers to purchase in bigger quantities or extended service contracts. another way to retain interest during the growth stage is to launch complementary products/services so that consumers will be "locked in". for eg, Sony products are rather proprietary as they are designed such that the different equipment can be easily communicated with one another to faciliate consumer's use. so a product in a growth stage has extended life cycle as it can be used with its newer products from the same "family".</div>

The marketing plan's price, promotion or place (distribution) strategy relies heavily on the brand equity of the product. For instance, a product with lower brand equity (not so well known in the market) may require more elaborate planning &amp;/or spending on A&amp;P activities (pull strategy) to raise the brand awareness among its target customers.<br><br>However, in recent years, a lot of bigger corporations are changing their mindset when it comes to branding or increasing brand equity. it has become such that branding drives marketing (not the other way round).<br><br>these corporations are spending a lot more effort and resources to strategically plan &amp; execute their branding &amp; marketing activities to reach their brand objective. the brand carries more than just the intangible value of the product. it also represents an identity/values of what the company behind the brand stands for.<br><br>Take for instance, VIRGIN. VIRGIN's brand equity is high and they have been able to diversify their business rather boldly (w/o prior experience) and some even rather succesfully. No matter what they do, their working style revolves around being consistant with their brand value, ie, being "fun, maybe totally irrelevant &amp; thinking out of the box" style. As such, their target customers around the world gets a very clear message of what VIRGIN stands for and even look forward to receiving new products/services from VIRGIN (partly coz they are curious as to what VIRGIN will come out with next).<br><br>not sure if the above helps. just my personal thoughts on branding &amp; marketing! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
