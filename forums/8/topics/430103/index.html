              <p>WHAT? U mean an angmo dare to bully a Singaporean. This makes me very pissed.</p>
              <p>I am not afraid to argue with an angmo even tho he is 3 times as tall as I am. After the argument, I will say to him that God will curse him and throw him into the lake of fire. Of course that's not what a christian should say but I just don't like angmos. Anything about angmos gets me worked up. If any of u need advice on how to deal with angmos, just write me. I really give them a piece of my mind.</p>
              <p>I used to have a website that teaches Singaporeans how to handle angmos but I took it down bec my cowardly family fears repurcussions from the angmo bootlicking PAP. The following are some tips from my ex webpage.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: small;">- I think the same way
              that whites alienate Singaporeans when we go study in London and New
              York, we should alienate the whites in Singapore to give them a taste
              of their own medicine. Acting like sheep in the face of such racist
              abuse can only result in more innocent Asians entering the
              slaughterhouse.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: small;">- Many whites in British
              and
              American towns act like they have never seen an Asian before.  I
              think we should do the same to them in Singapore.  We should treat
              white guys like aliens from outer space, or just plain dog crap. Show them the SINGAPORE CULTURE.<br></span></p>
              <p>Tip 1: Stand side by side on MRT escalators denying the white man the option of walking.<br> <br> Tip 2: When a white man or woman opens a door for you, don't offer any word of
              thanks.  Just eye them and walk on by.<br> <br> Tip 3: At a taxi stand as the white man is about to get into the cab, you, the alighting passenger,
              should slam the door for him to open.<br> <br> Tip 4: When you see a white man selecting his lunch at the hawker centre, bark
              out your order to the vendor to get your order first.<br> <br> Tip 5: When driving and a white man indicates his desire to change lanes, speed up to ensure
              he does not get in front of you.<br> <br> Tip 6: When a white man withdraws money from an ATM, peer over his shoulder.<br> <br> Tip 7: When you see a pregnant white woman on the MRT,  refuse to offer her a
              seat.</p>
              <p>Tip 8: When a white asks you for directions, say "I'm in a hurry. I
              don't have the time to indulge you"</p>
              <p>Tip 9: Do not invite whites or welcome them to your homes for Deepavali, Hari
              Raya, or Chinese New Year.<br> <br> Tip 10: At the workplace do not treat whites with kindness or understanding.</p>
              <p>Of course, when it comes to a Singaporean (Malays, Indians and Chinese only exclusing eurasians), retain the kind of traditional friendliness you grew up
              with, put on your best and be as gracious as you possibly can i.e. hold lift
              doors open for Singaporeans, smile when you see Singaporeans, and assist Singaporeans who need
              your help.</p>
              <p>FINALLY, when a white man tries to show you some attitude, try to use the following phrases to put him in his place:<br> <br> Phrase 1:  When you are overseas in a white man country and a white shouts
              to ask  you to go back to your own country, tell him to "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Go to Hell</span>".
              This
              is one of the wittiest things you can say.  Don't offer him any
              compassion or explanation as white racists are never open to reason. 
              Plus you'll look silly trying to use logic to "diffuse" the situation
              because logic never works with people who are out to harm you.<br> <br> Phrase 2:  If a white man tries to assert his "authority" in Singapore, tell him
              "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore does not owe you a living</span>".<br> <br> Phrase 3:  If a white man tries to bully you at work or in a shopping
              centre, tell him "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">You are not in a white country so don't try to act so
              tough</span>" or "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Don't try to act all tough just because you are a
              white man</span>"<br> <br> Phrase 4:  If a white barks out some racist remarks at you, tell him "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">You are a
              disgrace to the human race, you low life racist bastard</span>".<br> <br> Phrase 5:  When in doubt in issuing any phrases, just use the handy retort
              "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Get Lost</span>".</p>
              <p>Please go thru these phrases weekly so u won't forget them.</p>

              your help.</p>
              <p>FINALLY, when a white man tries to show you some attitude, try
              to use the following phrases to put him in his place:<br> <br> Phrase 1:  When you are overseas in a white man country and a
              white shouts to ask  you to go back to your own country, tell
              him to "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Go to
              Hell</span>". This is one of the wittiest things you can say. 
              Don't offer him any compassion or explanation as white racists are
              never open to reason.  Plus you'll look silly trying to use
              logic to "diffuse" the situation because logic never works with
              people who are out to harm you.<br> <br> Phrase 2:  If a white man tries to assert his "authority" in
              Singapore, tell him "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore does not owe you a
              living</span>".<br> <br> Phrase 3:  If a white man tries to bully you at work or in a
              shopping centre, tell him "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">You are not in a white country so
              don't try to act so tough</span>" or "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Don't try to act all tough just
              because you are a white man</span>"<br> <br> Phrase 4:  If a white barks out some racist remarks at you,
              tell him "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">You are a
              disgrace to the human race, you low life racist
              bastard</span>".<br> <br> Phrase 5:  When in doubt in issuing any phrases, just use the
              handy retort "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Get
              Lost</span>".</p>
              <p>Please go thru these phrases weekly so u won't forget them.</p>

              <p>First off, i agree with you, doesnt mean theyre tall theyre big, but arent we supposed to be all good to everyone? It doesnt mean one white person beats a countrymen, doesnt mean we all need to hate on their race, we should just hate that "ONE" person who did that. Just saying.</p>

              <p>Some (not all, of course) of the caucasians believe they can bully asians simply because of their skin colour.</p>
              <p>Eg: I think most locals won't expect super good service at simple restaurants where each meal for a single person only cost about 30-50 bucks.</p>
              <p>And yet I've lost count of how many caucasians I've seen trying to leave without paying at these restaurants for the simple reason of "poor" service.</p>
              <p>Prolly got the "Treat me like a king because I'm white" idea too high up in their head.</p>

              <p>I refer to the article in the New Paper dated 11 May 2011. Our
              fellow Singapore countrymen have been assailed by Caucasian men
              without any fear of reprecussion. This is the visible result of the
              influx of foreigners into Singapore. They probably belong to some
              elite club and believe that they are now above the law. Now even
              Suntec is not safe for us common citizens to visit. Ramming
              people’s head into pillars indeed. I fear what will happen to our
              daughters if they any of them bump into these foreigners. This is
              no longer a country and home that I feel safe in.</p>
