Cos "understanding" is a very important part to matain human relationship rather than jus love relationship. To be frank i have lots of frd who are lik the guys u knw... and they all have their own excueses. Most that iv notice is that they find that their wife are not acttractive as b4. Same that iv GFs doing that to their husbands too due to same reason. U must knw wad is ur other part of life wants, not jus on bed but of cors in hes life style. For me i will always try to make new surprises for my fif and i wld do simple things like asking "Baby hows ur day?, Baby had lunch? Baby u need a massage?" i find that alot of ppl dun even bother to do such simple things at all...i wld say it make a big diff in life.</div>

Did you live up to expectation? Of course you would answer yes to my query but the truth is only you yourself know.

And you definitely sounded very insecure with big self inferiority complex and with a suspicious character and mind too. So I suggest to you NOT TO get married. Otherwise, you will get divorce sooner than you think. Moreoever you will only give unnecessary stress to your future husband and I would pity the fellow who married you. So, spare the men their agony and stay away from them <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> .<br><br>By the way I've been married for eighteen years to a very wonderful woman who has full confidence in me and for that I thanked her. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Just saw a reply from you that you were once married before and got divorced. But that is beside the point. Please don't lump all the men into your ex-husband category that is - unfaithful. Instead of asking why men or should I say your ex-husband were unfailthful why don't you do some reflection. Search yourself and ask yourself have you been the wife he deserved? Did you live up to expectation? Of course you would answer yes to my query but the truth is only you yourself know. Many a times a man became unfaithful was due to the unnecessary pressure from the wife.</div></blockquote>That is always the excuse men give when they stray.  Tink of it the other way.  If a woman strays and quote that as an excuse, will the society and the family forgive her?</div>
