            <div class='col-md body'>I bought all their bootlegs when i was still schooling...not cheap....becos it is imported and not official release, i pay up to $32 for a CD that may contain 6 songs, sometimes unreleased or their very first demos.....<br><br>I love Nirvana. They are never the best musicians you can find. Kurt once said that he uses lousy korean guitars during his live shows becos he can trash as many as he wants. He also said that he never likes to tune his guitar during his shows. But Kurt writes mean lyrics. I have yet to find a lyricist that convey his tots as well as Kurt does. The emotions he brings out thru his songs and his words.<br><br>Nirvana signals the the rise of GRUNGE and with Kurt's death, GRUNGE died. Grunge was never about the music. Grunge was about the attitude and doing things for ourselves. Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam once said something like that during the era where Grunge was at its peak "These young people look at us (nirvana and the other grunge bands) as role models but we hate it. We never wanted to be that"<br><br>In the end, Kurt died becos he is caught in between being famous and his refusal to be famous. His fame is the direct contradiction of what Grunge was all about. But he is great. He will always be great and I will always remember him as a music hero who shaped my life.<br><br>8 April 1994 - The day the world lost a genuine hero.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Should I curse or bless him? Nirvana was the band at the turn of the begining of 90's to set this grunge music trend going. It basically create a new phenonmenon that sort of cause the death of heavymetal music arena that were the rage back in the 80's with bands like Metallica,Megadeth,Iron Maiden,Judas Priest,Sepultura etc etc.<br><br>The songs are short and catchy and not as noisy (heheheh) but somehow the style reminds me of punk music like Ramones style. I like Ramones a lot and when Nirvana came along, it sort of re-ignite my interest in short and catchy and slightly noisy song again.<br><br>Ppl told me Nirvana may not be the first in this grunge business as Pearl Jam was there first? Nirvana gain world fame first. Anyone wanna confirm on that?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Suicidal Note of Kurt Donald Cobain, 1967-1994<br>To Boddah<br><br>Speaking from the tongue of an experienced simpleton who obviously would rather be an emasculated, infantile complain-ee. This note should be pretty easy to understand.<br><br>All the warnings from the punk rock 101 courses over the years, since my first introduction to the, shall we say, ethics involved with independence and the embracement of your community has proven to be very true. I haven't felt the excitement of listening to as well as creating music along with reading and writing for too many years now. I feel guity beyond words about these things.<br><br>For example when we're back stage and the lights go out and the manic roar of the crowds begins., it doesn't affect me the way in which it did for Freddie Mercury, who seemed to love, relish in the the love and adoration from the crowd which is something I totally admire and envy. The fact is, I can't fool you, any one of you. It simply isn't fair to you or me. The worst crime I can think of would be to rip people off by faking it and pretending as if I'm having 100% fun. Sometimes I feel as if I should have a punch-in time clock before I walk out on stage. I've tried everything within my power to appreciate it (and I do,God, believe me I do, but it's not enough). I appreciate the fact that I and we have affected and entertained a lot of people. It must be one of those narcissists who only appreciate things when they're gone. I'm too sensitive. I need to be slightly numb in order to regain the enthusiasms I once had as a child.<br><br>On our last 3 tours, I've had a much better appreciation for all the people I've known personally, and as fans of our music, but I still can't get over the frustration, the guilt and empathy I have for everyone. There's good in all of us and I think I simply love people too much, so much that it makes me feel too fucking sad. The sad little, sensitive, unappreciative, Pisces, Jesus man. Why don't you just enjoy it? I don't know!<br><br>I have a goddess of a wife who sweats ambition and empathy and a daughter who reminds me too much of what i used to be, full of love and joy, kissing every person she meets because everyone is good and will do her no harm. And that terrifies me to the point to where I can barely function. I can't stand the thought of Frances becoming the miserable, self-destructive, death rocker that I've become.<br><br>I have it good, very good, and I'm grateful, but since the age of seven, I've become hateful towards all humans in general. Only because it seems so easy for people to get along that have empathy. Only because I love and feel sorry for people too much I guess.<br><br>Thank you all from the pit of my burning, nauseous stomach for your letters and concern during the past years. I'm too much of an erratic, moody baby! I don't have the passion anymore, and so remember, it's better to burn out than to fade away.<br><br>Peace, love, empathy.<br>Kurt Cobain<br><br>Frances and Courtney, I'll be at your alter.<br>Please keep going Courtney, for Frances.<br>For her life, which will be so much happier without me.<br><br>I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Despite all the claim abt Nirvana supermacy in grunge rock, I still find their music has much influences from the punk music of the 70s like Sex Pistols and Ramones. Basically it is the short duration of the song and the very catchy guitar riffs and the lyrics in it.<br><br>Now did Kurt Cobain mention his musical influences is from where? Given a choice between Nirvana and Ramones I pick Ramones cuz they are there first back in the 70s  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
