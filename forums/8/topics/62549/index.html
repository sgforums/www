            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Singaporeans kiasu? The Chinese are worse </strong><br>By Goh Sui Noi<br><br>BEIJING - Every morning when I take the underground train to work, I am faced with a dilemma.<br><br>Do I stand behind the person buying a train ticket at the ticket window, or do I join the 'lateral queues' - in the words of a fellow Singaporean - of other commuters shoving their change at the ticket seller on either side of the ticket buyer at the window?<br><br>The odds are 10 to one that the ticket seller will give a ticket to whoever is able to get his or her money through the window first rather than serve only those who are next in line.<br><br>It's a tough choice to make - do I stand in line, as I am used to doing, and get served last, or join in the shoving and feel like a boor?<br><br>Once, I told a man who cut in in front of me to 'please queue up'. He looked askance at me, then went ahead and pushed his money in front of mine through the ticket window anyway.<br><br>A friend told me she once protested at a queue-jumper only to get the rejoinder, 'Who asked you to be so slow?'<br><br>Even when there is no obvious advantage in queue-jumping, people will try and push ahead of you.<br><br>Not too long ago, I was at the airport waiting to take a flight which had been delayed for several hours because of heavy fog. Passengers were bunched together in front of the boarding gate.<br><br>When boarding began, airline staff at the gate asked passengers to form a queue. Some of us tried, but many didn't bother. My travelling companion and I got separated when a group of passengers pushed through in front of me.<br><br>Yet, there was no need to rush because we had already been assigned seats.<br><br>So, why are the Chinese so anxious to zhengxian konghou, or 'scramble to be ahead, afraid of lagging behind'? Or in Singapore-speak, why are the Chinese so kiasu ?<br><strong><br>The answer I often get is that overpopulation and shortage of resources are the root of this and many other ills in Chinese society, both in the past and today.<br></strong><br>Ms Xiao Qin, the clear-eyed young woman from Anhui who puts my flat in order each week, thinks this is the case.<br><br>She thinks the <strong>crushing poverty among migrant workers like herself has made them calculative and ever ready to take the pettiest of advantages. </strong>She refuses to leave her oil and sauces in the communal kitchen she shares with other households because she's afraid they will get stolen.<br><br>Historian John King Fairbank, in describing the population explosion in China in the 1800s, said <strong>life then was reduced to a grim struggle for survival in which generosity and philanthropy became luxuries people could ill afford. Personal morality declined as virtue brought uncertain rewards and those who lived by their wits survived better. People became suspicious of seemingly worthy motives, fearful of strangers, and ungenerous.<br></strong><br>Agreeing with this thesis, population expert Li Xiaoping added that cycles of crises of survival throughout China's history had led to such traits being ingrained in the Chinese cultural make-up.<br><br>But in traditional Chinese society, some factors served to control people's behaviour. One was the belief in Confucianism, which preached self-discipline.<br><br>Also, in the traditional agrarian society in which there was minimal migration, any getting out of line would mean conflict in the close-knit local community. So, people tended to toe the line.<br><br>With the introduction of communism, however, traditional Confucian values were destroyed and replaced by modern role models like Lei Feng. While on the surface, equality was preached, people could see inequality and special privileges everywhere - only officials of a certain level and above could sit on soft seats on the train or take a plane, for example.<br><br>Under the rationing system of the planned economy, one had to go through the back door, make connections, in order to get an extra bar of soap, say, or bale of cloth. Because there was no private property and no individual ownership, no one had any qualms stealing from 'the big pot' that belonged to no one. Thus, modern society was worse off than the feudal society of old.<br><br>So a man who fell into a river drowned because no one would try and save him, and a toddler starved to death alone at home after the single mother was arrested by the police.<br><br>The family of an elderly hit-and-run victim tried to pin the blame for the accident on the rare Samaritan who had driven the injured man to hospital.<br><br>But Mr Li assured me things had improved immensely in the past 10 years or more since the opening up of the Chinese economy and institution of reforms.<br><br>The change for the better was brought about by foreign, particularly Western, influences, and a gradual return to traditional values, coupled with a growing abundance of goods, he declared.<br><br>People are becoming more civilised even if China has a long way to go before it gets to be like Singapore, he believes.<br><br>As for me, I look forward to the day when a fellow commuter would wave me ahead with an 'after you' at the ticket window.<br><br>[/quote]<br><br>sounds familiar?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>

He wants benefits so he queues without being fully informed what he's queuing for. Maybe it's because of the high cost of living in Singapore that makes us like this? Not sure how to explain what I'm trying to get at, but it's something like, cos the cost of living is high here, so we try to save whatever we can and get our hands on whatever can help to lower our burdens? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
