MTR is the fastest, but it's expensive (unless you buy a MTR tourist pass). Avoid MTR during peak hours.<br><br>The octopus card can be used on all mode of transport (except taxis). When you buy a normal adult card, it costs $150 ($50 deposit + $100 value). To be frank, the $100 value will not last long. (The trip from the airport to the city already eats a large chunk.) If you travel solely on tram and star ferry, the card should be able to last for one week. If you take MTR &amp; KCR often, you may have to top up $100 every 2 days. If you make a trip to the big buddha in Lantau Island, you may have to top up your card before and after the trip!<br><br></div>

If it's stuck in the west (e.g. Sheung Wan or Central), the line from Happy Valley to Shaukeiwan will not be affected. If it's stuck in the east (e.g. Shaukeiwan or North Point), the line from Happy Valley to Kennedy Town will not be affected. If it's stuck in Happy Valley, the line from Kennedy Town to Shaukeiwan will not be affected.<br><br>The worst scenario is when a tram get stuck on the eastbound lane between Tin Lok Lane (Wan Chai) and Percival Street (Causeway Bay), because all tram routes (regardless of going east, west, or Happy Valley) will travel on this track.<br><br>But so far, I never experience any tram disruption yet. The tram has been pretty reliable. (But the tram is rather slow because it shares the same road space with other vehicles. Unlike normal vehicles which can steer away from an obstruction, the tram stay on the fixed track. If there's a traffic jam, the tram will be the slowest and most affected.)</div>
