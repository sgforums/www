            <div class='col-md body'>If she has another affair, I dun think I can take it. Probably break with her. If she can share her feelings so easily when still with me, then no point staying together cos the element of trust and all is lost. However I will want to make sure that it it really happened first. I dun want to go and break up just cos there are rumours and all. Better to confirm before doing anything drastic. Understandably in LDR it is not easy to confirm, just have to take hints. A friend's g/f once told him right in the face while overseas that she is scared she feels tempted to cheat on him. *terrible* Anyway she did not finish her studies. Made my friend damn worried. Love may conqueres almost ALL but dun think it includes infidelity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>doesn't it depend on what you expect from your other half? if her mind, personality and wit engages you, why stop her from having fun on the side? she'll still possess the same qualities that attracted you before and after the 'dreadful' deed. fun together or fun apart, she doesn't suddenly turn dumb, dull or witless with a mere physicality. cheating is only a concern when there is some notion of possession, some notion of belonging, which frankly perplexes me. why do we equate the humpy-dump with notions of love and romance? will not sarah warm you during those long winter nights just as well as alison? cheating is a nonstarter if we really know what we want from each other, with specificity.<br><br>cheerio<br><br>------------------<br>When I was a kid, I used to pray every night for a new bicycle.

            <div class='col-md body'>Unfortunately, I've been through the whole saga of cheating. My partner cheated on me twice when we first fell in love but haven't offically dated. Each time, I was told of the incident immediately by him and apologies were given. To me, it wasn't the physical act that was disturbing but the moral implications of it. I was tremendously hurt. I asked him pointe-blank whether there were emotions involved and he said no. I don't think I will ever understand the reasons for such actions but that was sufficent for me to forget about it. Have I fully forgiven him? No and I don't think I ever will but you've got to move on in life. All those around me were telling me to close all contacts with him but deep inside, I know that I couldn't.<br><br>Its been 3 months now and we are still going out and very much in love. Things are quite smooth and we realise that we have to solve our problems instead of avoiding them. You have to make things happen and not wait for them to occur.<br><br>------------------<br>we've come a long long way together. Thru' the hard times and the good. I have to celebrate you baby.

I did and still do realise the risk that I am putting myself through and you can say that I am putting a huge bet on this.

I certainly do not wish for reoccurance of unpleasant incidents but again, I can't be sure if it will happen at all. Of course there is the certain schema attached and I would be lying if I say I don't care.

            <div class='col-md body'>i think that LDR is something very unpredictable, just as almost everything else in life. to even embark on a LDR in the first place, there must be a certain element of trust. and to me, to have one night stands constitute breaking the trust that might already be fragile due to the distance between us. but i wont monitor my bf's movement or anything cuz i would want to trust him. besides he's not a dog or ath that i can put a leash on and expect to know his every action.<br><br>no matter how much i love him, i dun think i can bring myself to forget it, even if i've forgiven him. so i think that ultimately the relationship would not work outbecause of the doubts and questions that keep playing themselves over and over in my mind.<br><br>one thing i would appreciate greatly is that he would tell me directly, rather than having me find out from someone else.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi Terence,<br><br>iÂ’m flabbergasted!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> surely you jest? i just want to get something cleared out of the way: are you talking about a marriage here or a live-in relationship whereby the lady in question fits some of your requirements but not all &amp; youÂ’re still waiting for the so called Â“rightÂ” one? or even one where the sex is great but as partners for life, heck that leaves much to be desired type of relationships?<br><br>if youÂ’re talking about a marriage, wow, i never knew that you could be so Â‘relaxedÂ’ &amp; understanding about your wifeÂ’s infidelity. even for a girlfriend with the potential to be your wife, your magnanimity in this area astounds me.<br><br>surely when we become someone elseÂ’s other half (legally married or not yet), thereÂ’s bound to be feelings of possessiveness &amp; commitment? i mean, if there isnÂ’t whatÂ’s so special about being your doll? to think iÂ’ve been working so hard to catch your attention  :p! Duh! what was i thinking??? *knocks head knocks head*<br><br>sure, if iÂ’m so inclined, alex would warm me just as well as brandon, but whom shall i call as my love? am i not in effect looking for a series of one stands with a constant stand who perhaps can sexually please me more?  what about commitment &amp; making plans for the future &amp; all that jazz about will you still love me &amp; feed me when iÂ’m sixty-four?<br><br>er, what kind of relationships are you talking about here, Terence, please clear my doubts ... thanks.<br><br>[This message has been edited by colette (edited 18 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Terence<br>Well, we are sort of talking little about morality and values unless u think they are simply uncalled for. Has the world simply disappointed u to a point  that you only look for sexual partners instead of a loving damsel?<br>Good for you if you are trying to be the Dr.Jekyll here and Mr.Hyde in real life(or is it the other way round) cos I do believe in split personalities esp where the virtual reality is concerned...Kudos to u for being so 'diplomatic' in your thinking... and yes you have suceeded in making this forum really interesting and anticipating especially when reading your most outspoken replies which certainly is an eye-opener for me ...
