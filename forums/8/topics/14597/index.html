            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore is so small in area. Imagine you are working as a plate washer in one of the hawker centre or food courts. The chances of running into friends and relatives are rather high and it would be such a embrassing moment that most people would give that job a pass if they have a choice.

Just like the above mentioned POST, it's a RELATIVE thing... LARGE SUM of $$$ to them, BARELY enough to feed us...? Moreover, you mentioned the feeding of a family and such..?

If you're just looking to be a dish washer or a hawker cleaner I tell you you'll just need to speak English... (Perhaps you can take up additional 'courses' to learn some Malay and dialects...?) What's that about EDUCATION being IMPORTANT is Singapore...? WHY spend (waste?) your time on it? To imagine that EDUCATION is a MUST in Singapore...?<br><br>Talk about PRIDE and EDUCATION? If you see your children seeing you work at such places would there be PRIDE? Maybe? You're still working hard to give them a feeding to provide for...? But what about EDUCATION..? What about WHAT your parents used to tell you and you might be telling your CHILDREN? STUDY hard so that you'll get a BETTER job..? A 'BETTER'(?) job...? HOW you EXPLAIN that concept to them...? Of HOW CRUEL and BRUTUAL true life can be....? Talk about STRESS at work?

But perhaps more like a little frustrated with the SYSTEM...? On such topics, we usually have people COMPLAINING or others SUGGESTING that they quit COMPLAINING and work HARDER.... But CAN'T they SEE? It's the SYSTEM..... Who don't know the FITTEST would survive? So SIMPLE as that? WORK HARDER? WHERE would that bring you..? You achieve MORE, they PULL up the standard even more... YES, living standard is INCREASING, but EMPTY PROMISES on relative benefits fall back...? Why not? Go ahead... WORK HARDER... And HARDER... Can you even IMAGINE what your children would be LIVING in this kinda ENVIRONMENT? Haven't people realised why UNLESS some MAJOR CITIES, Singapore is relatively LOW-CRIME? Because the place is SMALL? Because it's EASIER to control...? We're EASIER to control..? WAKE UP MAN.... One thing I would like to REMIND 'ALL', Singapore is not exactly LOW CRIME because it's SMALL... It's because it HAS TO BE..... And with the current system it's like BOILING a kettle of water SEALED TIGHT.... Singapore is SMALL.... IMAGINE this? If terrorist's act in other countries are to happen in SINGAPORE? What would it be like? Actually it happened BEFORE... Long way back in HISTORY.... But it was US against 'them'.... With the current situation continuing, it shall be SINGAPORE against INTERNAL DISRUPTION and THEN the EXTERNAL FORCES.... GOOD LUCK? Think WHY the government is emphasizing SO MUCH on FREEDOM of SPEECH nowadays...? Because NOBODY wanna speak up 'openly' anymore... It's like a POTENTIAL TIME BOMB waiting to EXPLODE... Is it FRIGHTENING? YES... At least to them...?<br><br>But what's 'Freedom of Speech'...? Care to DEFINE it? Does it INVOLVE that many many more legimate strings and sub-branches behind...? Come on...

If that scenario is reached, Malaysians working in Singapore would be flocking back to their own country for a job. Malaysia's salary is relatively LOW as compared to Singapore because of currency and such. Besides, I don't think you would even stand a CHANCE? Just like Singapore companies should give priority of jobs to Singaporeans, you can expect the SAME over there? Just that the situation is a little TWISTED? In Singapore, Singaporeans usually would ask for a higher pay as compared to Malaysians. Back in Malaysia, Singaporeans as FOREIGNERs asking for a HIGHER pay? Not to mention Malaysia is never really on good terms with Singapore? Good luck for all EASY FANTASIES? Try MIGRATING?</div>
