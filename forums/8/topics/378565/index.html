              <p>As I was watching the President Start Charity show just now 7.30pm on ch5, several thoughts went through my mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. The fat ass President of Singapore together with his wife and the Minister of MCYS was sitting there watching the entire show. They did not contribute anything except just to watch the show. The rest of the people were either acting in the show or like the rest of everybody in singapore donating money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. He as the President of Singapore should lead by example. At the end of the show there was so many people coming to donate huge amount of money to the charities and he being the President of Singapore just stood there and collect the cheques and never donate any money to charity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. What kind of behaviour is this? Shouldn't he lead by example too by donating money to charities too? Its not as if he is poor and got no money to donate. Hell his salary is the highest in Singapore and the highest among all the politicians in the world too. Can't he just donate say 2 or 3 months of his salary to charity which will have amounted to millions of dollars to help the poor and needy?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What a selfish person he is.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. At the end of the show, there were several disabled people who presents gifts to the President. A few of them draw a protrait of him while another person gave him flowers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why do they give him presents for? He did not contribute anything at all to the show. It is ok that he did not perform in the show. A fat ass like him will probably suffer a heart attack if he did perform in the show.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But the very least he could do was to donate some money to the charities which he has tonnes of money. He together with that old man Lee and the rest of the high salary ministers should at least donate 3 months of their salary to charity to lead by example.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Earn so much money and yet don't even want to donate money to charity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Want to bring all the money with him to hell is it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I think maybe they did donate but just that they do not have to let us know. Theirs may be world class salaries, but its nothing compared to those that earn millions in a year, which is why they are capable of donating 1.5million to charities so easily.</p>
              <p>Do not look at things only from one side, look at it from all angles.. Do you all really think that singapore would be today if not for lee kuan yew?? If lee kuan yew does not exist, we would still be part of malaysia. And how would we look like... we would be something like johor bahru. Lee can be ass sometimes, but he has done his part in the past. He may have done something wrong, he may be earning world class salaries, his men may be coming up with more ways to suck us dry.. but think, would you be here if not for him in the first place.</p>
              <p>We have not gone through the hardship periods (1950-1960s). When we were born, everything was so fine.. there was no hardship at all for most of us. We grew up with education etc. It was the government that gave us all this. I understand that recently there are becoming more bastards by increasing the GST, more ERP gantries, etc.. but it was the PAP that gave us what we have now.</p>
              <p>Personally, I dont think any of the opposition can do better. They only got the mouth to talk, but do they have the ability to actually do it? I dont know... Maybe they can really do better... if they can, then i am all for the opposition to take over the government and country etc.. but I am at least grateful for lee and his associates for making singapore a world class place to live it as compared to our neighbouring countries. We should be grateful of this even though we might not agree with what lee has done over the years...</p>
              <p>Anyway back to the charity show, i observed that not many mediacorp artists actually participated. Gurmit singh himself was involved in at least 4 items... Last time it used to be a celebrity in only 1 item or at least 2 items.. now 4!!!!!! Kudos to Gurmit!!!</p>
