              <p>Hi All,</p>
              <p>Am I the only one who noticed that by 10pm last night the screen on the President TV charity event was showing just $600,000++.....so how in God's name did they managed to earn $6.06 million by the time the papers hit the stands this morning!</p>
              <p>Like all the other charity events on tv these days, this one is another huge scam. I for one have never donated a single to any such events and never will! And with the current economic climate that we're in, it's simply amazing that they claim to have made a cool million over last year...so go figure.</p>
              <p>I suggest that from today, everyone out there should just stop donating any more money to any charity events in Singapore. I rather you guys give directly online to the poor people in Myanmar, Cambodia, Philippines or Indonesia, who rightly deserves this a whole lot more.</p>

              If not lie, then some multi billion companies must have donated? possible?
