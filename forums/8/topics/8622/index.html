            <div class='col-md body'>ok, so it's like this: i met a gal from first 3 mths jc, but now im in poly. We went out as a grp, but rarely tok to each other, cos she only tok to gerls. That time i a bit interested in her liao, but no chance lah. In the end she stayed in JC while I went to poly.<br><br>In June, our grp of frenz (including her) celebrated me and another gal's bday together. Still no communication. Recently, I gained a sudden interest in her, and decided to call her up (that took abt 2 hours of self hypnotism and encouragement from my fren to make that decision).<br><br>The call went well, and juz nice, this weekend is her bday, and she invite me along with the rest of our first 3 mths grp along. I really wanna jio her, but I'm thinking if it's really possible or not.<br><br>She's at JC, I'm at poly. Not much chance to meet up and communicate, unless I call her up. But if I call her up too often, I might reveal that I like her too quickly. A guy in her JC had some interest and called her up. She didn't even bother to keep up with the conversation. I don't wanna become like that. So how?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I went to her bday party, and I gave her a necklace with a lock. To avoid any embarrassing stuff, I gave her when I was about to leave with my friends.

It's amazing how difficult it becomes when the two don't meet each other when going about their daily work (eg. school, work...)<br><br>I guess I really haf to let nature take it's course, cos I met an old friend at the party, and he told me he broke up with his gf, cos he's in poly and she's in jc. Same case as me and my crush leh. Sigh.<br><br>What I fear is a waste of time, a waste of a perfectly good friendship, plus a lot of embarrassing situations for both of us. What to do?<br><br>This isn't one of those 'I got nothing to lose' situation. Much as people would like to say the contrary, a failed attempt in the chasing game does result in dampened friendships.
