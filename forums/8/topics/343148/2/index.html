              <p>You know.....there is always plenty of those sms or emails telling you to go NUH or NUS to donate your blood and plateletes.......but you actually call or go down to the hospital and the kids are already dead?</p>

              <p>Thats why I am cynical.  If it was really needed, the hospital and support groups like Club Rainbow will call me.  We didnt need smses, posters and emails circulating around that comes from dubious sources like 'international detectives working pro bono'.</p>

              <p>oldbreadstinks says " but considering the fact she's actually capable of going to germany then singapore from australia with a kid i doubt the kid's in grave risk of emotional and physical harm. the kid's probably not even "abducted" from the mother's point of view."  We sincerely hope so regarding the physical harm ; the emotional harm is already done to the 4 year old child who will miss his father.  You are right in your statement that the mother probably does not consider she abducted the child. The legal and International authorities however, disagree with her.</p>

              <p>and you are the authority to speak for the child regards to his harm and abuses?</p>
              <p>For all he knows, mummy is protecting him from his father from whichever non existent threat and taking him on happy trips around the world.</p>
              <p>Do not assume that there is psychatric reports on the mother, that you understand what a 4 year old is thinking and its bad form for a volunteer to try to present himself/herself as a understanding and helpful adult, not because he/she she truly wants to help the kid by being physically there for a kid.</p>

              <p><br>Times like this I really hate good hearted smaritans with no legal training.  Not one!</p>
              <p>1) Their Singaporean friend got her a visa to work in Singapore.  So who pray tell is her Singaporean friend and why couldnt a decent PI find it?  What kinda of PIs you guys employed anyway!</p>
              <p>2)  She is a qualified nurse with a court record of aducting of a child, even if its her child.  Why do you think her cannot be terminated and her work permit revoked and she arrested to be bought back to Oz?</p>
              <p>3)  She remarried illegally means she can be charged for bigamy and be in jail for 40 days at least. The child will be handed over to the father in the event of such occurance.  Besides, ROM is required to conduct a search of any marriage documents before she can be legally married.</p>
              <p>3.5) Change her name?  This is Singapore.  Not some movie inspired 3rd world country where you can legally change your name and forget your old one.  Whatever you changed to, you are still tagged to your old name!</p>
              <p>4) She has false papers, like what?  How much cash she run away with that allows her access to false papers?</p>
              <p>5) She overstayed.  And she is so rich to afford hotel stays for so many days? </p>
              <p>Technically if you say she overstayed, then her Singaporean family is involved in housing her?  Which makes the SIngaporean family housing a illegal immigrant.  Which means severe penalties for that singapore families.</p>
              <p>Unless she overstayed on her own, maybe with cash supplied by her singaporean family friends.  And the home is rented in the friends name and not her own. blah blah blah.</p>
              <p>heck, I watched more american tv then you obviously.</p>

              <p>actually i thought the best thing would be having the father come down to have a talk to settle everything instead of the whole court thing. but it doesn't seem very likely now with it looking like both sides thinking each other's crazy. one side even struck first taking the kid overseas.</p>
