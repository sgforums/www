              <p>Hi everyone in Singapore</p>
              <p>please read through the story below.</p>
              <p>We believe the mother and abducted child moved from Europe to Singapore last year and we need some volunteers to do some legwork since  we know where she was staying. Anyone willing to help please contact <a href="mailto:dynamco@netvigator.com">dynamco@netvigator.com</a></p>

              <p>Four-year-old Andrew John THOMPSON was illegally abducted from Australia by his mother Melinda Margaret THOMPSON (who could also be using the name Melinda Margaret STRATTON) on 24th April 2008 and has since disappeared .  They passed through Singapore to Frankfurt and are believed to have doubled back.</p>
              <p>We know that they were in Singapore for some time in mid 2008 , Andrew was in a day care and they may still be resident there.  Shortly before the abduction, one of Australia's leading psychiatrists found that Melinda has an underlying mental state that affects her judgement - particularly in relation to Andrew.</p>
              <p>Andrew is now at grave risk of emotional and physical harm. In addition to an extensive search that has been underway by international authorites for several months, an international multi-media campaign has now been launched to help the authorities find him as quickly as possible. This campaign has the full support of Australian authorities and Interpol. Interpol yellow and blue notices are issued on the pair.</p>

              <p>when we contacted the Straits Times group of newspapers their reply was ' pay us for an ad' -              Since their passports are monitored this is why we believe they may still be in Singapore.  Because the offence was committed in Australia it is not a crime in Singapore but as an Interpol member (whose Police Commissioner holds office in Interpol) they are obliged to comply with Interpol yellow and blue notices. They were in Singapore in June last year and have a family friend there. There is no registered movement in their passports since then.</p>

              <p>Dyna,</p>
              <p>If the child and mother is in Singapore, and you truly has the court order that the child belongs to you.</p>
              <p>Your court order can stand in sg courts to have the child and mother extradicted to Australia.</p>
              <p>You do not need to pay a newspaper to publish any story.  You only need to contact a lawyer in Singapore or you yourself come to Singapore to request the return of your child.</p>
              <p>That is also, whether the mother is Australian, not Singaporean, the marriage and birth is not registered in Singapore.</p>
              <p>If you cannot afford to pay a lawyer to contact their singapore counterpart from Australia.  Please advise how it is that you can afford to maintain the child?</p>

              <p>When there is plenty of Private Investigators to confirm the location of the child and mother.</p>

              <p>it seems you have a chip on your shoulder about something. It is pointless for the father to travel anywhere until the whereabouts are established. Private investigators were contacted  and have so far provided nothing. It is possible that a reader of this forum could see the mother and child and provide information - after all, Singapore is not the biggest place on earth. Singapore is not a member of the Hague convention on child abduction rendition and social services deal only on behalf of Singapore citizens. Your comments match your name and are not beneficial to our request for volunteers so please go and annoy someone else.</p>

              <p>Argh forget it.</p>
              <p>The web links will have mentioned that any sightings of the child and mother can be reported to Australian Federal Police.</p>
              <p>Your other option, is when you spot the child and mother, to report it to the police station near where you spot the child or mother.</p>
              <p>There is no need to contact whoever is posting this.</p>
              <p>And is the child and mother is indeed in Singapore.  Singapore diplomatic and AGC can arrange the return of the child.  Its a matter of courtesy, as in the extradiction of criminals that have ran off to Oz.</p>

              <p>So if the father is the deputy fire chief, pray tell, what's stopping you form taking out and ad? If you can hire a plenthora of private investigators who have turned up nothing, I don't think putting an ad in the straits times will cost as much.</p>
              <p>If a parent is that intent on locating his/her child, I would think that monetary concerns will be the least of his/her worries. You still have not answered VK's question. If like you say money is not a problem, why would putting an ad on the straits times be an issue??</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Courier New;">My name is Ken Thompson and I am Andrew's father.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Courier New;">The international detectives who posted this forum are doing so with my consent.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Courier New;">
              </span></p><p><br>My wife Melinda Margaret THOMPSON abducted four-year-old Andrew last year after the issue of a psychiatrist's report on her to the Family Court of Australia. An arrest warrant for her has since been issued.</p>
              <p> <br>Emails and letters were subsequently sent by my wife to Australia commencing in June 2008 up until at least October or November last year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She could be residing in the vicinity of Coronation Road West and Andrew could be attending a local day care centre.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Andrew's picture is shown in the links posted by Dynamco and on this site posted by Skythewood. These links will also show that this is a genuine appeal to try and find a little boy who is missing and who is at serious risk of emotional and physical harm.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am appealing to the people of Singapore to raise awareness about Andrew so that he can be found safe and well and returned to his family, his frineds, and his home as quickly as possible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The reason I am not in Singapore is that as you'll see from the links in the previous posts, this is a global search and I need to make sure I can go anywhere in the world at very short notice when Andrew is found.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, I don't know how long it will take to find Andrew and I can do more to raise awareness globally from my own home than I can from anywhere else since I have all the resources I need here to do that. I also have the close support of family and friends, which is what is needed at a time like this.</p>
              <p>If anyone sees Andrew or his mother Melinda they should not be approached. If you have any information, please contact Singapore Police Inspector Han Loong Seu at Police HQ on telephone: 65573331.</p>
              <p> </p>
              
              <p>I can also be contacted on <a href="mailto:kenthompson@fastmail.fm">kenthompson@fastmail.fm</a> if anyone would like to receive any email posters or an email that I would very much appreciate being circulated throughout Singapore. This information is available in English and Chinese.</p>
              
              <p> </p>
