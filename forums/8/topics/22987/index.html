            <div class='col-md body'>John Woo: "In the sixties, there was no film schools in Hong Kong. My family was poor, especially after my father died, my mother couldn't afford to send me to school anymore. He needed to find a job and a way to study cinema as well) There was a newspaper called "The Chinese Student Weekly". The boss was a very kind man who made the paper's offices available as a sort of art centre. There was several sections of poetry, art, philosophy, and I met a group of young people who loved film. The newspaper rented art films for us to watch and we discussed them. Also I went to big libraries and book stores and stole film books. That's how I learned film theory."<br><br><img src="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/ABPub/woo14_0611111555.jpeg"></div>

The Sniper was hit over and over again from a short range MINI machine gun without scope and bad recoil. If I am not wrong, all shot has hit his target, first 5 shots hit the sniper down from a tree, as the sniper dropped down, another 5-15 hits had shot the sniper. I think he can be a terminator.</span></div></blockquote>do you mean a machinegun or a sub-machinegun? sub-machineguns are basically select-fire personal weapons that fire pistol-caliber rounds such as 9mm, .45, etc....and the range is usually about 100m only. if its a machinegun, even if its a light machinegun, the range is usually much further....so what was the exact make and type of gun the guy was using?</div>

World war 2. The Machine guns are already developed. IN few different types, Saw guns and Short portable type mini machine gun. I expect their technology wasn\'t that good for a 200M without scope, somemore aiming from a miserable MINI machine gun. Whats more? This guy can even challenge A Sniper! Amazingly, he sprayed around 5-25 ammos on that sniper victim. The first shot has hit the sniper, so the 2nd shot.. and so on...
