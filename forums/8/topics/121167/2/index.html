            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote> a time when it was believed that the earth sat on a large animal or a giant (1500 B.C.), the Bible spoke of the earthÂ’s free float in space: "He . . . hangs the earth upon nothing" (Job 26:7). Science didnÂ’t discover that the earth hangs upon nothing until 1650. </blockquote>first the person who talk is job, a mere person. Second, he also say the following<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"> 10 He marks out the horizon on the face of the waters<br><br>for a boundary between light and darkness. </span><br><br>Isn't tat suggesting the world is flat ? It is a sphere and there isn't really a horizon nor was it a boundary between light and darkness ? In the past who say they believe the world is on an animal ? Don't they see stars ?<br><br><blockquote>3By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God's command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible.</blockquote>muslim also claims the same thing when someone claims tat matter is formed from very small things, smaller than ant sh!t or something. BTW the above verse doesn't means it had to be small, it may just be invisible.<br><br>Earth not flat ? Read tis <a href="http://www.answering-christianity.com/earth_flat.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.answering-christianity.com/earth_flat.htm</a><br><br>When it comes to scientific claims, the Bible has the dumbest claims, with all due respect to Jews and Christians.  The Bible claims that Earth has four ends and four corners.  Nobody can ever think a ball or a cycle to have corners and ends!  Only flat items can have corners and ends, and this is exactly what the bible is trying to express regarding the shape of the earth.  The earth is not flat, as once thought and it has no corners or ends at all.   If Magnetic Poles can be taken as ends or corners of earth, then this definitely opposed to the axis of rotation.<br><br>Isaiah 11:12<br>12 And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the FOUR CORNERS OF THE EARTH. (KJV)<br><br>Revelation 7:1<br>1 And after these things I saw four angels standing on FOUR CORNERS OF THE EARTH, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree. (KJV)<br><br>Job 38:13<br>13 That it might take hold of the ENDS OF THE EARTH, that the wicked might be shaken out of it? (KJV)<br><br>Jeremiah 16:19<br>19 O LORD, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ENDS OF THE EARTH, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things wherein there is no profit. (KJV)<br><br>Daniel 4:11<br>11 The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the ENDS OF ALL THE EARTH: (KJV)<br><br>Matthew 4:8<br>8 Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; (KJV)<br><br><blockquote>The Scriptures inform us, "All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, there they return again</blockquote>tis is totally mythical and doesn't says they believe in a water cycle. It is nowhere close to it<br><br><blockquote>if the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth</blockquote>anyone who experience rain can say tat<br><br>Amos 9:6<br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Lord, the LORD Almighty,<br><br>he who touches the earth and it melts,<br><br>and all who live in it mourn-<br><br>the whole land rises like the Nile,<br><br>then sinks like the river of Egypt-<br><br>6 he who builds his lofty palace [b] in the heavens<br><br>and sets its foundation [c] on the earth,<br><br>who calls for the waters of the sea<br><br>and pours them out over the face of the land-<br><br>the LORD is his name. </span><br><br>Itr is probably talking about water slamming onto earth like the tsunamis. the title of this chapter is called "Israel to Be Destroyed".<br><br>Christianity also says tat the earth is flat, all animals arrive at the same day, dinosaurs arrive a day difference as men, galaxy is only 10,000 years old, bat is a bird and lots of rubbish. These few dubious phases seems pretty weak</div>
