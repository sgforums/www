            <div class='col-md body'>I don't believe it because it is a lie. If u talk about miracles a lot of other religion also have them, particularly the religion on sai baba. If u talk about experience, other people from other religion also experioence their deities as well. U say the world is systhematic, yet it doesn't means tat someone design it nor it is really systhematic. If u think the bible contains all these, then bible also says the world is flat.

            <div class='col-md body'>The Bible and EarthÂ’s Free-float In Space<br><br>At a time when it was believed that the earth sat on a large animal or a giant (1500 B.C.), the Bible spoke of the earthÂ’s free float in space: "He . . . hangs the earth upon nothing" (Job 26:7). Science didnÂ’t discover that the earth hangs upon nothing until 1650.<br><br>The Scriptures Speak of an Invisible Structure<br><br>Only in recent years has science discovered that everything we see is composed of things that we cannot seeÂ—invisible atoms. In Hebrews 11:3, written 2,000 years ago, Scripture tells us that the "things which are seen were not made of things which do appear."<br><br>The Bible Reveals the Earth is Round<br><br>The Scriptures tell us that the earth is round: "It is He that sits upon the circle of the earth" (Isaiah 40:22). The word translated "circle" here is the Hebrew word chuwg , which is also translated "circuit" or "compass" (depending on the context). That is, it indicates something spherical, rounded, or archedÂ—not something that is flat or square. The book of Isaiah was written sometime between 740 and 680 B.C. This is at least 300 years before Aristotle suggested, in his book On the Heavens , that the earth might be a sphere. It was another 2,000 years later (at a time when science believed that the earth was flat) that the Scriptures inspired Christopher Columbus to sail around the world.<br><br>The Bible and the Water Cycle<br><br>The Scriptures inform us, "All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, there they return again" (Ecclesiastes 1:7).<br><br>Ecclesiastes 11:3 states that "if the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth." Look at the BibleÂ’s concise words in Amos 9:6: "He . . . calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out upon the face of the earth." The idea of a complete water cycle was not fully understood by science until the seventeenth century. However, more than two thousand years prior to the discoveries of Pierre Perrault, Edme Mariotte, Edmund Halley, and others, the Scriptures clearly spoke of a water cycle<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br>I have no wish to argue or convince, this would get endless.
