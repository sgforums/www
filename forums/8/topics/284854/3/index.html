But what I think is that TS may have had a breakthrough, simplifying advance physics, that using energy from the parent battery to convert other sources of "ignored" energy to electrical energy.. Not sure of what "other sources" are but I'm thinking again that this might be feasible and if we are to take TS word for it, he may have found a feasible way.. i would think energy is all around us.. heat, sound emf blah blah blah..</div>

The question about upscaling commercially has been considered while designing the device and it has been designed in a way where it can be practically applied.<br><br>The consideration of marketing this technology is always the case of obsoleting other industries and professions ie. oil, so yes, we are taking the consipracy as you have mentioned very seriously which is why the device has been dismantled and parts held by various parties jus to calm our paranoid psychology  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>VCs around the world has been fed similar tales, let alone govt entities. Do you think anyone will give you credence, to give you funding?<br><br>You would need to self fund to at least a pre-production prototype, get production/assembly sorted out, discussions with OEM before anyone will seriously consider funding you. What you have is termed a proof-of-concept prototype which doesn't mean much.<br><br>To be commercially viable, there is a lot more things to be considered beyond 'we designed it from scratch from a commercial stand point'. Too many things beyond a simple business plan.<br><br>In truth, how can u protect your technology? If there is any true value, any big US MNC will just grab and then prepare for litigation. Do you have a 5 million war chest to start legal battles? You may send lawyer letters to threaten, but beyond that, what can you do? Do you have the lobbying platform these companies have? Creative learned that the hard way, in the best recent example.<br><br>What's more, in China, there is no way to maintain IP protection in any way. The China men will just laugh at you if you talk about suing them.<br><br>I'm not discouraging you. This is just to food for thought when you think you have something great.<br><br>In my role, I have been fed a lot of similar tales from Israel, US, China and India. Nope, I never did proceed with them. Neither did I hear anything significant ever again. The only one that was ongoing was with the Israel entity.<br><br>Another good recent example was Hyflux. They had something great. But EDB just shrugged and didn't invest. The problem is the private equity industry has been fed with a lot of fast talk, and it is really hard to make a good idea, a good business.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>-- removed a section of my post --<br><br>Where Is God has already mentioned that such EM-field shockwaves can only occur in vaccum.<br><br><blockquote><br>3. The source of energy is the Electric shockwave that is created within the circuit as of any circuit will generate.<br><br>I'm sorry, but saying electric shockwave in a circuit is like saying swimming in air. Electric shockwave can only be present through an electromagnetic field in the absence of a physical medium, whereas, circuit implies a a closed path through which an electric current flows. Saying that a shockwave exist in a circuit is paradoxical and nonsensical.<br></blockquote>And from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_wave" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>:<br><blockquote><br>Like an ordinary wave, a shock wave carries energy and can propagate through a medium (solid, liquid or gas), or, in special cases, through a field such as the electromagnetic field in the absence of a physical medium.<br></blockquote>Yup, energy cannot be created or destroyed. So I believe whatever energy that was harnessed from EM waves and whatsoever originated from the battery itself. So it's like a 1 = 1 thing. Furthermore, it would probably lose minute amount of energy here and there to the environment because of movement of electrons etc.<br><br>And once again, I guess anyone who makes such discovery would not post it in a public forum just for the sake of asking opinions. And yea, I'm on the skeptical side as well, especially with the above errors you have made.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is indeed true tat since energy cannot be created nor destroyed, 1 unit of power cannot generate more than 1 unit of output. Given our most efficient power plant in Senoko, it could only generate an efficiency 40-50% of power conversion from natural gas, the remaining lost through sound, heat and vibration energy.<br><br>However, try thinking from the perspective of say a waterdam generating electricity where the regulating of the turbine and water flow is controlled by technicians with a mere push of buttons. And try converting this concept to a battery where the source at this point of discussion is actually acting as a triggering force to draw energy from electrons within the circuit rather than a supplying force.<br><br>Hence, yes it is not possible to transfer 1 unit of power from a battery to convert it to 2 units, but very much possible if this 1 unit is used as a trigger to draw energy from "ignored sources" and convert it to useable electricity where the laws of physics is not violated.<br><br>As for the question about why bringing this topic on a general public forum, firstly, the ultimate consumers would be the general public like you and I. Thus I feel it would be beneficial for us to understand the general opinion prior to arriving at a decision of our approach to its application and revelations.<br><br>Thank you <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by NewAgeSensitiveBoy:</div><div class="quote_body">It is indeed true tat since energy cannot be created nor destroyed, 1 unit of power cannot generate more than 1 unit of output. Given our most efficient power plant in Senoko, it could only generate an efficiency 40-50% of power conversion from natural gas, the remaining lost through sound, heat and vibration energy.<br><br>However, try thinking from the perspective of say a waterdam generating electricity where the regulating of the turbine and water flow is controlled by technicians with a mere push of buttons. And try converting this concept to a battery where the source at this point of discussion is actually acting as a triggering force to draw energy from electrons within the circuit rather than a supplying force.<br><br>Hence, yes it is not possible to transfer 1 unit of power from a battery to convert it to 2 units, but very much possible if this 1 unit is used as a trigger to draw energy from "ignored sources" and convert it to useable electricity where the laws of physics is not violated.<br><br>As for the question about why bringing this topic on a general public forum, firstly, the ultimate consumers would be the general public like you and I. Thus I feel it would be beneficial for us to understand the general opinion prior to arriving at a decision of our approach to its application and revelations.<br><br>Thank you <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>Kindly stop using the loaded words "ignored sources".
