A little intro about the theory behind the discovery:<br><br>At present, in order to charge up a rechargeable battery, energy is needed to force free electrons into the negative terminal, alter the equilibrium of the battery and cause the positive terminal to expel free electrons. The new device deploys the same principle, but it further employs the principle as stated above during the charging process, i.e. deliberately causing breaks in the circuit to create a series of fractured current in order to introduce several timed electrons shockwave instantaneously across the circuit during the breaks.<br><br>By deliberately creating a series of current breaks throughout the charging process, the fractured form of current is being use to charge the rechargeable battery B while also serves as a triggering energy to produce an electrons shockwave that creates a situation whereby the potential energy of the individual electron within the positive terminal is used to repel each other out of the positive terminal and spreading across the vacuum zone without injecting any extra energy.<br></div></blockquote>Has anyone considered waste heat from internal resistance?

The only way that is almost achievable is to use one battery to partially charge 2 other identical battery, but that is only ideally, for in real life, there is the element of inherent inefficiency present.<br><br>Simply to put it, the "extra" energy must be coming from somewhere and since you mentioned nothing about nuclear fission/fusion, or any chemical reaction, i would assume that you are claiming these "extra" energies are pulled from thin air. This is not possible, for if you claim so, you are inadvertently claiming that you can create matter out of nothing, according to Einstein's E=mc^2 law.<br><br>You are making a very huge claim here. Being able to create matter out of nothing, and i wouldn't be surprised if it gets thrown out the patent office, for this is too absurd and you'll be possibly the greatest scientist and inventor ever if it were true. Infact, you'd be the first person in the world to create matter out of thin air.<br><br>But alas, i remain a skeptic.<br><br>Besides, are your researches even peer-reviewed?
