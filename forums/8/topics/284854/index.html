            <div class='col-md body'>obviously set up your own business unit and convince the govenments to allow you to set up the plants etc to replace the current feuls. of course you must find a way to make sure its not pirated. you would be saving earth AND making money for yourself at the same time. Or if you find it abit too duanting, you can offer to sell the technology to some company/merger.<br><br>the problem is i doubt what you said is possible without some drawbacks or perhaps other materials since what you described seems to violate energy conservation laws.<br>Somethign along the lines of perpetual motion machines.</div>

EEE guys tend to use the effect to reduce overall power lost. However in reality, it is not feasible to build such perpentual energy machine.( energy lost through wastage in LRC components)</div>

A little intro about the theory behind the discovery:<br><br>At present, in order to charge up a rechargeable battery, energy is needed to force free electrons into the negative terminal, alter the equilibrium of the battery and cause the positive terminal to expel free electrons. The new device deploys the same principle, but it further employs the principle as stated above during the charging process, i.e. deliberately causing breaks in the circuit to create a series of fractured current in order to introduce several timed electrons shockwave instantaneously across the circuit during the breaks.<br><br>By deliberately creating a series of current breaks throughout the charging process, the fractured form of current is being use to charge the rechargeable battery B while also serves as a triggering energy to produce an electrons shockwave that creates a situation whereby the potential energy of the individual electron within the positive terminal is used to repel each other out of the positive terminal and spreading across the vacuum zone without injecting any extra energy.<br></div>
