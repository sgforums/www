Thats the whole purpose. Its an unobvious control<br><br>2) The mouse is a random item which may or not appear. Dunt u get it? But its there and it will appear throughout the maze at selected times. Nut that doesnt matter becos when it appears the 2 men must be able to recognise it as the clue. The question of the experiment is who does it.<br><br>Extra point:<br><br>Even if the 2 men could have get along from the very start. the uneducated man would have told the scholar abt the  mice "hey lets follow it". But the scholar would have thought its a dumb idea when there are presumely mysterious signs and symbols to show the exit.<br><br>Cant u see the maze inventor is not really testing intelligence ) else he would have made he signs to have meanings, scroll up earlier to read my post but he is testing worldly psychology<br><br>So he choose 2 different men from very different backgrounds<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What then is your definition of a scholar? Someone as shown in the story? Then scholars must be lousy people.<br><br>What scholars should not do is to reject another person idea base on his education background. He gathers all the ideas and makes a judgement on which is the best idea to get them out. He is able to tell you the pros and cons of the various ideas and give a clear explantation on why he decides on a particular idea over another. Therefore, in this particular case, I feel that a scholar would follow the mouse first because, if he didn't, the mouse would run off. Even if the mouse is unable to lead them out of the maze, he could still go back to the puzzle to figure a way out.<br><br>Conclusion, the story sucks.</div>
