            <div class='col-md body'>let me ask u a Q:<br><br>what if the shcholar is stuck not able to solve a riddle at one point. He will be stuck. But the mouse will not get u stuck.<br><br>thats were he may come to his sense and follow the mouse.<br>So what happened to his academics? The were useless<br><br>And btw The maze inventor will not have a maze with symbols making sense and without a mouse with an uneducated man inside as the result is predetermined:<br><br>1)The uneducated man may have never got out<br>2) no guarantee that the scholar can solve all of the riddles and get out.<br>3) if both did not get out, the experiment has no conclusion<br><br>Even if the scholar gets out, the conclusion of the experiment is also predetermined and no point conducting the experiment</div>
