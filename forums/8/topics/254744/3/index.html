Someone as shown in the story? Then scholars must be lousy people.<br><br>What scholars should not do is to reject another person idea base on his education background. He gathers all the ideas and makes a judgement on which is the best idea to get them out. He is able to tell you the pros and cons of the various ideas and give a clear explantation on why he decides on a particular idea over another. Therefore, in this particular case, I feel that a scholar would follow the mouse first because, if he didn't, the mouse would run off. Even if the mouse is unable to lead them out of the maze, he could still go back to the puzzle to figure a way out.<br><br>Conclusion, the story sucks.</div></blockquote>didnt u read?, the puzzles have no meaning how can he make his way out?<br><br>I hate to repeat myself, pls go and read the story many many times b4 u all post!</div>
