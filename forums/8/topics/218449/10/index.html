I was irked mostly by the dishonesty of the lady in giving an exaggerated account of the incident. There is no question that the sign was in bad taste. But I did see with my own eyes how the poor young chap struggled to explain to the lady who was shouting more than listening. I figure the chap lacks experience and the management had given little thought to the wording on their sign. I give them the benefit of the doubt that discrimination was not what they had intended to practise. Indeed, it was an unfortunate blunder. </strong><br><br>If you sugarfix are merely a bystander in all this, surely there is no need to make up stories only to confuse yourself.

It was an amazing place, and had all my favourites from EU and Aus. I could normally get this variety only when I'm travelling there. I was quite surprised that it was cheaper than I find in EU or AUS, even after converting. There were 3 cash counters open, but still I was one among about 20 in a queue.</div>

But I did see with my own eyes how the poor young chap struggled to explain to the lady who was shouting more than listening. I figure the chap lacks experience and the management had given little thought to the wording on their sign.

Jumping Jellyfish!<br><br>You folks with the clever use of your CSI inspired sixth sense to construct my profile just cured my momentary amnesia. I recall now that I own Candy Empire! Since I have appointed a big bunch of people to take care of my empire, I make money while I am asleep. Being an IT savvy Tai-Tai, instead of spas and shopping centres, I lounge around my celestial palace and extend my circle of annonymous friends and business partners while playing devil's advocate on online forums.<br><br>And guess what I did with the staff who put up the sign. I demoted the person to mow my 2 acres of garden in JB and slaughter 101 chickens a day to feed my diamond clad 101 dalmatians. As part of the new job scope, the staff also has to care for my margay - Priscilla whose staple diet comprises of parrots, small monkeys, tree frogs and the shedded skins of cobras for starters. If you happen to visit the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, you just might find my staff sourcing food for Priscilla.<br><br>If you cannot broaden your minds, hope this helps to at least stretch your imagination. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Great minds discuss ideas.

Didn't have any intention to shop, but left the shop $77 poorer. It was an amazing place, and had all my favourites from EU and Aus. I could normally get this variety only when I'm travelling there. I was quite surprised that it was cheaper than I find in EU or AUS, even after converting. There were 3 cash counters open, but still I was one among about 20 in a queue. </div></blockquote>Hey Same here, buddy<br><br>Amazing collection and variety............. and most affordable prices ........<br><br>The staff and manager were so friendly and accomodating, and showed their best sellers ...... yummy ........ shared with my friends and they are heading where ... ofcourse ..... to the Candy Empire lah......... Woooooooo Hooooooooooooo<br><br>After going there, I seriously dont believe on the story put by the lady (Catryna ..whatever !!). And ST news these days .......is merely for .... after lunch ciesta.....<br><br>Thank you CandyEmpire for being in Singapore...

Another thing is healthy issue. U are on wheelchair and too much of candy will add more weight, making pushing arnd even more difficult n tiring. have they tot abt that? candy empire might have a reason to ban wheelchair. a hard knock or several and u will see all yr fav candies raining down on u. it is raining sweets and jumping M&amp;Ms! who will bear the cost? i would ban wheelchairs in a china shop if i am the owner. Ming antique vase is priceless FYI. pple on this forum dont think deep enuf. very surface emotion and take a very superficial stance. it is right for candy empire to ban wheelchairs, it's a business decision, but they are not banning the pple who are sitting on wheelchair. get that clear.  the shop can be helpful in the signage by explaining why they cant cater to wheelchair in the shop., n have more business acumen by stating, alternatively, customers  can approach our staff and we will help u shop or have online shopping choice.  smtg like dat! And finally.... a clear winner works things arnd, so even if one is wheelchair bound, he can have his cake (oops, candies i mean) and eat it. just think abt what u wan... if u wan the candies, get it despite watever it takes. and one more thing: she wrote "it pains me to write this letter..blah blah..(appalling was used inside)". Okay that is a tad drama. no candies, means painful life n deprived? oh pls, gimme a break. millions r starving outside SG. oso, she brings in the power of MP , thinking that would help.... oh pls, this is weak. dun quote on the MP.  and oso she said that would be an uproar in the West. hello wake up, this is Asia, Singapore. And who will dare guarantee there will be a uproar in the West. perhaps the western folks would just laugh it off and walk away. comeon pple protest on the street to ban nuclear waste and shrkining Antartic, not over matter like "i cant get my candies, weep weep weep. my sweet tooth is denied". then, to be fair, if the gatekeep is allegedly rude and crude, that is a penalty. Did she over-react to a point, the gatekeeper has to be rude and firm?  Who knows? We got to have some witnesses. and aside, what is with that name, cathryna, smtg smtg....geee. anyway this is really trivial. </div></blockquote>I have to say i agree with him to a <strong>certain extent</strong>.</div>
