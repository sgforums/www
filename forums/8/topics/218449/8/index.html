Valid argument and I agree with you completely. Thank you for sharing your thoughts. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Actually, I did not know about this incident reaching the papers until my friend who had witnessed the incident with me told me about it. I was irked mostly by the dishonesty of the lady in giving an exaggerated account of the incident. There is no question that the sign was in bad taste. But I did see with my own eyes how the poor young chap struggled to explain to the lady who was shouting more than listening. I figure the chap lacks experience and the management had given little thought to the wording on their sign. I give them the benefit of the doubt that discrimination was not what they had intended to practise. Indeed, it was an unfortunate blunder.<br><br>Newspapers are only too keen to increase their readership through stories of sensationalised and scandalous petty events. But they could have had the story verified with independent eye witness accounts before publishing it in its entirety. Although I have a wheelchair bound mother at home and do not appreciate neither implicit nor explicit discrimination against the less fortunate, I still sympathise with that poor young man at the shop.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if wheelchair bound pple want to keep their pride and dignity, they shld at least avoid crowded shopping malls, just go to parks and open space. what is the point of being pushed arnd by yr tired kin while being overwhelmed by the crowds, u cant walk u cant run, u cant jump. so what is the point of being in the crowd where pple r doing what u cant do? what fun do they get out of it? That they went to VIVO city before? that is a score? that yes, u despite having walking difficulty, that u manage to have a life and get out of the house?<br><br>they get the occasional cold hard stare, they are slow moving, they block human traffic, obstruct yr path. they are an inconvenience to the general public. Mind, our society is built and functions like one that is not meant for the handicapped pple. It is a healthy, limp-using environment. And if u are handicapped, u hv to accept the fact, this society is not going all out to cater for yr special needs, be it lifts, ramp, etc. If u get those, good on u, if u dont, dont complain. Life in Singapore seems to be like, u wan u wan, u must always wan...it is too rosy. when there's no handicapped friendly amenities, complain to MP... such and such. when signs say no handicapped pple in store, they complain.  so when parks say no dogs and cats here, does it mean my pet is discriminated? shall i rise a petition with SPCA and PETA. animals have rights, eh?<br><br>to hv a quality dignified life, handicapped pple shld enjoy open space, green areas, garden, pools, reservoir, nature park, etc. why go to get squashed at crowded malls, these places are for fast movement, rapid transit, go-in-get-out. there r many things these pple can do, and that doesnt involve going to crowded place. have a tea ceremony, arrange some flowers, play some music, face the sea and sands.<br></div>
