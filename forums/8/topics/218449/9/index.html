            <div class='col-md body'>you're comparing the physcially disadvantaged (i believe that's the politically correct term) to cats and dogs???<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by curio t:</div><div class="quote_body">if wheelchair bound pple want to keep their pride and dignity, they shld at least avoid crowded shopping malls, just go to parks and open space. what is the point of being pushed arnd by yr tired kin while being overwhelmed by the crowds, u cant walk u cant run, u cant jump. so what is the point of being in the crowd where pple r doing what u cant do? what fun do they get out of it? That they went to VIVO city before? that is a score? that yes, u despite having walking difficulty, that u manage to have a life and get out of the house?<br><br>they get the occasional cold hard stare, they are slow moving, they block human traffic, obstruct yr path. they are an inconvenience to the general public. Mind, our society is built and functions like one that is not meant for the handicapped pple. It is a healthy, limp-using environment. And if u are handicapped, u hv to accept the fact, this society is not going all out to cater for yr special needs, be it lifts, ramp, etc. If u get those, good on u, if u dont, dont complain. Life in Singapore seems to be like, u wan u wan, u must always wan...it is too rosy. when there's no handicapped friendly amenities, complain to MP... such and such. when signs say no handicapped pple in store, they complain.  so when parks say no dogs and cats here, does it mean my pet is discriminated? shall i rise a petition with SPCA and PETA. animals have rights, eh?<br><br>to hv a quality dignified life, handicapped pple shld enjoy open space, green areas, garden, pools, reservoir, nature park, etc. why go to get squashed at crowded malls, these places are for fast movement, rapid transit, go-in-get-out. there r many things these pple can do, and that doesnt involve going to crowded place. have a tea ceremony, arrange some flowers, play some music, face the sea and sands.<br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good on you Curio! You have raised some thought provoking points. You could have taken the path of least resistance to bow to the vocal majority's opinions or remain a voyeur. But you are one tough cookie who begs to differ in the face of intense, crude criticizm to question norms and think out of the box. You probably learnt well the moral of the story in The Emperor's New Clothes - public opinion can be a failure.<br><br>Bloggers have shown abundance of support and sympathy for wheelchair bound people in this forum. It is the collective voice of basic humanity (although some have expressed it in a uncouth manner) and that is the way every society should function. But instead of believing and reacting in a monotonous fashion to everything you read, see and hear; learn to think critically about events and issues that captures your heart and interest.<br><br>There is a fine line between discrimination and business decision. The distinction lies in the way you choose to interpret the written words of a business organization. Often in job ads, some requirements state Mandarin speaking, bilingual, Chinese preferred, males or females only, below 40 or in some airline ads, the height must be a minimum of 1.6ms. If you choose to interpret these words as discrimination, then there is a cause for concern. But if you choose to view these requirements as meeting the needs of the business, then it is a business decision.<br><br>In the Western world, such specifications are not allowed in job ads and will be directed to the Human Rights Tribunal or other anti-discrimination authority for language, racial, gender, age or physical discrimination. However, that does not prevent employers from exercising their rights to hire staff that meets their requirements without making them explicit.<br><br>All businesses have specific target market segments to channel their marketing efforts and maximize profitability. In the case of Candy Empire, if their target market is non wheelchair consumers, then they reserve the right to adopt policies that benefit their purpose. There is no need to raise a protest or call for government intervention or regulation as Candy Empire is not offering public services or products. If you do not want to patronize a shop that does not allow wheelchairs to be brought into the shop, then you can exercise your consumer right to take your business elsewhere. It's your hard earned money and you can decide for yourself where you want to shop or with whom you want to do business with.<br><br>So let Candy Empire decide at its discretion on policies that meet their business objectives. Consumers who disagree with their business policies can shop for candies at alternative venues such as Seng Siong, Carrefour, Giant, NTUC, Cold Storage, Mustaffa (24/7, even more convenient), 7/11, petrol stations and many more. There is really no shortage of shops for candies in Singapore unless you have an undying passion, obsession and addiction for Candy Empire that keeps this thread in the forum going. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Last but not least, could we exercise some civility on this forum and voice our thoughts, opinions and views without opting for profanity, vulgarities, mud slinging, name calling and curses. There are many finer words and expressions that you can use to express yourself in the English language. You don't need the aid of abusive languages to stand for your ideals.</div>

Just because employers hire on the basis of their prejudices <strong>does not </strong>make it morally and legally right....and in fact social and govt watchdogs should step up efforts to eradicate such prejudicial behaviour. Just because a certain type of crime is widespread doesn't mean that it should be condoned. The promulgation of such views are especially dangerous in a multi-ethnic society like Singapore.</div>
