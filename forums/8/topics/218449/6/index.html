            <div class='col-md body'>Nov 5, 2006<br><strong>Candy store's 'no wheelchair' policy upsets shoppers </strong><br>It's discrimination they say, but store maintains that wheelchairs may hurt customers and damage property<br><br>By Nur Dianah Suhaimi<br><br>IT TOOK an entire year for Ms Catryna Zhang and her family to convince their wheelchair-bound father to go on outings with them.<br><br>However, when the 66-year-old finally agreed to go to VivoCity last Sunday, he found himself shooed out of a candy store.<br><br>The family went into the Candy Empire shop, but failed to notice a sign which read: Please do not bring your wheelchair or trolley into the shop.<br><br>Ms Zhang, a 33-year-old businesswoman, said the store's policy seemed particularly galling when Singapore is trying to make its facilities more accessible to the elderly and disabled.<br><br>Contacted by The Sunday Times, the store's general manager Abdul Mohamed said the sign was removed last Thursday after some customers pointed out that it discriminated against the physically disabled.<br><br>The change is only cosmetic, however. The shop's policy of banning wheelchairs remains in place, though Mr Abdul said he would not chase away any wheelchair-bound customers already in the shop. He denied that the store had asked Ms Zhang's grandfather to leave the shop.<br><br>Mr Abdul maintained that the store 'was forced to put up the sign' for fear that wheelchairs might hurt customers and damage the property.<br><br>'Ours is a small shop. It is not designed to take heavy knocks from trolleys and wheelchairs, unlike the hypermarts. And if anyone gets hurt, we will get sued,' said Mr Abdul.<br><br>He added that the store makes an exception for 'smaller wheelchairs'.<br><br>The shop has an area of 3,500 sq ft, approximately the size of three four-room Housing Board flats. According to Mr Abdul, Candy Empire's other branch at Millenia Walk, which is smaller, did not put up a similar sign because the mall is not as crowded.<br><br>'Thousands visit our VivoCity store on weekends. We need to look into crowd control and stampede issues. That's why we don't allow wheelchairs in,' added Mr Abdul.<br><br>Ms Sherena Loh, a wheelchair user, said this is the first time she has heard of a store openly banning wheelchairs. The 47-year-old senior manager said sales staff and shop owners usually try their best to accommodate her.<br><br>'They will even shift their furniture a little to make space for my wheelchair. If the place is too narrow, they'll bring out the items for me to choose,' she said.<br><br>The National Council of Social Service said the sign was insensitive and Candy Empire should instead be offering additional assistance to wheelchair users.<br><br>The Handicaps Welfare Association and the Society for the Physically Disabled (SPD) have also expressed their disapproval.<br><br>'Banning wheelchair users demonstrates a lack of understanding for people with physical disabilities,' said SPD's head of therapy services, Ms Tay Hwee Li.<br><br>Jalan Besar GRC MP Lily Neo told The Sunday Times she was disappointed to hear about the sign, especially when the Government has been striving to improve the urban environment for the physically disabled.<br><br>Last week, she was at her Kreta Ayer-Kim Seng ward to identify areas where wheelchair users' movement is restricted.<br><br>'In our ageing society, we can soon expect almost every family to have a member in a wheelchair. Retailers will be driving customers away if they turn away wheelchair users,' said Dr Neo.<br><br>This is already happening at Candy Empire.<br><br>Aaron Shui, 14, who is wheelchair-bound, planned to buy some candy at the store with his family last weekend. But they changed their minds when they saw the sign.<br><br>Said his mother, Madam Molly Zhao, 47, a housewife: 'At other stores, sales staff will just give us unhappy looks when we enter. But this is the first time I'm seeing such outright discrimination.<br><br>'But it's not our loss. If Candy Empire doesn't want our business, then we will just go elsewhere.'<br><br>ndianah@sph.com.sg<br><br>Copyright Â© 2006 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.</div>
