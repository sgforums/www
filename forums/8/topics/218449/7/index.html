            <div class='col-md body'>What i've noticed in Singapore context.<br><br>There used to be 'no food and drinks' signage stickers pastes on the window display of boutique, especially those high class ones.<br>However it went off after a while.<br>Maybe it could be education. People automatically have this impression that all boutiques disallow drinks.<br><br>In my personal opinion. I feel the boutiques found those stickers 'offensive' hence turning potential buyers away.<br>These boutiques wants to be shopper friendly, the way to sales.<br><br>I always get chased out of a boutique by a friendly sales assistant reminding me that i should finish my drink first before entering the boutique.<br>I liked that! Because of the personal touch.<br><br>If i'm 'offended' by no food and drinks sign, i think i wouldn't anymore less affected if i see a no disabled policy.<br><br>It's not the consideration of the place, we all understand there could be some discomfort here and there. However it is how the store wish to approach this issue. They took the easy way out, which disgust shoppers of my kind. And now they pay for it.<br><br>Cheers</div>

People automatically have this impression that all boutiques disallow drinks.<br><br>In my personal opinion. I feel the boutiques found those stickers 'offensive' hence turning potential buyers away.<br>These boutiques wants to be shopper friendly, the way to sales.<br><br>I always get chased out of a boutique by a friendly sales assistant reminding me that i should finish my drink first before entering the boutique.<br>I liked that! Because of the personal touch.<br><br>If i'm 'offended' by no food and drinks sign, i think i wouldn't anymore less affected if i see a no disabled policy.<br><br>It's not the consideration of the place, we all understand there could be some discomfort here and there. However it is how the store wish to approach this issue. They took the easy way out, which disgust shoppers of my kind. And now they pay for it.<br><br>Cheers </div></blockquote>Many moons ago, I had worked as a sales assistant during my school vacations in one of the department stores in Orchard Road. And I used to hate having to remove all the drink bottles, McDonald cups, half eaten potato chip packets, tissues and other stuff left among the shelves. I have even found and removed baby feeding bottles, pacifiers and dolls. I used to think what a waste of time and why can't people be more responsible shoppers and use the bins provided at the foot of the escalators.<br><br>But I believe Singapore is used to being a "fine" city and needs signs and posters to guide and remind people to be more considerate and mindful of the impact of their actions on others and the environment.</div>

I was able to take my mother only to the one which had an upgraded lift that stopped at every level. The other flat which was within walking distance had a lift that stopped on only three levels, and which were not the levels where my friend's house was.
