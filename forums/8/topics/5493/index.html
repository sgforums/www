            <div class='col-md body'>After 2 years, numerous emails and phone calls, but no photo, the day of meeting is fast approaching. How would it be like? Is she gonna be the one that I had been searching for? Am I the type of guy she fancy? All the unknowns keep flashing through my mind. I am dying to see her and yet fear that my dream might be shattered. What should I do?<br><br>I have nothing to loose, and everything to gain. What would I lose by meeting up with a friend. It's a step forward on the friendship at least. Cheer up and let destiny take the driving seat.<br><br>Life is about taking chances. It does not necessarily come twice and it is wise to take it at first sight. It might not suceed, but if you know you had tried, the feeling would be better than regrets of not even attempting. If you don't try, you never know.<br><br>You would not know how much something meant to you till you lost it. Never take for granted what you have in life, something you have right now might be gone tomorrow. Treasure what you have now , for you never know what is gonna happen.<br><br>This was written a few days before I was supposed to meet the supposed girl of my dream, someone whom I had known via the net. Can someone love another person without knowing their looks, and just based on what they know about the person?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you really want the relationship to hit off well, you should not have pictured her as anything at all. After all, there are millions of combinations of types of people, how great are the chances that she is actually going to hit a similar match with what you have in mind? Quoted from your message -I have nothing to loose, and everything to gain- , initial impression it gives me is that if this particular female does not hit your match, will this mean that this supposingly girl of your dreams will vaporize into nothing? If you have the concept of love can exist without looking at the person before, then you should not have the warped concept of -I have nothing to loose, and everything to gain-<br><br>Anyway good luck on your meeting and have a great time</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi luf<br><br>there are many many different scenarios that can happen from meeting net friends.  love can happen!  i have a friend who met her current boyfriend through the Internet.  The great news is they are planning to get married next year!<br><br>Of course, there are the usual sob stories.  but hey, like i said, every case is different.<br><br>i don't think that 2 people can fall in love without knowing what the other looks like.   i know, i'm a cynic, but this just doesn't sound plausible to me.  anyone got contradictatory opinions?<br><br>btw, hope your meeting had been as you wished it to be.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>love on the net is possible.......but dun rely on it to keep things going.......there's more to love than words on the screen......<br><br>i believe that true love comes with being blind. den you won't be so affected by the physical side of things. the net serves the purpose quite nicely........i think... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That was my feeling during May before I return from my oversea studies.<br><br>Well, I had met up with her, and she is not that fantastic looking, but still quite sweet. I wasn't captivated by her looks, but more of her character and aspiration. She got what I want in a girl, confidence, smart, sporty.. and I am at ease while talking to her.<br><br>To me, love should not be build up based on physical attraction. It does play a part, but to maintain a relationship, the more critical element is personalities, this is what decide if a couple can go the distance. As for appearance, so long we are please with the other party (might not be fantastic), it should be fine.<br><br>Sad to say, this relationship didn't work out well, as she is attached.. I tried to do whatever within my means, guess we are just not destined to be together. Still we do keep in touch and share our thoughts with each other, this friendship can go a long way. So a net relationship might not turn out well, but if given a little more efforts, it can be something meaningful.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm Luf, you mean you juzt recently knew that she is attached? of course itll turn out to be sad. im sure you would be thinkin.. 'Gosh, only if i had met her earlier' rite? well.. you got to learn from there. u need to know a lot about her FIRST before getting into relationship. hopefully her boyfrend dunno about your intentions. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br>hopefully she is still loyal to her boyfrend. how do you feel if u know a guy trying to stalk your girlfrend? to me.. i prefer her to be tha loyal one rather than one that like to break up whenever new person comes.<br><br>love in tha net.. quite dangerous to believe cos its merely words. its better to define love by showing that you care and protect. theres a lot of people in tha net who fool around so chances of meeting tha real loved ones are very slim. if you do find.. take care of her well cos she is among tha 'rare species' in tha net  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>(gosh.. my nose bleeds again! but its ok.. im still alive here)<br><br>well.. physical appearances will not be a problem if we can control our lustful eyes from judging (tha so-called 1st impression counts). but tha problem is.. not many pppl can control them. well.. for killjoy, if u loved a girl/guy (sorry i didnt know your gender) on tha net and it turns to be tha most ugliest human being u ever seen. whats your 1st move? do you still go for it, or have a second thought that there are other better looking girls/ guys around whom may like you too? think of the consequences of living happy ever after and your relationship with him/her in few years time.<br><br>well Luf, try again! Dun give up k! be like me..  a guy who never give up hope of finding tha one i love. even though ive been dumped and rejected lots of times, but tha experience i got.. its worth! from there you'll learn more about how to have at least as close as an ideal relationship.<br><br>------------------<br>Professional Critics</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since we're on the topic of net meetings, I would like to ask u pple how u normally deal with 1st meetings? Does it turn out awkwardly? If the other party is really shy or quiet, what are the best ways to break the ice? And one more thing. Where are some good places to go/What are some suitable things to suggest doing during 1st meetings?<br>Oh, and I meant for one to one meetings with the opp sex.

            <div class='col-md body'>hey Mysubterfuge,<br>Actually I did meet up with a girl I met from the net. I "met" her 4 yrs ago at alamak.com, and after that I went to NS and stopped using internet altogether. Did not have her contact numbers or anything. Recently, on irc, i met her again. Somehow I remembered her sec school, and she confirmed it. In fact she turned out to be in NUS also, and same course, and also in the same lab session for one of the modules! And yes, we did meet, although there was no need to plan it. She did not seem to have negative reactions towards me, but I couldn't get the chance to approach and get to know her better because she had many guy friends(ironically all she met on irc just before university term started). She said she doesn't have a bf though.. anyway we always seem to bump into each other after that day, and also one day I skipped a lesson and went to hers, because I wanted to leave campus early, and she told som guy whom she doesn't realise he knows me, and told him I was a guy she met on irc and that she felt "uncomfortable"...so it happens the guy told me all about it, and that she is thinking I'm "stalking" her.. oh well<br>my question, since you're a girl, is...<br><br>1)Why the heck must she tell a supposed stranger all about it? doesn't it demean and defame me??<br><br>2)If she likes me by my physical appearance(not saying she goes for looks, just that first impressions count), would she ever think that stalking her, even if I did(I didn't!). I mean if I'm this handsome guy ...would she mind me stalking her at all...this sounds a bit controversial, but then we don't know each other well, so looks count most currently.<br><br>------------------<br>"And when my love for life is running dry, you come and pour yourself on me"--- David Gates</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I had meet up with quite a few net girls on single date. Some of the most frequent place to go is to makan and maybe movies. At times both can be quite awkward with each other, most of the times, it's quite alrite, coz I usually know them pretty well before I meet up. So there are a lot of things to talk about during the meeting. There was once I know this girl who do volunteer, and well, I tag along and go volunteering as well. It's kinda nice and I was quite consistent with it until I started working.</div>
