            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there, everyone.<br><br>Just like to have some opinions from this forum. A NTU admission offer was sent to me last week and I have to give them an answer by 15th April. I have applied for the part time course in last Dec and I have totally given up hope on it when the letter came.<br><br>One of my main worries, right now, is the 5 years duration and I heard the course is quite tough with plenty of tutorials and projects. 5 years down the road is a big commitment for me. I'm afraid that I don't have the perseverance to continue the studies if I decided to go for it (for your info, I have been out of poly for about 10 yrs, so kinda lost touch in academic studies).<br><br>My the other worry will be my plan to switch job next year. I have couple of friends who are in part time studies and have some difficulties in getting a suitable job. Most of them have settled for lesser pay and lower their requirements.<br><br>For those less interested or just wanna leave some sarcastice comments, there's always other threads for that purposes.<br><br>I'm seeking advices and opinions in this thread. Your valuable genuine comments is deeply appreciated.</div>

Some employers DO discouraged their employees in further studies. My previous employer was like that. Part time studies will affect your work in a way or another, especially, during the exam periods. It's important to have a common understanding ground. It's really sap your energy trying balance both sides and also not forgetting your family too.</div>

If the new job you're interested in is not related to mechanical engineering, wouldn't you have wasted your money, time and effort?<br><br>If changing jobs is a higher priority to you now, it'd probably be better to wait till you have settled down in your new job before planning your upgrading path. If upgrading is a higher priority now, then naturally you should take up the offer, and jump ship only when you land the ideal new job that can accomodate your part-time study schedule and offer advancement options once you get your degree.</div>
