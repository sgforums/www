            <div class='col-md body'>My Experience in Kyoto Higashiyama...<br>DJ Sensei  (Feb 12 2003 - 02:44)<br><br>I walked into the restroom that said 'Dan', not "Jo". I'm not that stupid. However, a Japanese woman followed me in. Either she was that stupid, or she was all for the Unisex toilette idea. I guess it was the latter because she proceeded to use a urinal! Maybe she had a sex change. I don't know. All I know is that I ran out of the restroom in amazement. I told my friend to watch the restroom and see who comes out. He did and he saw her. He said, "yeah, so what?" I said, "ha. that's a woman coming out of a men's restroom." He said, "no, that's a guy. have you seen how the guys dress around here?" He was just kidding. I'm quite sure that she was a girl. Her boyfriend put his arm around her. Definately, a girl using a urinal.<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>As a guy, I am totally against sharing toilets with females, for a number of very good reasons.<br><br>1) For starters, I went through high school in a house where I was the only guy - and I can back up those who have been in situations where they get unduly persecuted for leaving the seat up. I have also lived in a student flat with 3 guys and 1 girl, and we all had to accomodate the girl's complaints about seat-settings. Women need to understand that leaving the seat up is a part of our culture. Just like you look before crossing the road, you check the seat before you sit down. Guys do it. We touch the seat to raise and lower it - so can you. In more than half the cases here anyhow, the toilets are squat toilets which shouldn't raise these kinds of issues.<br><br>2) Women take sooo long on the toilet. We have all been to concert centres, night clubs and the like, with separate toilet use, and seen guys walking in and out while the line for the womens toilets goes all out of the toilet and along the wall. If they made these toilets unisex, I would have to wait as long as the women, even though I am perfectly capable of ending the whole transaction 10 times quicker than they are.<br><br>3) Standing to urinate is a right guaranteed under the constitution (of somewhere). It saves time, is more hygenic, and takes advantage or external plumbing design. The idea of having to go into a cubicle, lift a seat that my bucho just sat on (yes, I know, I am contradicting myself, but I am allowed to do that too) - or WAIT for a cubicle. These are not things I care for.<br><br>4) The whole make up and powdering thing - it's time Japanese men found their cojones! Two things shocked that shocked me was 1) seeing that someone had put vanity mirrors on train platforms, and 2) seeing that MEN used these mirrors more than women. Has anyone here seen the facial skin products in the mens toiletries section? Facial scrub (a term I only knew from playing rugby), treatement mousse are all words I have had forced into my vocabulary against my will. I worry that with the added exposure to female cosmetic activity in unisex bathrooms will be just one short step to such venues becoming a venue for new male recruits to companies to wear aprons and swap cooking recipes. Men are supposed to be sweaty, stinky and bald, just like my bucho. Six months of a unisex toilets and you won't be able to tell the guys here from lesbians.<br><br>That all said, I think that Sachie may have a point in some ways as to it being applicable in Japan.<br>- I had just gotten over having cleaning ladies standing next to me while at a urinal when I opened a door to an onsen and nearly bumped head on into the cleaning baba from the black lagoon. It seems to me that there is already greater tolerance of having women in mens toilets and public baths, at least<br>- The whole onsen thing as well - in parts of Japan, men and women (admittedly, mostly wrinklies) publicly bathe naked together still (and get even MORE wrinkly) while people are kicking up a stink about listening to my bucho exorcise his natto burrito in the next cubicle (they may have a point, but if I have to put up with it, everyone should).<br>- Anyone ever been to a urinal in a public park in Japan. I tell you, it is more private going for a wizz under a tree - most toilets are designed for some very good reason I have yet to have explained to me, to enable a complete view of all guys at standing urinals from outside of the toilets (I mean, they put them right beside the entrance, with no door). I have actually evacuated myself in a Shinjuku Gyoen park toilet urinal and waved to a family of picnicers at the same time.<br><br>So in spite of any cultural predisposition of Japanese toward unisex toilets, I oppose it completely. I say, let women into the boardroom, the old boys society, the golf club, the cricket club, and the hair club for men, but I think civilisation as we know it will draw to an end when we let them into our toilets.<br><br>The end.<br><br>Hiko's Bucho.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>once i was in a toilet with 2 cubicles. went in one while the other is empty. after awhile someone went in the other cubicle too. and from the sound of movements and such i concluded that it was a man. (can hear lifting up of toilet seat, zipper and his pissing was LOUD. muahaha)<br><br>you should have seen the look on his face when he came out and realised it's the LADIES. he was "cornered" by me coming out of the other cubicle and a girl who was just walking into the toilet. damn candid. i laughed right on the spot man  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
