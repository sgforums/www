            <div class='col-md body'>Well, had encountered the same thing as you. I told him off infront of the class, and infront of the tutor as well.This type of surfers should be taught a lesson, they just bloody study their exams and tests, but projects leave others to do but get the grade.Its juz damn unfair. And people like me, cannot perform that well in academic paper, but project always get B and above, will suffer. So since he never contribute, I told him off. In the end, he got marked down.</div>
