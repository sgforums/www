            <div class='col-md body'>something i liked to share with those ppl over at the other thread "education standard too high" as well as for all students studying in spore to ponder...<br>a true story...<br><br>My friend's elder sister was rejected by NUS medicine faculty because her A level results could not make it. So how? She did not give up her dream of pursuing medicine and thus went to Australia(name of Uni withheld) to do a full-time degree in the field.<br>6 years later (last year), she came back to Singapore and in a short time, she was invited (or rather, head-hunted) to be an associate professor/lecturer in NUS medicine faculty. A scholarship was even offered to fund her research. Well, the rest is history.<br><br>Moral of the story.<br>Someone who was rejected by this same institution because her As did not make the mark, after she obtained the degree in a foreign country, was invited back to that institution to be a lecturer to her peers and juniors, not to mention a scholarship thrown at her.<br><br>What could be the loophole in our education system?<br><br>[This message has been edited by FireIce (edited 04 January 2002).]</div>

Some might just want to joke around making friends, some venting their anger, some asking for advice and some like Doom is asking around for pple with the same kind of disappointment as him to see if it really stand out as a problem to singapore society. Maybe someone upon reading and analysing the problem might really come out with a solution. If you are asking Doom the victim himself, how he know what's the solution that's possible when he has no connection or knowledge of what, how the government can help? Everyone know that the government like to restrict this and that, passing law to fine this and that without proper transparency to the public.

            <div class='col-md body'>Another usuage of the 'priority' to locals argument. Do you think ALL the locals can make it to univeristy? Dun you think the government has tried its best to give its citizens a gd education and encourage lifelong learning.<br><br>Stop deceiving yourself and open your eyes wide. Yes, Singapore is a people resource country, yes we do have capable people. BUT is it enough?? That's what the government has been stressing time and time again to you people. They dun overlook the locals, instead they HAD to bring in foreign talent to boost several aspects of the country. Take for example, the education system, ie, universities.<br><br>They had tie-ups with other universities overseas.. do you think all this is posssible if we just stick to our roots and no matter what, LOCALS rules??<br><br>This is not a case of foreigners are foreign, so they get better. But it rather, if you want something, earn it. Face the fact, grades are still relatively important today in singapore THOUGH, i repeat THOUGH there are efforts to bring this down.<br><br>People are threatened by this foreign talent. Why? Cos they feel they are not up to competing withthem. SO what do they say. They say the governement is biased, the government does not help the locals enough. IS that really true?? Ask yourselves seriously??<br><br>Is the government really that biased, if so why did it stay in power for so long(that is another story.<br><br>In this democratic society, u get what you earn. Yes, some people are intellectually more gifted, they get an easy road. Others, not so gifted have a harder road to take. But it is not as if the government does not give you any options at all! See the government's effort to keep kids from straying away from school, keeping them out of gangs, the various awareness campaigns, the many numerous programs implemented. WHat for?? For the foreigners?? NO!! they are for the locals.. who? THE LOCALS!<br><br>If you feel so strongly that foreigners have taken over the university, does it say anithing about the education system in singapore?? what do you say. do we breed useless fools who can't make it into univeristy and can't compete with the foreign students? or are these people constantly lamenting that the education requirement is too high, and they can't win the super scholars.. etc..etc..<br><br>If you want the best, you have to be the best, with a little luck. Harsh it may seem, but that is true reality.<br><br>I am not saying that you can't voice your opinions nor ami trying to stop you from releasing your pent-up frustration, but i want you to see the other side of the story as well and hope you understand what i am trying to put across.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br><strong>I cOnSiDeR MySeLf aN ExPeRt tOmAtO gArDeNeR sInCe aLL oF mY FrIeNdS TeLL mE I hAvE tHe mOsT CoLoUrFuL aNd sWeEtEsT tOmAtOeS.</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Life is too short to bother with tasteless tomatoes."<br></span></div>
