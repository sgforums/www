                                      Failure</span>: So you think that you are somehow far too talented,
                                      hard-working or knowledgeable and that everything you touch will
                                      turn into gold? Sorry to burst your bubble there, but we humans are
                                      flawed by nature so that, my friend, I?m afraid that you may just
                                      be living in denial if you have such a way of thinking.<br> <br></li>

                                      Impossible to Take Me by Surprise</span>: If you think that being
                                      taken by surprise is impossible if you have everything planned then
                                      I have one questions: how is life in that fantasy world of yours
                                      treating you? Yes, planning ahead is always recommended but
                                      thinking that you can actually be able to prepare for absolutely
                                      everything is just plain foolish on your part.<br> <br></li>

                                      Something Done Right, Do It Yourself</span>: Do you think that
                                      others should never be trusted and do you think that, if you want
                                      something done right, you should do it yourself? Aren't you giving
                                      yourself just a little bit too much credit there? It may just be
                                      me, but you most definitely don't strike me as a person with his or

                                      Fault</span>: Others are always at fault, aren't they? You keep
                                      doing everything right and they just ruin things for you, do they?
                                      Sorry to have to say this, but not assuming responsibility is one
                                      of the most obvious signs that you are living in denial.<br> <br></li>

                                      excuses for <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">everything</span>? Good
                                      for you, maybe you will find someone who pays you for that, but for
                                      the time being, your attitude is yet another sign that you are

                                      brilliance? I'm sorry but, if that's the way you see things, I am

                                      victim in what seems to be one huge conspiracy against you? In that

                                      conspiring against you, and it's about time you stopped living in

              <p>Not all men are able to set/put aside their emotions and achieve the optimal results consistently.    I come across petty, narrow minded men (I have to make myself clear, not all men though) who can't.   They just go on and on to bear grudge and allow their grudge to affect their performance and at the same time being unfair to others.   </p>

              <p>--- "As for comments from bigots who think that gender directly
                                                              determines the value/worth of a person's potential in the
                                                              workforce, imho it screams lack of confidence in their masculinity
                                                              and it shows they are <em>incapable of negotiating beyond conventional
                                                              ideas</em>.---</p>
              <p>Not from an elite school. Not from an elite debate team so please bear with me.</p>
              <p>Conventional refers to traditional gender roles adopted by generations before today, during times when people thought women should not be given education because the workforce has no need for it. In the 21st millenium, this concept is no longer valid. It's sexist to assume that all indivuduals clearly fit into the category of male or female roles in our society - women have characteristics fit for home making, therefore they should be home makers.</p>
              <p>To believe that equal education and employment opportunities for women is not the right step for our society, sounds like an idea marred by very obvious suppression. I won't compare it to third world countries, they don't have the advantages we have.</p>
              <p>Go conventional and stuff out radical? What's radical? Misandry? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> ok back to the point.</p>
              <p>If Singapore is waiting for evolutionary confirmation before granting female borns the right education, why are home econs lessons and D &amp; T workshops compulsory for all? Please evolve. Please.</p>
              <p>Or nope I get it now, this is not about snuffing out the "weaker sex" in the workforce or denying them equal opportunity for promotion for the good of nature.</p>
              <p>It's the secret grief of an abnormal mind.</p>

              <p>How many times do I have to tell you that it is an ANALOGY.
              Which means that it doesnt freaking matter what the women did or
              did not do, its just an example to prove a
              different point.</p>
