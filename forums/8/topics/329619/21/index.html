              <p>Eh, sorry but I disagree. The cost of living has nothing to do with women joining in the workforce. If women did not come in, the men would still be able to do something among themselves to boost the economic growth...unless you are saying they are not capable of doing that.</p>
              <p>It is more like the more civilised we are, the more things come up in life, the more we need to spend to accomodate those needs...those countries have lower living cost because they are not so advanced yet and they do not have so many needs compared to us. Not because the women are not at work.</p>

              <p>you see, an increase in the workforce is one of the major drivers of economic growth. without the critical mass, economic growth would be substantially slower. women have played a part in economic growth, which is why they are now trapped in a vicious cycle which is the rat race.</p>

              <p>Even without the women, there will still be others who will come in to increase the workforce. For example, foreigners, etc. I don't think women should take blame for this.</p>

              <p>I don't recall anyone here not being able to accept educated women, just checked the news, nope none of us jumped out of the window after finding out that almost 99% of the women we've met are educated.</p>
              <p>Detached, I understand that this subject must be very touchy, perhaps you yourself are a lady. However this forum is for purely debate, theres no need for these frenzied attacks on the proposition. Hyperion may not be as charismatic as Hitler, however he is sharp and articulate and has made fairly valid points. I do not see you making any, please back up your arguments in future.</p>
              <p>No one of us is denying the RIGHT of women to be educated, nor are we planning to lock them up at home. We simply think that they should STICK to their GENDER RELATED ROLES. There is nothing GENOCIDAL (hitler) or CHAUVINISTIC about that. Since god or whatever entity decided since the dawn of time that women should do that (look at the traits we have already posted in the previous pages).</p>
              <p>I reinforce the point that homemaking is a very very NOBLE job. There is nothing chauvinistic about thinking women should perhaps stay at home to look after the children. Who else would? Your maid? And in a few months time your child would be calling you "mam".</p>
