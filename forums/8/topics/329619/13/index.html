              <p>Imho, female colleagues and staff are more attentive to detail
              and they are more meticulous. They can put these qualities to good
              use at work, especially if their jobs call for a good level of
              emotional sensitivity to their surroundings. For example, they tend
              to make better writers and photographers and sometimes
              teachers.</p>

              <p>Quite true. Attentiveness and having a higher level of emotion sensitivity sure do help in the education industry or those that require memory work.</p>
              <p>However, pls take into consideration when i say "<span style="color: #0000ff;">emotionally-oriented</span>"</p>
              <p>That means that their work performance are primarily based on their emotions, unlike men who are mostly able to set aside their emotions and achieve the optimal results <span style="color: #0000ff;">consistently</span>.</p>
              <p>So, the working capabilities of females is highly doubtful. History has proven this by having more ( many more ) mens than women in nearly every field of specialty except for caretaking :P</p>

But to confuse piety with her capability as a businesswomen or a coporate executive I'm not very certain about that.<br><br>By the way, I think I drank formula milk since i was born. No breast milk :'(<br><br>And with reference to Hyperion's post. I believe men did the real fighting and women still stayed behind.

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Sources pls. If not it'll be all talk only, which are what materalistic girls does the best.</span></p>
              <p>For my point that females are mentally and physically weaker, it can be proven by the ratio of successful men to successful women in the world and also by the average NAFA test results ;p</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Totally agree. Primary school girls always pwn primary school guys in their studies. But when it comes to higher educations.... </span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Of course I realise it, it is so obvious. The increased edcation level in females had led to alot of problems. That why men, who are ever so caring and thoughtful of the devastating consequences of allowing girls more education, are gathering here to debate on the possible solution. </span></p>

              <p>I rather let woman rule the big countries and man rule the smaller countries. Liddat there will be lesser war. Cus woman are all naturally born with a weak spot, they are more prone to "balls carrying" and easily smitten. While man holds their stand firm and of course the pussies of man cant la.</p>
              <p>In other words, we nid man to rule sg cus sg is so NRS (Natural resources starved) and nids an ambitious man to head. While an economic giant like America should be woman ruled, first as to cease the world by the impression of Americanism like boozing, womanising and sorts. Cus a woman will definitely emphasize on anti-womanism thingys.</p>
              <p>Aiya even to speak of things. Woman's body are born sufferers while Man's body are born pain-inflictors... Anyone get wad I meant?</p>

              <p>Would you be so kind to elaborate this "news"? And yes women have been oppressed and perhaps there will be women presidents in the future, but that does not prove thhat women are more capable then men.</p>
              <p>My side of the house has already shown that women have been SCIENTIFICALLY proven to be weaker emotionally and physically. This has as we have already stated made them ideal homemakers which is nothing shameful about. I don't think anyone here is stopping them from being educated and knowing how to read and write, an affluent society will still exist at the same time solving problems such as aging population and llow birth rates.</p>
              <p>High positions such as presidents, executives etc require strong and firm people. Men having stronger mental and physical capacities are able to take the stress of the workplace better (Go get a psychologist if you dont believe me). Will a women president be firm in her decisions or will she back down in the face of aggression when even men have? (e.g neville chamberlain)</p>
              <p>I believe the point has already been proven that women are not inferior to men, they simply have different gender traits and should direct them in the correct position.</p>
