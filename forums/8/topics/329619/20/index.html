              in modern concept, feminist means support equal rights for woman.
              female chauvinist means thinking woman is superior than men.

              <p>Eh, sorry but I disagree. The cost of living has nothing to do with women joining in the workforce. If women did not come in, the men would still be able to do something among themselves to boost the economic growth...unless you are saying they are not capable of doing that.</p>
              <p>It is more like the more civilised we are, the more things come up in life, the more we need to spend to accomodate those needs...those countries have lower living cost because they are not so advanced yet and they do not have so many needs compared to us. Not because the women are not at work.</p>

              <p>I don't think you share the same understanding of the word 'birthright'. Birthright is the basic entitlement that someone is entited to from birth. If you refuse to acknowledge that the right to education that everyone, female or not deserves from birth, wouldn't that make you a barbaric pig?</p>
              <p>The issue at hand has exactly to do with policies. You complained that by 'putting incredible (and unfair) workloads on women, leads to the undeniable plummeting birth rate", so shouldn't this government implements policies to help increase the birth rate? A little self-contradictory there, chum.</p>
              <p> I didn't say that the role of a caregiver is inferior, and in my previous post, I honor the role of a modern woman - juggling work and family.</p>
              <p>If the solution to the 'undeniable plummeting birth rate' is to take women out of school and ban them from society, I'd like to ask, what difference are you from Hitler, who saw the jews as a problem?</p>
