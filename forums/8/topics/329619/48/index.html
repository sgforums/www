              <p>guys guys guys... </p>
              <p>Obviously a broken woman. Fix a broken woman and she will love u forever. Now for her case , mmmm... i dont know how to fix it yet. What do u guys think is the remedy ? How do u go about .. fixing this poor thing.</p>
              <p>People act the way they act and say the things the say. Why ? There is always a reason behind everything. Maybe we should, open our hearts and minds to understand her situation.

              <p>Lets face it , its undeniable that women are starting to play an important role as actors to the systems of the world. I have no qualms about a woman in top dog position. I just worry that they get too over thier head sometimes to the point of no humilty when regards to issues of gender equality, or in fact, anything gender in notion. Like..someone here. I believe education for all. No problems with that. The issues on birthrates and wages.. lol.. i leave that part out.</p>
              <p>But i am here to add fuel to the fire. Sometimes small fires dun get the job done. U need more fuel.. bigger fire to totally burn down the house.</p>
