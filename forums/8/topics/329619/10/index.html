              <p>Parn, you need to realise that the biggest argument here for the point that women should not be educated has nothing to do with inherent capabilities of either gender.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The point to be made is:</p>
              <p>If women were not educated, society would stand to benefit as a whole, not because women dont deserve it, but because women have a natural role of being a caretaker (which they excel at).</p>
              <p>With education, women have tried to imitate and even replace the role of men, as the supporter of the family unit, and this has upset social dynamics, evident in plummeting birthrates.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>-----</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The fundamental problem here, is that women look down on their natural role as caregivers, and see the male paradigm of education and occupational mobility as superior. Which is what has led to this problem in the first place.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I really dont understand why women despise their own roles so much. I dont see that problem with men. Most men want to provide for and support their families, and not encroach on traditional female responsibilities.</p>

              this problem in the first place.</p>
