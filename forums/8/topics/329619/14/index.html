              <p>Would you be so kind to elaborate this "news"? And yes women have been oppressed and perhaps there will be women presidents in the future, but that does not prove thhat women are more capable then men.</p>
              <p>My side of the house has already shown that women have been SCIENTIFICALLY proven to be weaker emotionally and physically. This has as we have already stated made them ideal homemakers which is nothing shameful about. I don't think anyone here is stopping them from being educated and knowing how to read and write, an affluent society will still exist at the same time solving problems such as aging population and llow birth rates.</p>
              <p>High positions such as presidents, executives etc require strong and firm people. Men having stronger mental and physical capacities are able to take the stress of the workplace better (Go get a psychologist if you dont believe me). Will a women president be firm in her decisions or will she back down in the face of aggression when even men have? (e.g neville chamberlain)</p>
              <p>I believe the point has already been proven that women are not inferior to men, they simply have different gender traits and should direct them in the correct position.</p>
