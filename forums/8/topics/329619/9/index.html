              <p>I'd like to present my view on modern social dynamics related to gender issues, slightly deviating from the thread topic. If you have the time, do read through the post.</p>

              <p>----</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I honestly think, biologically speaking, that the modern conception of gender equality is an anomaly. I'm not saying that girls are inferior, because i do have female friends who are much more capable than i am. But i somehow think that nature has a role in place for each gender, and the modern conception of 'gender equality' is a retardation of nature.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Have you realised, that in every country where gender equality is prominent, birthrates fall dramatically such that populations cannot even sustain themselves ? How can this be evolutionarily proper, that a populus, without outside interference, is wiping itself out?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sure, there are those who will say that falling birthrates are due to economic development, leading to stress, leading to social changes. But, the root cause of these problems is the upsetting of traditional gender roles.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If women had stayed out of the economy as a whole, leaving the men at work (which has been the case seen the start of humanity), economic growth would be slower, competitiveness will be lower, costs of living would also be lower. This would mean that men can cope as the sole breadwinner, and women can play the traditional role of looking after the family. With this, birthrates will go back to normal levels unlike the current situation where both parents usually have to work.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And I'd like to ask, what is wrong with the traditional female role? Why do females look down on their own noble role as caretakers of the family? Its something that men can hardly cope with, and is a role biologically suited to the female (given that women are more sensitive to emotion and are the natural nurturers of children). In this way, there is also gender equality, albeit different from the modern retarded notion of it. In the ideal concept, each gender plays its suited part. Men, who are physically stronger, go out to support the family, and Women, who are more adapt emotionally, take care of the family.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore, the point i'd like to bring across, is that the modern notion of gender equality, appears to be a retardation of natural process. It could be an undesired manifestation of the 20th century's feminist movements. But whatever it is, there seems to be a long term problem associated.</p>

              retardation of natural process. It could be an undesired
              manifestation of the 20th century's feminist movements. But
              whatever it is, there seems to be a long term problem
              associated.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I'd like to present my view on modern social dynamics related to gender issues, slightly deviating from the thread topic. If you have the time, do read through the post.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>----</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I honestly think, biologically speaking, that the modern conception of gender equality is an anomaly. I'm not saying that girls are inferior, because i do have female friends who are much more capable than i am. But i somehow think that nature has a role in place for each gender, and the modern conception of 'gender equality' is a retardation of nature.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Have you realised, that in every country where gender equality is prominent, birthrates fall dramatically such that populations cannot even sustain themselves ? How can this be evolutionarily proper, that a populus, without outside interference, is wiping itself out?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sure, there are those who will say that falling birthrates are due to economic development, leading to stress, leading to social changes. But, the root cause of these problems is the upsetting of traditional gender roles.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If women had stayed out of the economy as a whole, leaving the men at work (which has been the case seen the start of humanity), economic growth would be slower, competitiveness will be lower, costs of living would also be lower. This would mean that men can cope as the sole breadwinner, and women can play the traditional role of looking after the family. With this, birthrates will go back to normal levels unlike the current situation where both parents usually have to work.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And I'd like to ask, what is wrong with the traditional female role? Why do females look down on their own noble role as caretakers of the family? Its something that men can hardly cope with, and is a role biologically suited to the female (given that women are more sensitive to emotion and are the natural nurturers of children). In this way, there is also gender equality, albeit different from the modern retarded notion of it. In the ideal concept, each gender plays its suited part. Men, who are physically stronger, go out to support the family, and Women, who are more adapt emotionally, take care of the family.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore, the point i'd like to bring across, is that the modern notion of gender equality, appears to be a retardation of natural process. It could be an undesired manifestation of the 20th century's feminist movements. But whatever it is, there seems to be a long term problem associated.</p>

              <p>It would be suicidal to openly agree that women should be less educated with feminists like Parn in existance. Thus, I take a more neutral stand. Forgive me if there is any inaccuracies in my case, I have reviewed the past pages of posts ( skipping pages 1-4 as they involve parn besmirching the name of man and her ultimately getting wtfpwnt!).</p>
              <p>I have concluded that at the present stage, it would be impossible to strip women of their rights to education. Judging from the responses of the ladies, the mere notion of connecting them with "not allowed to be educated" has triggered off a scene that would be rightfully associated with the phrase "hell hath no fury like a woman's scorn".</p>
              <p>However, we must consider the outcome of having women not being educated. I fully agree with hyperion's earlier post. The traditional gender roles of women have been upsetted and this is mostly due to rising education rates among the female populace.I also agree fully with him/her stating that there is NOTHING wrong with the female gender role of being a homemaker. Is bringing home a million dollars more satisfying than knowing you have raised and bred three wonderful and productive members of society who love and adore you? Even parn would think twice before abusing this statement.</p>
              <p>Now let us fully review the pros and cons of this situation:</p>
              <p>Pros<br>-An increase in childbirth rates<br>It is a fact that due to women going out to work, married couples have less children as they simply have no time to look after children. With recent government incentives, the notion of having "no money" is a poor excuse for having no children.<br>-Better bred children<br>Ever heard of the phrase "your mother never teach you properly isit". Yes, with the watchful eyes of a motherly figure, our society will have less mats,chao ah bengs, pai kias and ah lians. Less people going to ITE too. And less chances of pregnant men, urgh.</p>
              <p>There might be more benefits to this however i've been unable to think of anymore. However I would like to remind everyone that because of low child birth rates, "foreign talent" has been allowed to do the damage it has done to our society. Other ugly consequences have also been arising, I do not wish to make any mention of them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>-Cons<br>-A smaller skilled workforce<br>The most obvious of the problems that will surface, women make up a substancial portion of singapore's workforce, by taking them away we face a possible collapse of our economy.</p>
              <p>-The rise of femenism<br>Just look at parn, we don't need more of them around bitching about not being allowed education. "you useless men just don't like capable women like us outperforming you, pussies, pussies PUSSIES!" well you get the idea. We don't need more general rioting in singapore. Dr chee soon juan is entertaining enough.</p>
              <p>-More human rights abuse.<br>Possibly the UN is going to have another thing to add in singapore's human rights abuses, pushing our ranking as a facist country even higher up the charts.</p>
              <p>I regret that as a man there is a grain of chauvinism in my blood, and that involves wanting  women to be more passive than men. I believe every men in the world has that small grain of chavinism, the question is wheather we choose to show it or not. Education has disrupted the intricate tradition of women and their roles, that I believe was a mistake. nevertheless the situation is as such, we cannot seek to change this new environment, for us men, the days of the nice girl who would listen to our every command and do our bidding is long past.More women WILL be educated and there is nothing we can do about it like it or not. Time to police up your D***s and adapt boys!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Trivial fact: The Y chromosone is going to die out in 20,000 years time! What does that mean? The end of sexual reproduction! Thus, we can all see this topic will be very pointless in 20,000 years time!</p>

With recent government incentives, the notion of having "no money" is a poor excuse for having no children.<br>-Better bred children<br>Ever heard of the phrase "your mother never teach you properly isit". Yes, with the watchful eyes of a motherly figure, our society will have less mats,chao ah bengs, pai kias and ah lians. Less people going to ITE too. And less chances of pregnant men, urgh.</p>
              <p>There might be more benefits to this however i've been unable to think of anymore. However I would like to remind everyone that because of low child birth rates, "foreign talent" has been allowed to do the damage it has done to our society. Other ugly consequences have also been arising, I do not wish to make any mention of them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>-Cons<br>-A smaller skilled workforce<br>The most obvious of the problems that will surface, women make up a substancial portion of singapore's workforce, by taking them away we face a possible collapse of our economy.</p>
              <p>-The rise of femenism<br>Just look at parn, we don't need more of them around bitching about not being allowed education. "you useless men just don't like capable women like us outperforming you, pussies, pussies PUSSIES!" well you get the idea. We don't need more general rioting in singapore. Dr chee soon juan is entertaining enough.</p>
              <p>-More human rights abuse.<br>Possibly the UN is going to have another thing to add in singapore's human rights abuses, pushing our ranking as a facist country even higher up the charts.</p>
              <p>I regret that as a man there is a grain of chauvinism in my blood, and that involves wanting  women to be more passive than men. I believe every men in the world has that small grain of chavinism, the question is wheather we choose to show it or not. Education has disrupted the intricate tradition of women and their roles, that I believe was a mistake. nevertheless the situation is as such, we cannot seek to change this new environment, for us men, the days of the nice girl who would listen to our every command and do our bidding is long past.More women WILL be educated and there is nothing we can do about it like it or not. Time to police up your D***s and adapt boys!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Trivial fact: The Y chromosone is going to die out in 20,000 years time! What does that mean? The end of sexual reproduction! Thus, we can all see this topic will be very pointless in 20,000 years time!</p>

              <p>So far, the above sentence is still very true.</p>
              <p>Will you guys still whine if you're enlisted in police and not army?</p>

              <p>Unfortunately, my post carries a certain truth which is just presented to an insensible audience.</p>

              <p>Why don't you tell us if you really think it is true?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are girls who are not able to take hardships in life, and very often that is the reason why they are not able to cope and survive in the working world.</p>
              <p>Is that explaination simple enough for you to understand?</p>

              <p>One thing for sure, having an intelligent conversation/argument with a girl DOES arouse and ignite a guy's desire to sleep with her. Hence, birthrate will INCREASE.</p>
