              <p>I would like everyone to know that Germany not only had women fighting on the front (1945 volksturm) but also working in assembly lines. And they ultimately lost the war.</p>

              <p>12) Hitler had some of his best staff executed after the july 11th plot, including Erwin Rommel.<br>13)Germany was constantly bombed by the allies and had their industrial output halved.<br>14)The german army was overstretched by 1944.<br>15)The 7th German army was encirlced in the falaise pocket when hitler did not allow it to retreat resulting in 100000 men being captured and the loss of 200 guns and hundreds of tanks.<br>16)Hitler decided to launch opertion Wacht Am Rhein , known as the battle of the bulge when the resources could be better used elsewhere.<br>17) Allied Air superiorty was overwhelming by 1943 germany had lost air superiorty on all fronts.<br>18)Italy betrayed Germany on 1943 and joined the allies.<br>19)Germany was oil starved by 1942<br>20) the Wehrmacht was plagued with mechanical problems in their panzer and luftwaffe branches after 1941.</p>

              <p>It is scientifically proven that females have a weaker mental and physical capacity than males.</p>
              <p>This is not a disadvantage.</p>
              <p>Rather, nature meant it this way as females are to be caretakers. That is why females are more emotionally-orientated.</p>
              <p>However, such advantages in caretaking does not applies to the working world, of which this is a major disadvantage.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, females have their monthly problem which causes a varying degree of "emotion instability" and that could cause alot of problems if they were given important tasks to accomplish.</p>
              <p>And to add on, there are a minority of females who have more flaws compared to others, for example they have the built in urge to want a 30k ring, or simply put, materalistic.</p>
              <p>If you look at all this flaws, wouldn't it be better if females would become caretakers instead and fulfil their roles? Wouldn't money be saved and put to better use if education is stripped for them since it is unneccessary?</p>
              <p>All they need is just to learn how to communicate and allow their male counterparts to fulfil the "feeding" role. The workforce part could easily be solved by the rising birth rate if they become caretakers.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why don't you tell us if you
              really think it is true?</span></p>
              <p>While, you have your rights to your views.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">There are girls who are not able
              to take hardships in life, and very often that is the reason why
              they are not able to cope and survive in the working
              world.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is that explaination simple enough
              for you to understand?</span></p>
              <p>It is scientifically proven that females have a weaker mental
              and physical capacity than males.</p>
              <p>This is not a disadvantage.</p>
              <p>Rather, nature meant it this way as females are to be
              caretakers. That is why females are more
              emotionally-orientated.</p>
              <p>However, such advantages in caretaking does not applies to the
              working world, of which this is a major disadvantage.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, females have their monthly problem which causes a
              varying degree of "emotion instability" and that could cause alot
              of problems if they were given important tasks to accomplish.</p>
              <p>And to add on, there are a minority of females who have more
              flaws compared to others, for example they have the built in urge
              to want a 30k ring, or simply put, materalistic.</p>
              <p>If you look at all this flaws, wouldn't it be better if females
              would become caretakers instead and fulfil their roles? Wouldn't
              money be saved and put to better use if education is stripped for
              them since it is unneccessary?</p>
              <p>All they need is just to learn how to communicate and allow
              their male counterparts to fulfil the "feeding" role. The workforce
              part could easily be solved by the rising birth rate if they become
              caretakers.</p>

              <p>Imho, female colleagues and staff are more attentive to detail and they are more meticulous. They can put these qualities to good use at work, especially if their jobs call for a good level of emotional sensitivity to their surroundings. For example, they tend to make better writers and photographers and sometimes teachers.</p>

              <p>Why is it so hard for some forumers to understand although we have our own place and roles to play, it's perfectly fine to alternate between different ones?

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Isn't the answer already in your heart?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why don't you tell us if you really think it is true?</span></p>
              <p>While, you have your rights to your views.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">There are girls who are not able to take hardships in life, and very often that is the reason why they are not able to cope and survive in the working world.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is that explaination simple enough for you to understand?</span></p>
              <p>It is scientifically proven that females have a weaker mental and physical capacity than males.</p>
              <p>This is not a disadvantage.</p>
              <p>Rather, nature meant it this way as females are to be caretakers. That is why females are more emotionally-orientated.</p>
              <p>However, such advantages in caretaking does not applies to the working world, of which this is a major disadvantage.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, females have their monthly problem which causes a varying degree of "emotion instability" and that could cause alot of problems if they were given important tasks to accomplish.</p>
              <p>And to add on, there are a minority of females who have more flaws compared to others, for example they have the built in urge to want a 30k ring, or simply put, materalistic.</p>
              <p>If you look at all this flaws, wouldn't it be better if females would become caretakers instead and fulfil their roles? Wouldn't money be saved and put to better use if education is stripped for them since it is unneccessary?</p>
              <p>All they need is just to learn how to communicate and allow their male counterparts to fulfil the "feeding" role. The workforce part could easily be solved by the rising birth rate if they become caretakers.</p>

              <p>Imho, female colleagues and staff are more attentive to detail
              and they are more meticulous. They can put these qualities to good
              use at work, especially if their jobs call for a good level of
              emotional sensitivity to their surroundings. For example, they tend
              to make better writers and photographers and sometimes
              teachers.</p>

              <p>I thought men were more meticulous, they make better mathematicians and scientists ( i believe you have to be very meticulous in calculations) and tend to have a more logical brain.</p>
              <p>Futhermore a good level of emotional sensitivity, isn't that what is needed more at home? Children's needs and feelings are perhaps, to subtle for men to comprehend?</p>
