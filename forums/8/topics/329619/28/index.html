              <p>And for the sake of comparison, what are your so called examples
                  of an <em>unconventional</em> society?</p>
              <p>--- "As for comments from bigots who think that gender directly
                  determines the value/worth of a person's potential in the
                  workforce, imho it screams lack of confidence in their masculinity
                  and it shows they are <em>incapable of negotiating beyond
                  conventional ideas</em>.---</p>
              <p>Not from an elite school. Not from an elite debate team so
                  please bear with me.</p>
              <p>Conventional refers to traditional gender roles adopted by
                  generations before today, during times when people thought women
                  should not be given education because the workforce has no need for
                  it. In the 21st millenium, this concept is no longer valid. It's
                  sexist to assume that all indivuduals clearly fit into the category
                  of male or female roles in our society - women have characteristics
                  fit for home making, therefore they should be home makers.</p>
              <p>To believe that equal education and employment opportunities for
                  women is not the right step for our society, sounds like an idea
                  marred by very obvious suppression. I won't compare it to third
                  world countries, they don't have the advantages we have.</p>
              <p>Go conventional and stuff out radical? What's radical? Misandry?
                  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> ok back to the point.</p>
              <p>If Singapore is waiting for evolutionary confirmation before
                  granting female borns the right education, why are home econs
                  lessons and D &amp; T workshops compulsory for all? Please evolve.
                  Please.</p>
              <p>Or nope I get it now, this is not about snuffing out the "weaker
                  sex" in the workforce or denying them equal opportunity for
                  promotion for the good of nature.</p>
              <p>It's the secret grief of an abnormal mind.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Alright fair enough. First things first, please do get the definitions "elite" and "good" school striaght. Only shallow people fail to make the distinction between a "good" school and "elite" school. So please, before you associate me with elitism, get your definitions straight.<br><br>About the conventional part, there is no basis for the comparison. In no part of my argument did i include conventional or radical societies. I merely included singapore being a conventional society so as to irritate a certain femenist being rather unfriendly in her posts.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"It's
                  sexist to assume that all indivuduals clearly fit into the category
                  of male or female roles in our society - women have characteristics
                  fit for home making, therefore they should be home makers"</span><br>-What is sexist about saying a gun is designed to kill, therefore you should use it instead of the stone as it is more effective.</p>
              <p>It is however, sexist to deny women the rights to education, which is not what the basis of my argument is. We encourage women to stay as homemakers because men do not make as good ones as women.<span style="color: #000000;"> Please, do read carefully in future.<br><br>Now let us review, why is it that our dear femenists are so unhappy about being homemakers? Is it because they find that they do not get enough recognition, or is it because they get paid nothing ? If that is the case, perhaps they should be complaining to the government about it and not calling us "unevolved oppressive extremists" to sum up their, ah, case.<br><br>Regarding education, you do realise that D&amp;T, home economics and the like is offered to provide a "wholesome education" . The same reason why art is offered, it is not compulsory, in fact a student can choose to drop this subjects if his parents were to write a letter to the school. <br><br>Therefore, I highlight ONCE AGAIN, that homemaking is a worthy job, as noble as any coporate job out there. I do not see anything wrong with it and if women stay on as homemakers, they do not have the need for high education, however they are still welcome to be educated if they wish. <br><br>And if women don't look after the children, who will? Sure, men can do it, but not as well as women , on a scientifically proven general basis. Why do you think courts are often prejudiced to give the child to the female side. And again, we must look at the consequence, stop being selfish my dear lady. This benefits society as a awhole. With women staying at home, the birth rates will definitely go up (look at countries such as india and compare and contrast to this hypothesis), thereby solving the workforce problem with women removed.<br><br>I would like to remind you that the women are still employed (as home-makers) and I don't see how this is an unfair job opportunity as the minute they have a child, they are employed. Neither are we saying that women cannot enter politics. So please stop making us sound like Nazis.<br><br>If you don't like the idea of gender inequalities, I suggest Thailand. They have several good sex change offers available, you might even become asexual and enjoy the benefits of both man and woman! ^^  And yes, this is radical. And no, you are the conventional femenist in todays society, perhaps it is a time to step back and review if we've been doing the right or wrong thing since the 40s. You say evolve? I say look before you leap.<br></span></p>

              <p>So allow me to sum up this topic,</p>
              <p>Many of us here agree that girls should be allowed access to as
              less as possible an  amount of education as their main job is
              to be a caretaker. This will save money which could be
              redistributed to other sections like defenses or recreations.</p>

              <p>That was what happened in the past, most women stayed home, the men were the primary breadwinner. But after a while, the men couldn't cope and had to ask the women to go out and work as well to support the family.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, both genders have their own strong points and good in different aspects.    I see no end to the argument on the education  for women and birth rate.    This topic can go on and on yet reach no consensus.      Both genders are made up differently.    Both genders to appreciate each other will reduce friction, avoid misunderstanding.</p>
