              <p>Singapore is not an easy place to survive without money, therefore, money issue is almost NOT an option. However, with the introduction of contraceptives, having babies now becomes an option to the ladies, since they would also need to go through that 10 months of pregnancy (not easy) and stakes are high.</p>

              <p>Education = <strong>helps</strong> economic progression = focus (when without measures to take care of areas other than ---&gt;) on economic growth = therefore low birth rate.</p>
              <p>I think this doesn't mean curtailing education for women is the definite right way to encourage birth rate. In fact I think education is necessary, but we need a more appropriate education on top of our normal school stream education, and that is to educate the importance of romance, family and love to both genders.</p>

It is much like how in the case of absence of electricity, you wouldn’t be able to use your electric kettle. But know that there are other source of heating up water like using an ordinary kettle and cooking water over gas. So it may be that people are <strong>DEPENDING </strong>too much on electricity <strong>that they neglect to see other viables,</strong> which may affect the outcome of no boiled water. <strong>What we want is to achieve the same effect, so we must be open to alternatives. </strong></p>

              <p><br> Many women, especially in Singapore, aren’t ACTUALLY so lucky to have the luxury of the life you have just described. And perhaps the whiny girls you said who nags are the ones you happen to come across. But I like it when you said it is the duty of a man to take care of his wife. The fact however, remains that <strong>majority of pregnant women are still out there working</strong>, gets only three months maternity leave and <strong>comes home to fetch from care taker a wailing baby</strong>. Many couples do not have the <strong>luxury </strong>of depending on only the husband to bring the bread dough, what's more, with prevalent threads advocating girls earning their own keeps too and to pay for dates as well (isn’t it contradicting then to advocate ladies staying at home when one didn’t encourage the women to be financially dependent on man in the first place?) Alright, not to go off topic, what I’m trying to say is:

              <p>I'd like to present my view on modern social dynamics related to
                  gender issues, slightly deviating from the thread topic. If you
                  have the time, do read through the post.</p>

              <p>I honestly think, biologically speaking, that the <strong>modern
                  conception of gender equality is an anomaly.</strong> I'm not saying that
                  girls are inferior, because i do have female friends who are much
                  more capable than i am. But i somehow think that nature has a role
                  in place for each gender, and the modern conception of 'gender
                  equality' is a retardation of nature.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Have you realised, that in every country where gender equality
                  is prominent, birthrates fall dramatically such that populations
                  cannot even sustain themselves ? How can this be evolutionarily
                  proper, that a populus, without outside interference, is wiping
                  itself out?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sure, there are those who will say that falling birthrates are
                  due to economic development, leading to stress, leading to social
                  changes. But, the root cause of these problems is the
                  upsetting of traditional gender roles.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If women had stayed out of the economy as a whole, leaving the
                  men at work (which has been the case seen the start of humanity),
                  economic growth would be slower, competitiveness will be lower,
                  costs of living would also be lower. This would mean that men can
                  cope as the sole breadwinner, and women can play the traditional
                  role of looking after the family. With this, birthrates will go
                  back to normal levels unlike the current situation where both
                  parents usually have to work.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And I'd like to ask, <strong>what is wrong with the traditional female
                  role? Why do females look down on their own noble role as
                  caretakers of the family?</strong> Its something that men can hardly cope
                  with, and is a role biologically suited to the female (given that
                  women are more sensitive to emotion and are the natural nurturers
                  of children). In this way, there is also gender equality, albeit
                  different from the modern retarded notion of it. In the ideal
                  concept, each gender plays its suited part. <strong>Men, who are physically
                  stronger, go out to support the family, and Women, who are more
                  adapt emotionally, take care of the family.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore, the point i'd like to bring across, is that <strong>the
                  modern notion of gender equality, appears to be a
                  retardation of natural process. </strong>It could be an undesired
                  manifestation of the 20th century's feminist movements. But
                  whatever it is, there seems to be a long term problem
                  associated.</p>

              <p><strong>I have concluded that at the present stage, it would be
                  impossible to strip women of their rights to education. Judging
                  from the responses of the ladies, the mere notion of connecting
                  them with "not allowed to be educated" has triggered off a scene
                  that would be rightfully associated with the phrase "hell hath no
                  fury like a woman's scorn".</strong></p>
              <p>However, we must consider the outcome of having women not being
                  educated. I fully agree with hyperion's earlier post. The
                  traditional gender roles of women have been upsetted and this is
                  mostly due to rising education rates among the female populace.I
                  also agree fully with him/her stating that there is NOTHING wrong
                  with the female gender role of being a homemaker. Is bringing home
                  a million dollars more satisfying than knowing you have raised and
                  bred three wonderful and productive members of society who love and
                  adore you? Even parn would think twice before abusing this
                  statement.</p>
              <p>Now let us fully review the pros and cons of this situation:</p>
              <p>Pros<br> -An increase in childbirth rates<br> It is a fact that due to women going out to work, married couples
                  have less children as they simply have no time to look after
                  children. With recent government incentives, the notion of having
                  "no money" is a poor excuse for having no children.<br> -Better bred children<br> Ever heard of the phrase "your mother never teach you properly
                  isit". Yes, with the watchful eyes of a motherly figure, our
                  society will have less mats,chao ah bengs, pai kias and ah lians.
                  Less people going to ITE too. And less chances of pregnant men,
                  urgh.</p>
              <p>There might be more benefits to this however i've been unable to
                  think of anymore. However I would like to remind everyone that
                  because of low child birth rates, "foreign talent" has been allowed
                  to do the damage it has done to our society. Other ugly
                  consequences have also been arising, I do not wish to make any
                  mention of them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>-Cons<br> -A smaller skilled workforce<br> The most obvious of the problems that will surface, women make up a
                  substancial portion of singapore's workforce, by taking them away
                  we face a possible collapse of our economy.</p>
              <p>-The rise of femenism<br> Just look at parn, we don't need more of them around bitching about
                  not being allowed education. "you useless men just don't like
                  capable women like us outperforming you, pussies, pussies PUSSIES!"
                  well you get the idea. We don't need more general rioting in
                  singapore. Dr chee soon juan is entertaining enough.</p>
              <p>-More human rights abuse.<br> Possibly the UN is going to have another thing to add in
                  singapore's human rights abuses, pushing our ranking as a facist
                  country even higher up the charts.</p>
              <p>I regret that as a man there is a grain of chauvinism in my
                  blood, and that involves wanting  women to be more passive
                  than men. I believe every men in the world has that small grain of
                  chavinism, the question is wheather we choose to show it or not.
                  Education has disrupted the intricate tradition of women and their
                  roles, that I believe was a mistake. nevertheless the situation is

                  Thus, we can all see this topic will be very pointless in 20,000

              <p><strong>the biggest argument here for the
              point that women should not be educated has nothing to do with
              inherent capabilities of either gender.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The point to be made is:</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If women were not educated, society would stand to benefit as a
              whole, not because women dont deserve it, but because women have a
              natural role of being a caretaker (which they excel at).</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">With education, women have tried to imitate and even replace the
              role of men, as the supporter of the family unit, and this has
              upset social dynamics, evident in plummeting birthrates.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>-----</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The fundamental problem here, is that women look down on their
              natural role as caregivers, and see the male paradigm of education
              and occupational mobility as superior. </strong>Which is what has led to
              this problem in the first place.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I really dont understand why women despise their own roles so
              much. I dont see that problem with men. Most men want to provide
              for and support their families, and not encroach on traditional
              female responsibilities.</p>

              female responsibilities” </strong></p>
              <p>Contrary to what you have stated, there <strong>IS</strong> a reason why women despise their own roles and this reason has also been perpetuated by <strong>some </strong>men themselves.
              I’ll give you some examples, mostly phenonmenon from the further past because that’s when women aren’t encouraged or even denied the access to pursue higher education and commonly stayed home as home-makers.</p>
              <p>Common talks of women being: é»„è„¸å©†ã€�æ²¡è§�è¯† etc were rampant. And instead of encouraging and providing the means to help women dress up to look more attractive or carry a more intelligent conversation with hubbies, or try to romance women to help keep sparks alive in marriage, some of these men choose to go find other women, <strong>who ironically are more likely to be in the work force</strong> (æŠ›å¤´éœ²é�¢), have more è§�è¯† to carry on an intelligent conversation, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">as well as an affair with them</span>.</p>
              <p>Media also has a part in this, but I find that it actually point out why women shrink from role of caregivers with the telecast of certain dramas. If you've noticed, dramas keep playing out this typical dilemma.
               How much time and energy does a woman have for a romance if she is being tied up as a caregiver? Important note here, I’m not saying that a caregiver doesn’t and shouldn’t have time for romance. I’m just trying to say that the means of trying to incorporated romance into a caregiver’s schedule <strong>has not been widely explored</strong>. Caregiver or not, all women need romance to help keep that spark in a relationship. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">“Busy” or “mismatched schedule” therefore little or no freedom nor romance when a woman stay home to look after children are excuses unlikely to make women NOT “despise their ‘ own roles’”.</span></strong></p>

              <p>The issue of gender equality has been resonating through society
              for decades now, no doubt this world that we live in has been
              shaped by historically by males. But we are past that era; this is

              <p>If women should be deprived of their birthrights, just to

              so obtuse might be able to increase birth rate, there're
              better options and governmental policies we've yet to explore.</p>
              <p>Lets not forget the other ugly face of gender bias. In many
              other countries, women generally, suffer a higher mortality rate
              than men because of gender bias. Remember China's one child policy?
              Accounts of farmers burying alive their newborn daughters. And more
              notably, the more recent gang-raped victim from middle East whom
              went to jail? I do not think I need to expound further.</p>

              up in life, the more we need to spend to accomodate those
              needs...those countries have lower living cost because they are not
              so advanced yet and they do not have so many needs compared to us.

               why are the females coming out to work as maids in Singapore?</p>

              <p>The pursuit of gender equality is central to sustainable
                  development where each member of society respects others and plays
                  a role in which they can fulfil their potential. The broader goal
                  of gender equality is a societal goal to which education, along
                  with all other social institutions must contribute.</p>
              <p>Discrimination based on sex is often structurally embedded. In
                  many societies women bear the major burden of responsibility for
                  food production and child-rearing, they are excluded from family
                  and community decisions affecting them and they have little or no

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gender issues must therefore be mainstreamed throughout

              <p>It is however, sexist to deny women the rights to education,

                  with it and if women stay on as homemakers, they do not have the
                  need for high education, however they are still welcome to be

                  do it, but not as well as women , on a scientifically proven
                  general basis. Why do you think courts are often prejudiced to give
