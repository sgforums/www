            <div class='col-md body'>No offense, i am in rmit-sim, i mean honestly those who enrol in private school because most have no choice. In Sim both UOL and rmit have no TUTURIALS class just a lecture  of 3 hours per week for each module. If u think tutorial class is important please think first before going to SIM.<br><br>Regarding my lecturers in RMIT, its real 70% lousy, 30% passable. I am in my 3rd year and only 3 lecturers give me their email address to ask questions through emailing them the rest of lecturers said its not convenient to anyhow give.<br><br>Now rmit have a bloody new policy, they will not be giving photocopied lecture materials, they expect YOU to photocopy 400 pages of notes per module. The bloody excuse they give is saying due copyright reasons which is really hilarious.<br><br>I cannot complain as i cannot get in local uni, and regarding your NS deferment SAF only recognise the 3 local unis. I done my ICT EVEN during schooling periods as my OC says no bargain for SIM. Forget about getting help from your school office as at the most they just give you a mere letter to explain (Thats all, they will not help any further)<br><br>Take care and under SAF policy u need to clock at least 20 schooling hours per week from local uni in order to get a deferment<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi there, im currently taking up a course in PSB while my gf is in SIM-RMIT(econ &amp;finance). From what i've heard about SIM is that they have no Tutorials and its lectures 5 days a week. i would say this is system is meant for students who are more independent and have the time to really revise and mug for their exams.Really, not for slackers.<br><br>As for psb academy, the system is rather slack haha. Most lecturers are nice and the school,whether its payment,deferment,enrolment etc.  is rather flexible *cough*(as long u have $$) *cough* . anything pretty much goes your way. class size can range from 20-60. so lecturers and tutorians can cater to the needs of students individually during or after class (unless its sloppy lecturers).<br><br>anyway in terms of Ranking of Priv . schools, i'm not sure which school reigns against one another? from what i've heard is PSB but could anyone enlighthen me on this one? imo in singapore SIM's name is more familiar to most people. prolly due to higher advertising stunts and word of mouth? sometimes people ask me where i'm currently having my education @ and i go like "psb" and they are like "huh?". <br><br>Anyway in terms of  school's outlook SIM looks more like a CAMPUS then PSB tiong bahru.which looks like a primary school(which it was). thats why..............................................no "HEY GORGEOUS" PSB =(.<br><br>anyway i hope u'll make the correct choices in whatever lies ahead. good luck =)<br><br><br></p></div>
