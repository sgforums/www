            <div class='col-md body'>Just curious, do you mean to say that you have migrated there or are you just studying there?<br><br>If its the former, and if you have only been there for a short time, I can only say that the feeling will change. Slowly you will come to realize how different the environment (both physical and mental) is from Singapore, and most of the difference will be pleasant. You will come to appreciate the fact that you have the opportunity to do what, like TheNatureWitch said, so many many other people dream of doing.<br><br>Then, I think 2 things might happen.<br><br>1) You will realize that your loyalties and love towards somewhere that you have called home will change, and it will confuse, bewilder and scare you, because you do not want to be forced to choose like this, for whatever reasons.<br><br>2) You will realize that its what you really wanted anyway, and your feelings for somewhere that you have called home have diminished so much because you find that there is so little to offer other than the odd plate of cha kway teow that you will think little of staying in that new country.<br><br>Still, there is much to be enjoyed, and no point worrying so much. Or perhaps you have discovered that already?<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 30 January 2000).]</div>

York U...<br><br>Being in another country exposes you to things you might not have experienced before.<br>Different people, exotic food, liberalism... a culture shock! There's no parental control, no stress, no rat race, no pressure to conform to the norms of the Singaporean society!! At least not while you're here......And you get financing from back home!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Hey, life's one big party here!!! Studying here is like nothing compared to home!<br><br>Personally, I think I made a choice when I chose to come here, so I'll grind my teeth &amp; bear with it, even if life sucks here, which doesn't! Can't really blame anyone, u know... Sure, missing home is inevitable at times, but you'll get over it soon. Why dwell on it when you can have such a great time here? It's all gonna be over too fast, too soon!<br><br>Youth is our best assets now, this is our chance to expand our horizons, see the world &amp; soak in other cultures....<br><br>So...everyone, bring out the booze, get the party going &amp; here's to more good times while we're overseas!!! Cheers!<br><br>Oh, another thing, Swatch, you're in a country where others voted as the best place to live in the world, so life can't be that bad, eh?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i made my choice to come to singaproe and stay here by myself 7 years ago.  I dun even have any family or old friends here.<br><br>Obviously there is a feeeling of longing for nostalgic things such as home and hearth.  Living by yourself is not easy when you have no family around. Just having them in the same city as you or even int he same country is more comforting than havingthem live thousands of miles away....same for friends...<br><br>In this 7 years, I've been to visit once anfd that's it because i dun have the cpital to visit more often.  It's sad but my choice my loss and my gain.<br><br>I love it in singapore and i dun complain. I have onli good things to say about being here and thank God and everybody else for being able to stay here even though most people here think i am silly for choosing singapore over my own country...(usa).<br><br>It's a great opportunity when u are overseas...and you should feel very priviledge to be there...enjoy it while you can because you're only going to be there for a few years...<br><br>I'm staying here forever! haha</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Swatch&gt;&gt; Think you might have gone to most of the attractions in Toronto by now... Plus now that it's winter, don't think there's much you can do anyway... Go skiing/ snowboard (you probably haven't tried, rite?) Learn to play ice-hockey, skating first if you don't know how... (Hey, it's a Canadian game!) And this you gotta go @ least once -- to a NHL hockey game! Watch the Toronto Maple Leafs in action!! Try catching a musical/play, take the subway, explore the city, check out U of T, visit the ROM &amp; AGO, go to Niagara Falls (not now! Summertime..), check out the Chinese Malls in the suburbs (when I was in Toronto, I hung out @ Eaton's Centre almost everyday, till I found this pretty interesting Ch. mall in Markham/Scarborough), try cooking a meal with your friends, check out the party scene...there's so much to do. Personally, I feel that if you found a group of friends who's of the same frequency as you, it doesn't really matter what you do.<br>It's all in the mentality, u know. Are you hanging out a lot with the S'pore students there? Perhaps it's time to get to know more people...<br><br>Don't complain! Where I'm @, it's a f!@#%$-up university town in AB. where the shops close @ 5pm! (Good hint for my sch, eh? Only 3 here.) Pple here are either in the Uni or college or retirees.... Not that the sch is bad, but the town really is...<br><br></div>
