Generally that's what they mean by stock options, but I guessed too this thread could be about Options.<br><br>Erm....by the way, for more experienced people, please don't discourage new people. Everyone can learn, and eventually can be experienced too, if not more.<br><br>So, ok, when u do ur calculations, Im not sure what exactly u r calculating and how u do it, but I think I get the idea what ur problem is.<br><br>The pricings are determined by the market, so it changes all the time. It's not static. And the market may place more, or less, value. So u have a changing value, reflected in changing price. And, options have expiry date, so as time pass, the value of an options decrease. It will be reflected in a decreasing price as well. These reasons will make ur calculations obsolete. I don't know exactly what u r trying to calculate, but u need to keep these changes in mind. That's why when u calculate today, tomorow it won't be the same. So u have to place ur trade soon after u finish calculating. If u delay ur trade, u might need to re-calculate, or use the same calculations but adjust ur trade positions a little.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Be careful of futures,you have to mark them to market daily,will burn if you're not careful.Options are way better,no legal obligation to take delivery unlike futures,where you may have to close your positions.<br><br>I have this advise,something given to me by those in the finance industry.Stay AWAY from derivatives unless you are a professional.Dont be attracted to the leverage alone.Its very mathematical,not something a layman can do.The Black Scholes models has been proven to be flawed,so you need to understand advanced option pricing models just emerging.Also,you need to adjust the pricing to whether the option is American or European.<br><br>Hence,rule no.1=Stay away from derivatives and forex.Leave it to the professional traders to speculate.Only use derivatives for hedging purposes,and not to make additonal cash.<br><br>I think if you wana invest,just got for index funds,since the SIngapore market and the US markets are semi-efficient.</div>
