He couldn't make you happy (well, both of you broke off), then he should give a chance to #2, his good friend a chance to do so.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know two friends of mine which are really good buddies. They hang out together all the time. Then one of them went steady with a girl(my friend also) in the same class as them, then later then broke up and the girl went steady with the second guy. Then they broke up again. Now they are still great buddies and still hang out together. This shows that true friendships can't be affected so easily.<br><br>I also know another bunch which is my classmates(4 or 5) were all infatuated with one girl. The girl, according to them was really chio and mesmerising, but the girl just looks ah lian to me. When the girl went steady with one of them, the whole bunch of them quarelled. Only the girl's bf and one other guy became really angry with each other. They became like enemies and would not want to meet each other. During gatherings, either one would be absent. Then later the couple broke up again and the other guy msg her every day and night and after some time she say she also like him but was hurt to start another relationship now. She then ask him to forget her. Then my friend ah can't forget her ah and was so sad that he can't study and stayed back for another semester. sad case. All because of one girl.<br><br>Another guy friend of mine, broke up with his gf at around march. He can't forget her and always msg her. Then he say got some cds with her and can they meet up to collect it. You know how she reply? She say NO and that she will go post office and send the parcel over by mail. When they broke up, she gave no reason for why she wanna break off. He wanted to know why? But she always reply with DON"T KNOW!!!! He very very sad and then he went to sign up for volunteerism to go to East Timor to WEI CHI HE PING. I asked him why and he say he wanna go there so that he will not think of her. I told him that he was wrong, he would think of her whenever he is alone. He say he just couldn't take it anymore. On the night B4 he flew, he sms her to ask her to meet him but she say NO. He ask him to go back home and then call her. I heard from another friend of mine that his voice sounded really sad before he left. That means must be BAD NEWS lor. Too bad, she wouldn't go back to him.<br><br>Wah, i talk so much ah, pls forgive me for my LohSohNess.<br>Why my friends all like that one, so problematic???<br><br></div>
