Smoking is very often the main cause of cancer.<br><br>It kills us silently and drains money from us quietly.  ThereÂ’re 4,000 harmful chemicals (though in diluted form) in one stick of cigarette.

Food that is low in fibre : Our body needs 25gm of both soluble &amp; insoluble fibre daily.  We must drink at least 1.5 litres of plain water a day.<br><br>h.

There is information on<br><br>* What staging is<br>* Why staging is important<br>* Staging systems<br>* The TNM system<br>* Number systems<br><br>What staging is<br><br>Staging is a way of recording the size of a tumour and how far it has grown.  When doctors first diagnose a cancer, they will carry out tests to investigate the extent of the cancer locally and to see whether it has spread to another part of the body from where it started.<br><br>Why staging is important<br><br>Staging is important because it usually tells the specialist whichreatments you need.  If a cancer is just in one place, then a local treatment such as surgery or radiotherapy could be enough to get rid of it completely.  A local treatment treats only part of the body.<br><br>If a cancer has spread, then local treatment alone will not be enough.  A 'systemic' treatment will be needed as well.  Systemic means treating the whole body.  Chemotherapy and hormone therapy are systemic treatments because they circulate throughout the body in the bloodstream.<br><br>Sometimes doctors aren't sure if a cancer has spread to another part of the body or not.  They look at the lymph nodes near to the cancer.  If there are cancer cells in these nodes, it is a sign that the cancer has begun to spread.  Your doctor may say you have 'positive lymph nodes'.  The cells have broken away from the original tumour and travelled as far as the lymph nodes.  But we can't always tell if they've got any further.  In this situation, doctors usually suggest 'adjuvant' treatment.  This means treatment alongside the treatment for the main primary tumour.  The aim is to kill any cancer cells that have broken away from the primary tumour.  Adjuvant treatments are always systemic.<br><br>Staging systems<br><br>There are staging systems worked out for most types of cancer.  The systems are there so that<br><br>* Doctors have a common language to describe tumours<br>* Treatment results can be accurately compared between tumours<br>* Guidelines for treatment can be standardised between different treatment centres<br><br>There are two main types of staging systems used by doctors. The TNM system and number systems.<br><br>The 'TNM' staging system<br>'TNM' stands for Tumour, Node, Metastasis.  This system can describe the size of a primary tumour, whether there are lymph nodes with cancer cells in them and whether the cancer has spread to a different part of the body.  The system uses numbers to describe the cancer<br><br>* 'T' can be 1-4, with '1' being a small tumour and '4' a large one<br>* 'N' can be 0-3 with '0' meaning no positive lymph nodes and '3' many positive nodes<br>* 'M' is either 0 or 1 with '0' meaning no spread and '1' meaning that there is spread<br><br>Number systems<br><br>These usually have a scale of 1-4 (or sometimes A-D). '1' typically means a small tumour with no spread and no positive lymph nodes.  '4' would mean that the cancer had spread to other major organs in the body.</div>

They look at the lymph nodes near to the cancer.  If there are cancer cells in these nodes, it is a sign that the cancer has begun to spread.  Your doctor may say you have 'positive lymph nodes'.  The cells have broken away from the original tumour and travelled as far as the lymph nodes.  But we can't always tell if they've got any further.  In this situation, doctors usually suggest 'adjuvant' treatment.  This means treatment alongside the treatment for the main primary tumour.  The aim is to kill any cancer cells that have broken away from the primary tumour.  Adjuvant treatments are always systemic.<br><br>Staging systems<br><br>There are staging systems worked out for most types of cancer.  The systems are there so that<br><br>* Doctors have a common language to describe tumours<br>* Treatment results can be accurately compared between tumours<br>* Guidelines for treatment can be standardised between different treatment centres<br><br>There are two main types of staging systems used by doctors. The TNM system and number systems.<br><br>The 'TNM' staging system<br>'TNM' stands for Tumour, Node, Metastasis.  This system can describe the size of a primary tumour, whether there are lymph nodes with cancer cells in them and whether the cancer has spread to a different part of the body.  The system uses numbers to describe the cancer<br><br>* 'T' can be 1-4, with '1' being a small tumour and '4' a large one<br>* 'N' can be 0-3 with '0' meaning no positive lymph nodes and '3' many positive nodes<br>* 'M' is either 0 or 1 with '0' meaning no spread and '1' meaning that there is spread<br><br>Number systems<br><br>These usually have a scale of 1-4 (or sometimes A-D). '1' typically means a small tumour with no spread and no positive lymph nodes.  '4' would mean that the cancer had spread to other major organs in the body.</div></blockquote>Colorectal cancer - I think americans use duke staging</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cooked foods (the higher the temperature and the longer the duration, the worse it is) cause carcinogenic mutagenic compounds to be formed. In addition, proteins become denatured into toxic forms, oils and fats have their biochemical structures irreversibly altered and begin storing (all kinds of environmental and industrial) toxins in the body, instead of cleansing and removing toxins, as was the original function (in the raw state).<br><br>On a nutritional and toxicology level, accumulation of toxins due to years of cooked foods results in the body's desperate response as cancer.<br><br>On a genetic level, tumor suppressor genes can shut off and proto-oncogenes get activated into oncogenes. Cell division becomes uncontrolled and cancer results.<br><br>The solution for preventing cancer - change one's diet to a 100% raw diet, as described by Aajonus Vonderplanitz. In practice, in Singapore, this is awfully difficult, so just cut down on cooked and fried foods as much as you can, and replace your diet with raw vegetables (eg. raw avocadoes, raw celeries, raw coconuts, etc) and meat (eg. sashimi, raw eggs) as much as possible.<br><br>If you know someone who already has cancer, and are not responding well to standard medical treatments of radiation therapy and chemotherapy, check out alternative therapies for treating cancer described on my webpage <a href="http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Heart.Of.God/main.htm#Cancer" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br></div>

Smoking is very often the main cause of cancer.<br><br>It kills us silently and drains money from us quietly.  ThereÂ’re 4,000 harmful chemicals (though in diluted form) in one stick of cigarette.  Taking one puff is 600 times worse than inhaling exhaust fumes from vehicles.<br><br>2. 	Some foods that cause cancer is :<br><br>a.	Barbecued Food<br><br>b.	Deep Fried Food<br><br>c.	Overheating Meat<br><br>d.	Food that is high in fat causes our bile to secrete acid that contains a chemical which is a promoter of cancer cells.<br><br>e. 	Food that contains preservatives, too much salt or nitrates, e.g. canned food, salted egg &amp; veggies, sausages, etc.<br><br>f. 	Overnight Rice (where Aflatoxin is accumulated)<br><br>g. 	Food that is low in fibre : Our body needs 25gm of both soluble &amp; insoluble fibre daily.  We must drink at least 1.5 litres of plain water a day.<br><br>h. 	Contaminated Food (e.g. moulded bread causes our body to secrete toxins that may eventually lead to liver cancer in the long run.  Never eat bread that is kept in room temperature for more than 2 days especially in a humid weather.)<br><br>3. 	Types of fat and which is the best?<br><br>Highly Recommended for Health :<br><br>a. 	Olive Oil - It does not absorb in our body.<br><br>b. 	Fish Oil - Omega 3 (contained in NIÂ’s Circulytes) has poly-unsaturated fat.  ItÂ’s good for our brain cells.<br><br>c.	Peanut Oil - It contains Vitamin E.  A small dosage is recommended only.<br><br>4. 	Not Recommended for Health<br><br>a. 	Vegetable Fat - Palm oil is worse than coconut oil.  It is high in cholesterol and highly unsaturated.<br><br>b. 	Coconut Oil - It has saturated fat.<br><br>5. 	Specific Food &amp; Beverages<br><br>a. 	Egg when eaten too much can cause High Colon Cancer, Risk Ovary Cancer, Prostate Cancer.<br><br>b. 	Cabbage is highly recommended for health reason.<br><br>c. 	Tomato is best eaten raw with a bit of olive oil for better absorption.  Other alternative is to take tomato sauce.<br><br>d. 	Coffee is good because it contains 2 anti-oxidants.  Inhale coffee aroma for half each day is equivalent to eating 2 oranges a day.  However, the residue of over-burned coffee is extremely bad for health.  It can cause cancer.<br><br>e. 	Tea, as long as it is in its original tealeaves and not processed into BOH or Lipton packets, it is good for health.  Tea contains 30 anti-oxidants.  Recommended dosage is 2-3 cups a day.<br><br>EXERCISE AND BE FIT<br><br>Have a balanced lifestyle.  Exercise regularly.<br><br>F	: Frequency	     : 3 to 5 times a week.<br>I	: Intensity	     : Exercise till we sweat and breath deeply.<br>T	: Types of exercises	: Find one that suits our age, lifestyleÂ…<br><br>HAVE REGULAR CHECK-UP once we reach the age of 45 &amp; above, it is recommended that we go for regular comprehensive health examination.   Early detection may save lives.<br><br>* * * Pass it on to people you care of their health * * *<br></div></blockquote>where did u get these informations?<br><br>its good stuff u have here, u have any web sites which i can refer to to find out more information?</div>
