            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm.. I find with kids like this<br>it seems best to go on a<br>very patient, calm and firm attitude...<br><br>I had this 8 yr old kid who tried to provoke a reaction<br>by taking off his shorts in class repeatedly and sort of waiting for me to scold him<br>he wears a long tshirt so can't see lah... but when I just ignore him<br>and just keep repeating my request over and over and over again<br><br>"how do you do this sum"<br>"heehee see see! no shorts?"<br>"how do you do this sum? explain to me"<br>"hee look I not wearing shorts!!!"<br>"ya.. ok... now explain to me, how do you do this sum"<br>eventually he stopped this stunt cos he realises it just isn't going to get any reaction from me.<br><br>basically WEAR him down with your non-reactionary attitude. What he wants is to provoke you to a reaction, jus be no-nonsense and repeat over and over again. If he refuses, take a break, do something else, come back, tell him to do it over and over again without raising your voice.<br><br>Cos the moment you raise it, I think it shows to him, you can't handle him.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by A Beautiful Mind:<br><strong>Reminds me of this story......<br><br>[b]Part 1<br>I ever met a 26 year-old aunt from IRC. She looked younger than she actually was, and was surprisingly attractive; taking into consideration she was from IRC. And here I was, thinking all the while that she was just another single left on the shelf. It was only on the day I met her in person (I had known her for donkey's months) that I started to be amazed by what she had told me all along...<br>Over the months that I had known her -- let us call her Jess -- for, I learnt some things about her, naturally. She was a single woman who was somewhat independent and, unlike other women, had few friends. One thing about her was that she was very open-minded. We could talk about anything freely, though I sensed that she would ignore any guy who asks her for sex.<br><br>For quite a few years Jess had been staying alone in a flat, since her elder sister got married (her parents had passed away from what I know). When her sisterÂ’s eight-year-old son hit Primary Two though, he was put into her house. That is what some parents do in order to get their kid closer to school, nothing very surprising about that. However what surprised me were the things that Jess did even after her nephew moved in.<br>Well, here is a little bit of information about what Jess did at home normally. Basically, she liked to feel free and easy. For those who are not familiar with this term, it simply means that most of the time she did not wear a bra, and that her attire was mostly Â‘coolingÂ’. It usually consisted of a spaghetti-strap and shorts or hot pants. If she felt like it, she might even walk around in knickers (shorts-like panties).<br><br>When asked about how she felt about wearing so little, she said it was comfy. "What if people pass by your door and look in?" I ever asked her. "Aye, they just stare...Well, I canÂ’t stop them from staring. Neither do I want to compromise my comfort," she replied. So I dun suppose she would be any different with her nephew around.</strong>[/b]</blockquote>i give u 6/10.
