            <div class='col-md body'>Reminds me of this story......<br><br><strong>Part 1<br>I ever met a 26 year-old aunt from IRC. She looked younger than she actually was, and was surprisingly attractive; taking into consideration she was from IRC. And here I was, thinking all the while that she was just another single left on the shelf. It was only on the day I met her in person (I had known her for donkey's months) that I started to be amazed by what she had told me all along...<br>Over the months that I had known her -- let us call her Jess -- for, I learnt some things about her, naturally. She was a single woman who was somewhat independent and, unlike other women, had few friends. One thing about her was that she was very open-minded. We could talk about anything freely, though I sensed that she would ignore any guy who asks her for sex.<br><br>For quite a few years Jess had been staying alone in a flat, since her elder sister got married (her parents had passed away from what I know). When her sisterÂ’s eight-year-old son hit Primary Two though, he was put into her house. That is what some parents do in order to get their kid closer to school, nothing very surprising about that. However what surprised me were the things that Jess did even after her nephew moved in.<br>Well, here is a little bit of information about what Jess did at home normally. Basically, she liked to feel free and easy. For those who are not familiar with this term, it simply means that most of the time she did not wear a bra, and that her attire was mostly Â‘coolingÂ’. It usually consisted of a spaghetti-strap and shorts or hot pants. If she felt like it, she might even walk around in knickers (shorts-like panties).<br><br>When asked about how she felt about wearing so little, she said it was comfy. "What if people pass by your door and look in?" I ever asked her. "Aye, they just stare...Well, I canÂ’t stop them from staring. Neither do I want to compromise my comfort," she replied. So I dun suppose she would be any different with her nephew around.</strong></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><strong>I guess I was right, when she told me over the phone about her nephew's Â‘culture shockÂ’.<br>I refer to the nephew as Yong. Maybe because his parents were so strict towards him all the while, he grew to be timid and, generally, well-behaved. He was also soft-spoken and physically weak.<br><br>When he first moved into JessÂ’ house on a Sunday afternoon, with all his books but without his Playstation, he was notably disappointed. Looking around, he could see no game console or whatever, and he could not reasonably expect there to be much boy stuff around. (He was right, and will soon fall in love with all the women stuff.) After all, his mum had decided to put him there so that he would have nothing to play.<br><br>After his mum left that day, Yong idled in his newly assigned room which was right opposite JessÂ’ bedroom. Although the doors were not really aligned, with a little effort one could look into the opposite room. At six plus in the evening, the room was getting darker. Yong went to the light-switch, andÂ… paused.<br><br>His aunt, Jess, was in her room, but her door was not closed. From where he was, Yong could see his auntÂ’s back view. Her arms were crossed before her. For a fraction of a second, Yong wondered what was happening, when Jess pulled off her spaghetti top.<br><br>In the dim light, her bare back curved as she stretched out a slender arm. Her left nipple came into appearance briefly, before her hand returned with a bra. Fastening the hook behind her, she tossed her hair slightly. Soon, a blue top stretched down over her back, and Yong lost sight of the black strap on her back. Quickly, Yong hid behind his door.<br><br>His heart was beating fast as a bass-drum. He pressed his back against the wall, as Jess walked out of her room pass his door, for fear of being seen. He felt his cheeks becoming warm as he recalled the scene earlier on. Such a thing would not have happened back at home. In fact, at home he had only ever caught glimpses of his mumÂ’s underwear, and he had never seen his mum wearing less than a T-shirt and shorts.<br><br>When Jess returned home later with their dinner, she noticed the tension on YongÂ’s face, and asked him about it. Â“UhÂ… IÂ…Â” the boy mumbled. Â“DonÂ’t worry about it ok? You will get used to staying here,Â” Jess said, Â“Oh, and by the way I heard from your mummy that sheÂ’s very strict with you. But donÂ’t worry, IÂ’m not like her.Â” Jess was not aware at that time that Yong had seen her changing, but even if she knew she would not be too bothered. This was to become evident soon.<br><br>Even though Jess did not usually stay in her outing clothes and bra after reaching home, that evening she did not bother until she was done with preparing the boyÂ’s room, after which she went to take a shower.</strong></div>
