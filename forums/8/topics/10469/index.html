            <div class='col-md body'>Jason, as per our agreement, you were to remove not just Tet's picture but all pictures of forum memebrs.<br><br>I also understand that you are doing thia as a favor to me and not to the members. That's fine with me as long as they are removed. But this will not fix the feelings that members have here.<br><br>I will pretend that I didn't read that you would refuse to remove the fotos.<br><br>I also gave you some advice on how to sove the problem. i thot it was sensible advice. Very practical, But apparently your post in another thread doesn't do anythign but make even more ppl angry. Instead of trying to solve the problem and get things right, you are provoking more ppl. All there was to do was to respond to questions that ppl had, not defend yourself or compound the problem by pointing fingers and shifting blame/responsibilities. The more you defend yourself, the worse your reputation will get.<br><br>Your post also made it out to be that I was to be held responsible. I admit that I am responsible for those fotographs and take those responsibilties very seriously. I am trying to remedy that situation now. But I also don't like to be made to look like I was  soley responsible for it, because I did highlight to you on more than one occasion to not post pictures of ppl up from the forum.<br><br>Even still, users have the right, legally or otherwise, to decide when and where their pictures can or will be posted.<br><br>You have told me that it will be done by the weekend latest. i shall wait for the weekedend to roll by then. We'll see wat happens.<br><br>Also, please leave someone (you know who it is, I won't say the name)out of this. I hear that you're trying to make that person feel guilty. That is really low class. You have a problem you deal with it. Don't go and point fingers at ppl with the intention to cause them hurt. I'm really losing my patience here. youre problem is a result of your own doing or undoing and the company that you keep. You may manage to make other feel bad but don't think that it will work with us (u know who we are) just because we are diplomatic with you. We afford you professionalism in our dealings with you adn would expect the same with your dealings with us and forum  members.<br><br>From a personal view, I don't like this emotional manipulation game that you're playing with all of us...ESPECIALLY WITH THAT SOMEONE! Don't make it out (implied or otherwise)that your dissapointment is a result of anyone but urself and your moderators which may or may not include your GF. I don't know who they are, but be careful of who you are trying to manipulate into feeling guilty. I hope you hope, and should think, that you understand what I am trying to say on this issue jason.<br><br>I have more to say, but I will leave it at this for the moment unless something else transpires.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jason,<br><br>Thanks for your reply to me on ICQ.  There are a couple things that made me very upset.<br><br>You mentioned that my views are twisted?  How twisted? Did I put words in your mouth or did I just misunderstood your intention?  Please explain.<br><br>You also mentioned that your conscience is clear, but mine is not.  Why is your conscience clear?  Because you have posted a forumitie's picture up and used it to gain traffic to your site?  Is she not being use by you?  That you lied about her not showing her unhappiness about her picture being posted? That  you called her petty when she asked you nicely to remove the pictures?  That you have placed the blame on firewire? That you have betrayed a friend?  That you have made them doubt your character?  That you are bias because of your relationship with FireIce.  That you have too much pride to admit you are wrong?<br><br>And why should I have a unclear conscience? Because I speak up for what I believe is correct? Because I didn't defend you and you are my friend? Because I have caused you grief by speaking up?  As mentioned before, part of a real friendship is not only to be there to pat your friend on the back when they do something good, but also to point out mistake they have made and guide them to the correct path.<br><br>You are indeed running away from this problem. You choose not to reply to the forumites' requests and you choose to ignore.  Isn't it running away?<br><br>And please, #sgclub is just a place for chatters to chat.  I would appreciate it if you just go there to chat and not do your spying or cursing there.  Show some dignity.  If you go there, don't hide under another nick and tell me that you are just stumbled into the channel and act as if you were some newbie.  I believe you have did this to tet as level54 also?  If you have the intention to solve this problem you would have answer the questions that are out in the forum, why do you have to do such lowly act?  I will assume you have no intention to solve the problem at all.  If you have the time to call firewire, ngkaihoe, and explain/talk to me then you will have the time to reply in this forum.  I am sure firewire and ngkaihoe can do without your phone call to them and wish you could have used your precious time replying to the forumites.  For, I know I can surely do without that chat with you last nite.<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...sting like a bee...<br><br>join me @ #sgclub</div>
