            <div class='col-md body'>goodbookmarks is spouting nonsense as usual,<br>look at his definition of hacking, and you<br>will know. The hilarious part is that he is<br>asking a hacker (moi) not to speak on hacking<br>if I do not know anything.<br><br>That is funny, considering that I am a<br>hacker, and I do not hack other people's<br>firewall or login to other people's system.<br><br>Hacking is purely to see where in the source<br>code of telnet daemon for example, is a<br>potential for buffer overflow attacks. Or<br>whether port forwarding of port 25 requests<br>to a sendmail MTA is fatal, or even qmail<br>should be used instead of sendmail. How can<br>Solaris be made operationally transparent to<br>Linux, Tru64 Unix or even Windows NT. How<br>can changing the scheduling policy of Linux<br>improve/change the time needed to run a<br>repoirtre of tasks.<br><br>I suggest you shut up about what hacking is.<br>I live as a hacker, sleep as a hacker,<br>breathe as a hacker. So do not ask a hacker<br>whether he knows what a hacker is.<br><br>And even if we talk about cracking, the stuff<br>you mentioned is not the only job that a<br>cracker does. A cracker is simply someone<br>who uses his skills in malicious ways. A<br>cracker does more than just that.<br><br>The history of professional hacking stems<br>back to as far back to MIT AI Labs during<br>Richard Stallman time. Go on the net and<br>search for Richard Stallman, Linus Torvalds<br>or Eric S. Raymond to even understand what<br>the hell is hacking and its history.<br><br>And last but not least, shut your mouth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah...I vote Bangster as President in the next general elections!!!!!! :-) set up cameras all over Singapore!!!  hahahah:-)<br><br>ok I wanted to say that we can't compare hacking with breaking into houses....I feel that it shouldn't be such a comparison....but if there MUST be this kind of comparison, then let it be like this:<br><br>hacking is akin to a guy who knows how to make and design locks on houses (or make a better house)and they are always on a move to find different types of locks (or houses)so that they can create a better lock(or house)....let's say that if your lock somehow gets broken by bad workmanship(faulty/buggy software), then these guys are the ones you want to really employ to make sure that you can get back into your house and it's contents...They have a keen knowledge of how these locks and houses are built, the theory behind it's construction, the different ways they are built and the different ways to by-pass these locks.  I would like to think that they are people who see problems and can't sleep until they can somehow find a solution to that problem..and because the IT indstry is so intertwined, a person cannot just sit back and improve his system only as he has to communicate with and exchange with other systems, so it is beneficial for him and everyone if he/she can develope the best lock/structure possible for the house or best solution for the problem in and for the software...<br><br>Crackers are the guys who break the locks to get something or do something maliscious like stealing/robbing/wreaking havok...I guess they can be compared to bad contractors who like to skimp on materials while contructing and thus makes the house/structure very weak and easily prone to break downs or problems...so that they can save $$$.<br><br>I guess the difference between the two would have to be that one builds for himself and ultimately for others while the other breaks or cheats while building for his own gains....just a simplified summary in easy to understand comparisons...I hope that it is to everyones approval as I am not that knowledgable myself on the subject.<br><br>One final thing is that it is really difficult to make comparisons between what happens in the real world and what happens in cyberspace...the ether...<br><br>What we do in life, may not mean that the same rules apply inside this ether.  It's a very complicated and complex thing to explain...someone far better than me would have to do it....FADINGSTAR where are you!!!??????<br>...or someone in the industry woul have to explain it...I'm onli a designer...not my field.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>where the law is concerned in singapore, most sentences meted out are heavy nut only to deter similar offences to happen again.  hacking itself is not such a serious crime but they have to learn to respect others' intellectual property.<br><br>juz compare the crime rate here and the US.  somehow you juz feel that sense of safety and security here.<br><br>------------------<br>the good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From Diecovery Online:<br><br>cracker n. One who breaks security on a system. Coined by hackers in defense against journalistic misuse of the term "hacker." The term "cracker" reflects a strong revulsion at the theft and vandalism perpetrated by cracking rings. There is far less overlap between hackerdom and crackerdom than most would suspect.<br><br>hacker n. 1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities. 2. One who programs enthusiastically. 3. A person who is good at programming quickly. 4. An expert at a particular program, as in 'a Unix hacker'. 5. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive information by poking around. The correct term for this sense is "cracker."<br><br>Let close this topic.  We still get the same views as in the press.  Nothing new.  Let see how they managed to catch all hackers.  Please don't just pick on Singapore hackers, do somthing global, international, regional.<br><br>May the best win.<br><br></div>
