            <div class='col-md body'>well actualli the newspapers all labelled a person going into some other pc without the proper authorisation is hacking! well there are phreaker hacker n cracker. the ones dat mess things up when they enter a "house" is a cracker n a hacker is some1 who enter n observe but they aint going around pissing all over ur hse or smashing ur furniture! n the so called hackers reported in the news lately well if im not mistaken they are juz doing a brutal hacking n when they manage to get the correct passwrd n username they juz got to tell somebody(in this case the revamped the whole site). well hackers haf a couple of rules n 1 of them is come in see no touch.<br>its better ppl out there (esp the reporters) noes how to differentiate between hackers n crackers. cos i realli don tink they like us to call a photographer a reporter too rite? if they insist to use the word hackers on all computer crimes than we can call the man who send u the newspaper in the morning a reporter as well!!<br>oh by the way im not a hacker like ngkaihoe, im juz an observer dats all.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>NAME IS BosS , HugOBosS !</div>

Please let me in."<br><br>Would you like that?<br><br><strong>2nd Situation</strong><br>Let's say that hacking into someone's computer/server/system without doing damage is legal.<br><br>Just think, if prisoners were allow to walk around the prison, without being locked up is allowed, as long as they don't run away.<br><br>Can you ensure that no one will run away?<br>Surely got people run away one right?<br><br>The prisoner can walk right to the door, no one will stop him, cos. it's allowed. He just idle around there, then suddenly, he runs away.<br><br>This goes for hacking too. If hacking is allowed, but no damage must be done, then the hacker can lurk around the system, look for the most important portion, set a "time-bomb" there, and run away.<br><br>------------------<br><a href="http://www.goodbookmarks.com" rel="nofollow">Goodbookmarks.com</a> - Daily updates of good and honest website, plus a daily joke!<br><a href="http://www.goodbookmarks.com/Submit_URL/submit_url.html" rel="nofollow">Submit Your Site Now!</a><br><br>[This message has been edited by goodbookmarks (edited 24-12-1999).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by goodbookmarks (edited 24-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the bottom line is not whether you hack or crack, or whether you touch anything or not. Unless you are specifically given permission, the bottom line is that gaining acess into someone's system/server should not  be right. It is illegal, similar to property trespassing. If you really want to analyse a system by hacking, then you jolly well set up your own network and do it.<br>Right now, the internet is advancing so rapidly, and if you dun come down hard on such hackers, things will only get worse.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Quote from -  Howard Rheingold: The Accidental History of the Net -<br><br>'Licklider knew there was a whole subculture of unorthodox programming geniuses clustered at the new Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at MIT and graphics geniuses like Ivan Sutherland at Lincoln. There were others around the country, chafing to get their hands on the kind of computing resources that didn't exist in the punched card and mainframe era. They wanted to reinvent computing; the computer industry giants and the mainstream of computer science weren't interested in reinventing computing. So Licklider and his successors at ARPA, Robert Taylor and Ivan Sutherland (both in their twenties), started funding the young hackers--the original hackers, as chronicled in Steven Levy's book Hackers, not the ones who break into computer systems today. They also funded Engelbart, whose Augmentation Research Center (ARC) at Stanford Research Institute lasted for more than a decade and created the first word processors, conferencing systems, hypertext systems, mouse pointing devices, mixed video and computer communications--the technical foundation for half a dozen of the biggest high-tech industries today. When the first ARPANET went online, Engelbart's ARC was the original network information center that centralized all information gathering and record keeping about the state of the network.<br><br>Among the original hackers at MIT, the ones who helped invent time-sharing, the hacker ethic was that computer tools ought to be free. The first personal-computer makers were outraged when William Gates, now the richest man in America, started selling BASIC, which PC hobbyists had always passed around for free. The software industry exists now and Microsoft is bigger than General Motors, but the Net continues to grow because of intellectual property that skilled programmers have given to the Net community. Again and again, programmers have created and given to the Net powerful tools that have changed the nature of the Net and expanded its availability. At the grassroots level, in the world of BBSs outside the Net, the key programs that make amateur CMC via modem possible were also distributed for free or at little cost.'<br><br>That's some contributions and the original spirit of hacking.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ngkaihoe, what you toking?<br><br>Get paid to hack? That means they got PERMISSION to hack.<br><br>But now, we're toking about hacking WITHOUT permission.<br><br><strong>Summary</strong><br>Hacking into other people's system/server/computer WITHOUT permission should be illegal.<br><br>If someone wants to become a kind hacker, he can ASK for permission to hack first.<br><br>If you guys are saying that hacking WITHOUT permission into other people's computer/server/system for educational/practice should be legal, think again.<br><br>Let's say someone wants to be a "house-checker", checks for loopholes in people's house. And breaking into someone's house WITHOUT permission for kind intentions is legal, then you're giving potential burglars have a chance to practice how to break into a house!<br><br>Someone who wants to be a burglar can break into your house, when he's caught, he says, "I'm here for practice to become a house-checker."<br><br>Then after sometime, he becomes familiar with all that house-stuffs, he can become professional and break into people's house for bad intentions more easily!<br><br>So if you want to become a hacker, get a license or something!<br><br><strong>And</strong> why should other people let hackers practice on their servers? People shiok wat, dun let you practice leh.<br><br>DUH!<br><br>kekekekekeke<br><br>------------------<br><a href="http://www.goodbookmarks.com" rel="nofollow">Goodbookmarks.com</a> - Daily updates of good and honest website, plus a daily joke!<br><a href="http://www.goodbookmarks.com/Submit_URL/submit_url.html" rel="nofollow">Submit Your Site Now!</a><br><br>[This message has been edited by goodbookmarks (edited 24-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ngkaihoe, you're the one who dunno about cracking and hacking.<br><br>Let me explain.<br><br><strong>Cracking</strong><br>It means you alter a software. Example: An FTP software has a 30 day evaluation period. After 30-days, the FTP software cannot function anymore. And so you "crack" it, and make it functional even after 30 days.<br><br>I've learned cracking before, so I know.<br><br><strong>Hacking</strong><br>You get pass a server/system/computer's firewall or any security shit and get access to it. Once you're in there, you can do things (bad or good) to the server/system/computer.<br><br>Please ngkaihoe, if you dunno, please dun say.<br><br>------------------<br><a href="http://www.goodbookmarks.com" rel="nofollow">Goodbookmarks.com</a> - Daily updates of good and honest website, plus a daily joke!<br><a href="http://www.goodbookmarks.com/Submit_URL/submit_url.html" rel="nofollow">Submit Your Site Now!</a><br></div>
