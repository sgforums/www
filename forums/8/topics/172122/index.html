            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I have a problem here concerning my good friend. Hope someone can enlighten me. Thanks! =)<br><br>Recently, my good friend ran into some financial difficulties and needed cash immediately. He didn't tell me about it until now, because of pride.<br><br>Anyway, my only consolation is he didn't resort to borrowing from Ah Long San (or maybe he didn't know any). He chanced upon a Singnet advertisement online recently. Sign up for a 36mth broadband and get a laptop free. He signed up immediately with no intention of paying the monthly subscription fees and a week later, he got the laptop. He sold the laptop for $1,200. I calculated for him how much 'interest' he had to pay by signing up for the broadband service (which he doesn't need). That'll be $88/mth x 36 = $3,168. That's a 40% 'interest'!<br><br>But now, the real problem is he doesn't have the means to pay the $88/mth subscription fees as he's working as a hawker earning on $700+ per mth with a wife and 2mths old baby boy.<br><br>I want to enquire, if he doesn't pay up, how will Singtel make him pay and can they take him to court if he really refuses to pay a single cent? I hope someone who has knowledge in this area enlighten me. Thnx.<br><br>Happy New Year!</div>
