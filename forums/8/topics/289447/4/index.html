            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gedanken:</div><div class="quote_body">Fair comment, all of it.  Quartz watches are certainly more accurate than mechanical watches; chronometer standards for automatic movements are -4 to +6 seconds every 24 hours, and cheap quartz watches can easily exceed those standards.  However, as you've noted, automatic watches do have their allure, and high-end watch collectors tend to go for those on account of the higher manufacturing standards required.<br><br>As for the alignment issue, it's a matter of manufacturing quality, and TAG, unfortunately, is not known for that.  I'm not too impressed with their servicing standards either.  One of my fellow watch collectors took a chanceon a TAG, and when he sent it for service, they poliched the case till it was completely out of shape - he raised the roof and they finally changed the case on the watch two months later.<br><br>That's one of the key areas in which you'll find a difference between lightweights like TAG and serious players like Rolex.  When I send my Rolexes in for service, what I get back is a virtually brand-new watch with a one-year warranty.<br><br>Anyway, I've noted that snobbish started the thread with the issue about matching the watch with the outfit.  I think my watches do a more than adequate job in this respect:<br><br>It's not just suits that they go well with, either:<br><br></div></blockquote>Hello Ged ! Nong Time No See Aye ! Hopes everything doing well back in down under !<br><br>I share my sentiments with regards to the Tag Heuer Service Center here. Couple of months back, my gf sent in her Kirium for servicing. I personally seen her Kirium and there was no scuffing or deep scratches on the watch. She only wears it to work and takes it off during work.<br><br>When the watch was returned to us, she literally fainted as the watch casing had a one hell of a deep scratch enough for me to feel it with my fingers. She nearly wasted the whole staff there and the manager offered to redo the polishing. Only to return the watch to us overly polished *sigh*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>She has another Zenith which she sworn that she will not bring in for servicing there..Any 3rd party to recommend ?<br><br></div>

Be advised, though, that it's a very chunky watch, so if you're not into oversized watches it won't be your thing.  Within IWC's price bracket (and they're nowhere near Patek), have a look at Zenith for good value as well.<br><br>Now, I don't know about dream watches - the best definition is the next one I'm going to get.  With the US dollar so weak against the Australian dollar, my next one ought to be the Rolex 116710 within the next few months:<br><br>I'd love to get my hands on one of these Comex Subs, but seeing as how there are only 120 of them worldwide, they come at a premium - my mate paid $55,000 for this one:<br><br>In the meantime, though, my humble collection stands at:<br><br>As for TAG-Heuer, they're a complete waste of money.  Pathetically poor rework on run-of-the-mill ETA movements, and their service is even worse - to anybody who knows the first thing about watches, TAG says you care more about the badge than the watch.  I wouldn't touch them with a barge pole.  If you're in that price bracket, look at Oris instead - they make much better watches for a slightly lower price than TAG.<br><br>As for Franck Muller, my God, what a waste of time - pun intended.  Crazy Hours is completely useless - if you wanted complications, look at Patek Philippe, JLC or even<strong> the good old Sinn 156. </strong><br><br>Just a tip - if you give half a damn, forget quartz.</blockquote>Nice to hear that you mentioned the Sinn 156 =) *thumbs Up*</div>
