            <div class='col-md body'>The term monism was first used by Christian Wolff in his discussions of the mind-body problem to depict both philosophers who would only acknowledge the mind (idealism or mentalism) and philosophers who only acknowledged the body (materialism). The meaning Wolff originally intended by using the term has broadened in scope through the centuries, and today applies to any doctrine or theory that claims that all things, no matter how many or of what variety, can be reduced to one unified thing in time, space, or quality. Monistic philosophers including Parmenides, Democritus, Spinoza, Berkeley, Hume, Hegel, and proponents of contemporary atomic theory. The denial of monism forces commitment to either dualism or pluralism.<br><br>The term "Dualism" was originally coined by Thomas Hyde around the beginning of the eighteenth century. As a metaphysical theory, dualism states that the world is made up of two elemental categories which are incommensurable. This includes distinctions between mind and body, good and evil, universal and particular, and phenomena and noumena. Dualism contends you must have both of the two components in question, rather than one or the other. In contrast to dualism two other philosophical positions concerned with the number of substances: monism and pluralism. Monism is the view that there is one elemental whereas pluralism maintains that there are many things which constitute the world.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 11 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Does that apply to other sciences or fields as well? E.g. pathology, because there were lots of arguments in which some people think that a group of diseases are actually different things, with different causes, and vice versa, where lots of conditions once thought to be totally different were found to have the same cause.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Science, philosophy.... sometime i wonder are they crap or not <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> cos for example margarine. Some time ago, researchers say margarine is better than butter cos it has lower fat content. But now they are saying butter is better cos margarine cause cancer.<br>I have been brought up by the notion that sleeping early and waking up early is gd for the body. Then i read an article saying sleeping early, wake early or sleep late wake up late doesn't really matter. Now i read an article saying sleep late wake up late is better........ Will philosophers conclude in the future that death is better than living? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Juz a thought of mind.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MInd and Pacman...<br>I can't definitely say if Science is 100% correct cos research has been continously improved and actually there are a lot of daily products that we use are actually carciogenic but we still use it unknowingly...Just do a simple check at home at your shampoos and toothpastes...or cosmetics and creams...Most of them contains lauryl sulphates, regardless is ammonium or others as well as ethylene glycol. Ethylene glycol actually dries skin instead of mositurising them...actually most glycols are harmful. But ppl keep using just like ppl knows that smoking is cancer causing, they still continue to puff their lives away..so there is no right or wrong in Science..it is more of how you want to lead ur life in the way you want it.<br><br>Though it is being tested that deprivation of sleep has no detrimental to your health,it does lowers your alertness and attentiveness at work. Of cos, your skin might age faster etc etc. But it really depends on individual body system cos some ppl can sleep for just 4 hrs and some 8 hrs..and some ppl have sleeping disorders.Well,,,I did know some stuffs about sleeping disorders and stuffs..so it depends also which sleeping orders u have too<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 11 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I really have to go with Descarte on this one. He's so far been one of the few philosophers who have dealt with monoism and dualism systematically (the logics of which are still debated I know). In "Discourse on Method" and "Meditations on First Philosophy" he spelled out the Carthesian doubt, i.e. chucking our every piece of knowledge and starting from rock bottom in order to develop a proper epistlemological foundation. In doing so he begot "Cogito Ergo Sum". This led him to believe that the essence of being was thinking, and that the mind was separate from the body - hence dualism.<br><br>Meditations Two<br>"At this time I admit nothing that is not necessarily true. I am therefore precisely nothing but a thinking thing; that is, a mind, or intellect, or understanding, or reason - words of whose meaning I was previously ignorant. Yet I am a true thing and am truly existing; but what kind of thing? I have said it already: a thinking thing."<br><br>However, this indisputable knowledge of oneself was of course solipsitic since he only proved that he existed and not the external world, which of course made him necessary to prove the existence of God.<br><br>I'm not too impressed with the 'philosophy of the mind' school since its not de rigueur philosophy in the truest sense. The psychial and behavioural sciences employed take away from the romance of classical philosophising. However I'll love anyone to challenge me to give Philosophy of the Mind account.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Terence (edited 12 January 2000).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by Terence (edited 12 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just to siddetrack a bit. not trying to defend myself too, but maybe add on a bit to what isaid. i think if you want to talk about why we use a thermometer to measure heat. it's not because we were taught to use thermometer in that way. it's because you can't see heat with the naked way. and we know that heat makes things expand. and not cold that make thing contract, but the absence of energy in the form of heat.  you can't create something out of nothing. only a divine persona, such as God can. as in the case of fire. fire is created by the burning of energy found in whatever it is consuming/combusting, eg. wood. it is the conversion of stored engergy to light and heat. it is not the absorption of engergy from it's surrounding.  hope it clears the air a bit.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmmm though some of u dun think so but i think philosophy is still pretty much errr crap. Lets juz bear in mind those philosophers are humans like all of us here. Why should we follow what they think. We should have our own unique and personalised thought of sch. Who knows u might one day be called upon as a philosopher by the future generations. And i do question some of the things those so called philosophers concluded. Yah, my policy: think simple! No need to complicate the issues with various philosophy, juz bearing in mind all of us are humans, basically we think in more or less the same way. Put urself in his/her shoe and u get the pt.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mind,<br><br>You are seriously misguided, and you<br>probably have no understanding of philosophy.<br><br>The purpose of philosophy is never to provide<br>any answer, but to provide questions. No<br>philosophers in their right minds, would ask<br>you to accept what they have concluded<br>wholesale without thinking.<br><br>But yet, the more interesting question is<br>whether you have seen that questions are<br>more interesting than answers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh crap....<br><br>this is the kinda thing i'll be studying in the future? looks interesting, but scares the heck outta me.<br><br>now for my thoughts, hope i don't make a fool of myself.<br><br>if i understand the question and the key terms correctly, and going by my philosophically untrained thought process, i have to go with dualism.<br><br>Dunno whether i'm on the right track, but i recall reading something abt Plato who talked abt forms and ideas. I suppose in this way it is analogous with body and mind.<br>What we see is the "form" but our memories would go with "ideas". In this way, "what is" would differed with "what should be".<br><br>Therefore i would be inclined to believe in dualism, because i perceive that the univerese is indeed made up of 2 things: "material" as well as "ideal".<br><br>hope i haven't wasted anyone's time.<br><br>terence&gt; sorry for a late reply, been busy job hunting. anyway, i applied for Leeds, Warwick, Birmingham for philosophy/computing.<br>and Leeds, Kings, Bristol for philo/physics.<br><br>as you can see, i'm doing a joint degree scheme, that's mainly because my parents (and myself) feel that philosophy is not very marketable (i mean, what can u do with a philo degree besides academia??).<br><br>what are your opinions (on my choice of unis, my doing a joint degree, and the marketability of a philo degree)?<br><br>thanks.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>and also a side thought, again, not sure if it's relevant.<br><br>would the chicken and egg question imply dualisim or monism?<br><br>if monism&gt; because it is a cause and effect qn, and because "effect" is a result of "cause", therefore monism would stand. hence the single element would be "cause".<br><br>if dualism&gt; then again, who're we to say that cause and effect are not 2 distinct elements? (in a way, it is the chicken and egg qn in itself)<br><br>hmm...<br><br>i seriously think i've gone seriously off-tangent. so sorry...<br><br></div>
