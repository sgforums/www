              <p>Ah Gua can be loosely related to pansies or cowardly pricks?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I read a book entitled Criminal Intent and for all the glorification of past gangs, there are lots of stories revolving betrayals as well. And I think 10 v 1 is perfectly fine because in the end, your intention is to cause harm, what's the point of 1 v 1, no weapons if your existence is against the law in itself. Think DotA and tell me those ganks weren't justified.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think the difference betwene gang members now and then is, those back then are cash strapped and deprived of luxuries, which drove them to do what they did, unlike the gangsters now, who are acting based on faux machoism and deep down, attention.</p>

              <p>With the recent arrests of about 40 people involving in gangs, I asked my <span>CID</span> friend, who happened to be in charge of the whole operation. As what he says, nowadays gangsters are ah guas and sissy, not like those from the old days, where yi chi is still around. Nowadays they only need to capture 1 person and the rest of the people from the same gang will be dragged into the problem (even if they are not involved in the immediate crime). What he means is that you capture 1, he will rat out a few, and the rest will leak out even more of their friends to the police, something like <span>MLM</span>, lol… So do you all agree nowadays gangsters are not only stupid and retarded, but are at the same level as ah guas?</p>
              <p>Based on the evidence so far, I think it’s true. Gangsters = Ah Gua.</p>

              Gary, I think you read MobTwo's comments wrongly. If you check the quote from MobTwo, he was joking about someone's else comment. Someone asked what is yi chi, and the other forumer explained yi chi means camel toes. So MobTwo, based on the fake explanation of yi chi, is joking that the gangsters have camel toes ( instead of human toes ). It's obvious becaus Police won't scared of yi chi (loyalty). But if you see a human being with gigantic real camel toes = monsters, I think most people sure siam, even if you police... Let me copy and paste his comments and the person he quoted also...

The obvious answer is NO NO NO ! Yo Mob Two  have you read any books in the last 10 years ? Are you a school drop out ? What interesting things have you ever done ?  What interesting things have you ever learned ? What interesting things have you ever read ? What heroic things have you ever actually done ? What interesting places have you been ? The answer is NOTHING. You and gangsters like you are all big NOTHINGS that most people consider scum.</p>
