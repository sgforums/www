            <div class='col-md body'>SMU is better in terms of system...imagine a 30% allocation to class participation, this is the real thing where u have to speak up and share your views and now just mugging on notes and hoping to pass the exams and sneak thru ur education.<br><br>To be honest, NUS has become far too diluted with students of all sorts. It has now become like Polytechnics. In the past when i enrolled in Poly Business in Ngee Ann, our minimum cut off point is 12, higher than that, you cant come, for some engineering courses 10 is the highest you can go. But a year or two after i graduate, 28 points for your O levels can qualify you for Mechanical Engineering in Ngee Ann....as with other polys. True, now more pple have chances to further education and from these "28 pointer", there are top students who came out from this group, but the majority is there to get it easier and thus diluting the value of a diploma.<br><br>NUS is in the situation right now...what can you say when a A level student with C C D can get into Arts, like one of my frens sister did? Again, you might get a few outstanding students who may not excel in A levels but excel in NUS, but again majority are there on the easy. Thus, NUS standards get diluted.<br><br>SMU is new so not subjected to such standards, in fact, it has rcv overwhelming applications from students. It is still new and precisely it is new, it can uphold high standards. But lets hope in time to come, it will not become another polytechnic or NUS....<br><br>There is always a place for giving a chance for people to further education and a place for people with real ability.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You're absolutely wrong to think that SMU is plain boring and square cuz it's totally the opposite!
