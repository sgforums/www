I've come across several experiences of seeing elderly men on the buses doing queer things, for example, there's an old man who regularly goes on this bus service I frequently take. Sometimes when I see him on the bus, he's always sitting at the back seat, with his legs sprawled all over the place. He'd be spitting here and there and scolding vulgar words and talking to himself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
