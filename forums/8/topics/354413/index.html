              <p>2 men were put in a giant maze which was riddled with incomprehensible signs and symbols and were told to find the exit.<br>one was a scholar and the other was an uneducated man<br><br>The 2 men were discussing how to get out. When the uneducated man suggested something, the scholar disagreed thinking he is wrong because he was uneducated. The 2 couldnt agree<br>Each of them took a different path to find the exit from their starting point.<br><br>but each time the scholar came to a junction he thought so deeply about the signs and symbols and clues applying his logics, mathematics and academics and was going about in circles<br><br>but each time the uneducated man came to a junction he thought so deeply about his family and how he would get back to support them.<br><br>Finally only one got out first and it was the uneducated man.<br>The inventor of the maze was surprised and asked him how.<br>He said " I do not know how to count or write but<br>He said : i saw a mouse and followed it and it showed me the exit"<br>This has been posted before , but the topic expired. I feel this story is fantastic.</p>
              <p><br>THe inventor then said to the man that " the maze was riddled with incomprehensible symbols which do not have a solution .You had the most simple and perfect solution"<br><br>The reason why the scholar failed is becos<br><br>1)he was so engrossed in his academics that he failed to look at the world and notice the subtle things around him which could guide one in life to a solution<br><br>2) his ego of disapproving another man's words thinking he is inferior had blinded him further<br><br>he reason why the uneducated man suceeded is becos<br><br>1) he was full of love for his family , with attributes which is universal and worldly.<br><br>2) his mind was humble and free from thoughts that would clog an academic's mind to blind him further. His void mind was stimulated to look at the world around him to notice the subtle clues<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Experiment controls:</span></strong></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">The riddles and signs have no meaning</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">The mouse is a control item</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The mouse is a seasoned veteran of the maze or like most animals, it uses its extra sensory capabilies to get in and out of the maze periodically</span></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">The experiment is designed to gauge a specific EQ component in both groups</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">The expereiment is time dependent </span></em></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Implications:</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The maze inventor will not have a maze with symbols making sense and without a mouse with an uneducated man inside as the result is predetermined:<br><br>1)The uneducated man may have never got out</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">2) no guarantee that the scholar can solve all of the riddles and get out even if the riddles have meanings.</span><span style="color: #0000ff;">Even if the scholar gets out, the conclusion of the experiment is also predetermined and no point conducting the experiment</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">3) if both did not get out, the experiment has no conclusion</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">4) Research has shown that all of us have extra sensory capabilities in us but we lose them through formal learning and education</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">5) Animals have extra sensory capabilities not found in humans.</span></p>

              <p>Sometimes, I really dislike such stories. They have the potential to make our society worse off.</p>
              <p>Many youngsters nowadays say things like</p>
              <p>1) Study so hard for what? See so many businessmen earning big bucks all O level grads only. Books also say so. So fail never mind, next time I'm going to set up own business earn big bucks.</p>
              <p>2) Raise up stories like the above, and use it as a reason for them not studying or preparing well for exams.</p>
              <p>3) MLM says easy to earn money, no need any degree, study for what?</p>
              <p>4) things like financial freedom, and how they can achieve it without having a good education from the education system.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They also use all the reasons above to mock and laugh at their peers who are doing much better academically than them. These are things that are happening in Singapore, and has already happened way before now.</p>
              <p>A few of them would go on to succeed in setting up their business, but the majority of them? Now grown up, I know such people regretting not studying harder earlier. Some have problems earning more than $2k take home pay, and after paying bills, are left with very little. Some struggled and attempt to take part time uni degrees so that they will have higher paper qualifications to get a better paying job.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seriously, it pains me to see some people thinking and feeling like
              what I have described. Sure, they can be street smart, set up
              businesses, anything they like. But please,  it's still of utmost importance to
              get a good education.</p>
              <p>So, such stories are not meant for everyone. As with water or fire, these stories can make or break people. Working/studying hard, working/studying smart, and spending within your limits while building your retirement nest prudently is the way to go.</p>

              <p>I think you are wrong bro. Your comparison of the modern world to ancient man makes no sense?</p>
              <p>Education is important, as it almost 100% turns a man useful, in some ways or others.Be it behavior, knowledge, ethics, language, methods of learning to progress further etc.</p>
              <p>If you choose not to study, u will have a 10% chance of becoming successful, provided you have a creative+smart mind and a good chrisma to attract people to assist you.</p>
              <p>But how many out there have a creative mind + chrisma to make things happen?.......</p>

              <p>To WorldlyBusinessman, your story is really thought-provoking but i think the message you are trying to send from it is grossly misintepreted. I believe the inventor of the story meant to remind us that in pursuit of education and better qualifications we should not forget the other things that make us a complete and wise person.</p>
              <p>And yes Newton's discovery of gravity is indirectly caused by an apple but do bear in mind that without his intellectual prowess and education, his observation would be dismissed as a mere myth. Science always starts from observation and hypothesizing, but without formal training and theorizing, these observations remain as unexplained phenomena and not recognized as a scientific discovery.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>YOUR ARE VERY WRONG. Take for example in prehistoric times, when
                                      man was still a ape, he used his instincts so develop tools to
                                      hunt  and make fire. THESE ANCIENT APES WERE NOT EDUCATED
                                      MEN.</p>
              <p>ANCIENT MAN SURVIVED WITHOUT EDUCATION AND DEVELOPED AGRICULTURE
                                      FOR CIVILISATION TO THRIVE.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The above is true, but taken out of context by you. What you should be picking out of this is that Man is adaptable and pick up things through experience and by learning from their environment, they progress and make civilisation possible. Man today has preserved that spirit of learning and discovery and that is precisely why we educate ourselves. Just because we do not go out into the wild and look at trees and birds and make theories out of them, doesnt mean we are not learning. It is because society today has progressed and that much knowledge of the world has been consolidated into books and academic journals. Instead of going through the arduous task of discovering our environment again, sitting in the classroom and browsing the internet for materials is how Man today is educating himself to continue what his predecessors has done for him. I do not deny that many academically inclined individuals lack EQ or being street-smart but that does not render their academic knowledge useless.</p>
              <p>Many of us here have already pointed out that success is not only through the route of being educated as people like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and many other entrepreneurs are not PhD holders or such. But the lessons that should be learnt is that through grit and hard work, anything is possible but it should not imply that education is not important. Look at Mark Zuckerberg. He is a Harvard grad but do you think its his mere education that brought about his success in Facebook? He is a classic example of the educated man with EQ and has achieved success.</p>
              <p>Eagle has correctly pointed out that by slanted the tone of your story and many others that have been taken out of context, have misled many youths today of the importance of education. We are not educated for the sake of it. Besides the practical use to our future work, raising your intellectual level contributes to your ability to recognize and appreciate The Arts and improve other aspects of your life such as graciousness and courtesy. All these contribute to our society improving and creating a better place to live in. More fundamentally, education serves as a signal to potential employees our ability as a worker. Although a rather blunt tool, your education level serves as an approximation to your intellectual capacity and your discipline as a student, all are attributes important of a good worker. And worldlybusinessman in your other post about CCA, my points there are precisely why there is a need for CCA, which is to complement this blunt tool to give a better picture of you as a person for employment. EQ is important, but without the correct IQ to carry it out, it is equally impaired as in IQ without EQ.</p>

              <p>In both case that you have quoted, first of all, we are living in a modern society, not caveman era. We are not even the agricultural era/society. Please do compare apple with apple.</p>
              <p><br>Speaking of apple, it is not Newton used an apple to find gravity, it is through logic and deduction of an educated and scientific mind. If not, apple farmers will be the first to discover the laws of gravity.</p>
              <p><br>Basically as eagle had mentioned, there is no right or wrong. Such stories do make or break pple. We will have to be fair to those who did not achieve academically for it maybe due to circumstances of unable to study or simply do not like to study. But it does not means they're wrong, merely just a different path in life. If it is 20yrs ago, it is still quite a feasible idea not to study so much and just become an businessman. Nowadays, it is simply too tough in SG to do business or even being an employee. The streets are full of grads, local or foreign.</p>

                                      mind, he came up with the equations, and apply it to previous observations like Kepler's Law. And through education of fellow peers and others, he shared his knowledge, where other educated and scientific
                                      minds build upon what Newton has come up with.</p>

              <p>An education is to equip the individual with the knowledge and expertise in which to base his actions upon. It is possible for him to succeed without an education. But he certainly wont succeed with a caveman's skills. A person's work is never purely his own. Our ideas and thinking are influenced by our bethren, which is in turn dictated by the academics through years of experiment and experience. It is possible to apply certain academic theories instinctively without actually knowing them. </p>
              <p>An education does not equate to success; a lack of education does not neccessarily mean failure. A straight A-student without the neccessary strength of character, luck and circumstances might not do very well, whereas an unschooled street-smart urchin might just make it big. Nevertheless, for the advancement of mankind and to improve upon existing practices and theories, an education is important. The fusion of passive learning and active learning, with the believe that things can improve, will fuel mankind's struggle forward.</p>
