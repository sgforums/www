            <div class='col-md body'>Funny, I thought yesterday or this morning someone would post something abt this 'sweet lady' features in Sunday Time? But I did a search of the posts, none..<br><br>Anyone know this 'lady'? Say working in the same company... former sch mate from Hwa Chong JC? Or in the same Combat Medic course during NS?<br><br>******************<br>THE only giveaways are her large hands and the hint of an Adam's apple.<br><br>A DIFFERENT BREED: Apart from knowing that she was not gay, Leona did not know how she was different - until she was 15 and found a book on transsexuals - Cries In The Dark - at the library.<br>Otherwise Leona Lo, who was born Leonard Lo, is a 1.71 metre tall, leggy woman with a penchant for short, shoulder-baring dresses.<br><br>The 27-year-old corporate communications assistant manager is, to date, the first Singaporean transsexual woman to fling off the mantle of secrecy surrounding men who become women through surgery, by writing a book on the subject.<br><br>My Sisters, Their Stories, which was launched yesterday by Miss Lo at the MPH bookstore at Parkway Parade, is both a visual feast and a mind-opener.<br><br>The 96-page coffee-table book features 13 trans- sexual women, 10 of whom are local.<br><br>For Ms Lo, a Masters degree holder who wrote the text, it is an attempt for her fellow 'sisters' to be understood.<br><br>It is also the culmination of her lifelong journey to find her own gender identity.<br><br>'I want everyone to know who I am. I am sick of lying,' said Ms Lo, who used to tell everyone who asked that she studied at St Nicholas Girls' School instead of the all-boys' school Catholic High.<br><br>The taunts of 'Ah Kua' and 'Bapok' (colloquial terms for effeminate men) first came in primary school when the only son of a businessman father and customer service officer mother would pretend to be actress Julie Andrews and spontaneously belt out 'the hills are alive' from The Sound Of Music soundtrack in class.<br><br>What Ms Lo called 'nasty jokes' followed her to Catholic High, where she often donned dresses and took to the stage to act out the female parts.<br><br>'No boys were eager to play the female role except me... that was my only way of expressing myself.<br><br>'At the end of every virtuoso performance, I would sashay offstage with Gong Li's poise and hauteur. Steeped in my reverie of superstardom, I would drift trance-like back to class, only to discover the words 'Leonard is a bloody faggot' splashed across my desk.'<br><br>Apart from knowing that she was not gay, she did not know how she was different - until she was 15 and found a book on transsexuals at the library.<br><br>It was Cries In The Dark by the late Professor S. S. Ratnam, who used to perform sex-change surgeries at the National University Hospital.<br><br>The book changed her life, but she did not go under the scalpel until she was 21.<br><br>In the interim, she spent two years at Hwa Chong Junior College and two years in the army as a combat medic, where she had a mental breakdown from depression.<br><br>'Everyday was torture, I felt like dying. It was a struggle to live,' she said.<br><br>That was when she first told her parents that she wanted to be a woman.<br><br>'My parents refused to believe it. They brought me to mediums, exorcists, people from all kinds of religions, to pray over me.'<br><br>They finally gave in when a reputed fortune teller from Taiwan took one look at Ms Lo, clad in jeans, blouse and lipstick, and declared: 'I can only see a woman.'<br><br>She went off to the University of York in Britain to study English Literature and, in her first year, took 14 days off to fly to Bangkok for the surgery.<br><br>Today, the only reminder that she is not a woman through and through is having to go for hormonal implants in her abdomen once a year.<br><br>Ms Lo, who has had two boyfriends in Britain, hopes to 'meet my Prince Charming, have a beach wedding and give out insect repellants as door gifts'.<br><br>What about children?<br><br>'I might have cats instead,' she said.<br>[/img]</div>
