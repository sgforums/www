'Shadow work,' or free work saves corporations lots of money.<br><br>For example, Banks saves sooo much money by getting you to bank over the internet or the phone instead.  They save money because you do the work of a teller and result in their fixed costs  being so much lower.  They market it in the name of convience but really, its all about saving the $$$  Now companies charge people user fees for any person-to-person larbour, its greed really!  It also has even more sinister implications if you think about it!<br><br>I for one am greatful that Spore MacDonald's continues to supply this service.

It is hard to say whether it is right or wrong. Maybe for us, Fugue is wrong. But for him, he is convinced he is right. So is it right or wrong?<br><br>There need not be 1 right, there can be more than 1 rights and truths. We think the ang-moh guy is not stupid but civilized. Fugue thinks the guy is stupid.<br><br>Fugue is talking like this, because he thinks like a no-emotion utilitarian. He thinks since customers already pay, and cleaners exist, then there is no need for customers to spend time and energy to clean by themselves. That would be a stupid action. It defeats the purpose of having cleaners and waste ur own energy and time.<br><br>To me, if u take away the emotional part of ur brain and ur values and ur civility, Fugue's argument makes perfect sense. So, in other words, it is just how Fugue thinks and how he perceive things and how he has his own values. Is Fugue therefore a stupid person or ignorant person? No, he has his own values like u and me. It is just different.<br><br>If u all want to think Fugue is stupid or ignorant, it is up to u all. Like Fugue who is free to have his opinions, u all also free to have opinions. But I just want to say, by saying Fugue is stupid, didn't u all do what Fugue is doing to the guy? Something to think....</div></blockquote>Your 'essay' reminded me of a 'friend' at a coffeeshop many years ago.<br><br>:::He bought a bowl of Laksa and i had Chicken Rice, we sat down together on a table.<br>He took his plastic spoon and scooped up the chilli portion which was on the side of the bowl. The next thing he did was that he threw the chilli onto the floor. Next...he scooped those veggie condiments with gravy and threw it onto the ground again.<br><br>I got offended by his action. So i questioned.<br><br>Why did you do that?<br>:::I paid money for this bowl of laksa and my parents paid tax for these cleaners. So i have the right to do this.<br><br>So do you pass motion at your void deck since your parents paid taxes? Might as well do it all the way...right?<br>:::I have toilet at home so comfortable, why need to do such things?<br><br>But do you see that it's wrong for you to do that? You can place it on your tray or on the table.<br>:::Nothing wrong at all. I paid $3 for the bowl of Laksa. I can do whatever i want with it.<br><br>I left without eating my plate of Chicken Rice.<br><br>Li Ka Shing:<br><br>May i know what value holds this 'friend' of mine in respect?<br>And you are right in every sense that everyone is entitled to have and hold their opinions. In fact my 'friend' is entitled to do what he did.<br>But he lost my respect towards him.<br>What i'm trying to present to you is that:<br><br>If an opinion doesn't hold any water.
