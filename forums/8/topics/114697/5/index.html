I was just sharing a perspective.<br><br>The thing about this line of logic is that it is premised on the fact management recognizes the workload and employees accordingly.  This means the more you do an employeeÂ’s job the less employees there will be.  However you do make a valid point on employees having other jobs to do, but I am viewing this from a global, meaning overall load.<br><br>As to your point of the migration from primary to secondary:  This is not a case of a job becoming obsolete, as it is more of creating a need.  No need means no job, by dialectics, create a need and you create a job.  I do not agree that as society progresses new jobs will open up.  Or at least I do not believe equal or better jobs will be available as society Â“progressesÂ” Example: Its Sunday today and IÂ’m in office working ArrrggghhhhÂ… err or rather posting in forums.  But the deskilling of our labour force is a whole other issue.<br><br>I see what youÂ’re saying but I continue to maintain my stand as a whole. Although I wouldnÂ’t call either wisdom!!!
