Initially this post reflected the attitude of a particular Singaporean. Sadly, it starts to show the mentality of more Singaporeans.<br><br>I think we're not trying to discuss on whether to clear the trays or not. We're more concerned about why we have to criticise others when they're just trying to do their part. Even if we dun contribute, we should not criticise. Whether one clears or not is up to the individual, but we can choose not to create more problems by criticising or dissuading others from doing their part.<br><br>Helping others is a great way to feel good. If the simple act of clearing the trays can bring a smile to someone, why not? We do not need to go to extremes by mopping or sweeping the floor. But if we can n want to, why not? But the easiest thing for us to do is not to contribute to the mess. N also understand, encourage n applaud those who actively help to do their part in helping others. Wouldn't it be very harmonious if everyone around us were smiling all the time cos everyone is helping one another? Dat's why we gotta start somewhere. It is truly a very sad day if we're blind n ignorant to something worthy of praise. Honestly, why bother whether others clear the trays or not? Just make sure dat we ourselves do not create more problems 1st. If we cannot even do it ourselves, do not judge others.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The fastfood restuarants management, has spoilt us all, they are providing the service of clearing our trays free of charge, there's no service charge for this  and we are taking it take granted.<br><br>Apart from fastfood outlets, food courts, hawker centers, kopitiam, coffee shops, are also providing this service FOC.  After we finished eating our food, we jus pai pai pi gu and go off, there will always be people who will clear our plates and trays for us.<br><br>Remember years ago, at an MacDonald's outlet, also saw an ang mo couple after finished eating, cleared the table and bring the tray to the dustbin to throw away the rubbish. Was to surprise to see this (also admired them for doing that). What was even more surprising or rather shocking was that the MacDonald's staff instead of being appreciative of the ang mo efforts,  complained to his other colleague that the ang mo dunno how to throw rubbish properly into the bin, mess up the area, so he had to clean up the mess. So much for being kind-hearted on the part of the ang mo (hao xin mei hao pao).<br><br>Leaving plates and trays on the table after eating and walking away at a public place has already been our culture for years. We learn this from our parents when they took us to MacDonald's to eat, we learn this from our friends also (peer pressure, won't want to be the odd one out to clear away  the trays while others jus walk off)<br><br>Years ago, there was a good gracious promotion campaign. The authorities  tried this out at Newton Circle (I think, not sure if this is the place). They encouraged diners to clear their trays and plates after eating for the comfort of the next diners, was it successful? dunno!  Also dunno was it faithfully carried out at that place now.<br><br>If for example, some fastfood restuarant or food court try to change this culture by insisting that their diners clear their plates and trays, quite sure  this will cause an outroar<br><br>Finally, to change this culture, there's only one way. That is to fine those diners who don't clear their plates and trays after eating.  Afterall, we are living in a 'fine' society.<br><br>Sorry if this is a bit too long, thanks for reading<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Fugue is a classic example of our future typical Singaporean. If i'm not wrong, this guy aen't matured enought to think whats right or wrong. Guess u have NEVER travelled overseas b4. In european cities, u are required to clear ur plate as an act of courtesy. Such actions are also being carried out in primary schools, u must have ignored that part did u?<br><br>Dude u need some guidance. Just becos the majority of singaporeans cultivate such actions does not give u the right to follow them blindly.
