            <div class='col-md body'>What you said is quite true. By using old tech and os, there are bound to be unpatched vulnerabilities since m$ phased it out but i highly doubt hackers/virus writers would be bothered about old technology anymore so in a sense you are relatively safe lol. smart move. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

I have an XP test machine using the bare minimum specs, no modem, 8GB of HDD, 128MB of SDRAM, P3, sound card and a graphics card. Everything is fast without that modem and ethernet card. Another machine has the same specs, but with Internet capability. It's running slow like tortoise.</div>

The olden day computers of the pentium 2 nad 3 genre wer emroe ruggard and don't spoil easily.<br><br>Here's my config<br><br>Pentium 733<br>512 MB SDRAM<br>Geforce 2 GTS<br>10GB HDD<br>Win2000<br>Creative SB Live<br><br>All running fine for the past 6 years! . The most funny thing is that, my comp is faster in doing applications than most P4 out there!<br><br>but rather sickened by the rate at which people upgrade.  yes, it is good to keep up, but I have no plans to buy any new motherboard for at least a year maybe more. I do have some relatively older stuff, but I see no need for any PCI-E based motherboard, no Athlon 64, P 4, no newer sound cards, they are a waste of money. yes a p4 is faster than a first generation pentium but when the p4 is running XP and the p1 is running win95 i notice that the P4 from 5 to 10 or more seconds to open a file, what  i think what is more important is what i call the "snap" factor<br>I also think that users these days don't appreciate former hardware, or computing from 8  years back.<br><br>How would we have got this far without it ? what is the matter with a 486, a Pentium, a P II ? they still run just fine, and can run certain software perfectly adequately than newer XP equipped comps<br><br>. You don't need a Athlon 64 just to surf the web and check e mail. Most of what people do with computers can be done with a 300 MHz machine and enough ram. I want to finish my rant by adding that the real age of development in computing has past, the real experimental times have been left behind. Now it's all hyped hardware and little appreciation for what computers are all about.<br><br>Comments welcomed.</div></blockquote>You're right... in some ways... for users who use their PC only to surf web, read email, run basic office application, a pentium 3 system would suffice..<br><br>however, most users do more than those stuffs... running multi-application at the same time, play games, downloading stuffs like videos, animes etc, running cpu-intensive task like encoding or editing video...<br><br>you certainly can't run today's games using a geforce2 card, or download videos into a 10GB HDD which obviously isn't enough...<br><br>so, in the end, it depends on what you use your computer for...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ndmmxiaomayi:</div><div class="quote_body">I can guarantee you that without Internet access, everything would be fast. I have an XP test machine using the bare minimum specs, no modem, 8GB of HDD, 128MB of SDRAM, P3, sound card and a graphics card. Everything is fast without that modem and ethernet card. Another machine has the same specs, but with Internet capability. It's running slow like tortoise.</div></blockquote>Tell u something else , AT TIMES WinXP RUN BETTER on old systems than a P4.  why?<br><br>It is because, The OS has been optimised to run on the minimal system requirements and if yr old comp meets that, it will run just as it was intended to be.<br><br>But wait, again i think it has more to do wif the hardware, Older computers have a less complicated hardware for the OS to handle like example, AGP 4x ,SDRAM. This also plays a factor because the hardware addreressing by the OS on newer comps may possible take up more CPU cycles than older hardware.<br><br>THis what i called the SNAP FACTOR.</div>
