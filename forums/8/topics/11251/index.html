            <div class='col-md body'>Do you guys know of any cases where good fellow soldiers got kanna charged for unreasonable cause?<br>There is this case that happened to my unit (I wouldn't say where i am from), I believed it was because there are some high-ranking regulars who think they are kings in NS, who think they can do whatever they want. This poor chap got charged 20 days in DB(detention barrack) just for not eaten his breakfast the day before!!<br>I see this as a very minor offence, which at most rendered a scolding or extras...<br>But to send this poor chap to DB, I find that, is really too much.<br>I heard that poor chap had only a few weeks to ORD.<br>Can anybody share with me your valueable suggestions?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are a lot of ways of looking at things lor...it is just a matter of point of view.<br><br>In the issue of this guy, maybe the OC or CO thinks that it is of utmost importance to maintain the discipline of individual. Today you can skip breakfast, tomorrow you can book in late, the next week you can forget to sign out weapons and the next month you can forget and bring 5.56mm rounds back home. I think the Officer is trying to "slaughter one to warn the rest". If not, this attitute of this soldier will spread to all of his platoon mates and eventually to the whole company.<br><br>Although I admit that by sending him to DB is a very harsh decision. But I can see the logic behind it. We can give the men extras and extras and tons of extras but some people are just born immune to extras. And in this case, the ultimate way will be to charge him to "wake up his idea".<br><br>------------------<br>Where is Montgomery? I thought I am supposed to meet him for lunch????.....</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>This seems to be a very extreme case to me. What Desert Fox says has a point. In order to instill military discipline, the OC or whoever in charge has the right to do so. If u really take time to sit down and read through the military offences book, u will find a lot of things which are not practsied in NS nowadays. What is supposed to be a charge becomes a confinement now. In short, punishments are reduced in severity.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If that guy has a valid reason to skip breakfast, then the punishment is unjustified. However, if there is no valid reasons, then too bad for him. Maybe mingming would like to supply more information on this??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I wonder if military courts allow appeals.  :p</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do agree with Desert fox's point of view, that military law must be enforced to soldiers at some point of time. To wake up their ideas when things get out of hand.<br>I personally do not know that chap. But from what i heard, That chap was a 'marked' feller by his OC, cos he had created alot of troubles for his company for the past 2 1/2 years. I dunno what kind of troubles that the chap had created, but according to the men and some of the commanders in that company (btw, that feller is a sergent), they all felt that this was what the OC wants to give him as an 'ORD present'?!?!<br>Maybe there are some personal feuds involved??<br>Right now, everybody are keeping their mouths shut, cos they don't want anything to affect their own ORD. Selfishness? Or just want to cover their own backs?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, it is very difficult for us to judge in this case because we do not know the actual circumstances surrounding the incident and any events leading up to it. If this is the first time the guy skipped breakfast, then I agree that it is too harsh a punishment. But if the guy has been constantly skipping breakfast, ignoring instructions etc despite repeated warnings, extra duties etc, then this charge may be a'next-level' punishment.<br><br>The OC may also specifically told the guy NOT to skip his breakfast. By doing so, his crime is no longer just skipping of breakfast, but insubordination!<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>

Is this the first time he lied? Or has he lied a lot of times already? How is his disciplinary record prior to the lying? What is the consequence of his lie?<br>Last time back in my unit, there's this guy who was charged and send to DB for 4 days for sleeping during sentry.
