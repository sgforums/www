I couldn't accept the changes he made to BMTC even up till now when i have ORD for almost a year. It was like he was "training" all the other soldiers, regulars or NSF, except the new recruits who were treated really like babies. All the soldiers from the CO to the storemen were afraid of him. But the recruits dared to climb onto PC's n sergeants' heads cos the big farker damn afraid of parents' complaints.

SIGHZZZZZZZZZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!</div></blockquote>Hi Shiork,<br><br>This is a sad fact of life, but it happens every where...not just in the SAF. Take a normal organisation for example, a regular (read: full time) employee can go AWOL for a few days, but it's quite easy enough for him to clear belated leave after that. Imagine a temp or part-time staff going AWOL?? Most probably, it's a sack or docking of pay. Similarly, you will find that as you get higher and higher in rank (read: corporate ladder), you can get away with more and more things. These are things which happen everywhere, in every organisation, all over the world, not just in the SAF.<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aiyah you all are just over paranoid and all that. Seriously, i thing army life after training is very lobo. do nothing most of the time.<br>no point to be siao on and all that. SAF doesn't need you to anyway, or why do you thing they're paying you peanuts?<br>SAF is all about impression, from the whole organisation level all the way down to the individuaL level.<br>Do you really think SAF is really capable of defending S'pore? I don't think so, the most we can only buy time while waiting for our "allies" to make up their minds whether to help us or not. SAF can't survive the most 3 months of warfare. SAF with all its weaponry and technologies are there just to impress other people so that they'll "think twice" before attacking S'pore.<br>By the way, I don't think S'pore soldiers are sincerely loyal. I think when war comes, desertion will be one of the problems. I may even be one of the desertors, who knows? is s'pore really that worth defending? sometimes i really ask myself that.<br>that was the organisation level, now let's talk about unit/battalion level. all these BUC ( best unit com ) and all that are really a disgrace. there's a lot of cheating involved. It's all about impression and not if you this or that unit wins the BUC fair and square. like me, for instance, i was forced to go for ATP range 5 times until i get the marksmanship so that my result can contribute to the BUC. SAF is all about face.<br>SO this goes the same for the individual level. you make a good impression with you officers and regulars, you're bound to have a good life. or another way, try to go unnoticed, like me, and no one will disturb you.<br>this is really how the world works.<br>take care now. ta-ta<br><br>------------------<br>**I don't ride fast, I just fly low**</div>
