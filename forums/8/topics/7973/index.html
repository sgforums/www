            <div class='col-md body'>Guys and gals, take a minute to read and post your opinions.... as for the gals... err, I don't mean that you will all end up like that, but just try to put yourself in her shoes and share what would you do best to make things right.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote><br>Last evening I had a call from a KTV mamasan asking me if I want female company. She told me that one of her gal liked to earn 'extra money'<br>She told me she's 22 &amp; pretty. Well I said OK. She arranged for me to pick her up. I met the gal. She's looks OK and had her specs on. Looks like your typical school girl. I took her a hotel after dinner. She lament that she would like to earn her keeps. So ok, we proceed to my room...<br><br>While she was undressing.. and took off her specs.. I had a shock!!! she is looks about  2.5 months pregnant. Her stomach &amp; her breast were swollen. I immediately asked her to get dressed. She denied being pregnant.<br><br>I asked to look at her i/c. Huh? Only 17. Shit.. I asked her again.. why is she doing this? She should be in school.<br><br>She broke down..and explained that her dad is in DRC and her mom fled to M'sia to avoid loansharks.. and left her alone to fends for herself. She left school and stayed with one of her b/fs.. one of them make her pregnant and dumped her. She's been sleeping with<br>men to make enough money to keep the baby. I packed her up &amp; sent her home. Her home is a 3 room HDB Flat. It was empty..with only a few stools &amp; a matress on the floor. Her clothes were scattered on the floor.. There was not even a table!<br><br>I gave her whatever I have in my wallet and left.<br>I was really mad. I called the mamasan and scolded her. She seems just as surprised. She haven't seen the gal for quite some time. She has only work for her in a KTV barely a week. She thought she was doing her a favour..<br>I made her promised not to refer any more 'johns' to her..<br><br>Sometimes I felt that we should be more careful whom we are catering to..<br>No doubt we look for sex..but we ought to be mindful seeking pleasure with other less fortunate gal in similiar circumstances..<br></blockquote>I wonder how many people would have did what the author of this story did.... and there is no source to verify the truth of this story either, but whatever it is, it seems sad that such things happens or may happen in our country.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>"For every 1 person living a better life than you, there are 8 others who are living in a worse condition than you."<br><br>I apologise should anybody be offended by this post.<br><br>------------------<br>How I'd wish to be a kid again, skinned knees are easier to heal than broken hearts.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Cookee (edited 21 June 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>now moose, don't take this personally, i'm not flaming you but i'm just stating my stance.<br><br>please! if i'm ever unlucky enough to be in her shoes and let's pretend that i'm 17 again, i'll never prostitute myself. i was already giving private tuition at that age and earning good money on top of going to school. if i should be pregnant and forced to give up school to keep the child, i'll try my best to provide for it, at least i still would have a roof over my head. i may have to work doubly hard but if there's a will, there's always a way.<br><br>and let's pretend that i don't have the ability to teach, i could always find a job as a shop assistant, it may not pay well, but it would suffice and even if i've no money to  deliver the child, what do you think the hospital will do if i just present myself at its doorstep when the baby's due? they won't turn me away, at most when the bill comes, i'll tell them i'll pay them in installments, what can they possibly do? Singapore is not that inhumane yet.<br><br>and how much can a common prostitute command anyway? there're rates as cheap as $20 to a high of a few hundred dollars and for that kind of money, to sell your soul, it's so stupid!<br><br>get an education, that's my advice to the young gals out there. of course, i must thank God for blessing me with a will of iron that i've never thought of selling my body to get out of money problems.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>and if i've no relatives or friends, then i would have to rely on myself, don't i? if i've relatives and friends and they shun me in my hour of need because what my mom has done or because my dad is in DRC, then i must treat myself with even more respect so that when i'm out of that pit of shit, i'll be able to hold my head high and of course my elephant memory will serve me well who are friends and who are foes.<br><br>in life, self-respect is very important, if you cannot look at yourself in the eye, how do you expect others to accord you the respect you crave? especially in a society as materialistic as ours?<br><br>money though important, it's not everything in life and to get money through prostitution out of one's own free will, i've no pity for such women. there're lots of other courses available to them, it's basically just that they're afraid of hard work, although it beats me how could they even entertain all sorts of men?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>least of her worries, it would become her greatest nightmare in future.<br><br>and i fail to see how pressing can it be for her to save money for 2 if she is not overly materialistic. she does have the house, doesn't she? and even if the house is not fully paid for, HDB won't turn her out onto the streets, just imagine the headlines it'll create. from the way i see it, making enough money for 2 with some utilities bills to pay still don't justify her actions.<br><br>and yes i do know that the upkeep of a baby is expensive but if she has no money for baby formula, she can always breatfeed half the time and instead of disposable diapers, use the cloth type. and how much does a sarong (as the baby cot) cost? baby bottles and such are one time purchase and they don't cost the earth. and debts by her mom are not hers, i still don't see it. of course the problem of who will look after the baby arises, but she could always look around for some reasonable babysitter, there's bound to be some kind people around. *sigh* maybe i'm too naive.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by gigalo:<br>[quote]<br>I believed that you have noticed the age of the gal in here- she is 17 with a broken family, How much of education could possibly the gal would have attained? no matter where she is, in Singaopre or elsewhere?</blockquote>how a person handle a problem does not depend on the education level, a good education is merely an aid to getting a good job. itÂ’s the innate character of a person which determines how he/she handles a crisis. and even without an education, she can still get a job, be it a shop assistant or even the kopi-girl, my point is that itÂ’s not impossible to earn a decent living in Singapore unless sheÂ’s of sub normal intelligence, dumb, mute and deaf.<br><br>iÂ’ve seen girls who have barely completed their PSLE who handled certain life situations even better than me.<br><br><blockquote><br>She would have the same thing or even done better things than you if her parents were to be of a better situation. </blockquote>my parents are illiterate hawkers, my family has its share of problems and iÂ’m thankful that God blessed me with intelligence and some semblance of morality. now, do i prostitute myself if i needed a large sum of money urgently? the answer is no because i wonÂ’t be able to live with myself.<br><br><blockquote><br>Put yourself into her shoes, Think of the possible mental sufferings she has gone through or even doing so! At the age of 17 can you imagine to see your father in DRC, and your mum running away from the country leaving you all behind and later part being cheated by someone... ending up being pregnant........... You will either become mad or commit suicide b4 you could even think about anything else?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></blockquote>er, iÂ’ve no interest in posting my personal problems on the Net but suffice to say in lieu of the girlÂ’s father and mother, iÂ’ve other problems to deal with, my life is a melodrama and iÂ’m not even the lead actress. iÂ’ve handled family crises since i was 14 and mind you, iÂ’m the youngest in my family and when opinions differs, i get my way most of the time if not all the time, case in point was when my dad was misdiagnosed by some stupid doctors at TTSH a few years ago which nearly cost him his life, even though i donÂ’t have enough money to pay the hospital should the other siblings refused to help out, i moved him out of TTSH into SGH where the correct prognosis was done, why do you think iÂ’m so bossy?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>i guess the difference between this girl and me would be our characters. should i be cheated by a man sexually, i donÂ’t think iÂ’ll lose my mind over him, i mean whatÂ’s the point? is he going to come back to me, will he love me still? the answer is no, so why should i lose my mind over him on top of being sexually used by him? iÂ’ll be infinitely hurt but iÂ’ll not lose my mind over him.<br><br>the only way to rise above such a circumstance would be to live well, get over it (even if it takes years) and get on with my life and open my eyes wide wide the next time i fall in love and it will be a long time before i do the hanky panky with my new boyfriend. iÂ’ll take this as a lesson and be stronger for it. tough circumstances although highly unwelcome are circumstances that will mould oneÂ’s character and to bow down so easily, that speaks volumes of her weak will for prostitution is the oldest and lousiest occupation any woman can aspire to.<br><br><blockquote><br>By the way in case of a situation like this as you have mentioned that you could turn to your relatives for financial help!!! ahahahah<br>You will realise the truth when these things happens to you personnally.. </blockquote>if my relatives do not help out in such a situation, then i guess my elephant memory will remember, iÂ’m nothing if not petty and even though iÂ’m a Christian, itÂ’ll be a long time before i forgive and forget. i believe that even though oneÂ’s life is in the pits, itÂ’s not going to last forever and a brighter tomorrow will come some day, one just has to have some principles.</div>
