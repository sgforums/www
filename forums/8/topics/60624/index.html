The unlikely duo defeated the Harris Brothers on December 7, 1999 in Madison, Wisconsin, and lost them on December 14th to Scott Hall &amp; Kevin Nash in New Orleans, Louisiana.  This was only weeks before Bret would suffer a concussion from a Goldberg kick that would ultimately end his career.<br><br><strong>Is Bret Hart still suffering from the post concussion syndrome?</strong><br><br>I am not sure but I do know that he is telling anyone who asks him that he can't wrestle, so my hunch is that he is still suffering from it in some form or another.  As I said in the Lariat last week, Bret's is a very sad ending to a great career.  In a matter of a few years, he has "gotten screwed" by Vince McMahon in Montreal, had his career ended at the foot of Bill Goldberg, lost his brother and mother, had to deal with public scandals around his zany family and made some very curious decisions (including going on the talking to the dead show on ABC).  I really feel a lot of pity for the guy.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by boy in blues:</div><div class="quote_body"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> bret hart's fine lah. he just needed an excuse to retire to sunny hawaii and plant pineapples with his kids.</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually Bear, it is more to it than meets the eyes. I heard from his side of story that Vince forced him out of wwf to wcw. At that time he was also forced to play heel character since his contract went out.<br><br>Funny thing was at that time when he was heel, I still continue to support him and booed the U.S. pple, stone cold and HBK.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by the Bear:</div><div class="quote_body">actually, there is word that he did it to himself... he was told to drop the belt to Michaels and he refused.. he wanted to leave WWF.. the time honoured tradition was to drop the title before going off..<br><br>so his time was up so it was booked like for him to win, however, it just could not.. and WWF (then) could not let him leave for WCW with their belt... so VinnieMac in many ways, was forced to do that..<br><br>besides, wrestling has seen slip-ups letting their champ go somewhere else and disrespecting the title...<br><br>Shane Douglas did that to the NWA belt<br>Ric Flair did that to the big gold belt<br><br>the most spectacular one was when Mike Awesome did not drop the ECW belt when he jumped to WCW..
