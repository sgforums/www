I drive but I think traffic lights are very unfair for pedestrians. Anyway 20 seconds i think the road u r talking abt must be 2 lanes only and not a main road. Regardless, our traffic lights are not intelligent enough. But at least i'm guessing u press the button and wait for green man right. Some pedestrians dont even press the button just stand there and wait. Traffic light assume nobody waiting cos nobody press. Then green light for cars and red man stay on for pedestrians then they blur blur wonder why the green man nv  turn on. I see this kind of pedestrians everyday.<br><br>Haiz. And I try to let them cross but i give up cos even if i signal to them to cross at red man and i stop my car, they either dont see me, or if i horn they think i trying to scare them or do something bad, or if not other cars will just overtake me and scold me for not going when its green.<br><br>Haiz.</div></blockquote>O... u r such a nice person <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>that time i lazy to press the button, so the green man for pedestrians din come on. but i noe i am right to cross the road. and any car turning to my direction SHOULD give way to me right? even though the driver's traffic light is green.( there is no green arrow for this trafficlight).<br><br>so i happily cross the road. then suddenly got a taxi turn into my direction n horn at me and point to the red man on the traffic light. i turn my head n check the driver trafficlight again: no green arrow.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  i feel like showing my middle finger to the taxi driver. bully me. tot i dont know traffic rules issit? he must haf bought his license. anybody got encounter the same case as me b4?</div>
