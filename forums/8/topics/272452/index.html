Its just funny that commuters silently accept their fate that they are resigned to such long wait at traffic lights. I guess, it is only right that we commuters retaliate. Besides, we are still not breaking the law.<br><br>I urge more commuters to join me in this fight.  This will teach the drivers to show a little more respect for commuters and not Honk and hurry us.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I fully agree with you. I drive but I think traffic lights are very unfair for pedestrians. Anyway 20 seconds i think the road u r talking abt must be 2 lanes only and not a main road. Regardless, our traffic lights are not intelligent enough. But at least i'm guessing u press the button and wait for green man right. Some pedestrians dont even press the button just stand there and wait. Traffic light assume nobody waiting cos nobody press. Then green light for cars and red man stay on for pedestrians then they blur blur wonder why the green man nv  turn on. I see this kind of pedestrians everyday.<br><br>Haiz. And I try to let them cross but i give up cos even if i signal to them to cross at red man and i stop my car, they either dont see me, or if i horn they think i trying to scare them or do something bad, or if not other cars will just overtake me and scold me for not going when its green.<br><br>Haiz.</div>

How long do you wait for the light to turn green? That would be a good 3-4 minutes. And when the Light does turn green, how long do you have on the road? A mere 20 seconds. It is not fair. Moreover, when you are halfway crossing the road, the vehicles are already veering close scheming to cross the road. Sure, we are all users of the road; I demand a bit more equality.<br><br>Screw these road drivers. .......................................<br><br></div></blockquote>Why don't you find out which driver set the timing for these traffic lights. Its very unlikely a Merc driver would work on traffic lights. You fingered the wrong guy.<br>You tulan, and you spread your shit to an innocent party. You should screw yourself. Actually, thats what you are doing.</div>
