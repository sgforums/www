The area is SO, SO, SO, SO, SOoooooooo "uh-lu" and inaccessable. NO MRT, Bus take donkey years to reach. Area Full of BLACK Foreign Workers. Who in the right frame of mind wants to move there?<br><br>The only possible reason i gathered so far is PRICE, a new 5 room resale flat in a matured Estate cost $300K ++, But a new 5 room flat in "uh-lu" Sengkang only cost $250-260K....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>True. Sengkang estate is a bit too far for my liking. From where I am working now, I don't really see that estate as a choice of habitation. However, the parks there give me the atmosphere of being away from this world, and so it is not always a bad thing to stay there. But I'm more of a practical person. I would still choose a matured and centralized estate.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

I rather Jurong than Sengkang... basically, I'm used to the facilities available in a developed estate and I dun think I can stand the idea of having to go to a long distance to look for food... good food can seldom be found in a developing estate... Plus, town is really too far from Sengkang...<br><br>aiyah... i would rather buy a 20 yr old resale flat in AMK, Toa Payoh, Clementi, Jurong, etc...<br><br>But best is still Bishan  :p</div>

Plus, if I'm a young couple, still saving up for a car after making downpayment for flat, and going to have kids soon, all new schools in that region, I have to take a few buses to get to Jurong to work, etc... you still want to live in Sengkang?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Shervon99,<br><br>Well of cos if you work in Jurong, Seng Kang would be too far, I think its pretty obvious and goes without saying. And of cos, you can't compare a developing estate with those like AMK or TPY, its just like comparing an orange with an apple.<br><br>As you have mentioned, u r a young couple, are you sure u can afford a resale flat which gonna cost almost twice the amnt of a new flat? I don't know much abt applying for new flats but think the 3 most popular choices are Seng Kang, Sembawang or CCK rite? If given a choice in one of these three choices, i am sure Seng Kang will not be a bad place. Of cos, it all depends, for some might think that Sembawabg or CCK is better.<br><br>I don't live in Seng Kang but i definitely don't mind living there.<br><br>------------------<br>nOthiNg iS ImpOsSibLE In tHiS wOrLd<br>EvEn tHe wOrD ImPoSsiBLe SaYs "i'M pOsSiBLe"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually sengkang aint all that bad...govt is in the midst of developing the place, just have to endure for a few more years...<br><br>but one thing i dun really like about the place is the layout of the blocks of flats..so close to each other!<br><br>i thk i would like to stay in the east coast area, or marine parade...near the sea. getting a unit on the highest floor will guarantee a sea-view! but then, have to consider the air quality, full of salt and chlorin, leading to concrete deterioration and rusting of metal...but i thk i can live with that!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
