IT WAS THAT SIMPLE. From then onwards, even till today, whenever I begin to have this paralysis feeling, I just re-position my arms to my waist and the paralysis would subside immediately.<br><br>I cannot conclude that this remedy applies to everyone. You have to observe what posture works best. I don't even want to conclude that sleep paralysis is due to sleeping posture. It may be due to stress or emotions. Be brave and find a solution.</blockquote>Excellent explaination of a rather common phenomena</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I always keep an open mind, I read about sleep paralysis, it may be real &amp; common to some pple, but not every case must be sleep paralysis. Some of us know themselves &amp; our body(health)... it's not due to stress, too tired, etc. For those who travel may hv come across certain hotel room which give the this 'sleep paralysis' experience.<br><br>It happened to me ONCE &amp; i know im not in a 'stressful' state, i know wat was going on &amp; think about it for a few days. I believe it's not sleep paralysis. Spirture disturbance could be the reason, but believe or not it's up to individual.<br><br>It's never harmful to hv more approach when looking for help, if u believe it's sleep paralysis, see a doctor. if u r cured good 4 u, if not, u could always look for elsewhere answers.</div>
