            <div class='col-md body'>Well-said!! SLAPPY is a racist!!!<blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MrBach:</div><div class="quote_body">You're insufferably obnoxious and racist.<br><br>If he wants to bring to our collective attention features of his culture that we are probably going to miss (given the fact that his culture is shared by only a minority of persons in our country), then I don't see why this should be deemed wrong.<br><br>If you are not only indifferent to his culture but in fact despise it (as seems to be implied by your post about how 'indian music' has a tendency to drive you out of the rooms where it is being broadcast), and if your apathy or antipathy in this regard is shared by a majority of persons in Singapore, then obviously that might have been a reason why VC had felt the need to bring to our attention certain facts about his culture or about the people associated with it.<br><br>Why should he be making you hate him, by his presentation of the fact that there is much about his culture that could be admired?<br><br>And if 'your preference for your own culture' is indeed the reason why you hate him simply for the fact that he should have told you that there are admirable features of his culture, then, obviously, this 'preference' of yours must be something akin to chauvinism; for how otherwise could a person's pereference for his own culture ever lead him to despise another person for suggesting that there could be something praiseworthy about a different culture?<br><br>And what has the fact that the majority of us are Chinese have to do with the question or not whether he has the right to be informing us about certain features of his culture?<br><br>Are you saying that because we're in the majority, we should therefore rightly regard it as an infringement of our rights that someone not in the majority should undertake to bring to our attention various facets of his culture?<br><br>Why blame your inherent racism on VC's discussion of his own culture?<br><br>If you weren't a sickening and despicable racist to begin with, you would never find it in the least offensive that someone of a different culture should attempt to bring to your attention certain features of his own culture.<br><br>I agree that VC may be going a bit overboard at times; but I really don't know whether this may not be a reaction on his part to what he perceives might well be the apathy and antipathy of the majority.<br><br>Whatever VC is doing isn't inherently destructive of racial harmony; but your response to it, certainly is.<br><br>If you want to point your finger at an enemy of 'racial harmony', you need look no further than yourself.<br><br>And as to this statement of yours, namely, 'we don't like means we don't like', let me say this in reply:<br><br>Nobody is forcing you to like (or to read) what you don't like (or what you don't like to read); just as no-one is forcing you to convert to Christianity.<br><br>You're perfectly entitled to slam the door shut in the face of someone who is preaching to you; and Christians are for their part just as entitled (once they know of your determination to slam the door shut in their faces), to leave you alone (just as they might well see fit leave a dog alone to wallow in its own vomit).<br><br>For my own part, I won't cheapen the Gospel by proclaiming it to someone like yourself.<br><br>For someone who isn't convinced that he has a disease, it would be useless to attempt to covince him of the existence of the relevant cure; what is needful first is that such a person should be convinced of the fact that he is diseased; but if such a person were still to refuse to be convinced of the fact that he is diseased, then he must simply be left alone.<br><br>Our Lord has bidden us not to cast pearls before swine, lest they should be trampled upon; and lest that the swine in question should then turn and tear us to pieces.<br><br>I feel therefore that no Christian should waste his time (and defame Christ) by speaking of Him to someone like yourself; rather, you should be left to your own devices, and suffer the consequences of your own choices.<br></div></blockquote></div>
