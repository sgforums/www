              <p><br>Like it or not, the best lovers in this world are those who can open their mouth and ask their women how to be a better lover.</p>
              <p>I don't think men are capable of learning or finding out how to satisfy a woman appropriately without hint, advice, and guidance from women.</p>
              <p>I won't be surprised if all your so-called instructors, pornstars, masters, learnt it all from women.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I want to know girls do not have a penis so how do they
              urine?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since girls can urine without a penis does that mean that if we
              guys cut off our penis than we also still can urine?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I see alot of office girls like to wear a dress with a big belt
              in between and black stockings. Like that how they urine.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do they just pull down their stockings and panties than lift up
              their skirt and urine?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do they have to be nake that means pull down everything, take
              out their high heels, pull down their stockings and underwear, take
              off their big belt and pull down their dress and bra and than urine

              <p> </p>
              <p>I want to know girls do not have a penis so how do they urine?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since girls can urine without a penis does that mean that if we guys cut off our penis than we also still can urine?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I see alot of office girls like to wear a dress with a big belt in between and black stockings. Like that how they urine.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do they just pull down their stockings and panties than lift up their skirt and urine?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do they have to be nake that means pull down everything, take out their high heels, pull down their stockings and underwear, take off their big belt and pull down their dress and bra and than urine or how?</p>

              <h2><span class="mw-headline">Chinese usage</span></h2>
              <div class="rellink noprint relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <a title="Tongzhi" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongzhi">Tongzhi</a></div>
              <p>In <a title="Chinese language" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language">Chinese</a>, the translation of <em>comrade</em> is "å�Œå¿—" (<a title="Pinyin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin">pinyin</a>:
              tóng zhì), literally meaning "(people with) the same spirit, goal,
              ambition, etc." It was first introduced in the political sense by <a class="mw-redirect" title="Sun Yat-Sen" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Yat-Sen">Sun Yat-Sen</a> to refer to his followers.</p>
              <p>The <em><a title="Kuomintang" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuomintang">Kuomintang</a></em> (Nationalist Party), which was co-founded by Sun Yat-Sen, has a long tradition of using the term <em>Tongzhi</em> (<em>comrade</em>)
              to refer to its members, usually as a noun rather than a title; for
              example, a KMT member would say "Mr. Chang is a loyal and reliable
              comrade."<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comrade#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Nevertheless, the term was promoted most actively by the <a title="Communist Party of China" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China">Communist Party of China</a> during its struggle for power. It was used both as a noun and as a title for basically anyone in <a title="Mainland China" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China">mainland China</a> after the <a title="People's Republic of China" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China">People's Republic of China</a> was founded. For example, women were <em>nü tongzhi</em> (female comrade), children were <em>xiao tongzhi</em> (little comrade) and seniors were <em>lao tongzhi</em> (old comrade). However, after the 1980s and the onset of China's
              market-oriented reforms, this term has been moving out of such daily
              usage. It remains in use as a respectful term of public address among
              middle-aged Chinese and members of the Communist Party of China. Within
              the Communist Party, failure to address a fellow member as <em>tóng zhì</em> is seen as a subtle but unmistakable sign of disrespect and enmity.</p>
              <p>At party or civil meetings, the usage of the term has been retained. Officials often address each other as <em>Tongzhi</em>, and thus the usage here is not limited to Communist Party members alone. In addition, <em>Tongzhi</em> is the term of preference to address any national leader when their titles are not attached (e.g. <em>Comrade</em> Mao Zedong, <em>Comrade</em> Deng Xiaoping).</p>
              <p>Chinese territories such as Hong Kong and Macau do not have comrade
              in its popular vernacular due to the long occupation by foreign <a title="Western world" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world">Western</a> powers which instilled a different language paradigm in the natives of those regions.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Of late, <em>tongzhi</em> has become a common equivalent for the English term <a title="Gay" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay">gay</a> in mainland China.

              it has come to be used with the aim of presenting same-sex
              relationships as positive and suggesting solidarity between LGBT people.</strong></span></p>
