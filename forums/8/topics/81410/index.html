            <div class='col-md body'>After an unusually quiet couple of weeks, things have started to pick up with regards to hostile activities on the Internet. Apparently back from holiday, the virus/worm authors have gotten busy releasing new malicious software. Two new worms (and variants) are spreading from computer-to-computer by exploiting well know security flaws on machines running Microsoft Windows operating systems.<br><br>These worms are among the most worrisome type because, in addition to spreading, they open Â“backdoorsÂ” that allow infected machines to be controlled remotely across the Internet. Once compromised the machines can have sensitive data stolen off them, be used to relay Spam messages, or launch further attacks against other computers. MS Windows users can protect themselves by applying the necessary security update patches from Microsoft, running antivirus software with up-to-date signature files, and using a firewall to guard their Internet connection. Linux and Macintosh users are immune to these new worms.<br><br>Â“KorgoÂ” worm<br>quote: This Korgo (aka Padobot) variant was found in the very end of May, 2004. It is very similar to other Korgo variants. It spreads throughout the Internet using a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows LSASS. A description of the vulnerability can be found in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-011<br>F-Secure<br>Symantec<br><br>Â“PlexusÂ” Worm<br>quote: Plexus is an Internet worm spreading in three ways simultaneously: as an email attachment, via file-sharing networks and using the LSASS and RPC DCOM vulnerabilites in MS Windows like Sasser and Lovesan respectively. In addition, Plexus carries a potentially dangerous payload. Plexus contains rewritten code from Mydoom. It is written in MS Visual C++ and compressed with FSG: 16208 bytes and 57856 bytes. The main texts are encrypted.<br>Kaspersky Labs<br>Trend Micro<br><br>While these new worms are spreading, the top worms are still Â“Netsky,Â” Â“Sasser,Â” and Â“BagleÂ” that were making the rounds last month.<br>McAfeeÂ’s AVERT<br>Symantec Security Response<br><br>These new worms account for an increase in scanning activity for TCP port 445, as they look for vulnerable hosts to infect. Internet monitoring has also noted increases in port activity associated with Messenger Spam. This may indicate a new method of using zombie computers to automate the distribution of annoying directed pop-up advertising.<br><br>Not explained is the increase in TCP port 8000 scanning. TCP/8000 is commonly associated with Proxy Servers but may involve a vulnerability in Hewlett PackardÂ’s Â“Web JetAdminÂ” printing software. Exploit code for this flaw has been made available on the Internet. Those using this software are urged to install the latest version provided by HP as soon as possible.<br>Security Tracker<br>HP Web Jet Admin<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Windows users are being warned about a virus that is "aggressively stealing" credit card numbers and passwords.<br>The Korgo virus debuted on 22 May and since then has been steadily racking up victims.<br><br>Although the virus is not widespread, security firms are issuing warnings because it is proving so effective at stealing confidential data.<br><br>Those infected by Korgo are being urged to change passwords and credit cards if they have been used online recently.<br><br>Damage done<br><br>Korgo exploits the same vulnerability that the Sasser web worm used so effectively when it struck early last month.<br><br>Like Sasser, the Korgo worm spreads around the net by itself.<br><br>There's a real danger that your online banking ID would get into the wrong hands<br><br>Mikael Albrecht, F-Secure<br>Despite the fact that many people patched their PC to remove the threat from Sasser, anti-virus firms are advising people to be on their guard against Korgo.<br><br>The virus opens up a backdoor on PCs it infects which allows its creators to install a key logging program that activates when users fill in forms on websites.<br><br>The key logger steals password and credit card information and sends it back to its creators, thought to be a virus writing group called the Hangup Team.<br><br>In its web journal, anti-virus firm F-Secure issued a stark warning for those infected by Korgo.<br><br>"Change your passwords and cancel your credit cards. Especially the ones you've used during last week," wrote the anti-virus researchers. "This is not a joke."<br><br>"This is quite an effective one," said Mikael Albrecht, product manager at F-Secure.<br><br>"There's a real danger that your online banking ID would get into the wrong hands," he said.<br><br>Viruses on the rise<br><br>Security firm Symantec has also upgraded its warning about Korgo as the numbers of the virus circulating increased and new variants started to appear. In total seven variants of Korgo have been found.<br><br>But Symantec added that the threat from the virus was "well-contained".<br><br>Korgo has appeared during a month of almost unprecedented virus activity.<br><br>Anti-virus firms Sophos reported that it caught 959 new viruses during May, the highest number of novel viruses since December 2001.<br><br>Sophos estimates that there are now more than 90,000 viruses in circulation.<br><br>"The Sasser and Netsky worms may have captured the headlines, but many more viruses have been written this month," said Carole Theriault, one of Sophos' security consultants.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
