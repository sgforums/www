            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Recently I asked my close friend out for a gathering as we both had been busy with our life for the past few months.. But that night, he had no mood to make merry with me, too miserable to even drown his sorrows, unlike the past when we drank to be happy.. Upon some persuasion did he told me what happened..<br><br>Before I relate what happened to my friend, let me tell you my friend's character.. In a group of us, he can be consider handsome, always the envy of the toast as he was always in the company of ladies when we are still in secondary.. playful, fun-loving and handsome, he has the criteria to be a playboy and a jerk but he did not..<br><br>He was always the nice guy to his ex-gfs, taking crazy, insane and absurd requests that we normally will not tolerate..<br><br>So its not a surprise to us when he got married at a young age.. He now had 2 kids.. A peaceful and happy family or so you thought.. But his wife of seven years has a married man outside and always lie to my friend of her whereabout.. he is devastated, wearly of his life now and often weep silently to his bed before knocking off at 3am in the morning.. Life was a drag.. Here was a man who used to be so cheerful, fun-loving and playful but now?<br><br>So whats the problem? what went wrong for my friend and his marriage? The root of all cause: money or the lack of it.. before hand, she already knew my friend situation.. he was not rich but able to provide enough for the family, so why the sudden changed now..<br><br>It's beyond my ability to fathom what women really want in life.. This moment they say what they want( a nice guy) and what they do?( they want Asshole)<br><br>When a woman says all the good ones are taken, she means all the ones with money.. The man who work as a cleaner or office worker might very well be a great guy capable of loving her dearly, but she wouldn't even consider him as a potential suitor because he doesn't have enough earning power..<br><br>In one breath they proclaim, "I don't care how much money a man makes.. I can make my own money," and in the next, "But whoever I date has to have a status (read: money) job." All other men without this "status job," no matter how nice, intelligent or funny, will be ignored..<br><br>Many women LIE.. They are experts at self-deceit because if they ever admitted to themselves what they really want from men, then they'd be forced to acknowledge that they don't really want a "Nice" guy..<br><br></div>

He already have a broken family. Living in denial is only going to make matters worse. If he accepts it as it is, he will not be hurt by her cheating behind his back and would have moved on living his own life and staying married, which is pointless anyway.<br><br>No one gets married thinking of divorce. If that is the only route to go, it is only the route to go. No point standing at the crossroad not wanting to take the next step. Avoiding confrontation is not the key.<br><br>If he wants to carry on being unhappy instead of moving on, remember it is his choice. Do you think that it is so simple as the wife wanting a lover because of money? Maybe it is, but what is the other side of the story.</div>
