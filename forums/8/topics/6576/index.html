            <div class='col-md body'>Ever had that "urg" feeling when driving behind a lady? Especially when you are doing 100 km/hr on the 3rd lane of PIE and there in front of u...whoala, a cabriolet with a lady sporting long locks of flowing curly hair...with her chest 2 inches away from the steering wheel and seemingly immersed in her own world and who, apparently forgot that she has a rear view mirror. Oh I forgot to mention, she might be doing maybe 70 km/hr....well tell me about those wondrous creatures, is it a thing in them? Or is it a fact that men drivers are better?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi pple,<br><br>Frankly speaking, i like this topic a lot cos i often experience this type of situation, almost everytime i hit the road that is.<br><br>Hopefully to see more feedback here ...... as for my ans, well...... some gals r good, but in general, guys r better. Guess to guy its a things that born within them that make them drive better. Didn't mean to be sexist or anything ...... just personal feeling.<br><br>Anyway on a whole, guys r better, faster, better judgement, confident, reckless and like to speed. As for female, they are more careful, slower but tends to get panicky in some situations. Agree? if not, feel free to discuss further on ........anyway, ever read the book 'why men can't listen and women can't read map'. Me no time to complete the book seriously but think female have problem with sense of direction as well.<br><br>Errrmm.....also, is there any racer in this world that is a lady anyway?<br><br>Regards</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok, based on my 9yrs of driving experience, i can say men are generally average to good drivers..as for women drivers, there are quite some extreme cases...some women are indeed very lousy but some are damn good ok..i remember many yrs ago i chase a female driver in a BMW with my corolla, guess what she is driving more than 100km/h in a normal road..eventually i caught up with her but i tell myself never to do that again.</div>

They tink they r the king of road n if they r not happy abt. your driving skill, they will "siong" n show u some "hand signal". Have a bigger gap when driving behind a taxi, coz u never noe when they 1 2 stop. Never quarrel wif them, u bound 2 lose.<br>I like lady drivers, thou' generally slow, but r polite n at times help 2 boast up my morale abit, esp. when cruising 2 the different ends of Spore.<br>Basically, guys r better in technical n mechanical stuff which includes driving.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well well........<br>First of all, special thanks for dakar.  But I oredi said I got my own weak points too.<br><br>Why can't we all just look at human in general and not separate them into male and female?  I hate some female lousy road-hogging and indecisive drivers as well as those reckless, inconsiderate, dangerous and who think they are kings of the road male drivers.<br><br>Maybe female and male are born biologically different or socialized to be different.  Thats why they are different!  So respect each other for their difference and each sex is good at some things and bad at others.  There are many individual exceptions within each sex too.  So still.....WE ARE ALL HUMAN BEINGS!!!!<br><br>SO IN GENERAL, I HATE LOUSY DRIVERS REGARDLESS OF SEX !!!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh yes....two more points to add:<br><br>1)We all have bad days (down on luck, lack of sleep, kana jilted....etc).  So why can't others have bad days too?  Some drivers just drive badly on particular days due to some personal reasons?<br>Be more forgiving lah, coz one day, you might the that supposedly "BAD" driver.<br><br>2)Ppl who have licence to drive have their weak and strong areas when it comes to driving.  Some ppl can't reverse properly, some ppl can't parallel park...etc.....<br>Sooo.....dun condemn leh.....<br><br>But hor.....those drivers who are absolutely doing ALL the "common sense" things wrong are unforgivable...<br>heheheheaa....... like those toopid ppl who do toopid things like driving on the extreme right lane at 70km/hr.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>that day i was going to orchard n late for appointment<br>I flag a merc cab...told the uncle i in hurry.. Please try to rush for me...<br><br>Wah~! Ride of my life man.... First time i sat in a taxi at 130km/h<br>reach orchard on time...<br><br>Some taxi drivers are Very GOOD drivers. very stable.<br><br>But there was another occasion....I also in rush, going for school at funan... I flag a cab.. got in, told driver Funan center...<br>then i realized that He must be the favourite student of driving instructor...<br>Basic Theory of driving say should check mirror every 5-10s, speed limit is 80 km but 90 on certain stretch of ecp, kje n aye.. BUT the freaking good driver check blind spot once every 3 sec(imagine a guy driving with head in triangular movement..left, center, right) and the F***ing needle never touch 80.. Kns.... I think i reach earlier if i take mrt siah..<br><br>------------------<br>To luf someone is nothing, to be luf by someone is something, to be luf by the one you luf is everything.....</div>
