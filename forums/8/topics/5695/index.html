            <div class='col-md body'>This is something i cannot figure out...guys..pls enlighten...<br><br>I posted somewhere in this forum about my frd who broke up with a guy after 3 years, not knowing what exactly is in the guy's mind, why he's neglecting her etc. After they broke up, the girl found out that there is a girl who has been leaving intimate messages in the guy's voicemail. Till now (my frd and the guy have already broken up, but still on speaking terms), the guy still insists that the girl is just a close female friend whom he can confide in. The guy even told the my frd that the probability of them (my frd and him) getting back together is not impossible, but it's just not the time now, coz his life is in a mess, and he's having problems with schoolwork etc. Both my frd and him are uni students. What i can't figure out is...<br><br>1. The guy insists that there is nothing going on b/w the close female frd and him, coz the girl already has a bf and the girl is the type who likes more mature, working guys, but my frd has heard msgs of the girl asking him to pick her up, addressing herself as his "lao po" i.e. wife, and saying things like "I miss you". Why does the guy deny the relationship then (if there is any) since my frd and him has already broken up. My frd just want to know the truth, to know wat exactly happened.<br><br>2. The guy refused to tell my frd the name of the girl, but the guy finally told with much reluctance later, although my frd suspects that it's not the real name.<br><br>3. Why does the guy still tell my frd things like he knows of my frd's love for him, and he feels the same towards her, and it's not impossible for them to get back together, just not this semester?<br><br>4. Is it really possible for the guy and the other girl to be just friends???<br><br>pls enlighten...coz i can see that my friend is really at a loss of what to do...she doesnt even really know if the cause of the breakup is due to a third party....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pure speculation would not help to solve this problem. I suppose problems in relationships are due to a lack of communication, or rather poor communication. Sparkle, only your friend can solve this. She has to confront him, alone, and talk about it. Guessing games are totally out of the question.<br><br>------------------<br>This is merely the path I have chosen. You decide yours.</div>
