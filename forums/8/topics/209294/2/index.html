            <div class='col-md body'>I still remember 1 week before Sept 11, i was transiting in Japan from Singapore to LA.<br><br>I carried a pocket knife in my hand carry (before Sept 11, I always carried it). I was allowed to carry the knife from Singapore. But in Japan, when they rechecked my bag again, they confiscated the knife to keep in pilot's saefkeepign and claim from LA SIA office when i reach there.<br><br>It was such a hassle since i was brought into the security office and asked many questions. I was quite pissed and was thinking to myself "what could i have done on the plane with such a harmless looking knife".<br><br>1 week later... such stupid things happen and i came to realised even the plane's butter knife or flimsy penknife can kill 3000 ppl...<br><br>since then, my knife (still the same one), will always travel on my check in lugguage.</div>
