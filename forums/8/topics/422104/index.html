              <p>Just like the chinese from china entering Singapore today, they were very much like our ancestors. Our forefathers first went abroad following the trading routes of Cheng Ho, then during the late Qing dynasty, sailed abroad to escape hardships. And of course when Mao came to power, they fled to escape the oppression of the cultural revolution. And here I am talking about the entire South East Asia, not just Singapore.</p>
              <p>Why did they succeed? Why are there so many successful chinese businessmen in SEA? I think they key is simple. They ventured abroad knowing it's no paradise out there but a lot of toil and sweat. Once they are there, they don't sit on their laurels, not even after succeeding. That's why you see in many countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, Phillipines, Vietnam, Thailand etc.....the chinese call the shots on the economy.</p>
              <p>You'll be surprised when you visit any small town in Indonesia and more often than not, the Chinese boss is always sitting in the background and the workers, at the counter.</p>
              <p>The china nationals who enter singapore today will one day overtake us too....the way immigration policies are going and our Total Fertility Rate at an all time low (expect it to only go lower). That's because they come from an environment of worse hardship than us and are much hungrier to succeed.</p>

              <p>In a speech before the Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chambers of 
              Commerce and Industry, Inc. (FFCCCII) in 1966, he remarked: "I have 
              Chinese blood in me...I am not ashamed to admit that perhaps the great 
              leaders of our country all have Chinese blood."</p>
              <h1 class="entry-title">Thaksin Shinawatra (Thailand)<br></h1>

              <p>Thaksin's great-grandfather Seng Sae Khu (surname ä¸˜ï¼‰was a Hakka Chinese 
              immigrant from Meizhou, Guangdong who arrived in Siam in the 1860s and 
              settled in Chiang Mai in 1908. His eldest son, Chiang Sae Khu, was born 
              in Chanthaburi in 1890 and married a Thai woman, called Saeng Somna. 
              Chiang's eldest son, Sak, adopted the Thai surname Shinawatra ("does 
              good routinely") in 1938 because of the country's anti-Chinese movement 
              and the rest of the family also adopted it.</p>

              <p>This people are all crooks except for <strong>Yap Ah Loy (Malaysia)&lt;dont know who he is.</strong></p>
              <p>The chinese to me, has been drilled in Studies and Money Since the Ying and Yang Times, As for the Indians and Malays the culture is more of way of life and not so much about money and studies, And you can see this in Schools and your Neighbourhood, Malays/indians like the Community lifestyle, Thats why they refer to their nieghbourhood as a Kampong and like hanging out.</p>
              <p>The chinese culture is more money driven, You pray for money and you like to show money.. Etc.. Cars, gadgets going out to nice restaurants, and to get this, there has to be a drive to earn more money, As for the other races, Beauty of your home and Kin-ship and friendship is more important and you have to be happy and Thank ful for the money you earn, Whichever amount that is..</p>
              <p>But end of the Day, What ever race you may be, You are being judged Indivudually and not on a Community level, So who you want to be is all within your own powers and drive to succeed, sometimes with abit of string pulling.</p>
              <p>Anyways, This is all I.M.O, If L.k.y can give his 2cent worth, So can I.</p>

              <p>Thaksin's great-grandfather Seng Sae Khu (surname ä¸˜ï¼‰was a Hakka Chinese immigrant from Meizhou, Guangdong who arrived in Siam in the 1860s and settled in Chiang Mai in 1908. His eldest son, Chiang Sae Khu, was born in Chanthaburi in 1890 and married a Thai woman, called Saeng Somna. Chiang's eldest son, Sak, adopted the Thai surname Shinawatra ("does good routinely") in 1938 because of the country's anti-Chinese movement and the rest of the family also adopted it.</p>

              <h2>OVERSEAS CHINESE
                  A former king of Thailand once famously referred to the overseas Chinese
                   as the "Jews of Asia". But the overseas Chinese have been far more 
                  successful in their domination of many of Asia's economies than the Jews
                   were in Europe. So perhaps the king had it wrong: he should have said 
                  that the Jews are the overseas Chinese of Europe.</h2>
              <p>One of the key factors in the Chinese success was how they settled 
                  across Asia. They did not pour into a particular location, but fanned 
                  out across the region, thus ensuring that they had a ready-made network 
                  of international connections within which they could trade and raise 
                  capital. The legacy today is a web of personal connections that allows 
                  commerce to proceed on the basis of trust - and if anyone betrays the 
                  trust of another, that person is soon frozen out of trade and other 
                  business opportunities. It is a powerful enforcer.</p>
              <p> Commerce like this does not need sound laws to function. This is 
                  why the Chinese have been so astoundingly successful in south-east Asia.
                   For much of the last century, practically all the region was relatively
                   lawless and this has made the networks invaluable. The Singaporean who 
                  trades with a Bangkok relative or other contact knows he will be paid. 
                  Pre-existing networks of trust mean opportunities can be exploited 
                  quickly. while their Western competitors must arrange buyers and letters
                   of credit, losing time and opportunities.</p>
              <p>The ability to do business in those business environments that are so
                   rough that they are no-go areas for anyone else means that the Chinese 
                  get in on the ground floor when an economy is about to take off. It is 
                  the early bird that catches the highest margin. The overseas Chinese 
                  have been instrumental in building up the economies of Cambodia, Burma, 
                  Vietnam and even Laos. They were the first investors to go back into 
                  China, using their family and ancestral links to scout out 
                  opportunities, while multinationals were still trying to find 
                  consultants who could do the same.</p>
              <p>Dialect is important to understanding the Chinese outside China 
                  because it is a key signifier for different cultural groups under the 
                  broader umbrella of Chineseness. Mandarin is the language of northern 
                  China and is the native tongue of almost three-quarters of all Chinese 
                  who live in China, but it is the ancestral tongue of only a tiny 
                  proportion of the Chinese who live in south-east Asia - perhaps less 
                  than 5%. Because most overseas Chinese have their origins in China's 
                  south-east, their languages are the various dialects of that part of 
                  China. However, the written form of the language is the same. In the 
                  absence of a common third language or an interpreter, someone who speaks
                   Cantonese will be able to communicate with a Mandarin speaker by 
                  exchanging written notes.</p>
              <p>- Hokkien is the dialect for those with origins in southern Fujian province</p>
              <p>- Fuzhou is spoken by those from around Fuzhou city in the north-east
                   of Fujian, Hokchia is the closely related dialect of those from the 
                  area around nearby Fuqing and Henghua is the dialect of those from the 
                  Putian area, south of Fuzhou</p>
              <p>- Hainanese (or Qiongwen) is the language of those from Hainan province</p>
              <p>- Cantonese is the ancestral dialect of those with origins in much of Guangdong and Hong Kong</p>
              <p>- Teochiu (or Chiu Chow, as it is spelt in Hong Kong) is spoken by those from the Shantou area of eastern Guangdong</p>
              <p>- Hakka (or Keh) is the language of a group of Chinese sprinkled 
                  throughout northern Guangdong, southern Fujian and further inland</p>
              <p>Particular dialect groups tend to occupy certain business sectors: 
                  the Hokchia-speaking people, for example, were rickshaw drivers and this
                   explains why the largest manufacturer of tyres in Indonesia today is 
                  the Gajah Tunggal Group, owned by the Hokchia Chinese Nursalim family - 
                  they started by supplying and repairing rubber tyres for rickshaws. 
                  Similarly, the medicated ointment Tiger Balm was first manufactured in 
                  the 1920s by the Hakka Chinese Aw family, who lived in Burma at the 
                  time. Historically, Hakka families ran Chinese herbalist and 
                  pharmaceutical shops.</p>
              <p>In alertness to information such as this can help outside investors 
                  to truly understand business in south-east Asia today and how it came to
                   be the way that it is.</p>

              <p>well, as the chinese use to say, if you are not cunning and cruel, you are not a gentleman, base on this, chinese are successful not just mainly on hard work and endurance, they are also cunning, cruel, kill and dare to take whatever risk for the sake of success. Along the way, these successful peoples created many sins, they do not know they make millions suffer because of their action, so, usually you see them end up in some deep shit, for some, the time had yet to come. If i chop a client for $2 for a glass of water, do you think he mind in the midst of his happy drinking condition? That's what chinese are good at, like me, they take opportunities as it come along...</p>
