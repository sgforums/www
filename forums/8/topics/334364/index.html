              <p>Why people cut: My guess is extremely strong emotions.</p>
              <p>Unexplainable intense pain that is overpowering.</p>
              <p>Think of a person locked inside a nailed coffin with no way of escaping. They probably have no idea how to cope and they have no healthy methods for release.</p>
              <p>They think the physical pain from cutting themselves distracts the emotional torment.  Slowly it becomes a habit. Usually happens to girls because the chromosomes have it that they are more emotional than guys. But there are probably emotional guys too.</p>
              <p>I think everyone has emotions, good and bad ones. Confident people can be emotionally intense people as well.</p>
              <p>Finding the proper channel for release is key. Some people confide in friends, others play aggressive sports, some will choose to write or play music, others will let it all out by yelling, slamming and breaking things. Some play violent computer games to relief themselves.</p>
              <p>I think cutting usually starts in teenage years ba. Growing up is tough when you are still trying to figure things out. Emotional literacy is still very raw, with no idea on how to balance or how to react to the pain.</p>
              <p>If you are curious because you know of someone who does it, lend a listening ear. Offer help. Based on what I know people who cut themselves are also usually suicidal.</p>

              <p><br>People cut themselves because they want to get away from the pain and stress they feel. By focuing on the pain of their cuts, they forget about everyhting else that is bad going on around them.</p>
              <p>They also cut themselves because only when they feel the pain, they feel they are alive.</p>
              <p>Another reason could be they feel they lack the control of what is happening around them. But they are able to control the pain when they cut themselves. It makes them feel in control and so they continue to do it.</p>

              <p>My take on people cutting themselves... They're idiots... You feel sad, pitty you, tragic event happen in your life... cutting yourself is the answer? Its not even an answer, it actually creat more problems along with drinking...</p>
              <p>If you face a problem and you are overwhelmed by it... step aside for a while, go east coast with friends... if no friends, enjoy yourself at the arcade or other self activites... but remember to come back to that problem no matter how much it hurts coz that problem is never going to go away if you avoid it... Think of solutions, don't think of running away...</p>

              the ingredient is there for the law to stand. All you need is the complainant for it to work.

              <p>My take on people cutting themselves... They're idiots... You feel sad, pitty you, tragic event happen in your life... cutting yourself is the answer? Its not even an answer, it actually creat more problems along with drinking...</p>
              <p>If you face a problem and you are overwhelmed by it... step aside for a while, go east coast with friends... if no friends, enjoy yourself at the arcade or other self activites... but remember to come back to that problem no matter how much it hurts coz that problem is never going to go away if you avoid it... Think of solutions, don't think of running away...</p>

              <p>Why people cut: My guess is extremely strong emotions.</p>
              <p>Unexplainable intense pain that is overpowering.</p>
              <p>Think of a person locked inside a nailed coffin with no way of escaping. They probably have no idea how to cope and they have no healthy methods for release.</p>
              <p>They think the physical pain from cutting themselves distracts the emotional torment.  Slowly it becomes a habit. Usually happens to girls because the chromosomes have it that they are more emotional than guys. But there are probably emotional guys too.</p>
              <p>I think everyone has emotions, good and bad ones. Confident people can be emotionally intense people as well.</p>
              <p>Finding the proper channel for release is key. Some people confide in friends, others play aggressive sports, some will choose to write or play music, others will let it all out by yelling, slamming and breaking things. Some play violent computer games to relief themselves.</p>
              <p>I think cutting usually starts in teenage years ba. Growing up is tough when you are still trying to figure things out. Emotional literacy is still very raw, with no idea on how to balance or how to react to the pain.</p>
              <p>If you are curious because you know of someone who does it, lend a listening ear. Offer help. Based on what I know people who cut themselves are also usually suicidal.</p>
