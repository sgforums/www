Then i go hala a while he offer to giv me a stand and a 1gb memmory card<br><br>Oh ya i bought other product too , and the price usually negotiatable , but wont be too low also , if u manage to get the price too low , the shopkeeper buey tahan agree , wait until u buy liao then ask u wan to buy the charger anot (actually is 1 set) , and sell u seperately until the price is back to the prevous price  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Dont repeat my mistake</div>

A couple of them (not a liberity to say) have known to recommend some added items to boost up sales, and some strong encourage you to upgrade this, upgrade tat... got one case, customer as this shop to set up the computer for him, so he happy happy brought it home the next day... it work fine till one day when he got it repaired the found out... HDD suppose to be 80gig, is 2 x 40gig, and the processor was overclocked... i also have been cheated, my old Pentium 2 MMX was sold to me as a 233 mhz process, it was only a 200mhz, overclock to 233.<br><br>A couple of them have closed down (or should i say changed name). so do buy with caution... make sure the box is sealed and the warrenty card is valid, if in unsure ask for a new piece.

I got tough time choosing either a smaller Acer Aspire and another Acer Aspire. The small have a webcam. She said that the smaller one is better as it could play games but will tend to overheat, She recomended to buy the normal one and I'm happy with the results.
