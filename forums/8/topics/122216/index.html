This is more so for Uni than for poly and Uni requires you to read materials from outside your lecture notes.<br><br>Also, uni generally requires you to take a more analytical and critical approach in answering qns.

Like i said, self-study is paramount. Lectures are not and should not be meant to deliver the course to you in its entirety. It merely provides you with the scope. The rest is up to you.<br><br>While in poly, you may not need to refer to sources outside of your lecture notes, the fact remains that you need yo study those notes in order to learn anything.</div>

How can students be engaged in the subject if they dunno what the hell they are doing? During m poly days, i spent much time qn the need to learn matrices, laplace transforms and statics &amp; Kinetics? - Esp statics &amp; Kinetics? because i know the formulas are being applied to simplistically to have any real world application.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by HanHao:<br>can anyone give good details on how school life on these 2 schools differ?</blockquote>School life is not too different in terms of the freedom you are given, but a university syllabus (coupled with pre-university education) would naturally be more demanding, and would require more self-discipline when it comes to study.<br><br>If you're not tight on finances and have grades good enough to enter university, then it is probably a safer ('kiasu') choice to take the university route. You'd spend more time and effort, but generally you could have a better headstart in your career with a degree than with a diploma.<br><br>Of course there would always be people who would have a different opinion.

            <div class='col-md body'>If i am not wrong, poly and uni  are not much diff<br><br>Being a poly grad myself, i think poly pple are spoonfed while in uni emphasis is placed on professionalism and higher order of study.<br><br>But to look at it from another angle , nowadays employers prefer to hire poly/ite grads due to lower wages paid.This was not the case 15 years ago where the trend was to go JC and then to uni.If u cant follow this route, u are considered out and lose face.<br><br>But in the end watever route u take , i think hard work and preserverance is still more important to being successful in your career.</div>
