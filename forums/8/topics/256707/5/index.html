Indeed in America, for undergraduate studies, more emphasis is placed on extra/co-curricular activities which the candidate partakes in.<br><br>For admission to law schools however, it is a much more strictly regulated process. Fairly, candidates would have to submit inter alia, complete transcripts of results, past work experience, testimonials, multiple essays etc however, nothing weighs quite as heavily as results and LSAT scores.<br><br>If the law school which you are applying for has a 165 LSAT cut off with a 3.75 GPA minimum, achievements might compensate for a 164 LSAT score with a 3.72 GPA.<br><br>However, as the law is a postgraduate course in America, most of the candidates would be coming from not only brilliant academic backgrounds, but have extensive practical experience. Some people who choose to do law at a later stage in their life would be coming with life/work experience that would easily go on for pages and pages, but that's nothing unexpected.<br><br>LSATs on the other hand are the definitive guide to how one will perform in law school; the teaching method is very different - the socrates method of learning by asking is the predominant medium of instruction and there's no better way to filter out those who will "get it" from those who won't, than the LSATs.<br><br>I don't decide what's tier one; the US News &amp; World Reports publishes the definitive guide to law schools - and of course, your alma matter is part of the tier one law schools.<br><br>In relation to UK law schools, grades are foremost for Oxbridge, as well as the top few universities, including (non-exhaustive) the LSE, Durham (currently ranked top law school in the UK), and UoL (note UoL's prestige is sliding fast, so arguably, this is no longer a top university). However, all the other second rate institutions such as Uni of Newcastle, Uni of Manchester etc., you'd get by with average A level grades, and it would not take alot to graduate with 2nd upper class honours.<br><br>However, whilst the Singapore bar is very very lenient and tender towards UK universities and law schools (the list is incredulous), they are much meaner to US and Australian legal graduates. Last I checked, only the top 4 law schools in the States were approved, and you would have to rank in the top 40% of your graduating cohort; for Australia, more law schools are recognised (but again, these are only the best each state has to offer - e.g. New South Wales - UNSW and UniSyd), but you would have to rank in the top 30% - and this is much harder to achieve.<br><br>In fact, the Singapore bar has recently made a move to recognise Aus graduates who rank in the top 70% but again, this is no easy feat to achieve when everyone around you came in with a HSC score of 99.0/100. Further, they only recognise these Aus grads if they have 3 years of practical experience in a legal field, but seeing that they cannot be associates, this often means that these grads have to be clerks, drawing minimal pay.<br><br>What happens then? Alot of people as far I know leave Singapore; no point being second rate in this country - they easily find employment with large-megafirms in Hong Kong, Australia or the UK; PR comes just as easy. I say this with no offence to our government which I greatly respect for excellent governance.<br><br>Unless the Singapore Bar reconsiders its harsh stance towards our locals from US/AU law schools, we will end up with not only a shortage of lawyers, but find that our better talents are leaving for greener pastures.</div>

It's very much different from a general degree like that in philosophy, or business management etc. Of course, if you have a b.a. from yale, you'd probably be hard pressed to think of a reason why you should put yourself through another 3/4 years of hell with law school, or even worse, 5 years with med school.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by rmyfrm:</div><div class="quote_body">I will not deny that GPA is subject to the college attended; again, referring back to what I said, it's better to have an average GPA from a recognised institution, than to graduate magna cum laude from a shythole. However, the use of LSATs IS and will be the most important determining factor. Indeed exceptions are made from time to time, but the LSATs nonetheless are always looked at and considered. If you're seeking a full/partial ride through any of the tier1s, you must have an LSAT of at least 168 - sure there'd be minority scholarships etc, but the LSAT score is always the frontrunning method of evaluating a potential candidate's aptness for a legal education.<br><br>With regards to people going to law school, I never mentioned that people going into law school were doing so based on the fact that they were prepared for hell. All I said was that law school is no walk in the park. Everyone who goes through law school genuinely wants a legal education, but for reasons varying.<br><br>This is the internet, I may be hiding behind a moniker just like you, but trust me, I'm in a position to comment about law schools; as you'll see, I've never discussed any other faculty because it is not my place .. but law schools ..<br><br>Did you attend law school? Universty and graduating class?</div></blockquote>Unless you're telling me you've sat on the adcoms of the tier 1 law schools, I don't think you know any more about admissions to American law schools than I do - I'm in the midst of preparing the applications myself, so I obviously know what I'm talking about.<br><br>What you've suggested in your post is nothing more than stuff spun off the rumour-mill and common sense deductions which I've heard a thousand times over right from my undergraduate days - and I'm not saying you're lying, but your account hardly contradicts admission cases I've seen first hand.<br><br>Needless to say, by the law of averages, the better your GPA and LSAT scores are, the higher your chances of admission - that's not rocket science. The whole idea of there being a cutoff is just ridiculous - that's born out by people I know who have been admitted to 2 of those 4 law schools I singled out as being widely regarded as among the 4 finest law schools in the US. In essence, a strict correlation between GPAs and LSATs guarded by cutoffs dictating one's admission is just something I find completely ridiculous.<br><br>Likewise, what determines if law school is a walk in the park? It's all a matter of perception and aptitude and ultimately, it's all down to the individual.<br><br>For all your self-acclaimed expertise on the law school admission process, what law school(s) have you attended?</div>

That comes in the form of your GPA from your undergraduate studies.<br><br>Just like the system adopted widely, a high GPA would naturally translate to a higher class of honours.</div>
