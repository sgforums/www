The award conferred is not a LLB (Bachlelor of Laws; often commonwealth countries), it's a JD (Juris Doctor). You can't enter an American law school fresh out of A-levels.<br><br>2) In addition to having a crazy high GPA and straight-A studies leading to this point your life, you would have to undertake the LSAT; for a tier-1 american law school, roughly, you would have to rank between the 97th-99th percentile.<br><br>3) With regards costs, they are incredibly high.

Don't settle for less.<br><br>In Singapore, we have two cultures running parallel but not against each other:<br><br>1) Go for as much value that you can get.<br><br>This is seen in every aspect of our life; from shopping to education - a student will make his choice of course and institution based on his results.<br><br>2) If you can't get the best, settle for second place.<br><br>Hence the stigma attached to dentistry as a reflection of society's perception.<br><br>-<br><br>While not in any way wrong, taking them to the extreme will only have you grumbling about your future like many Singaporeans. Do what you want to do and have no regrets about pursuing that course. Dentistry is indeed an honourable profession, but if you're undertaking it only because you didn't get into medicine, then please reconsider your decision. You will find that the course fees for medicine/dentistry in Singapore is not too far from medicine/dentistry overseas. This is not like any other faculty.<br></div>
