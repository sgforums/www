DBS is a GLC. It operates under Temasek holdings, the investment arm of the local government. POSB was started by the British government to encourage citizens to save.

DBS argued based on this basis too citing the fact that we should start using its internet banking facilities.. and that will greatly reduce queues. But in the midst of POSB users, a huge majorities are heartlanders including our parents and grandparents who could hardly read, much less surfing the web!<br><br><blockquote><strong>I still remember the BIG HooHA when they wanted to charge banking fees, but after sometime people get used to it and just keep quiet about the whole thing. </strong></blockquote>What else can the people do other than keeping quiet? Profits was never 1st priority on POSB's agenda. POSB never competed on the same grounds with the rest of the banks. In fact it operated more like a statutory board until it merged with DBS. It was an awkward merger.<br><br>What we lost was a facility the likes of a public library.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Does it affect us to queue 15 mins to draw cash or wait an hour to pay bills?  Not really, unless I have to do it twice a day OR if I work in a bank.  But hor, if I don't eat or cannot shit once a day, or lose my sleep.... that's a nightmare!    :p</strong></blockquote>It does.. loads in fact. How do you figure out this logic, that when a free and efficient service suddenly become a less effective paid service? When you find that you now have to pay $2 a month to queue.. and stand instead of sit while you wait it just don't make sense at all.<br><br>Its no wonder why DBS had become this unpopular. The hostile bid for OUB aggravated it even furthur. By lending a helping hand to OUB, UOB's Wee Chong Yaw sent the message across, that non-GLC coporations can stand together to ward off the GLC empire. Look beyond dollars and cents and you realize that this isn't merely a matter of profits. Its no wonder why this move was cheered not only in the coporate world but also by citizens.<br><br>As keeping quiet about changes that are non-beneficial to the people at large, and keeping quiet about matters that are of no direct concern to yourself.. Pastor Niemoeller has this to say.<br><br>Â“First they came for the Communists, but I was not a Communist so I did not speak out. Then they came for the Socialists and the Trade Unionists, but I was neither, so I did not speak out. Then they came for the Jews, but I was not a Jew so I did not speak out. And when they came for me, there was no one left to speak out for me.Â”<br><br>Â—Martin Niemoeller</div>

The government is instrumental in providing an approriate economical climate, and that is totally different from trying to have hands in every business.<br><br>It is a correct approach to strengthen local banks to prepare them for competition globally.
