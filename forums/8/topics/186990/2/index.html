For a while, Creative basked in the limelight, reporting strong sales and good reviews of its Zen Micro MP3 players. Mr Sim even took swipes at Apple: when Apple launched its iPod Shuffle in January this year, he laughed it off as a 'huge disappointment'.<br><br>In its latest financial results, Creative suffered a 72 per cent plunge in quarterly earnings as the fight for a share of the digital music player market exacted a huge toll on its profitability. While sales for the third quarter ended March 31, 2005 rose 65 per cent to a record US$333.8 million, Creative earned just US$1.1 million for the quarter, excluding investment gains, down from US$8.7 million in the previous year.<br><br>Sharp price cuts of Apple's iPod mini and the introduction of the iPod Shuffle - which Mr Sim had written off just a few months ago - pushed Creative's gross margins to 23 per cent, below its forecast of 27 per cent. Worse still, analysts pointed out, net margins were terribly thin at just above zero.<br><br>Strategy too hopeful?<br><br>Creative's response to the dismal earnings is to do more of the same: it will sell more and more MP3 players, hoping that the growth in sales will compensate for the fall in margins and profitability. There are holes in this strategy, however.<br><br>For one, while Creative has produced some of the strongest rivals to the iPod, Apple still leads the hard disk drive music player market by a wide margin. Analysts estimate that Apple, which shipped 5.31 million iPods in the March quarter, has a 60 to 70 per cent world market share. Apple has also encroached on Creative's market for MP3 players based on flash memory chips with the launch of the iPod Shuffle. The iPod Shuffle, now acknowledged by industry players as a masterly stroke, serves a sharp reminder that Apple wouldn't just sit pat and watch its market share slip away.<br><br>Second, sales growth may not be enough to make up for rapidly falling prices and profit margins in the MP3 market. To sell more in a fiercely competitive market, Creative will have to lower its prices. It would also have to respond to any price cuts by Apple. And Creative does not compete with Apple alone. Japanese, South Korean, Taiwanese and even Chinese companies are also gunning for a slice of the MP3 pie.
