            <div class='col-md body'>Liu Bei (161-223)<br><br>Liu Bei, commonly called Liu Xuande, was a descendant of Prince Zhongshanjing. Liu Bei was born in Hebei Province. Started his life as a shoemaker and a weaver of mats, he made his name against the Yellow Turban Uprising and fought in wars all around China, finally becoming the first emperor of Shu.<br><br>Liu Bei was noted for his loyalty to friends and his respect to the talents. He met Guanyu and Zhangfei and became sworn brothers at the Peach Garden and vowed to combine their strengths and efforts to restore peace and order to the country. Another much-told story said that he ever paid three visits to the home of Zhuge Liang, one of the most resourceful men in history. In the end, with sincerity and persuasion from Liu Bei, Zhuge Liang gave up his seclusion and spent the rest of his life assisting the Shu rulers to govern the Kingdom.<br><br>In 208 AD, Liu Bei adopted the suggestion of Zhuge Liang and carried out a joint military action with the Wu Kingdom against the attacks of the powerful Wei Kingdom. The alliance had the final victory. And further on, Liu Bei occupied the vast land in present Sichuan and Shaanxi Provinces and thus reinforced the regime of Shu.<br><br>In 221 AD, Liu Bei crowned himself the King of Shu in present Chengdu City. The next year, he broke the alliance treaty and commanded the army downstream the Yangtze River to attack the Wu Kingdom. However, the Shu army lost the battle. On the way of their retreat, Liu Bei died at Baidicheng, in present Chongqing City.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guan Yu, styled Yunchang (originally Changsheng), was a Xie native from Hedong, and was once a fugitive on the run in the Zhuo commandery. Liu Bei was recruiting people in the village and Guan Yu and Zhang Fei then assisted him to fight against invasions. Liu Bei became the Chancellor of Pingyuan and Guan Yu and Zhang Fei majors to help govern the district.<br><br>Liu Bei and the two of them shared the same bed and they were like brothers to one another. Guan YuÂ’s devotion to Liu Bei could be seen through many actions like when many were sitting, he would be standing close to Liu Bei to assist him, etc and he would faithfully follow Liu Bei through all the dangers and not escaping the difficulties. When Liu Bei killed Che Zhou, the governor of Xuzhou, he commanded Guan Yu to take care of the governing matters of Xiapi City, whilst he himself resided in Xiaopei..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Zhang Fei, styled Yide, was a native of Zhuo commandery, and had dealings with Guan Yu and Liu Bei during his earlier days. Guan Yu was older than him by several years hence Zhang Fei treated him like an elder brother.<br><br>Liu Bei served Cao Cao during the annexation of LÃ¼ Bu. During this time, Zhang Fei followed Liu Bei to Xu (Du), and Cao Cao appointed him as Zhonglang Jiang. Subsequently, Liu Bei went against Cao Cao to join Yuan Shao and Liu Biao.<br><br>In the beginning, Zhang Fei was deemed to be inferior to Guan Yu despite his strength and might, but Wei advisors like Cheng Yu claimed that Guan Yu and Zhang Fei were Â“capable of fighting ten thousand menÂ”. Guan Yu was good to his subordinates but arrogant toward the rest of the officials, on the contrary, Zhang Fei was respectful toward the gentlemen but abusive toward his inferiors.<br><br>Liu Bei often reminded him, Â“You [Zhang Fei] kill excessively and often whip your soldiers. Beware that one day you would be in trouble with your subordinates.Â” Zhang Fei was worried but he did not reform.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chen ShouÂ’s final thoughts on the Five Tiger Generals: Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, etc were known to be powerful generals who could fight ten thousand men and accredited to be among the best of their times.<br><br>Guan Yu repaid Lord CaoÂ’s favour, Zhang FeiÂ’s releasing of Yan Yan out of righteousness were deeds held in high esteem in the country. However, Guan Yu was unyielding and overly self-respect, whereas Zhang Fei was hot-tempered and without kindness, their short-comings leading to their defeats.<br><br>This is common logic indeed. Ma Chao betrayed the minority tribes and lacked courage; he was a disappointment for his people, what a pity! Having been able to rise from rags to riches, is this not better?<br><br>Huang Zhong and Zhao Yun both strong and valiant were good subordinates of their lord, like the claws and teeth to a beast. Can they not compare to the likes of Guan Yin and Xiahou Yin?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>some facts and myths here..<br><br>1. Guan Yu didn't defeat Hua Xiong at the Fan Shui Guan, Sun Jian did.<br><br>2. Guan Yu's little gofer Zhou Cang isn't real.<br><br>3. There is no historical record of Cao Cao slaughtering Xuzhou's citizens on the march towards Tao Qian's castle.<br><br>4. Zhuge Liang didn't "borrow" the arrows from Cao Cao. It was Sun Quan who had his boats shot at by Cao, then decided to turn the boats around to collect arrows to prevent the boats from capsizing. (SGZ -- Sun Quan)<br><br>5. Zhou Yu wasn't the petty fellow who was jealous of Zhuge Liang at every turn. In fact, he was known for his generousity and bigness of heart. (SGZ -- Zhou Yu)<br><br>6. Lady Sun wasn't the dedicated wife that she was. In fact, she terrorised the neighbourhood so much when she crossed the River with Liu Bei that Liu Bei had to get Zhao Yun to make sure that she didn't wreak havoc. (SGZ -- Zhao Yun, also in Fa Zheng's bio I think?)<br><br>7. Diao Chan wasn't real; only "a serving maid" was mentioned as being a source of conflict between Dong Zhuo and LÃ¼ Bu. (SGZ -- LÃ¼ Bu)<br><br>8. Xu Shu didn't go over to Cao Cao because of a feigned letter by Cheng Yu -- he went over sometime during the Changban battles (I think this is from ZGL's bio?).<br><br>9. Zhuge Liang couldn't do "magic"<br><br>10. Huang Gai thought up the fire plan at Chi Bi.<br><br></div>
