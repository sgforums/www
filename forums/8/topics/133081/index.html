            <div class='col-md body'>Just got the polling results for the upgrading programme at Clementi Ave 4 , the addition of the utility room was not successful =(<br><br>ARGH! I thought it is worth to get that additional utility room for just about $10 000 , somemore the room space was bigger with more windows and better ventilation.<br><br>However, from what I gather .... many residents had the misconception that they have to pay about $3000 for the standard package (eg lifts , pipes, toilets etc) PLUS $13000 for the addition of utility room . But actually that $13000 include the standard package already.<br><br>How ah... maybe I make noise now also too late, cannot do anything also. But i thought is a waste if pple vote against it because of this misconception  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nice name for a usless store room.<br><br>Actually I've seen the months and months of suffering from noise, dust and whatever you name it and paying so much for such a small extra space that you cannot rent, and its not gonna be useful.  Forget about space or airiness. Its all untrue.<br><br>My old place, the lift upgrade took 3 yrs 3 contractors - 3 years of suffering and lift break downs.  And in the end, we end up with kids playing in the lift, people abusing the lift by pressing every button, or peeing/vomit in lift... Worse!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You should be glad that you don't have the utility room. The new room I had is airy, but it is next to the toilet and kitchen. It definitely a bad 'feng shui'.<br><br>Till now, I had spent no nights in that room.<br><br>I advise you to  be more involved in your precinct upgrading. Watch closely for any delays and feedback and document all your findings and correspondence. The best is to picture the progress.<br><br>For 2.5 years, my precinct still undergoing upgrading. Surbana and contractors never feel sorry that the residents have to bear with those inconveniences:<br><br>a. For 2.5 years, 3 lifts still undergoing upgrading.<br><br>b. They could simply overwritten the expected lifts completion date, from May 2005 to June 2005.<br><br>c. They might told you that contractors are not able to use the passenger lifts, and yet you might end up with the workers in the same lifts.<br><br>d. And despite 3 lifts still undergoing upgrading, workers still use the lifts.<br><br>e. Don't mistaken that the contractors are over zealous that they send workers to do some knockings on a Saturday morning at 0800h. They probably had received complaints over their progress.<br><br>f. Don't get too worked up when there is only 1 worker doing all the knockings on a Saturday morning. Even though you questioned the progress the sole worker can make, the contractor may say that if you can't stand the noice for 1 worker, can you stand it if 2 workers are working?<br><br>g. Pray hard that your contractor have solid backings. Pray hard that contractor will not go bust.<br><br>h. If your precinct has only 2 blocks, don't be mistaken that your upgrading can be completed much earlier.<br><br>i. You will understand the power of media, how a progress can be expedite. And how the progress died down when the news died now as well.<br><br>j. Prepare mosquitoes coils. You might stay on 20 storey, believe me, you still need mosquitoes coils.<br><br>k. Don't squeal when you see rats rattling around your neighbourhood.<br><br>l. Breath hard, you might be smelling some poopoo somewhere.<br><br>m. New lifts may break down more often.<br><br>So I would advise you to be more involved in your precinct upgrading. Seek a black and white on the expected completion date. What you see from HDB website may be an optismistic guess. And not just expection completion date of the whole upgradings, rather completion date of each milestones, like completion of lift upgradings, completion of paintings, completion of re-wiring, completion of new letter boxes, completion of lifts lobbies, completion of the amphitheatre, completion of roof railings, completion of hand railings, completion of shelters.....<br><br>Holding on to the completion dates, keep your mp updates of each progress.<br><br>Again pray hard. Pray real hard.<br><br>Don't get too worked up when another nearby precinct make more progress than yours.<br><br>They may meant 70% but it could be only 40% completed for you.<br><br>Welcome to the world of agony!!!<br></div>
