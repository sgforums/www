            <div class='col-md body'>IF THE so-called Reds renaissance under Gerard Houllier is to become a long-term reality, then Liverpool fans could argue justifiably that it began at Anfield last night.<br><br>Forget the half-hearted League Cup triumph over inferior opposition. The Premiership is the real yardstick and Manchester United is the team to beat.<br><br>For the first time in seven years at Anfield, Liverpool achieved that objective, defeating the most dominant side of the 90s 2-0.<br><br>Having won at Old Trafford earlier in the season, this was the Reds' first League double over their old rivals for 22 years.<br><br>But these statistics may pale into insignificance.<br><br>Ultimately, soccer historians may claim that this contest, coupled with Liverpool's Old Trafford win, marked the slow reversal of fortunes for both sides - the beginning of the end for United and just the beginning for Liverpool.<br><br>Make no mistake, United came off second-best to Liverpool in every department.<br><br>Considering Liverpool has a fixture pile-up that surpasses even United's, it attacked with conviction.<br><br>Handling the treacherous rain better, Steven Gerrard and Danny Murphy shackled Nicky Butt and Ryan Giggs effectively.<br><br>Having returned from injury, Giggs was a spectator for most of the match.<br><br>But United suffered the most damage before the match when Alex Ferguson decided to rest Jaap Stam.<br><br>His absence allowed the Reds to penetrate United's defence at will.<br><br>In the third minute, Robbie Fowler's long-range effort curled wide and Sami Hyypia saw two headers saved by Fabien Barthez.<br><br>A somewhat-subdued United had a couple of chances, but Dwight Yorke's header bounced over and a Giggs drive was saved by Sander Westerveld.<br><br>It soon became obvious that the deadlock would be broken by the home side.<br><br>And what a stunning strike it was from one of England's most exciting young players.<br><br>Gerrard's troublesome back forced his withdrawal from England's squad against Albania last week.<br><br>But England's loss was certainly Liverpool's gain when the rejuvenated midfielder almost broke the net in the 16th minute.<br><br>Collecting a lay-off from Robbie Fowler some 25 metres from goal, he unleashed a right-footed shot with such ferocity that Barthez was left grasping at thin air.<br><br>A second goal looked inevitable and should have arrived on the half-hour mark, but Emile Heskey's low shot was saved by Barthez.<br><br>It was left to the Reds' captain to remind Eriksson that he should still occupy that coveted striking role alongside Michael Owen.<br><br>In the 40th minute, Gerrard, who else, sent in a deep cross, which Gary Neville looked set to clear.<br><br>But the slippery conditions contributed to an embarrassing slip, leaving Fowler time to trap the ball and smash it past the stranded Barthez with his customary aplomb.<br><br>That goal killed the contest as a viewing spectacle.<br><br>Considering Liverpool has lost only once at Anfield in the Premiership this season, United was left with a huge mountain to climb.<br><br>And the obstacle came in the form of Finnish international Hyypia.<br><br>He was magnificent at the back, covering every blade of grass in and around his penalty box and ensured that Yorke had a comparatively quiet afternoon.<br><br>The great Liverpool sides of the 70s and 80s were renowned for their ability to 'close shop' at Anfield and now, finally, Houllier has built a side that displays that defensive hallmark.<br><br>The tireless midfield work of Gerrard and Murphy was soured slightly when the latter was sent off in the 69th minute for two late tackles.<br><br>Surely now, United, famed for its comebacks, would produce another?<br><br>Yorke had two late efforts saved, but it was not to be the Red Devils' day.<br><br>Whenever they play, there is always a confident side on display, which defends its lead with little difficulty - only this time, it was their opponent, the old enemy. And that will hurt.<br><br>When both managers left at the final whistle, Ferguson walked off hurriedly, ahead of a jubilant Houllier, who was just behind.<br><br>He had no choice. The pragmatic Scot knows that the quiet Frenchman is getting closer all the time.<br><br>----------------<br>MAN OF THE MATCH</div>
