Each night, the voice gets louder and louder..At first it may sound gibberish and my auntie's family thought its just their imagination or some sounds from outside..Then, like a month later..the child's voice becomes very clear and very very audible albeit in Russian...<br><br>Then, this cousin who bought the soft toy asked his friend, who's a russian exchange student, to stay overnight and translate what "it" was saying..Found out that the toy was saying "Let me out..Do not let me die...Let me out" in russian  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Immediately, my cousin's family freaked out and they flung the toy outside from their floor (12th i think) and they thought it was over...10 minutes later, my cousin's sister with her small son came home and that kid was holding the same toy...<br><br>Then, my auntie consulted a relative who's well versed in such occultism and immediately, dissected the soft toy...when the toy was torn apart..they found an intact black egg!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  the black is really black..not painted or burnt..then that relative of mine cracked the egg and found a foetus...<br><br>scary sia</div></blockquote>real meh?</div>
