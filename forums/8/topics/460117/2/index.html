              <p>Every other immigration autrhority in the world that I have come
              across, including third world and communist would have phoned the
              contact/boyfriend etc to ascertain the status. Not the arseholes in
              the <span>ICA</span> though.</p>
              <p>Secondly, there is an agreement between nations of <span>ASEA</span>. It is not stated as being based on further
              restrictions and compliance. Please feel free to look it up before
              making further uninformed comment. The <span>ICA</span> is
              basically applying pre visa requiremnts to an agreed reciprocal
              free movement protocol.</p>

              <p>As I have said many times, she does not have any previous
              problems in singapore. Nada, nothing, zilch, zero.<br> She was here once with her now deceased husband on a holiday.</p>
              <p>It is puerly the <span>ICA</span> applying thier own
              whim. Nothing more.<br> Dont believe me then please google ‘denied access to sinngapre’ and
              see how many thousand of unsubstantiated cases there are. These are
              just the ones reported.</p>

              <p> the denied access thing seem to affect the same group. and like lemon said, the KL stay might have caused problem as well.</p>
              <p>it's a common known "trick" that's used to "reset" the stay duration.</p>

              All
              
              As I said in the first place, the criteria for the denial is obviously based on profiling her by gender, age, race, and yes the fact that she was in Malaysia before coming here.
              
              Somehow I doubt that an Australian female back packer, single, having spent the last months in Thailand and Malaysia, coming to Singapore without a booked hotel, with only a couple of dollars and a credit card in her pocket would be stopped by immigration here. Anybody think she would be?
              
              Any way, I will not be bringing my girl back here to Singapore. She has to go back to her work as a self employed estate agent so I am going up to Ha Noi shortly to stay in the house she owns for a few days, to meet her son who I have talked to, and her mother who lives with her and looks after the son when she is away. 
              Hopefully we can get some time to do the tourist bit in Viatnam together. We might even get to the Philharmonic orchestra in Ha Noi which I know she likes because I first met her at the Dewan Philharmonic Concert Hall in K.L.CC Petronas twin towers while she was on holiday with her girl friends. 
              She has a very unusual profile for a confirmed prostitute!
              
              I doubt I will return to Singapore, next stop, brefly home in France and then back to work in
              Brazil.
              
              I thank all of you who have made sensible and helpfull comments and for those who just like to post nonsense 'troblemaker' get a life.

              <p><br>self employed as a housing agent?i guess thats where part of her credibility lies in to the immigration officers.and with her stay in kl with that job of hers..it sounds like she unemployed and would werk as a hooker from a developing countries as seen by most of her viet girls often found werking in spore as hookers.</p>
              <p>she should simply come from a developed country holding a job or d a credit card would directorships of a few companies and factories in oirder to satisfy the immigration officers.</p>
              <p>for australian coming to spore after she booked a hotel in her own name is good to the immigration officers.i would say your girlfried should have booked a hotel in her name to lessen the complications.if u are not married to her...what the heck are u booking for her a hotel in singapore for?if she stays in the hotel,its she should have her name on the hotel list.u must think singapore is a playground where unmarried immoral couples from all over the world can go n do what u please.hell..u wouldnt even get into the usa let alone singapore with all the strictness involved.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>its partially your fault as u were the one who booked the hotel in your name.if u did that in the uk,any UK immigration officer would have denied entry to yer galfriend too.it makes no sense whatsoever.</p>
              <p>maybe when u land in vietnam,u should let your viet gal book a hotel under her name.hell...the viet immigration officers would think you are part of the monty phyton group even!u be lucky they dont question u.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>its a case where u goofed up making u look like a pimp and everyone got a hardtime by your acts , decisions and failure.</p>

              <p>i think u goofed up b4 she even landed in singapore.its really your fault n not hers.u gave the impression to the immigration singapore that she was not a genuine tourist.its bad enough she self employed but with u putting accomodation under your name,it made her look strange in the eyes of officals anywhere on this planet n not in spore.</p>
              <p>im sure if u did that in brazil,japan,germany,usa,australia or norway u would get the same result!u could try laos or cambodia...im sure these countries would let anyone in without questioining.</p>

              <p>next time,anyone needs to go anywhere to any country that u have no residence........make sure u have a few directorships of a few companies around the world complete with a business registry number.because once u reach the gate of immigration and your card says self employed.....high chance u would be treated worse than dirt be it in  singapore,malaysia,asean or any other country be it all the way to timbuctoo!</p>

              I was going to reply suitably but I had a look at your prolifc past posts and realised you had not said anything sensible in any of them. Not only are your posts irrational, they are ill condiered and border line racist and sexist.
              You appear to have a problem with Singapore and the Singapore government. In fact you have left Singapore to work elsewhere and say you will not be back.
              
              I was taught never to argue with an idiot. He will bring you down to his own level and beat you with experince.
              
              I am not going to argue with you!

              <p>As I said in the first place, the criteria for the denial is
              obviously based on profiling her by gender, age, race, and yes the
              fact that she was in Malaysia before coming here.</p>
              <p>Somehow I doubt that an Australian female back packer, single,
              having spent the last months in Thailand and Malaysia, coming to
              Singapore without a booked hotel, with only a couple of dollars and
              a credit card in her pocket would be stopped by immigration here.
              Anybody think she would be?</p>
              <p>Any way, I will not be bringing my girl back here to Singapore.
              She has to go back to her work as a self employed estate agent so I
              am going up to Ha Noi shortly to stay in the house she owns for a
              few days, to meet her son who I have talked to, and her mother who
              lives with her and looks after the son when she is away.<br> Hopefully we can get some time to do the tourist bit in Viatnam
              together. We might even get to the Philharmonic orchestra in Ha Noi
              which I know she likes because I first met her at the Dewan
              Philharmonic Concert Hall in K.L.CC Petronas twin towers while she
              was on holiday with her girl friends.<br> She has a very unusual profile for a confirmed prostitute!</p>
              <p>I doubt I will return to Singapore, next stop, brefly home in
              France and then back to work in<br> Brazil.</p>

              and for those who just like to post nonsense ‘troblemaker’ get a
              life.</p>

              <p>And how do you know that those items were not stolen before they
                  arrived in Singapore? You’re clearly letting your anger get the
                  better of your judgment. That previous topic was closed because
                  there were no new replies for 3 months.</p>
              <p>Bob: I dont but seams unlikely that in the one hour from K.L. it
                  was opened and items taken. More likely to have been opened in the
                  4 days it was missing/lost.</p>
              <p>You’re free to air your grievances here but you probably won’t
                  get any answers or closure. We can only make guesses that aren’t
                  clouded by emotions. In Asia, “transparency” does not mean you’ll
                  get all the details you want. However, people don’t get rejected
                  twice based on whims, which means (1) something else is amiss, (2)
                  it has been documented by the <span>ICA</span>, and (3)
                  your grilfriend is not meant to know how to get around it. Either
                  she is hiding something, or the officers are just following orders
                  from above. At worst they’re just like the <span>TSA</span>.</p>
              <p>Bob: There is nothing else amis. She does not have a criminal
                  record anywhere and has not been deported from Singapore, she is
                  not hiding anything.<br> Transparancy means exactly that. All pertinent details should be
                  made available. I know Singapore is a closed society more akin to a
                  police state than a democracy. You as the Singaporean do not
                  realise this. More like the goldfish looking out of his bowl does
                  not realise that his bowl is not the world and that he is the
                  prisoner.<br> I would not object if were not that there is supposed to be a clear
                  agreement inder <span>ASEA</span> that visas are not
                  required for Singaporeans. If they were then we would have arranged
                  one before hand. What is the point of having a reciprocal agreement
                  if it ony works one way?</p>

              <p>"More likely" but you don't know for sure, period. It could've been rummaged 
                  in any of the 3 countries it was in.</p>
              <p>How can you say there's nothing amiss when you don't even know the full 
                  picture? Do you know who she's connected with back home? Is what you know 
                  simply based on what she tells you? You weren't there the first time to she how she answered (through no fault of your own, I guess). A reciprocal agreement doesn't mean we're 
                  obliged to take all and sundry, and it's the same for the other signatories.</p>
              <p>You've never been turned away before, therefore you're only assuming that every other country will contact you. Sorry, champ, but you should've continued your Google search, otherwise you'd know that this thing you call a "whim" is actually judgment and gut feeling, and ALL immigration officials around the world use it even in the absence of a record. And after the first encounter they make a record, in case you try something different in the future.</p>
              <p>Any of these stunts you and your girlfriend tried wouldn't have worked in Israel, the US or England either. Hopefully you'll never have to experience the truth yourself, it's most unpleasant to be put in a glass box screaming about your rights just because you're linked to someone who was at Hillsborough this week (just sayin').</p>
              <p>Every Vietnamese visitor and student I've met here is proof that our border control is not  singling them out for discimination. Heck, some of them stayed here for only a night or two without a hitch. It's just too bad that your girlfriend's past, connections, behaviour or circumstances in the first incident seemed fishy enough to put her on the blacklist.</p>
              <p>You don't know me well enough either to say that I'm oblivious to what we 
                  live in, but I'm glad that the policies of this "police state" allows me to go on a holiday without a visa most of the time. However, whatever you've written here demonstrates that you left behind a chunk of your brain somewhere on your travels.</p>
