Then will donate 65% of all profit earnings from all the chain of kopitiams and cybercafe to the charity every month. 10% as a bonus to all staff for the company.and 25% to upkeep the company of course.  Well at least I create jobs for others. Hehehee.<br><br>Then buy a nice car like toyota soluna will do and a house like a 5room flat or a condominium at most(no bungalow for me) and live happily.  Not forgetting to travel thrice in a year.  And not forgetting to wired up my home into a high tech home with very fast internet access and very fast PC to chat with you guys here.<br><br>Maybe open up another a medium non profitable internet and computer company to help the needy to learn about internet and computers.  Then open up some private educational institution and provide heavy discount or subsidiary to students whom can't afford school fees.<br><br>As for the interest that I earn from the Swiss bank, just keep toping it up.  Till I see a nice potential chap comes by and I will sponsor $1million for him to setup his own business.<br><br>The next thing I will do is to work for other people in a new field.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm....I dun know if you want to take into acount of the technical problems that will arise in your above decisions but I just put my point across anyway. (Just in case some of you really have $1 billion.)  :p<br><br>Well, if I had $1 billion dollars, much as I would like to put into a bank account, I would not for like <strong>Alex</strong> has shared you are advise to blanace your investments. Even if you still want to put all that money into a bank, the problem is the bank might not want to take it. You see, bank dun just take the money and leave it there, they got to earn money fro mthe money you put with them, else they would be paying you interest for nothing. They will need to think about you putting $10 million into their bank, much less to say $900 million in liquid cash. They will need to find somewhere to place that money so that it earns money to pay your interest and for their profit. So most likely the banks will not take in your money just like that, and you got no choice but to put your money else where. And no, not even the Swiss bank will take in that type of money. And if you are going to buy stocks and shares, by pumping all that money into the market at one shot is just going to cause havoc, prices might go down and the value of your own stock is going to be worth less than what you have bought them at due to the sudden increase in demand, you can't expect yourself to buy in $900 million of shares at one shot right? Since you can't you just going to buy in more and more as time passes, at lower prices each time, and in this case your lots which have been bought say 2 days ago, would have already made a loss. The above explantaion is just to explain the technical difficulties of what is going to happen, and why you need to diversify your investments.<br><br>As for myself, I should not go into how I am going to invest the money, for the details would be mind boggling, Just put it that there will be enough returns to keep my lifestlye in the luxurious class for the next few generations to come. I would rather indulge in how I am going to use that money I have + my returns.  :p<br><br>Well, of course to live in style you need a nice place, to stay, maybe if possible I buy over Alkaff Mansion and built my estate on top of the hill, it would include the standard swimming pool, suana...etc. I would employ a stay in doctor, so that I do not need to fear for a doc, when there are emergencies. I will employ mercenaries, e.g. Gurkahs as security for my estate. It will also have a garden with those fountains that you see in movies. An in house library, and  hotel class kitchen is a must, for knowledge and food are very important to me. *grinz* I am not so particular about cars, as long as I get chauffer around in something decent e.g. Bentley, I will not mind, but I suppose I wiil change it from time to time, to add spice to life. Hmmm.....a private helipad would be good to recieve overseas guest and to escape the traffic sometimes. As for holidays, I would prefer to have my private lodging when I am overseas, so most probably I will have a few houses overseas at locations I often travel to, though not with this much extravagance. As for where these locations are, I let my wife decide, for I am happy anyway as long as she is, we might even go to the moon for all you know.  :p<br><br>Ok for me I am rather different, I do not give to charities, I find it dumb, as giving the moeny to some organisation and then let them give the money to someone else, for goodness sake you dun know where the money might go to, it might end up as a fat year end bonous for some one. But rather, I will set up my own charitable foundation, to promote education in the region, If I have enough returns from my investments after a few years, I might built a university for low cost tertiary education locally, but of course entry is not base on academic results but on attitude and future potential of an individual. Quality of education will not be compromise in this case, for these young men and women are going to contribute to the world in future. The foundation will also organise and pay for youth missions to third world countries. Be it building a bridge in some village to helping out in a famine in Africa. The missions will be paid for fully.<br><br>As for my children, I will set aside a personal improvement trust for them, this trust is mainly to pay for their education and any skills, they want to pick up, e.g. volin, ballroom dancing, flying..e.t.c. I leave it up tto them to choose, for I dun want to interfere with their own development.<br><br>Ok so much for dreaming....WOW....now that I am back to reality, I really feel that I am still a piece of shit.  :p<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
