            <div class='col-md body'>Hello all.  Newbie to the forum.<br><br>Ok, I think it can be said for certain that most guys are a horny lot, always ogling at pretty faces, great bods and conjuring goodness knows what fantasies etc (well, actually i do..heheeheh ).<br><br>What about the fairer sex?<br>Societal norms have made you out to be the more emotional sex, the one that goes for emotional support rather than carnal pleasures.  Is this true for the majority of girls?  I really wonder you know, esp when I take a walk down orchard road (and what more at nitespots) and see girls all dressed up (or in somecases, dressed down) in outfits that can make a grown man cry.<br><br>I'm puzzled. When girls dress up sexily, they are BOUND to attract the gazes of guys...but then when they catch you lusting at them, they think u're a pervert.  What gives?<br><br>Comments?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What gives ?<br>I don't really know but i feel that dressing up is one thing and whether other people look or stare is another thing altought there is a linkage between the two which we cannot ignore, but they musn't stay too close. Some girls go dress thinking to attract glances.<br><br>It's how you look or stare at the girl that defines pervert. But then again if the girl doesn't know you're looking at her, what's the point of looking at her then? We look at the girl to attract her attention too don't we ? So as to pass off some "electricity" and make a new friend  perhaps ?<br><br>Correct me if i'm wrong, I think i'm going abit out of the topic<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, it would be so much simpler if there was no such thing as lust, or sexuality, or sex. Then, guys can concentrate on other things that give them kicks, and girls can dress up (or down) all they want to "feel good about themselves" or "express themselves".<br><br>I guess it happens to us all, just in different ways. Girls who want to feel good, or express themselves, find innovative ways to dress; Guys who want to do so, buy flashy cars or take over companies... *shrug*<br><br>------------------<br>Cya,<br>Praetor<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Do girls really like a guy looking at them by dressing up nicely ? I seriously doubt that generalisation...I have asked girls before and they said they hate guys looking and ogling as if she was some museum pbject.<br><br>Girls do look at guys yes, but usually in a non-sexual way unlike most guys.

Vanity, I think.<br><br>Human dress well to look well. That comes from the very beginning of mankind, when we start to cover ourselves with leaves, animal skins, and eventually start to use better leaves or better animal skins.<br><br>The fun part will be, girls normally would have this "six sense" that guys are looking at her, if she is the average looking one. The girls start to behave "tao" which makes me even want to look at her more, until she becomes "pai say".<br><br>Something I don't understand, if a girls dress up nicely so that she would look gorgeous, why do they still mind guys looking at them with that disgusting expression on their face, just because I am not a good looking guy?<br><br>Maybe if Ricky Martin looks at her, she would be most willing to let him look ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>haha, IMHO i agree w honey in tt we dress up primarily for OUR sake. to make us feel gd. i guess guys staring comes with the territory but sometimes, for most, it's not the staring but HOW you stare. a glance or two isnt tt bad but ogling is disgusting. how do you thk it makes us feel? like we're some exhibit for your viewing pleasure. but of course, this is my personal view, the ahlian down the rd in the tight tube top and short mini skirt might not agree with me though...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Very interesting topic indeed...<br><br>It is true that more girls nowadays are willing to bare more flesh. (My girlfriend gives the excuse that it is hot, and most of her tops are spaghetti straps.) Thus, this has given rise to a popular comment among guys (okay, maybe just my friends and me) that cloth is becoming more and more expensive.<br><br>Anyway, when I look at a pretty girl on Orchard, I usually look at the whole picture one shot. Forget about looking at specific parts. On the average, it is highly likely that you can see the whole prson at a glance. After that, I'll look at the parts most significant about the girl. (Sorry girls, I'm a bit crude and descriptive here...) I mean, a pretty face can be Surabaya Airport, right? And a girl wearing a tight tube can be humongously fat?? (Yucks!!) So that is how I look at girls, and that takes about one second or two. So tell me, am I ogling, staring or what? Usually, I accomplish this feat without the girl knowing.<br><br>I have no idea what a girl thinks when she dresses up (or down) because I don't presume to know the mind of a girl. Anyway, who can understand girls? Even they sometimes cannot understand themselves....;P<br><br>Cheers....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>going off topic a bit, but replying to demonsbane...the bit abt surabaya airport...sometimes, even though less well endowed, there are some girls whom still can dress nicely, sexily and be even more appealing that other better endowed but with lesser presentation skills. ... just back from orchard road this halloween nite, and there once again, a few stunners.  one in the tiniest red hugging dress with slit, and another with a 'blouse' that didn't have a back at all!!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Girls dress up also to make other *bitchy* girls jealous.  Admit it.  It's true.  It's to show off to other girls more than anything else.  Of course you dress to make urself feel good...But let's just say...for discussions sake...<br><br>If u got all dressed up for the day or night, and went out to orchard road...and the whole night noone even bother to bat an eye....how does that make u feel?  I'm sure I would be correct in thinking that it wouldn't feel very "nice".  I will not accept any answer but yes.  :-)  I've already made up my mind.<br><br>heh heh.  It's true tho.  No matter how much u say that it's to make urself look good, if noone sees, then what's the point.  Let's say for instance...and this is all true once again...u might be wondering how this firewire guy have so much insight into the women's psyche...it's called ...ZENNNN...<br><br>Anyway, most girls (MOSt as in say 80%-90% or more) would not get dressed up to go down to the local coffee shop...or neighborhood shopping centers.  It doesn't happen aw.  The only people I see dressed up no matter where they are are the Ah lian Species of women.  i should knwo because I'm a mall rat.  I'm there as often as i can.<br><br>Just admit it, when u go to orchard, u go there knowing that people will look, hence must dress nice.  That's what dressing is all about.  It's to be noticed...and being noticed makes u feel good.  By saying that u dress to make urself feel good, u forget that it's not *only* about dressing up.  With it comes a whole array of situations and elements that will ultimately make u feel good.  If these elements aren't met, then u can dress up in a million dollar tube top and never feel good about it.  It's only if people notice how nice ur dressed.<br><br>And by dressing nice to go downtown is a sure sign that u must be seen.  it's the whole function of orchard in the first place...besides shopping...<br><br>Obviously I don't think that women are stupid enought o believe that noone will look if they dress up nicely.  Even ugly girls who dress nicely get look at...  U really cannot have ur cake and eat it too.  It's just not possible.  U give the good-old double standard to men again... and agin, we are to blame for it...<br><br>There have been a lot of cases where women go out, actively work on being picked up by men, have them take her to a hotel/house whatever, and then they get hot and heavy...to the point that they've done everything except stick the damn thing in...Then as the guy is about to score, she says she doesn't want....huh?  Not that I sympathise with the bastards who push anyway, but u women must realise that u cannot play games like this.  It's wrong.  and evil...literally.  It's a good case of women being really double-standared.  And in some of these cases, i really don't sympathise witht he women who get "raped" anyway.  Maybe I feel their pain, but that's it.  If i was the judge in the trial, I would tell the womn to  pay the man a fine unless she got good circumstances(pain in pussy or what).  As simple as that.  Or sometimes, the woman invites a guy to score with her and everything is fine and happy..and she's happy, then the next day when she thinks about it, she decides that it shouldn't have happened so she sues rthe poor guy for doing it to her...calling it rape!!!  My God.  And they usually win.  Another reason why I left the States...too much of this women's power thing going on where the men are at the recieving end of everything.  No matter what situation it is...even if women's fault, the man ends up losing everything anyway and the woman gains it all from him...hmmm....does that sound nice?  Sorry a little off track there.<br><br>A lot of cases like this.  Happens in Singapore also, but most people here never report this kind of stuff.  the thing with dressing up in sexy clothes..etc...  it is an invitation for people to look.  maybe u don't get the look from the people ur hoping to get it from, but u really cannot choose right...everyone has eyes.<br><br>Like the guy from above said...i seriusly doubt if Ricky martin looked u would object. *wow, Riky Martin looked at meeee...ahhhh*  Get the point?  U can't pick and choose who looks at u, so don't feel offended when people do look.<br><br>I don't condone rape in any form, and I'm not saying that people who dress skimpy are *asking for it*.  No, that's wrong.  My point is that when u do something, there are results steming from this(rape not being one and is wrong!!!)...and a lot of times, it's not a conscious thing to dress to be seen.<br><br>"every action has an equal re-action."<br><br>Dress nice, people will look.<br><br>take a man to bed and go almost all the way, he will expect the whole thing...please don't  defend this point becasue it's really cruel for any sex to be doing it...no matter what the reasons.  Unless suddenly u get ur period, or ur vagina is having convulsive spasms, or ur cock suddenly feel like lightning hit it.. then it's no excuse to play these games.<br><br>Anyway, my point again is that we dress to feel good, and that happens when people notice.  Would anyone really dress up to go someplace where there's noone around?  Never.<br><br>*-Doens't apply to all casess and there are some exceptions to every rule, but this is the generalised version....Firewire style. :-)<br><br>But please don't stopp dressing nicely on my account.:-)<br><br>[This message has been edited by firewire (edited 02 November 1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think we have gone a little off tangent to the topic here... but heck!<br><br>yeah, its hot&amp; humid in spore. and the prices of things are going up. but at the same time, we should be aware of the growing number of skin cancer cases there are since spaghetti straps have made the move from evening wear to daywear. so i say, if u wanna bear it, why the heck not, but i can't blame the guys for looking (even if we are dressing for ourselves). Girls are kinda schizophrenic &amp; we are very guilty of double standards, so you'll have to excuse us, its inborn so we will continue to confuse and perplex you guys for the rest of eternity. Its why we're called the 8th wonder of the world. Don't try to step on our toes though, we won't stand for it, but do pamper us ever so often.<br><br>I'm a woman hear me roar! but i purr when stroked...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually when gers say that they dress to feel good, I really wonder, where do they get the 'good' feelings from? Doesn't the good feelings come from the pride u get when ppl noticed u? When members of the opposite sex take a second glance at u?<br>I really dun see how else anyone can feel good squeezing into those body-hugging tops. They dun even look comfortable at all!<br>I am someone who always dress to feel good. Yes, I dress so that I feel good, I feel comfortable. That's why I am always in T-shirts, bermudas and sandals, even when going to town areas. That's what I call dressing for urself, dressing to feel good.<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with seifer, Where does the good feeling comes from if there are no such thing as sexuality, lust, etc?. If guys do have no feelings for such things, then would ladies feel good wearing them?. Where does the good feelings comes from?. Why does it feel good to show here and there?. Same for guys, why does it feels good to buy more expensive cars?. Ladies like to show their assets, guys do the same. This is part of being a human. We have feelings. Hen and Egg situation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys..let's be honest with ourselves. We are as 'horny' as them. The difference is that we don't have multiple orgasms...and the reason we can't goes the distance with them. So..... foreplays come into the picture...heehee.<br><br>Prostitutes are different. They are there for a reason....to earn money. Do you think they really enjoys or want it that bad? Well..some does..when they are lucky and came across an 'Aneka Jin' look...*wink*. Put them in your shoes...will you enjoy it when the person you are servicing look like your 'father' or even worst..'grandfather'?<br><br>My thinking is that we are even worst than the gals..hahaha. Some of the 'black sheep' wanted it so much  that they started to do it on their own gender...hahaha. Do we guys really want it that bad?......hahaha.</div>
