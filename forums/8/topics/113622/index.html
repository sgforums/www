            <div class='col-md body'>When you are old, you are definately out.. but Tom don't believe what his friends comment.. " How can that happen ? " We are in singapore, remember.. said tom.. Who can blame him, when life was good for tom, living in a posh condo and income was a good 5 figure monthly..<br><br>He believe those working in mac and KFC are those un-educated folks who had no aim in life.. He's not going to compare to them, as he see himself a class above.. Holding a degree, makes him confident in life and don't see the need to improve himself..<br><br>He was always oversea and fail to look at the place where he call 'home' was deteriorating.. FT can always take his job, at a lower pay and willing to work 12 hrs each day.. they don't complain as their motive was just to earn money here, and leave for their hometown when they earn enough...<br><br>It doesn't matter to them if what they did, holds no life... they are not here to enjoy anyway.. true enough, Tom was retrenched.. his place was taken up by a FT.. tom was no doubt hard-working and competent, but he was a liability in terms of the salary he's holding..<br><br>Tom was devastated.. he wonder why?.. why after more than fifteen years in the company, where he did no wrong, he was given the boot.. of course no answer was given by the company.. It doesn't matter if he did his NS and serve his duty.. No one is going to give him back the job cos of that..<br><br>After several interviews, he still couldn't find a job even when he's willing to lower his expectation and take 3k per month.. many reject his offer because of his age.. few weeks turn into months and soon , he was deep in debts and had no choice but to sell his declining value condo at a loss..<br><br>Today, tom is happy working at KFC as a cashier.. life although was different from last time, he was at least happy that he make a lot of friends.. he regret not listening to his friends earlier, and was sad that permanent job doesn't exist...<br><br>Old folks like him are aplenty and they are still able to contribute, but who is willing to give them a second chance, when there's no fair playing ground ?<br></div>
