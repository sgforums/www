But thats something we can't help - and there's no way in this world where you can escape from this too.  But some worry and occasional stress keeps people on their toes and avoids complacency.<br><br>Yes too, those without the highest level of education may feel inferior in some way.  But education is not only the only thing which people choose to pick on, if they wanna despise others.  I know of grads who are looked down upon because their degrees are not prestigious ones, because their dressing is too suaku/nerdy, because of their family backgrounds, because of skin colour, nationality, etc etc....no matter, there will always people who admire you and there will always be people who despise you (and its not based on educational qualifications alone).<br><br>The old-fashioned thinking that graduates always have stable careers simply doesn't not hold true anymore.<br><br></div>

What matters most is still how good you are at smoking the interviewer. Example:<br><br>1. What is your weakness.<br>Always answer "I am poor in my chinese, but I am practising reading Zhao Bao every day now to up my chinese knowledge" or something towards that direction. Being poor in chinese doesn't make you disadvantagous in most jobs, but its still a weakness. It is a weakness that most interviewers are ok to take in.<br><br>2. Name one experience and what did you learn from it?<br>Just drama any experience whether its real or fake. No one knows!</div>
