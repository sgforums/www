Lets imagine 2 guys who is interviewing for a job. One tell u "I used to be a criminal for cheating... I am quite lazy and u probably won't gain much employing me". The second "I am perfect for the job. I can do everything ! In fact I am omnipotent ! If u employ me your sales will reach 100 million overnight !". Which is more trustworthy ? Which should be employed ? None !!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>his own worshippers actually.. which kinda gets to me... if they KNOW (a matter of faith... you know?) that they're being lied to, they why??? </blockquote>Actually one should reflect one why anyone believe in such a religion.

(Which is good  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) The main reason I can think is because they feel tat r just too many goody goody 2 shoes around. Some of their actions makes one... repulsive and connect it with a hypocrite. This religion is cool, in a sense. They r frank about certain facts in life and instead of trying too hard to be good, they let one loose and be bad for a try  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br><blockquote>well, it can be considered dumb but as a mathematician pointed out, turn this into a gamble... the finite things we give like faith and devotion in this earthly realm, can reward us with things infinitely WONDERFUL, isn't it worth the gamble?<br><br>as for the other side with Satanism... you are risking infinitely wonderful for infinite damnation and torture.. what the heck are you? can i classify that as dumb? </blockquote>Mathematician ? Has he calculate the problem Christian will encounter for the wrath of the other religions ? Don't forget u need chips to bet with. For christians, the chip is your time and 10% of your income. If it turns out to be wrong, u have burnt all of these...  For satanism... well if u want u can be satanism anytime, if u don't, no one is stopping u. U don't need to pay a cent either ! It is "fun" ! Make peopel think out of the box too.<br><br>Don't treat religion as a bet. Treat it as something which tell u the truth.
