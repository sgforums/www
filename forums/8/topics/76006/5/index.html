            <div class='col-md body'>When Tim Guitarist first brought out this topic, i hope it is out of curiosity when he said 'how to worship Satan'. Books and information about that is avaible in the library and also posted by some forumites here. It seems like TimmyG plays the guitar and i think he/ she may be a little into Metal and Trash, all those scream bloody gore music. Such sounds are hard and adrenalin pumping but as long as its the type of sound one prefers, be it. As long as we stay out of the drugs, extreme alcohol intake and perceived cult activities such genre of music always symbolize, things should be fine.<br><br>Cults or other self-proclaimed ones are usually led by leaders with a certain standards of charisma and persuasiveness. They talk or drug people into believing and supporting their cause for the Good of mankind through donations and fund consolidating. Some leaders or such thinkers even use their God as a shield or excuse to satisfy their own sexual desires. Else, people who worships the Devil are usually lost and lonely with no sense of goal, direction or objectives in life. They brawl, do drugs, murder, commit arson and pick on the weaker and easier targets (eg animals and pets) as the sacrifice to their so-called 'Evil idol'.<br><br>In a modern society driven by industrialization, globalization and information technology, it is unlike the old days when Good and Evil can be so clearly defined. It is that shades of grey in between where we have to strike a balance. A priest may misuses funds out of his own greed and desires while another religion may invoke the Holy War but if i do not praise the lord that does not mean that i worship the Prince of Darkness. Every religion teaches peace and harmony on top of co-existence - this is the uber rule and the most important line to preach to avoid Eternal Damnation. Only then will we see paradise in the horizon.</div>
