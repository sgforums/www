Satan represents indulgence instead of abstinence!<br><br>2. Satan represents vital existence instead of spiritual pipe dreams!<br><br>3. Satan represents undefiled wisdom instead of hypocritical self-deceit!<br><br>4. Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it instead of love wasted on ingrates!<br><br>5. Satan represents vengeance instead of turning the other cheek!<br><br>6. Satan represents responsibility to the responsible instead of concern for psychic vampires!<br><br>7. Satan represents man as just another animal, sometimes better, more often worse than those that walk on all-fours, who, because of his Â“divine spiritual and intellectual development,Â” has become the most vicious animal of all!<br><br>8. Satan represents all of the so-called sins, as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification!<br><br>9. Satan has been the best friend the Church has ever had, as He has kept it in business all these years!<br><br>Doesnt sound all that bad does it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> I mean, i can understand n relate to them, makes more practical sense.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

Lead vocalist <strong>Dead</strong> committed suicide in 1991 (two years after joining the band) by shooting himself in the head; <strong>Hellhammer </strong>made a necklace using some of his skull fragments, and <strong>Euronymous </strong>reportedly cooked and ate pieces of Dead's brain. <strong>Euronymous</strong>, in turn, was stabbed to death while in his underwear on August 10, 1993, by the band's bass player, <strong>Count Grishnackh </strong>(born Christian Vikernes). <strong>Grishnackh's </strong>alleged motive was jealousy over the fact that <strong>Euronymous </strong>had a more evil reputation; he inflicted 23 separate wounds, it was also rumored, so as to outdo rival band <strong>Emperor's </strong>drummer, Faust, who was convicted in the stabbing death of a homosexual acquaintance. When police arrested <strong>Grishnackh</strong>, they found over 150 kg of stolen dynamite in his house, complete with a plan to blow up a large church on a religious holiday. <strong>Grishnackh </strong>went on to pursue his electronic-influenced project <strong>Burzum </strong>while in prison; meanwhile, <strong>Euronymous' </strong>parents requested that his bass tracks be erased from <strong>Mayhem's </strong>1994 album, <strong>De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas</strong>, (which featured session vocalist Attila Csihar).<br><br>Still, thanks to growing worldwide interest in Norwegian death metal, <strong>Mayhem </strong>product has continued to appear on the shelves into the next century.<br><br><strong>Hellhammer </strong>also put together a new <strong>Mayhem </strong>lineup, which has toured sporadically. During one such tour in 2003, a concert-goer in Norway received a fractured skull as a sheep head flew from the stage while band member <strong>Blasphemer </strong>was cutting the head away from the torso.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote></div>
