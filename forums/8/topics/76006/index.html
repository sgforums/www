            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by the Bear:<br><strong>satanists are invariably morons of the lowest levels!!<br><br>check this out (i posted this before):<br><br>This is the story of the black-metal band, Mayhem:<br><br>Formed around 1985 by [b]Necrobutcher </strong>and guitarist <strong>Euronymous </strong>(born Oystein Aarseth), <strong>Mayhem </strong>was the first death metal band from Norway to make much of an impact in their homeland, which in the early '90s developed a burgeoning underground scene rife with violent, sometimes anti-Christian activity -- as evidenced by <strong>Mayhem's </strong>non-musical history.<br><br>Drummer <strong>Hellhammer</strong>, who at one time worked in a mental hospital, is the only remaining member of the band's prime-period lineup. Lead vocalist <strong>Dead</strong> committed suicide in 1991 (two years after joining the band) by shooting himself in the head; <strong>Hellhammer </strong>made a necklace using some of his skull fragments, and <strong>Euronymous </strong>reportedly cooked and ate pieces of Dead's brain. <strong>Euronymous</strong>, in turn, was stabbed to death while in his underwear on August 10, 1993, by the band's bass player, <strong>Count Grishnackh </strong>(born Christian Vikernes). <strong>Grishnackh's </strong>alleged motive was jealousy over the fact that <strong>Euronymous </strong>had a more evil reputation; he inflicted 23 separate wounds, it was also rumored, so as to outdo rival band <strong>Emperor's </strong>drummer, Faust, who was convicted in the stabbing death of a homosexual acquaintance. When police arrested <strong>Grishnackh</strong>, they found over 150 kg of stolen dynamite in his house, complete with a plan to blow up a large church on a religious holiday. <strong>Grishnackh </strong>went on to pursue his electronic-influenced project <strong>Burzum </strong>while in prison; meanwhile, <strong>Euronymous' </strong>parents requested that his bass tracks be erased from <strong>Mayhem's </strong>1994 album, <strong>De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas</strong>, (which featured session vocalist Attila Csihar).<br><br>Still, thanks to growing worldwide interest in Norwegian death metal, <strong>Mayhem </strong>product has continued to appear on the shelves into the next century.<br><br><strong>Hellhammer </strong>also put together a new <strong>Mayhem </strong>lineup, which has toured sporadically. During one such tour in 2003, a concert-goer in Norway received a fractured skull as a sheep head flew from the stage while band member <strong>Blasphemer </strong>was cutting the head away from the torso.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
