Just that some movies that are unconstructive and promote superstitions shouldnt be watched because you are funding the industry to make even more of such films. That's also the reason why you dont see real Christians listening to heavy metal and the likes of Marilyn Manson and such. =)<br>Cheers.</div>

To a Christian, since the Lord has given us his life to save us, it is befitting that we give up what little we can as an offering. Moreover, we do not force a person to give. If he is in dire straits, of course we do not expect him to give offerings for that period of time. And these offerings are treated as a form of worship to the Lord. Furthermore, these offerings are used for the upkeeping of the church and pastors' salaries etc. You dun expect them to "eat air" right  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ?<br><br>And the issue of pop music, I know that rock music is not encouraged, but there is no restriction against pop music.

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;"><br>im not here to argue the concept of god or not god. It is always the human who is creating the problem. I am sure ppl know be it buddhism, hinduism, christian, muslim, catholic, jews... there are bound to be bad wolves and black sheep. look at it this way, the chopper is always a chopper, let a good hearted chef use it, and many good food is theer, but if a murderer uses it, then trouble is there. See, the point is that the chopper itself is not at fault, they are not sinful. But the human that uses it will make a difference.<br><br>similarly, religion itself is always good and truthful, they are always ppl making use of it to gain and god knows what they are up too. It happened to buddhists, it happened to christians, muslim, hindus, whatever you can think of. The man behind it is always the cuase of the problem and not the religion, let not start a war out of it...<br><br>b4 i closed my reply, look at this and hope it helps to clear your mind... Qoo  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>there is a man shot by a deadly poision arrow and he quickly go and find a doctor. the doctor upon hearing what happened immediately pluck out the poision arrow and started to heal him. he get cured in the end. but there is another man, he was shot too by the same poision arrow, he also find a doctor, but the difference is that, he kept asking the doctor questions, can u heal me, are you good enough, do u know what kind of poision i had, do u... In the end, he died...<br><br>often, We are like this man, we have been poisioned, but yet instead of getting a cure straight away, we tried to find a "TRUE" doctor, even as we find the doctor, we often questioned his ability, doubting his skills, wanting to know if he is the one, he is the truth. And not knowing that time is always running from us... friends, once you found something you can believe, believe it because even as you go to another religion, there might be doubts too.<br><br></span></div>

Unlike some who ask who create Earth, humans etc etc blah blah... and they seek solace in the religion that answer their questions. It is God's work. But still they are suffering in Buddhism context. It is more practical to focus on current suffering context and seek a release from it all.</div>

That is the reason why some are born with a silver spoon in their mouth and some are born in africa. There is no unjust or unfair.<br></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, from wat I read from the earlier posts... I guess it's more of the personal attack on that "pastor" who's into pop music than religion itself.<br>Well, it's norm for Christian who sang Praises n Worship to go into entertainment scene...Like Michael W Smith, Jars of Clay etc. To some who support her and to some who dun, it's your preference. The songs are purely secular and none of it is related to religion, if it has...it would not be allowed to play in the air.<br>Let's juz keep the religion out of the topic as it can be sentitive to certain ppl... Juz u ppl won't feel good if some others spoke ill of ya religions.<br><br>cheers <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
