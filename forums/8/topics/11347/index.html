            <div class='col-md body'>Girls are by nature emotional. They tend to fantasize and imagine things. Sometimes they tend to let their emotions take control of them. I have had my gf called me up in the middle of the night crying, though she doesn't know why she's crying. So I guess it's up to you to assure your girl.<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>

Yes,we tend to imagine and fantasize things,building up so much expectations that our bf can't met.They felt stressful being with us,thats when the problem comes.When problems comes, this will lead to disappointment with the relationship.<br><br>is it our fault? I don't know.<br><br>------------------<br>The  greatest regrets in our lives are the risks we did not take. If you<br>think  something will make you happy, go for it.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry a bit off track ,<br><br>replying to the topic :<br><br>Its not impossible for this to happen, if the guy is always telling the girl how good is he to her and why she always behave this way, subconciously the girl will think that she is not good enough for him thus end up with a break up.<br><br>To me, when girls uses this as a breakup reason, guys will have to think about have you treated your gf the right way ?<br><br>------------------<br>The  greatest regrets in our lives are the risks we did not take.
