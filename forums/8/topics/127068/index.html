            <div class='col-md body'>Food for thought<br><br>God : Hello. Did you call me?<br>Me: Called you? No. Who is this?<br>God : This is GOD. I heard your prayers. So I thought I will chat.<br>Me: I do pray. Just makes me feel good. I am actually busy now. I am in the<br>midst of something.<br>God : What are you busy at? Ants are busy too.<br>Me: Don't know. But I cant find free time. Life has become hectic. It's<br>rush hour all the time.<br>God : Sure. Activity gets you busy. But productivity gets you results.<br>Activity consumes time. Productivity frees it.<br>Me: I understand. But I still cant figure out. By the way, I was not<br>expecting YOU to buzz me on instant messaging chat.<br>God : Well I wanted to resolve your fight for time, by giving you some<br>clarity. In this net era, I wanted to reach you through the medium you are<br>comfortable with.<br>Me: Tell me, why has life become complicated now?<br>God : Stop analyzing life. Just live it. Analysis is what makes it complicated.<br>Me: Why are we then constantly unhappy?<br>God : Your today is the tomorrow that you worried about yesterday. You<br>are worrying because you are analyzing. Worrying has become your habit.<br>That's why you are not happy.<br>Me: But how can we not worry when there is so much uncertainty?<br>God : Uncertainty is inevitable, but worrying is optional.<br>Me: But then, there is so much pain due to uncertainty.<br>God : Pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional.<br>Me: If suffering is optional, why do good people always suffer?<br>God : Diamond cannot be polished without friction.Gold cannot be purified<br>without fire. Good people go through trials, but don't suffer. With<br>that experience their life become better not bitter.<br>Me: You mean to say such experience is useful?<br>God : Yes. In every terms, Experience is a hard teacher. She gives the test<br>first and the lessons afterwards.<br>Me: But still, why should we go through such tests? Why cant we be free<br>from problems?<br>God : Problems are Purposeful Roadblocks Offering Beneficial Lessons (to)<br>Enhance Mental Strength. Inner strength comes from struggle &amp; endurance,<br>not when you are free from problems.<br>Me: Frankly in the midst of so many problems, we don't know where we<br>are heading....<br>God : If you look outside you will not know where you are heading. Look<br>inside. Looking outside, you dream. Looking inside,you awaken. Eyes provide sight. Heart provides insight.<br>Me: Sometimes not succeeding fast seems to hurt more than moving in the<br>right direction. What should I do?<br>God : Success is a measure as decided by others. Satisfaction is a measure<br>as decided by you. Knowing the road ahead is more satisfying than knowing<br>you rode ahead. You work with the compass. Let others work with the clock.<br>Me: In tough times, how do you stay motivated?<br>God : Always look at how far you have come rather than how far you have<br>to go. Always count your blessing, not what you are missing.<br>Me: What surprises you about people?<br>God : When they suffer they ask, "Why me?" When they prosper, they never ask "Why me?" Everyone wishes to have truth on their side, but few want to<br>be on the side of the truth.<br>Me: Sometimes I ask, who am I, why am I here. I can't get the answer.<br>God : Seek not to find who you are, but to determine who you want to be.<br>Stop looking for a purpose as to why you are here. Create it. Life is not a<br>process of discovery but a process of creation.<br>Me: How can I get the best out of life?<br>God : Face your past without regret. Handle your present with confidence.<br>Prepare for the future without fear.<br>Me: One last question. Sometimes I feel my prayers are not answered.<br>God : There are no unanswered prayers. At times the answer is NO.<br>Me: Thank you for this wonderful chat. I am so happy to start with a new<br>sense of inspiration.<br>God : Well. Keep the faith and drop the fear. Don't believe your doubts &amp; doubt your beliefs. Life is a mystery to solve not a problem to resolve. Trust me. Life is wonderful if you know how to live.</div>
