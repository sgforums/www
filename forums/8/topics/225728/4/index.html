I was sitting inside and i saw a group of teens with dyed hair,tattoos,piercing and all sitting outside the outlet. They were talking loudly and making a nuisance of themselves. There was 10 of them with 2-3 gals. Typical bengs and lians. Suddenly out of nowhere, a group of 6 guys ran towards the group. These guys were abt the same age as the group,maybe slightly younger than them. 3 of them began atttacking the leader. He was quite fat and had a helmet with him. But he was helpless. The 3 guys used wooden sticks, chairs and their fists to rain blows on the leader. The rest of the group took to their feet straight away. The leader already fell from his chair and had trouble getting up while fending off the blows. My guess was he oso wanted to run away but was too fat to even stand up. Everything happened so fast. The 6 guys then quickly ran away after their "job" was done. They crossed the road, boarded a cab and escaped.<br>Later the fat leader was cursing and swearing vulgarities at his friends for not helping him and leaving him in the lurch.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Talk abt "brotherhood" . yeah right.<br><br>i tink pai kia wannabes are so cliche in sg now. most of these kids juz want attention and act cool so dat they think they r invincible.

            <div class='col-md body'>Nowadays gangsters wanna be are mostly in their teens. They are just a bunch of people who smokes, dyed those cheap hair colors who don't suit them and act cool with girls around.<br><br>When matters really arise they will run with their tails behind their back. Last time my secondary school have lots of organised gang triads. Lucky that time plain clothes police came and slowly eliminated them. I still remember last time my classmate sitting infront of a guy. Guess what? When the DM came in and check the bag of that guy, he found a parang in the bag and NO BOOKS.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

At that time, me &amp; my so-called brothers always admire those "jong" aka chief. Used to see them once a week in desker road. They were always drinking beers &amp; stout at those coffeeshop in the back alleys. Then one day, one of my friend's elder brother (those study type) told us, if you want to be like them, then you will end up drinking at those place. Forget about going to KTVs &amp; nightclub. And it's true, after so many years (nearly twenty years) had past, still see them drinking over at the coffeeshop. What does it says? Cannot make it lah... Better study hard &amp; make a decent living. At least got the money to spend or drink at some posh place.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
