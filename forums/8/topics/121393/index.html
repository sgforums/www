            <div class='col-md body'>Pls read all the way down if you don't read it ..i don't have comment..<br><br>Democracy is Taiwan's best shield against China's Threat<br><br>Read Charles Heyman's article on BBC Online here<br><br>China and Taiwan are experiencing yet another period of tension in their complex and often stormy relationship. Last month the issue was Theater Missile Defense (TMD), which Taiwan wants to investigate in a bid to counter what it perceives as a growing threat from the Chinese mainland. Taiwan's interest in TMD follows US overtures in the aftermath of North Korea's launch of its Taep'o Dong missile last August. The focus of the US proposal was to protect Japan and South Korea against North Korean missile attack, but Taiwan believes that the system could be extended to cover its own territory.<br><br>China's Foreign Minister, Tang Jiaxaun, said last month that the development of TMD "would exert a negative impact on the global and regional strategic balance and stability into the next century. If some people intend to include Taiwan under Theater Missile Defense, that would amount to an encroachment on China's sovereignty and territorial integrity", he said.<br><br>Another fast-looming issue is Taiwan's presidential elections in March 2000, which could have a significant impact on security issues. The largest opposition party, the center-left Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), has been gaining support. Its policy on sovereignty differs from that of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) party.<br><br>Mainland China (the People's Republic of China, PRC) and Taiwan (the Republic of China, ROC) have co-existed for almost 50 years, in part because of the latter's very careful handling of the independence issue, and because of the US role in providing arms and defensive support to Taiwan.<br><br>A leading DPP politician - the former mayor of Taipei, Chen Shui-bian - said last year that he would hold a plebiscite on sovereignty issues if elected. Although the DPP was still working last month to clear technical obstacles to Chen's candidacy, some in Taipei already say he is the leading presidential contender.<br><br>At stake is the deeply sensitive issue of independence from mainland China, an issue which the KMT has skilfully finessed. The declared KMT policy is peaceful reunification with the mainland - a political objective so distant as to be invisible, but which nevertheless has provided the basis for mostly peaceful co-existence. That delicate status quo has been under particular pressure over the last decade. Taiwan's democracy has evolved, while the mainland has stepped back into repression, and according to some observers, has grown hostile towards Taipei.<br><br>Taiwanese politicians of all parties are proud to stress the transition from a one-party state to liberal democracy, which has been a relatively smooth process. From the lifting of martial law in 1987 to the people's election of the president and vice president in March 1996, Taiwan now plays down its Chiang Kaishek legacy. In May<br>1991, it ended its war footing with China, abandoning its nominal political opposition against the mainland (the 'Period of National Mobilisation for the Suppression of the Communist Rebellion'). During the same period, newspaper and broadcasting restrictions were lifted.<br><br>Against this background, the 'missile crisis' of 1995-96 put the relationship under great stress. The PRC test-fired more than seven M-9 intermediate-range ballistic missiles into waters close to Taiwan, and the US deployed two carrier battle groups in the area of the Taiwan Strait. It was the moment of greatest danger since the<br>Quemoy confrontation of 1958.<br><br>Taiwanese officials also point to what they see as a significant anniversary this month: it is 20 years since the signature of the Taiwan Relations Act under which the US provides for the defense of Taiwan. The April 1979 legislation pledges help, but does not specify the means; support was reiterated by the US House of<br>Representatives and Senate during 1996.<br><br>Strategic ambiguity<br><br>The US has trodden a careful path in its relations with Taiwan; this has been described as a doctrine of "strategic ambiguity". US President Bill Clinton's visit to Beijing last year, and a subsequent visit by Secretary of State Madelaine Albright, reflect the continuing 'one China' policy of peaceful unification. The US has supplied Taiwan with most of its weapons systems, France being the only other main overseas supplier.<br><br>Taiwanese officials carefully log each development in 'cross-strait relations', listing examples of liberal initiatives in cultural, political, educational, and business affairs. Beijing generally fares badly in these statistics, issued by the Mainland Affairs<br>Council of Taiwan's Executive Yuan.<br><br>Great significance is attached to events such as President Lee Teng-hui's visit to Cornell University in the US in 1995, which generated an angry reaction from the PRC. Incidents on the mainland, such as the deaths of Taiwanese tourists and the harassment of Taiwanese businessmen, are set against cross-straits visits by<br>officials of increasing status. A landmark agreement intended to end the hijacking of airliners from the PRC to Taiwan was made in 1994, yet there are still no direct airlinks between the two countries.<br><br>Statistics culled from public opinion surveys on the relationship with the PRC are closely scrutinized, with the independence/reunification issue and perceptions of national identity (Chinese, Taiwanese, or both) sought and analyzed.<br><br>Despite the political rhetoric which lies behind the figures, perhaps the most significant statistics are those reflecting the growth in trade. Taiwan's trade surplus with the mainland has grown from just over US$1 billion in 1987 to US$17 billion in 1996. The value of the two-way trade in the same year was US$23.8 billion.<br>Although the rate of growth slowed following the missile crisis, it is a relationship which would be difficult, maybe impossible to unravel.<br><br>Last February, a reshuffle of military and security personnel saw Taiwan promote personalities who are likely be popular with legislators. Former Chief of the General Staff (CGS), Tang Fei, became defense minister, with Gen Tang Yao-Ming replacing him as CGS - the first native-born Taiwanese to fill the position.<br><br>Mainland China's main strategic and military options - or threats - towards Taiwan have been summarized as blockade, missile attack, or invasion. Beijing's preferred strategy may be changing, say defense analysts in Taiwan, and these changes could cause defense policy to become politically controversial in coming months.<br><br>Taiwan's 230,000-strong land force is being restructured into as many as 30 combined armed (known as 'joint-branch') brigades, according to Jane's Sentinel. It deploys about 750 main battle tanks in six armored brigades. There are two airborne brigades. Deployed in Taiwan and the outlying islands - including Kinmen, Little<br>Kinmen, and Matsu - the army role is clearly to counter an invasion.<br><br>Could mainland China realistically mount a large-scale amphibious operation against Taiwan? The lengthy and conspicuous mobilization of troops, the need to secure air superiority over the straits, the shortage of shipping or amphibious warfare assets, have all been cited by defense analysts in Taiwan and 'China watchers' in the<br>region as mitigating against an invasion strategy. The three major amphibious exercises of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), mounted in March 1995, have been carefully analyzed. The chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff said in 1996: "We do not think that they [China] have the capability to conduct an operation of a nature that would be necessary to invade Taiwan."<br><br>A leading opposition DPP member of the legislature, Dr Parris H Chang, who sits on the national defense committee, told IDR: "Do you think China is going to cross the straits in an amphibious operation? We feel that is the wrong threat assessment. The enemy is not going to do that. The first wave of attack will be our command,<br>control, communications and intelligence [C{3}I] facilities with their missiles. We have got to do something to cope with that kind of attack. Taiwan needs TMD."<br><br>Defense minister Tang Fei said in an interview with IDR: "Whether [Taiwan] will participate in TMD is an issue of high political sensitivity because the PRC regards our efforts in strengthening defense as a major obstacle to national reunification. As a matter of fact, we are undergoing a series of evaluations and assessments<br>before we can reach any concrete decision.<br><br>"We hope that the PRC will construe such actions as an effort to preserve peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region, instead of US encouragement of an arms race, so that cross-straits tension can be reduced."<br><br>Estimates vary of the PLA's missile capability in the region, but the M-9 mobile system is reported to be deployed in Jiangxe and Fujian provinces - in easy reach of the ROC - according to Taiwan's own National Defense Report. The US Department of Defense (DoD) assessment estimates as many as 650 missiles deployed in south-eastern China; other estimates are as low as 100.In Taiwan's force structure, personnel strength is 52% for the army, with just over 14% each to the navy and air forces (reserve commands, military police and coast guards make up the balance). "Why buy all these tanks? We ought to pay more attention to air force and navy, to military and civil," says Chang.<br><br>There is a growing view across Taiwan - in the defense ministry, in government, and academic circles - that China could be paying far more attention to information warfare, and that a viable strike against Taiwan's C{3}I networks could be mounted, seizing the island with minimum bloodshed and destruction. The evidence for this is based on a close reading of PLA publications over the last decade, according to Taiwan's Chong-Pin Lin, vice-chairman, Mainland Affairs Council. He cites a PRC Defense University publication - 'On Commanding War-fighting under Hi-tech Conditions' - which states: "Paralyze the enemy by attacking the weak link in his C{3}I as if hitting his acupuncture point in kung-fu combat." Lin says that the PLA began simulating computer virus attacks in military exercises in October 1997.<br><br>Electromagnetic pulse weapons<br><br>As long ago as March 1986, China launched the 863 Project at the behest of Wang Ganchang, who initiated nuclear warhead and ballistic missile research in the mid-1950s. The 863 Project covered research on laser, microwave, and electromagnetic pulse weapons. Guo Hezhong, formerly of the Electronics Research Institute at China Science Academy, originated research into damaging the enemy's C{3}1 with microwave beams. His expertise lies in millimeter wave and directed energy weapons.<br><br>This theory may seem far-fetched, but Lin argues that China has managed several leaps of capability in the past - joining the nuclear club in 1964, launching its first space satellite in 1970, and its first full-range inter-continental ballistic missile in 1980. The official PLA budget has enjoyed double-digit growth since 1989: China's scientists have an impressive track record and also greater access to western technology.<br><br>While that side of the strategic situation looks bleak for Taiwan, it is balanced to some extent by China's weakness in other areas of industry and in order of battle. Concentration on missile and nuclear warhead technology, has hit mainland China's aircraft industry hard. It has a disappointing track record in design and<br>development; the industry is still living largely on its old Russian design legacy, with the J-10 and FC-1 designs the best examples of original thought.<br><br>Indeed such was the state of its indigenous aircraft industry that China was forced to order the Russian Su-27 in 1992. This aircraft remains the PLA Air Force's most potent platform, and over 100 have been ordered. Chinese design teams must be bitter that a license-production agreement for up to 200 more Su-27 is one of the industry's leading future programs.<br><br>In contrast, Taiwan's air force is approaching its maximum power, with an impressive order of battle. This includes an extraordinary example of technological independence. The last of 60 Dassault Mirage 2000-5 fighters was delivered last November, and the delivery of 150 Lockheed Martin F-16A/Bs will be completed this year. This will be followed by the last of 130 of Taiwan's own Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation (AIDC) Indigenous Defense Fighters (IDFs) in 2000.<br><br>This order of battle is extraordinary by the standards of any other air force. It stems largely from US refusal in May 1982 to allow the sale of F-16s. That encouraged Taiwan to launch development of the IDF, while the air force made do with F-5 and F-104 fighters for the rest of the decade. The surprise decision by France to offer the Mirage 2000-5 opened another strategic line of industrial supply which Taiwan found impossible to resist. This influenced the US, which reversed its decision barring F-16s by September 1992, just as the Mirage 2000 contract was being finalized. The US cited Su-27 deliveries to the mainland as the reason for permitting the sale.<br><br>The result has been that Taiwan has three types of fighter aircraft, carrying three different sets of air-launched weapons (MICA/Magic 2, Maverick/Harpoon, and Tien Chien II). Politically, this reflects Taiwan's special needs. Operationally, the picture is rationalized to some extent by roling the Mirage 2000-5s as high-altitude offshore interceptors, with F-16s responsible for medium-altitude interception and ground attack. The IDFs handle low-altitude interception and ground support.<br><br>A US DoD report tabled to Congress last February as part of the Fiscal Year 1999 Appropriation Bill, says: "By 2005 Taipei will possess a qualitative edge over Beijing in terms of significant weapons and equipment", and it cited the air force's 300-plus fourth-generation fighters as an example. Four E-2T Hawkeye airborne early warning aircraft are coupled to an improved C{3}I system. Patriot PAC-2 surface-to-air missiles and the indigenous Tien Kung (Sky Bow)I/II are bolstered by older missile systems. For the most part Taiwan is satisfied by its air defenses, but the PAC-2s offer only limited tactical missile defense, which leads back to the thorny TMD debate.<br><br>Defense of Taiwan's sea approaches, and the changing capabilities of the PLA Navy, are further issues. While there is a growing feeling in Taiwan that the invasion threat is increasingly unlikely, China's ambitions to build a blue-water navy could pose a strategic threat to Taiwan.<br><br>Dr Andrew N D Yang, Secretary General, Chinese Council of Advanced Policy Studies says: "China is building more powerful surface ships, frigates, and destroyers, and introducing new submarines.'' He points to the modern 'Kilo'- and 'Song'-class submarines, nuclear attack submarines, two Sovremenny-class destroyers, and the Luhai-class of 6,000-tonne destroyers. It is not only the newly<br>launched ships, but also the weapon systems. The Sovremenny-class are equipped with very powerful 'Sunburn' (SS-N-22) anti-ship missiles. Also arming the indigenous vessels are the C-802 (CSS-N-<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> missiles.<br><br>This force need not be specifically designed to blockade or attack Taiwan. "Littoral defense is very much in the mind of China,'' said Yang.<br><br>China's coastal regions are the source of its current prosperity. Protecting its sea lines of communication is another leading priority for China's navy, but an accurate reading of intentions is difficult. "What is the definition of China's security interests? What are the boundaries of its security interests? They never give a very clear definition. They never give clear boundaries,'' says Yang.<br><br>The nucleus of Taiwan's navy is eight ex-US Navy Knox-class frigates, eight former Perry-class and six French-supplied La Fayette-class frigates. More than 50 fast attack craft are available, mostly missile-equipped. Mine warfare capabilities are based on four coastal minehunters, and up to seven upgraded Aggressive-class ocean-going minesweepers. Maritime air assets include 12 SH-2F and nine S-70Cs. The air force's fleet of 32 S-2E/G/T Trackers are now under navy control, improving the efficiency of anti-submarine warfare capabilities.<br><br>Taiwan's greatest naval weakness lies is in its inability to acquire submarines. The submarine force is frozen at four vessels - two Hai Lung class and two aging Guppy IIs - with no prospect of any additions or replacements. Again, the political factor works against Taiwan, since no builder of diesel electric boats has so far been willing to brave international disapproval by supplying Taiwan. As the US has long discontinued construction of conventional submarines there is no obvious source, although the US has brokered a deal for the supply of German-built submarines to Israel. TangFei told IDR: "Submarine acquisition has been one of our top priorities in force planning and we will continue to keep contact with commercial sales channels to enhance our deterrent capabilities.'' Opposition politicians reported that they saw no immediate prospects of a submarine contract.<br><br>Taiwan has built a considerable defense technology base, with the state-owned Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (CSIST) at its core. Its highest-profile product has been the IDF fighter, but the manufacturing arm for the fighter - the AIDC - is now a separate body which will be privatized. The policy is to accelerate the transfer of technology and manufacturing to industry, with CSIST concentrating on research, development, and design.<br><br>The CSIST's workforce is 11,000-strong, spread across four major research divisions: aeronautics; missiles and rockets; electronics; and chemistry. Inaugurated in 1969, its rocket and missile programs cover anti-ship, air-to-air, and surface-to-air weapons. The CSIST has benefited to some extent from technology transfers from the US, but its independent capabilities are considerable.<br><br>One of its most potentially controversial programs was a surface-to-surface missile with a 950km range, named 'Tien Ma 1' (Sky Horse 1). The program was suspended in 1993 following US pressure. Taiwan is emphatic that it has no intention to revive this program, which might provoke its Chinese neighbor. "Ground-to-ground missiles are strategic offensive weapons. The ROC armed forces focus on establishing an effective and integrated defensive framework," defense minister Tang told IDR.<br><br>The DPP's Parris Chang suggests that a Taiwanese cruise missile could offer a counter force deterrent option. The CSIST has a gas turbine engine design dubbed 'Hsiung Feng III' (Male Bee III).<br><br>One of the perils for Taiwan's prosperity is that the armed forces must still rely on conscription. "In an open, competitive society like Taiwan the military has a hard time attracting more able young people,'' says Dr Hung-mao Tien, president of the Institute for Policy Research independent think-tank. Males are conscripted at 18 and serve for just two years, and there are no signs that this system, inefficient as it must be, will be changed.<br><br>"Our army is very large compared to the air force and navy. President Lee himself has questioned whether we need such a large army. There may be some reallocation of armed forces,'' he said.<br><br>Quality personnel<br><br>In mainland China, recruitment has posed few problems. Indeed the quality of an entire generation of PRC personnel may have been boosted by the closure of universities in the 1960s, with the armed forces offering the only attractive challenge in society. However, as China modernizes this trend is changing, and the PLA inevitably faces personnel problems. The US DoD's report to Congress in February said that despite changes in the political and diplomatic arenas in China and Taiwan over the last 20 years, the dynamic equilibrium of forces in the Taiwan Strait has not changed significantly. However, one danger is that sheer political and economic frustration in Taiwan could be reflected in next year's election results.<br><br>The missile crisis of 1995-96 caused a US$23 billion flight of capital, which has left a deep wound. Yet Taiwan switched from a one-party state to democracy without any economic or political breakdown, and China's political rehabilitation is making progress.<br><br>There are signs that the DPP may be softening its line, and its 'trigger-happy' image is unfounded. Dr Hung-mao Tien told IDR: "I feel that judging from what opposition leaders have been saying, they are becoming more sensible, a little more rational. I don't see a great danger of Taiwan doing something unilateral towards China.''<br><br>Beijing itself has said in recent years: "Chinese should not kill Chinese''. Some in Taiwan say that is mere propaganda - China was blighted by wars and rebellions for half of this century - but there are strong reasons on both sides for making sure that this does not recur.<br></div>
