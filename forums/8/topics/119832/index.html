            <div class='col-md body'>Feb 27, 2005<br>Earning power lets her care for the needy..<br><br>By Leong Chan Teik<br><br>ABOUT four years ago, Ms Gillain Liew was working as a customer service officer at Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) when a client chatted with her and discovered she had majored in insurance studies at university.<br><br>SOME PERSONAL INDULGENCES help keep Ms Liew sane and grounded. Her diving trips leave her serene and confident. -- LAU FOOK KONG<br><br>The client, who had gone there to placed an advertisement, asked her to join his insurance agency, which works for Prudential Assurance.<br><br>After a few months of persuasion, she left SPH, where she had been paid $1,900 a month.<br><br>Her first few months as an insurance adviser were so rough she wanted to quit. Her first pay cheque was for $80.<br><br>She had to make many cold calls. She approached strangers on the street to talk about financial planning.<br><br>The working hours were long and subject to the convenience of prospective clients.<br><br>Sales were not immediate, and she had to follow up with clients after the initial meeting.<br><br>But by her second year, in 2002, she had found her stride and qualified for the 'court of the table', an industry recognition for agents who earn commissions in excess of $150,000 a year.<br><br>She has qualified every year since.<br><br>Aged 27 now, she's young and she's rich - and she has big dreams, as she reveals in an interview at Prudential's office in Anson Road.<br><br>Q Are you a saver or spender?<br><br>A I am more of a saver because I don't have much time to go shopping or to splurge on expensive dinners.<br><br>I work 10 hours a day, five days a week, leaving Saturdays and Sundays for my family and myself.<br><br>I will spend only if there is a need to, or if I feel too stressed out at work. Once in a while, I pamper myself with expensive clothes, buy gifts for friends and family, or treat them to dinners.<br><br>Q When you go to an ATM, how much do you usually withdraw?<br><br>A I usually withdraw $500 to last me for about a week. I use credit cards for most of my purchases.<br><br>Q What has been your greatest extravagance?<br><br>A My Louis Vuitton bag, which cost nearly $2,000. I carry it around when I visit clients. I stuff my work materials, including a laptop, inside.<br><br>I have an expensive hobby: travelling. It lets me get away from hectic work.<br><br>In the past 12 months, I have been to the United States, Europe and several Asian countries, mostly on incentive trips sponsored by Prudential.<br><br>I also go on diving trips once every few months to West Malaysia. They offer me precious moments to enjoy nature's serenity, and give me the confidence to achieve what I want in life.<br><br>Q Where do you park the big bucks you earn?<br><br>A Every month, I give my mother a few thousand dollars on average. I also save more than $2,000 a month through insurance policies.<br><br>In addition, I park some money in shares that give decent dividends annually. I am a risk taker, and will also buy penny stocks, initial public offer shares, anything that might be profitable. If I see an opportunity to invest, I will definitely do so.<br><br>I have done my own financial planning. I realise it's better to start saving and investing early.<br><br>I pay a tithe based on 10 per cent of my income to my church as a thanksgiving to God.<br><br>Q What is it like to be young and rich?<br><br>A Actually, I have high expenses at work. I spend about $1,000 a month on petrol for my 1,600cc Mazda car, for example. Parking fees come up to $500 a month.<br><br>I also employ a full-time personal assistant who helps me with my administrative work. For some of my clients who are now my close friends, I invite them for birthday treats or give them gifts.<br><br>I know of friends and others in my age group who are earning a lot more. Those in private or priority banking earn $20,000 to $30,000 a month. Those in car sales earn about as much too, and they have far lower work-related expenses than I do.<br><br>Anyway, for me, greater earnings simply allow me to contribute back to society through charity work, giving to my family and tithes.<br><br>I love to donate to children's organisations and others.<br><br>Having lots of money alone does not equate to happiness. It is how much you give to the less fortunate that will make you happier.<br><br>Q What material wealth do you dream of achieving?<br><br>A I hope to achieve financial freedom - meaning I do not have to worry about monthly instalments or having no money to pay off any liabilities.<br><br>I dream of owning a fully-paid condo or semi-detached house. Ultimately, I would like to have a few million dollars that could support my family and me for a lifetime.<br><br>Q What's the largest insurance policy you have sold?<br><br>A My biggest single success was a client who pays a monthly premium of $2,200. He bought four types of products - life, endowment and investment-linked policies, and unit trusts - amounting to about $1 million in coverage.<br><br>I had made a cold call to him using some telephone numbers given as referrals by other clients, and I persuaded him to let me review his financial planning.<br><br>Only after six months of follow-up did I manage to make the sale. As you can see, in this line the income does not come in immediately. It takes a lot of patience and follow-up.<br><br>Q What's your greatest money fear?<br><br>A I will be very disappointed if I don't achieve financial freedom by the time I reach 40. With my hard work, I am quite sure I will make it.<br><br>Q What is the best money lesson you have learnt?<br><br>A I know fellow insurance advisers and friends from other industries such as real estate who are very motivated. They work 15 hours a day, seven days a week.<br><br>The lesson is that, to be very successful, I have to put in very great effort. This is an absolute truth.<br><br>Continual upgrading is also important. I take courses to enrich myself, learn to network and build my clientele base.<br><br></div>
