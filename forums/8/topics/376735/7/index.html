              <p>She had been convicted in May this year.</p>

              <p>Even if she had not been convicted yet at the point of signing up, I would believe that the onus would be on her to inform the organizers as soon as she was convicted.</p>

              <p>Frankly speaking, even after the news of her conviction broke, she still had the opportunity to salvage her chances - but she blew it repeatedly.</p>
              <p>She shouldn't have called it 'a moment of folly'. 'A moment of folly' is when you steal a Snickers bar from a 7 Eleven. It is not when you commit theft, credit fraud and impersonation 65 times over a period of two months.</p>
              <p>She shouldn't have said that everyone has made their mistakes and deserve a second chance. Yes, we all have our sins, but as my good friend the Bear would say, the sins of others do not exonerate you of your own.</p>
              <p>She should have said that she made the mistake of not declaring her conviction to the organizers from the very beginning and not only after she had won the local competition. After all, the T&amp;C made it clear that contestants must not be charged or convicted in a court of law.</p>
              <p>All this gives the impression that she doesn't realize how serious her crimes were, and that she's not entirely repentant for carrying them out.</p>
              <p>Criminals who are reformed do deserve their second chances, and I count former drug addicts and samsengs among my friends. Unfortunately, how the world works is that there will always be a record of the bad things you do if you do get caught for doing them. If that seems unfair to her now, then it really should have crossed her mind at least once during the 65 offences she committed during those two months.</p>

              <p>if you knew anything about clinical psychiatry, you'd know that the meds do not control 100% of psychological impulses. I have a good friend who was also bipolar. The meds only control up to a certain extent, depending on the individual, plus there are high undesirable side effects that make many patients not want to take them.</p>
              <p>EVEN IF her condition was under control, so she did something wrong. Is it necessary to degrade her and call her a whore, other names? If she can think its possible to get away with spending money on other people's credit cards and that police can't trace it back to her, she is not the sharpest tool in ths shed. Must she be witchhunted just cos she is not so bright? There are many other dumb fucks in Singapore who are very stupid in dumbing grounds for the not so bright. Why aren't they lynched like Ms Low?</p>

              <p><em> A TOP graduate blamed his medical condition for ejaculating on the
              thigh of a woman in a bus but the judge did not buy it.</em></p>
              <p><em> Two doctors said Chong Weien, 28, suffers from spontaneous
              ejaculation and is easily aroused even without any physical stimulation.</em></p>
              <p><em> This cut no ice with District Judge Jill Tan, who said in her
              judgement: 'Even if the accused did suffer from a spontaneous
              ejaculation on the bus, this did not rule out the possibility that he
              could have brushed his penis against the victim's thigh as well.' Chong's lawyer Ravinderpal Singh told the court that his client had
              graduated at the top of his class in 2007 and has been accepted to do a
              Master's in clinical psychology at James Cook University in Australia. (only like shit university will send people to another like shit university simi James Cook..)</em></p>
              <p>So what if Low joined MSW despite having a 'criminal' record? She
              cannot have a fresh start? She can't aspire for a new life, a good
              life? How about giving her courage to do so recognition, unlike the
              gangsters and hoodlums who sniff glue and extort money and go in and
              out of jail/drug rehab?</p>
