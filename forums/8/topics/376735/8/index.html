              <p>EVEN IF her condition was under control, so she did something wrong. Is it necessary to degrade her and call her a whore, other names?

              <p>well. Thats cause Miss Low holds the title of MSW. and she is supposedly chosen by the people/ voters.</p>
              <p>So, she in a way, represents a part of sg. and for the people to see that who they have voted, has tarnished the reputation of sgreans, im sure they'd get a fit.</p>
              <p>yes btw, im aware of the article. Thanks for pointing out. Nevertheless, im sure the authorities will deal with her.</p>
              <p>Besides, having already commited the crime, i dont think it was a wise decision she made to pursue her choice to take part in MSW. Knowing that by doing so, she would leave herself a higher chance of being exposed. - but this might also be due to her med condition which impaired her decision.</p>

              <p>also. she is in a high flying position(as some would consider). so there would be much harsher and higher accountability.</p>

              <p>Simi disgrace? SHE is a disgrace if she goes overseas, participates in an international competition in which she will appear on screen for 2 seconds and say 10 words or less because NO Singapore contestant has ever and will ever get past the first round? Give me a fucking break haha!</p>
              <p>What about your own and your  (you know who you are) kind's fucking behaviour when you slam Singapore and her leaders, policies and everything about her on the internet, wow such glory for Singapore and her people like you, your ah gong, ah mah, cousins who are her people..splashed on the Internet on a daily basis where the world can read..wow...such high horse now..</p>
              <p>hahaha this hypocrisy is making me retch, i wanna puke my laksa and chicken rice whose patents the Malaysians robbed.. the kind of nicknames you give Singapore, cursing her, calling her singkapore or stinkapore or what not..what a fucking shame and never have I witnessed any nationality in my years of overseas education who ever did that to their country, or even badmouthed their country..</p>
              <p>just one example out of the millions right before our eyes, just look at the fucking nickname of one of the fuckers who made a Ris Low spoof video. He called himself sgcannotmakeit.</p>
              <p>What about you and your prideless worthless, no pride, no spine compatriots? Talk about disgracing Singapore and her good name. Take a look into the mirror.</p>
