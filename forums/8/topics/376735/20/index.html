              <p>"Psychiatrists, don't be hired guns."<br>Beware of being taken for a ride by offenders, prosecutor advises.</p>
              <p>FORENSIC psychiatrists run the risk of being seen as 'hired guns' of defence lawyers if they are not objective and truthful in court, Principal Senior State Counsel Bala Reddy said yesterday.</p>
              <p>Speaking on the second day of the first Forensics Conference here organised by the Singapore Academy of Law, the former district judge said defence lawyers are increasingly relying on forensic psychiatry to support claims that their clients offended because of mental illness.</p>
              <p>Soon after Justice of Appeal V.K. Rajah set a sentencing precedent in 2007 when he granted a serial shoplifter suffering from kleptomania probation instead of jail, Mr Reddy said there was a 'significant spike' in the number of people accused of theft claiming a similar illness.</p>
              <p>He noted that in just the past six months, there have been 10 Newton hearings, where private psychiatry reports were challenged by the prosecution after the accused had pleaded guilty.</p>
              <p>A Newton hearing is a hearing held to resolve disputed points in a case and ascertain the correct basis for sentencing.</p>
              <p>The prosecution usually obtains psychiatric evaluations from the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), while the defence can opt for a private psychiatrist.</p>
              <p>Over the same period last year, such hearings were practically non-existent, said Mr Reddy.</p>
              <p>The prosecutor said many disputes were resolved after the defence's psychiatrist conceded that he had erred in his diagnosis.</p>
              <p>'Psychiatric reports are prepared by professionals who are experts in the field of psychiatry. Forensic psychiatrists must be prepared to defend every finding or diagnosis made,' Mr Reddy said.</p>
              <p>He cited the example of primary school teacher Shanti Krishnasamy, who pleaded guilty to altering three examination scripts earlier this year.</p>
              <p>Psychiatric reports from a private psychiatrist diagnosed her with major depressive disorder.</p>
              <p>However, after the prosecution decided to challenge the assessment, the psychiatrist withdrew his findings.</p>
              <p>Mr Reddy said forensic psychiatrists should ensure they keep a healthy dose of scepticism to ensure that they do not get taken for a ride by offenders.</p>
              <p>A clear ethical framework and a requirement that all psychiatric expert witnesses be made legally, or professionally, accountable for their diagnoses and testimonies in court could be another solution, he said.</p>
              <p>Mr Reddy also proposed that offenders be diagnosed by the IMH, as the hospital is known to be objective, impartial and willing to stand by its reports.</p>
              <p>Senior lawyer Peter Low of Colin Ng &amp; Partners felt that forensic psychiatrists who provide unreliable evidence in court will be found out very quickly.</p>
              <p>'The forensic psychiatrist has a duty to assist the court and should be impartial regardless of who has hired him...no expert wants to go to court and be labelled as not credible.'</p>

              <p>i did not follow the SG news in detail one question to mind was Did any of the Judges came up and defence their Decision?</p>
              <p>I mean she really doesn't have the look....and maturity. How on earth did the judge come to that conclusion?</p>
              <p>I think there is a opportunity for a clas Action against public trust  for public fraud on the judges and organizer.</p>

              <p>Hi <em><strong>noopi:</strong></em>  the points u stated r relevant, reasonable &amp; sensible.</p>
              <p>Psychiatry as it is today is not an exact science &amp; Psychiatrists interprete their observations of pts (by history taking, interviewing pts, family members etc) to draw their diagnoses.  That being the situation, its bound to have differences of diagnoses whereby 1 expect say this &amp; the other say that. Another collateral spin-off is that some smart pts can sometimes malinger to mitigate their wrong doings (giving much headache to the Judge!).</p>
              <p>"You think Miss Low really has multi polar?":  Personally I believe what one expect said so re: Bi Polar Disorder.</p>

              <p>This rude insult written in cement and targeted at controversial ex-beauty queen, Ris Low, has gone too far, says STOMPer <strong>Kayaker</strong>. <br><br>The sender first spotted the words on the ground at Blk 566 in Hougang Street 51. The culprit had written the words when the cement was still wet.<br><br>The insult was specifically targeted at Ris Low, who was Miss Singapore World 2009 until she gave up her crown because of her credit card fraud conviction. <br><br>During her reign, the diploma student had raised concerns over her win because of the bad spoken English she used in an interview with Razor TV.<br><br>In an email dated October 13, STOMPer Kayaker says:<br><br>"I spotted this at the void deck while walking past Block 566 at Hougang St 51 . <br><br>"It reads: 'f**k Ris Low' and ends off with a smiley face. It was engraved on freshly laid cement flooring, which has since become permanent. <br><br>"The poor girl."</p>
