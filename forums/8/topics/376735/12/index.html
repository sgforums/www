              <p>MISS Ris Low has resigned as Miss Singapore World 2009, days after her past conviction for credit card fraud was exposed.</p>
              <p>The organiser of the local beauty pageant, ERM World Marketing,
              said in a statement on Tuesday afternoon she will no longer represent
              Singapore at Miss World 2009 in South Africa.</p>
              <p>ERM said it will be interviewing a new representative to represent
              Singapore at Miss World 2009 in the coming days and will announce her
              shortly.</p>
              <p>The organiser said it has met Ms Low and her parents and 'they have
              agreed to allow their daughter to resign from the crown as we feel is
              in the best interest for the Miss Singapore World Pageant and Singapore
              at large.</p>
              <p>'We are accepting her resignation,' said ERM.</p>
              <p>On Ms Low's conviction in May and her bipolar disorder, ERM said
              there was no way of checking if a contestant has a criminal record or
              suffering from depression.</p>
              <p>'Ris Low was determined, well behaved and performed well throughout
              the 2 month competition and even went on to win 8 special awards. This
              is not easy task to accomplish from a group of 22 contestants. With her
              good performance and beauty, she excelled in the competition.'</p>
              <p>On her command of English language, which has been criticised by
              the public, the organiser said: 'We felt that person who made fun of
              her on YouTube was malicious and did not do her justice. The video clip
              was presented in a way to ridicule her.</p>
              <p>'The incident was a one-time interview which misled the Singapore
              public to believe she spoke English poorly. During the Grand Finals
              competition held at the Shangri La hotel on the July 31, she spoke
              perfectly good English, had a good answer (short, sharp and sweet) and
              performed very well to impress the 11 judges that she was good enough
              to win.</p>
              <p>'So perhaps her spoken English could also be an effect from her Bipolar disorder.'</p>
              <p>ERM said it felt sorry for Miss Low but added: 'We cannot
              compromise on our contest rules, regulations and the image of the Miss
              Singapore World Pageant.'</p>
              <p>ERM, which broke its silence only on Monday said it did not give
              any comments earlier to the media and press because 'we were taken
              aback by this incident and we did not have any documentary evidence to
              justify the allegations and could be faced with legal implications
              later'.</p>
              <p>'Ris Low committed this offence as a young offender, and we had to
              be sensitive to handle any comments delicately where a young offender
              is concerned. The treatment would be different if she was over 21 years
              of age,' it added.</p>
              <p>'We like to add that this is the first time in Singapore beauty
              pageant history that such an incident has occurred. We had to be
              careful with the approach.'</p>

              <p>I dun see how she could be reinstated. Rules are rules. But
                                      actually reinstating her is now the secondary issue. What shocks me
                                      is the number of people who actually step on others when they are
                                      down. How singaporeans (maybe not just snigaporeans in this case)
                                      love throwing in sarcasms, insults, mockery when people are down.
                                      Makes me wonder how these people would love to be treated one day
                                      when their deeds are exposed. I seriously think her accent is way
                                      funny and is embarassing but surely there is no need to attack a
                                      young person so viciously for a wrongdoing.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Guilty of credit card
              fraud</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>By DAWN TAY</strong></p>
              <p>RECENTLY crowned Miss Singapore World Ris Low, 19, had earlier
              been found guilty of credit-card fraud.</p>
              <p>The beauty queen was convicted of five charges of
              misappropriation, cheating using illegally obtained credit cards,
              and impersonating their users' identities.</p>
              <p>The first-time offender was sentenced in May this year to 24
              months of supervised probation, said a Subordinate Courts spokesman
              in response to a query from <em>my paper</em>.</p>
              <p>Another 60 charges were taken into consideration for the
              purposes of sentencing, he said.</p>
              <p>Court documents show that Miss Low spent a total of more than
              $2,400 on at least four separate occasions, using at least three
              different credit cards in April and May last year.</p>
              <p><em>my paper</em> understands that her previous employer, a
              health-care company, made a police report about her in April last
              year.</p>
              <p>It suspected that Miss Low, who worked there for five months as
              a patient-service assistant, had used credit cards belonging to its
              patients. It asked her to leave the following month.</p>
              <p>Before leaving, she was said to have returned a part - an
              unspecified sum - of the total amount she had spent using the
              cards.</p>
              <p>When contacted, Miss Low, now a student, said that she was "not
              in a position to comment".</p>
              <p>The international Miss World pageant will be held in
              Johannesburg, South Africa, in December. It is unclear whether Miss
              Low will be allowed to leave the country to take part in it.</p>
