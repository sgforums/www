            <div class='col-md body'>at least 2 of u seats right?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by browniebaobao:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: indigo;">I believe many of us has seen this happening.. especially during lunch time..<br><br>It's damn crowded at the full court/fast food restaurant.. you are trying to find a table, and there u see, a table with 4 seats, nobody sitting but u see a pack of tissue paper/newspaper on the table.  Then you are wondering whether you should sit, coz it seems that the table is already 'booked' by somebody.  But the newspaper and coupons looked like they were used before.<br><br>2 days ago I was at Burger King with my 2 friends at Shenton way area.  We saw this table with 4 seats, and there was a newspaper and coupons lying on the table.  We looked around, we asked whether anybody's sitting there, no one knows.  Thus, we took the table.<br><br>As me and my fren were queuing for food, there was this thick skinned woman, she approached my fren who was waiting at the table, and told her "I thought I left my newspaper and coupon here?"  Then my fren said "oh I asked around, nobody knows this table is taken."  Then that woman said, "We have only 2 persons, u can sit with us."  My fren told her that we have 3 persons, and she din want to argue with her, so she took our bags, came to the queue to inform us and went to find seats.<br><br>I was so pissed.  Put a pack of tissue paper there means the table is hers meh?  Why not she put her BIG NAME there? KNS!  We already settled down liao then she got the cheek to come and tell my fren that she  booked the table with her Newspaper.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Since there was 2 of them, why can't one go and buy, the other one stay?  Machiam their newspaper can tell us they took the table!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> </span><br><br></div></blockquote></div>

Then you are wondering whether you should sit, coz it seems that the table is already 'booked' by somebody.  But the newspaper and coupons looked like they were used before.<br><br>2 days ago I was at Burger King with my 2 friends at Shenton way area.  We saw this table with 4 seats, and there was a newspaper and coupons lying on the table.  We looked around, we asked whether anybody's sitting there, no one knows.  Thus, we took the table.<br><br>As me and my fren were queuing for food, there was this thick skinned woman, she approached my fren who was waiting at the table, and told her "I thought I left my newspaper and coupon here?"  Then my fren said "oh I asked around, nobody knows this table is taken."  Then that woman said, "We have only 2 persons, u can sit with us."  My fren told her that we have 3 persons, and she din want to argue with her, so she took our bags, came to the queue to inform us and went to find seats.<br><br>I was so pissed.  Put a pack of tissue paper there means the table is hers meh?  Why not she put her BIG NAME there? KNS!  We already settled down liao then she got the cheek to come and tell my fren that she  booked the table with her Newspaper.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Since there was 2 of them, why can't one go and buy, the other one stay?  Machiam their newspaper can tell us they took the table!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> </span><br><br></div></blockquote>i stil rem a few yrs ago. i was at my sch foodcourt. as it was very crowded, we use our bag to chop the seats and went to buy food... when we came back, we realised that there a grp of china gers sitting on our seats and they even move our bags to the nx chair.. i canot belive my eyes when i see that.. lucky my fres found another table or esle i sure quarrel with them..</div>
