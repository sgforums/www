            <div class='col-md body'>Hi peeps! Mister MooKu is baaaack!<br><br>Aiyah. This time I just wanna get some feedback on an issue...<br><br>Nowadays still alot of stray cats running about, even though the AVA's been culling them cruelly. *sniff sniff*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> People are still abandoning their pets after finding them a burden or after their short-lived interest in them have died down etc.<br><br>Isn't it time we should be doing something BIG about this? I mean, something like a campaign e.g. "Treasure the pets!" or "Help the animals"...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> I don't see why the animals' case should not be given the same treatment as things like the environment (Clean and Green Week) or the Speak Good English movement...<br><br>I guess many people still don't know the true responsibilities that come with a pet. I've come across owners who abandon their pets' offspring after failing to find a new owner for them. I've come across owners seeking new owners for their pets because they "don't want them anymore" for some stupid reason like "it's too messy" or "I don't have the time to look after it".<br><br>Maybe the government should impose a law on those who abandon their pets. It's considered a form of animal abuse too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

People cannot just throw them away like trash when they're not needed or wanted anymore.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Referring to the <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=55462" rel="nofollow">article</a> of the baby abandoned to die... Why do we feel such anger and such great sympathy for the child? Because it belongs to the human race. It's one of our kind. But animals are our kind too, isn't it? We're animals, the pets are animals. The main distinguishing factor that gives us our status is our intelligence. But it doesn't warrant the right for abuse.<br><br>Of cos I don't expect owners who abandon their pets to be TRACED down. People who see such acts should be encouraged to report it to the authorities.<br><br>MooKu is sick of tired of having to feed poor animals out in the stray. Stray dogs, stray kittens, stray RABBITS even. Why's the AVA culling animals. As though it'll stop the growth of the stray population.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
