Just because you self-centered and ignore the rules and others , you do deserve to be kick out !!!<br><br>The shopping center example was not good !!! think of it this way, you line up to for a plate of noodles .... you are first in queue ... the aunty pass you the first bowl , but you see the second bowl seem a little nicer ... which is the 2nd person in line. Is it fair you make a fuss to take the second bowl instead of the first !!!  Come on people doing business have their ethics , if no ethics like that taxi can anyhow charge fares and other things .... even people queuing got rights .... you should not be so self-centered - you are actually infringing on other people right !!!<br><br></div>
