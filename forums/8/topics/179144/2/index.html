Gangs were formed to solve domestic and fellow chinese problems. WHen in a foreign land , u can only rely on ur own kind. Slowly it got corrupted and got associated with all the vice activities. But is it thier fault ? We provide jobs.. . There are 2 kinds . The aggresive and the passive kind. Depends which one u are in will determine are u the fighting kaki.. or are u the business kaki.</div>

(weak sight/smell/hearing)<br>we lack the stamina as a prey.<br>we lack the fur or coat that keeps us warm in the cold. (too little hair)<br>we lack the long canines that almost all predators possess. (blunt canines)<br>we lack the long claws to slay our prey. (our nails do not end at a point)<br>we lack the stealth of a hunter. (our feet are not designed to move silently)<br>we lack a natural defense against every predator on this planet. (no chemical, physical or psychological defences)<br><br>the only reason why we consider ourselves number 1 is because we have intelligence above all other creatures and it is this intelligence that allows us to analyse a situation and come up with a solution, unlike animals who rely on instincts alone, though some use their brains. we are one of the weakest species on this planet, yet we now populate almost all parts of the surface because we are able to see reason and form consequences. However, if humans were to be stripped of their intelligence and their technology, we would never have survived in the wild. we would be far too weak to defend ourselves from mass extinction by thousands of predators that hunt us daily...<br></div></blockquote>Try telling yourself all these nonsence next when your kid join a gang, gets into a gang fight, accidentally injured or worst kill someone, get caught by the law and jail .....  come on, this is the modern world we're talking about !!!<br><br>You need knowledge to survive, not joining any gangs !!! playfights in the animal world are violent but not damaging thats becos it part of their learning process but gang fights are violent and damaging and sometimes fatal.

            <div class='col-md body'>this thread is nonsense to begin with...trying to equate man to animals so as to justify the beastility instinct.....lions group together because they need to do so in the african open plains to hunt and protect themselves. tigers on the other hand are mainly solitary animals as they live in jungles where they are well camouflaged to hunt and be protected. basically, whether animals form groups or otherwise have to do with their environment. just to digress a little, for those still unsure if sang nila utama spotted a lion or tiger, the answer is a tiger because temasek had dense forests.</div>
