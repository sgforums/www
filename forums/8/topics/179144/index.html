            <div class='col-md body'>hi,<br>I think your thinking is flawed.<br><br>firstly, lioness grouped together not lions. In a group, you will only see one or two male adult lions, never more than 2. And they come in attack, take over the group, kill the cubs and then mate with the lioness. This is to prevent genetic breeding. Meaning cubs with the same relationships as mothers &amp; fathers. In human sense, it will means marrying your niece or nephew. your father's side of the family. This would increase the chance of genetic problem. So nature deal with this, this way.<br><br>secondly, lions grouped together cause they need to hunt. One lion or predator faced a huge risk if they were to hunt alone cause they may be injured or even if they are successful, they fear losing their catch to other predators. Bottomline, they need to feed.<br><br>Lastly, what seperates human from animals, the thing inbetween your ears. Use it well, you are a human, don't use it, you are a low-life. Simple truth.<br><br>Gangs orginates from the olden days when one immigrant coming in to a new place, need to find protection &amp; brotherhood.<br><br>Nowsaday, gang formed so that they can play more arcade games, try smoking, get more gals &amp; get into fights.<br>Totally nonsense &amp; waste of time.<br><br>In the past, people would honour code, and fight one-2-one. Nowsdays, it is a safari. 20 vs 5 or worse. I have seen some, and it is like a hunting trip.<br><br>And to fight for their place, oh please. Whatever is in Singapore belongs to the authorities. Nothing you do, or spray some numbers will change that. Once the CID decides enough, "red-car" will come. Your gang just evaporates.<br><br>And for gals, they are like leeches, they only want company and maybe one who can afford that latest LV bags. Nothing more. shallow. Worse, if you have teen pregancy, then you are forever bound.<br><br>So to me, gangs are a thing of the past ,like in some HK movies, they use codes, "Yi-Ji". but in SGP, they are more like hooligans, just like mosquitos, grouping together to create chaos.<br><br>So please don't compare Gangs to Lions, the king of animals. It is a downright disgrace.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I forgot a point, about the playfighting.<br><br>oh, I have seen a "gang" in being ambushed by another, and now the leader is in a wheel-chair. (big report in new paper about how fillal the leader is, how good he is at home, how the mother doesnt believe the son is a bad boy).<br><br>next thing you know, this leader in a wheel-chair with his gang, recognised one of the attackers, and decided to ambush back, now all in Changi.<br><br>so what instinct?? It is all becos of FACE.<br><br>I bet the animals doesn't know that.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>mammals--&gt;primates--&gt;hominids--&gt;humans<br><br>we have survived while all of our hominid cousins have died because what they lack we have. we have intelligence, but that does not mean we have no need for instincts. all creatures of this planet are born with instincts. compare other animals with te human race and you'll see many similarities. from all the posts i've read in this topic i have concluded that most of u think of humans as a species that is number 1 on earth because we're meant to be. but the randomness of nature is in our favor, blessed us with intelligence. we may think we are number 1 on this planet, but that is in terms of intelligence only. if we compare our other talents with other animals you'll realize we lack many things. we are not that powerful.<br><br>we lack the strength and senses of a predator. (weak sight/smell/hearing)<br>we lack the stamina as a prey.<br>we lack the fur or coat that keeps us warm in the cold. (too little hair)<br>we lack the long canines that almost all predators possess. (blunt canines)<br>we lack the long claws to slay our prey. (our nails do not end at a point)<br>we lack the stealth of a hunter. (our feet are not designed to move silently)<br>we lack a natural defense against every predator on this planet. (no chemical, physical or psychological defences)<br><br>the only reason why we consider ourselves number 1 is because we have intelligence above all other creatures and it is this intelligence that allows us to analyse a situation and come up with a solution, unlike animals who rely on instincts alone, though some use their brains. we are one of the weakest species on this planet, yet we now populate almost all parts of the surface because we are able to see reason and form consequences. However, if humans were to be stripped of their intelligence and their technology, we would never have survived in the wild. we would be far too weak to defend ourselves from mass extinction by thousands of predators that hunt us daily...<br></div>
