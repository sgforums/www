If you with to have a gaming PC, you need to build the PC yourselve. If you can't, don't worry just buy the parts from Sim Lim and ask the people there to build the PC for you for $15.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think ppl buy so called branded PC not for their specification but more for the after service support. Imagine you got problem you bring it down they fix it. For DIY system you gotta do your troubleshooting yourselves. For ppl more on the end user side it is a nightmare. So the price paid for branded PC is not just for the specification but also for the after service support  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>The big plus for DIY system is like wat ppl said you only put in wat you wanted. It is something like say I wan SE joystick and Samsung clam shell onto a nokia keypad as a phone. A customised product just like software.</div>
