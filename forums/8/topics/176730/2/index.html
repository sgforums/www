(like topic sentence)<br>e is for elaboration. means, write your textbook knowledge here.<br>o is for outcome. wat was the outcome of the events? outcome links your textbook knowledge to wat the question is asking.<br>r is for reinforcement of statement. this strengthens your argument, and in some cases mayb can help you pull wool over some cock marker who thinks you make sense when you dont. essentially, its just a repitition of your statement.<br><br>for example, if they ask you a qn like, do you agree that divided loyalties is the most important factor that led to tension in northern ireland?<br><br>your intro would go: i agree (impt! state your stand, if they ask you qns like DYA.... if not, whole qn no marks.) that divided loyalties is an important factor that led to tension in northern ireland, however, there were other important  reasons, like the education policies and historical reasons.<br><br>example of first para (Talk about given factor): divided loyalties is an important factor for the tension in northern ireland (s). the protestants regard themselves british and the catholics regard themselves irish. the protestants did not want a union with ireland as they imagine that a catholic government would not be tolerant of their protestant beliefs. however, the catholics want a union with ireland and not britain, partly because they resent the English conquest of the irish in the 12th century battle of boyne(?) (e). as a result, this sense of insecurity for both groups made them intolerant of each others' beliefs, and they are hostile to each other as they do not see themselves as part of the same country. (o) hence, much tension and hostility exists in north ireland, making divided loyalties an important reason for it. (R)<br><br>your next two paras shld start with words like, HOWEVER, (explain another important reason), MOREOVER...<br><br>your conclusion may be sth like, even though divided loyalties is an important reason, but there are more important ones like the segregation of education for both groups of children, leaving them to grow up in hostility and distrust for each other, which uiltimately leads to divided loyalties blah blah blah. (explain the inter-relation between factors, and show your understanding of ALL factors. if you have no time though, dont bother with this, just write a slipshod one, this gets you the last 2 marks, so if your conclusion is only okay-okay but your explanation of factors are good, you shld get arnd 10 marks already.)<br><br>in cases with more than 3 factors in your textbk, choose the 3 most impt. go for quality, not quantity.<br><br>a good essay shld be at least 3/4 page long.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>Well, acutally me ss is very sux de lor.
