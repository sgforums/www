            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">NEW immigrants into Singapore could soon be assessed on their talent, skills and experience, and not just their academic qualifications.</span><br><br>Such an approach could help boost the population, Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng said yesterday.<br><br>Many foreigners can contribute but lack the right educational papers, said the minister who now oversees the population portfolio.<br><br>'We should therefore consider broadening the set of criteria so that they are not overly focused on academic qualifications.'<br><br>Along with skills, talent and experience, another factor to consider would be whether the immigrants' family members can also contribute to the country's growth, and possibly how well the immigrants and their families can fit in, said Mr Wong.<br><br>Related links<br>Watch Channel i news clip<br><br>The move away from relying on academic qualifications alone in assessing newcomers has already begun in at least one area. The EntrePass scheme, introduced last year, allows them here based not on their salary or academic papers, but business plans.<br><br>Mr Wong said that another target group is <span style="color: red;">foreign students on scholarships, who might be persuaded to get their families to settle down here.</span><br>'We are exploring all these points,' said Mr Wong, in his first interview since his appointment as Minister-in-charge of Population Issues was announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong last Sunday.<br><br>The policy review could see some changes to the population mix. There are about three million Singaporeans, 350,000 permanent residents and 800,000 foreigners here on long-term stay passes.<br><br>Last year about 6,500 foreigners became Singaporeans.<br><br>During the booming 1990s this number sometimes hit 10,000 a year.<br><br>But Mr Wong said there are no set targets for PRs or new citizens.<br><br>'Our aim is not to hit a specific number, but to build a competitive economy as well as a vibrant and cohesive society with a core of citizens,' he said.<br><br>Immigration is an important plank of the population strategy, as 'babies take many years to grow up', he said.<br><br>The two approaches - of having more babies and bringing in more foreigners - are complementary, he added.<br><br>But he stressed that a premium will always be placed on Singaporeans, even as foreigners are treated well.<br><br>'You have heard the Prime Minister say that we will always treat Singaporeans well and they come first,' he said.<br><br>Immigration is one of the four key issues in the population strategy, he noted.<br><br>The others are<br><br>Changing mindsets so that more citizens will marry and have more babies.<br><br>Helping overseas Singaporeans stay connected.<br><br>Dealing with ageing concerns.<br><br>To ensure immigrants do not add to the last concern, the target group of newcomers will be mainly younger people, he said.<br><br>Urging Singaporeans to do their bit to help PRs and new citizens feel at home, he recalled how his own parents came from China in the 1930s.<br><br>Many Singaporeans' forefathers also hailed from China, India and the Malay archipelago and helped make Singapore a modern country.<br><br>'So in the same way, the contributions of the new residents will help Singapore soar to greater heights,' he said.<br><br>Recent immigrants said most find out soon enough if they can fit in.<br><br>For Ms Alice Yim, 47, a company director from Hong Kong who became a citizen in 1999, it was immediate: 'I was comfortable from the time I landed... this is a safe and good place to raise and educate my daughter.'</div>
