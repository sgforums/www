She seems like a normal girl but somehow special. Its not just saying forget and u can forget, agree? if not 8 years so long i think i might go sianz girl and maybe got myself a gf already. But the feeling is fading away but not totally. Its the little bit of feeling which is damn bothering me alot. I wish to give my heart totally to the girl i love and not thinking of "her" and pulling a hand of another girl. This makes me sick alot. And so to conclude my feeling is i am waiting aimlessly and stupidly.<br>"HER" : Oh just another fool waiting for me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>The thing i think that can cure me is to go to her wedding dinner and seeing her and her husband so loving each other and piss me off.<br>Or maybe they already carrying a baby on their arms. OH MAN what am i thinking in the middle of the night. Soon, crazyness will strike me and woodbridge registration form will end up another member. PEACE~~~~~~~<br><br>------------------<br>Â®To The Maximum Limit Of My LifeÂ®</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thank everyone for your truthful answer. Though sometimes it may be foolish to wait for a gal who doesn't even know your feelings at all but i have to wait becoz truthfully say, i never tell her dirsctly yet. Maybe its self-console?? Anyway i give myself another chance till next chinese new year.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>You are correct! 2 years is enough to know whether a gal like u or not. Life still have to go on without her, rite? and besides, I still looking out for other girls too.<br><br>------------------<br>Forgiven is a true way to long lasting love.</div>
