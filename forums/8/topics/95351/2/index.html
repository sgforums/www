But put yourself in the shoes of a former TJC student hearing those comments coming from TJC students.  Actually, let's even go further.  Put yourself in the shoes of people who couldn't go to JC fpr whatever reasons.  If I'm quite right, TJC does hold some esteem in being a high level achiever in education.  Read those comments again.  Do they even make 'talking cock' a valid reason?  I know what talking cock is.  But saying something as unresearched and as degrading as that whilst wearing your school uniform shows discourtesy, lack of tact and sheer stupidity.  You'd like to know that TJC's prinipal was notified about the incident.  That's how upset the former TJC student felt.<br><br>To your last paragraph, you have certainly not grasped the big picture.  That was why I said 17 year olds and not merely JC students or poly students or whatever school students.  If a JC student could say that, why can't a poly student?  Why can't an ITE student?  Hell, why can't a secondary student say that?<br><br>Still can't get my point?  It means it doesn't matter what level of school you go to, you're still bound to say something stupid and be pointed out.  I was just highlighting an incident.

Because in your first post you said :<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Possum:<strong><br><br>Actually, I should tell you a little incident about JC students.

Now, that's the shallowest form of thinking I've ever come across!! My question would be - if a 17 year old can think like that, how many more would?<br></strong></blockquote>You mentioned the TJ incident, then proceeded to label that particular TJCian shallow. Then in the same paragraph you said and i'm quoting you : "My question would be - if a 17 year old can think like that, how many more would?".<br><br>Anyone reading that would conclude that you're taking the rhetoric "JC students suck" stand because you labeled JC students "shallow".<br><br>And also automatically assume that "17 year old" meant JC students  And also because it's in the same paragraph immediately suceeding a comment about JC students. So I replied as such.<br><br>Now you're telling me <span style="font-style: italic;">any</span> "17 year old" can say that, which is almost going to make your first post pretty pointless. So dude, what exactly was <strong>YOUR</strong> point in that first post? Telling us about a "shallow" statement that <span style="font-style: italic;">anyone</span> can make, JC or non-JC?<br><br>Basically here I am defending the JC cohort, and you just seem to be increasing your post count with a "idiots-are-everywhere" stance. Which incidentally happens to be an argument <span style="font-style: italic;">i'm</span> using.<br><br>PS : My last statement in my last paragraph in my last post said the same thing. 17 years olds are not confined to JCs. So silly cock-talking 17 year olds are everywhere, they're not confined to JCs. Certainly not TJC.<br><br>*****<br><br>That's all for now, I have a frigging programming assignment I have to hand up tomorrow and I'm not even halfway through. I have a sinking feeling that I really should be spending time on it instead of replying to frivolous posts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What's wrong with JC students? I don't know why anyone should have gripes with them. I think that JC students are perfectly alright. I was in a CI last year for my first three months, and quite a few of my friends ended up in a poly. And I can safely say that they are just as, if not more hardworking.  Plus, JC students 'have a life'. Are you simply jealous that we're probably smarter than you?<br><br>You say JC students have low E.Q. But I don't think so. In fact, I think JC students have better E.Q. Poly students are more streetwise.<br><br>I say, we stop having stupid JC-slamming sessions, and start slamming poly and ITE students. Just because you guys are slamming us.</div>

Why, just why, did I actually say 17 year olds instead of JC students regardless whether it's in the same paragraph or not?
