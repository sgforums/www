            <div class='col-md body'>meander:<br><br>I have no problem with whining. Afterall, everybody is entitled to whine once in a while. The key point is how both groups (JC and poly) attempt to solve a problem.<br><br><blockquote><strong>To the ex army training school instructors replying here, what happens sometimes in training schools is this :<br><br>Some new bird instructor is told by the lao chiaos that JC batches suck.<br>New bird kao peh JC batch more<br>JC batch whine more, gan cheong more and screw up more.<br>New Bird instructor tekans JC batches more.<br>JC batch whine more, gan cheong more and screw up more.<br>Instructor concludes JC batches suck too.<br>Instructor becomes lao chiao.<br>*Rinse and repeat*<br><br>To them I ask, can you honestly say that you have been fair to the to every single batch that you've taken?</strong></blockquote>We train hard, but that doesn't mean we train unreasonably. And just for your information, its based on my own personal experience after taking 8 batches of trainees. I don't need any "old birds" to tell me if JC batches are good or not. My eyes can tell.<br><br>Of course I have taken impressive JC trainees who really take pride in whatever they do. But sad to say, they don't really belong to the majority. I can quote u an example:<br><br>There was this PSC scholar who went into MC Att C for migraine. His MC ended on Sunday 2359hrs. So he was told to report back to camp that same night, but after speaking to him, he simply refused to come back and didn't even extend his MC, despite I was telling him to come back to extend his MC via the MO. Eventually, I counsulted my OC and he was straightforward enough to go ahead to charge the fellow if he didn't come back that night. Eventually, he came back 1 hr after the booking-in time, and with his parents somemore. And I wondered how the RP actually let them into the camp.<br><br>He might belong to the minority group, but things like these is enough to spoil the image of JC students.<br><br>I don't hate JCs, since I was from a JC myself. I just don't understand why 2 adults of different institutions have different approaches to an issue.</div>

The idea of differences does not stem from the differences in poly and jc, but even earlier (i believe). The general trend is that usually those who go to the jcs are the SAP students etc, along with the upper echeleon of the rest of the student body. With all the ex-ranking business, it is fully expected that those who excel more in secondary education will have a slight sense of superiority.<br><br>Also, jc students tend to segregate themselves from poly students. Perhaps it's because of the culture as well. Like you (the girl from poly) pointed out, you get to do your finishing school first, so you get more freedom from the education system, leading to different ways of development. But do you not also notice a trend? That which the poly students way of speech, is often littered so much with dialects or just plainly crass language? I have poly friends too, and more than often not, I dislike the way they speak.<br><br>Anyway, what on earth is 'as in fun from the depths of your heart and not some "planned and organised" fun'?!  Again, you say you have many friends in JC, obviously you don't talk to them enough, or you simply do not understand them enough.<br><br>I think it's time that the jc students stop acting like they don't feel high and mighty. Acting noble and just is not the same as being. If we really don't feel or act high and mighty, why does it not show in our actions?<br><br>I am from a JC, and I do feel high and mighty. So there. And I'm not even a guy.<br><br>But let me ammend some of your points. I feel superior, not because I'm going to the U, and you aren't. I feel like I'm better than poly students because I do believe than I am smarter than most of you poly-'kia's as you call yourself. See? You and your dialect-littered-speech? In fact, I even feel superior to some of the students in JC. Because I know I am smarter than you. I probably speak better than you, and I probably look better than you.<br><br>And every society, is an elitist society.<br><br>I don't care if I'm the only who supports my case. This is the internet, and you probably can't reach me anyway.<br><br></div>

You are smarter? I don't think so dear. I believe that everyone have some form of intelligence . Just because one is not academically gifted doesn't mean a thing to me . <strong> Some may not perform well in school but yet they perform extremely well in the workforce ....maybe not locally but overseas. </strong> And you just made a paradox : If jc people are to stop acting high and mighty, then why do you even want to admit that you belong those high and mighty type.<br><br>From what you have written ,you are just in junior college . You have not even started your degree yet...who knows you may pass or fail but the thing is : you have no right to comment anything at all because professionally and careerwise you have not made it YET.

My suggestion is : people, don't look at others as cleverer or better. I started off thinking I was stupid because the system made me feel that way but I decided to fight back . Even though I did not make it locally , I am working towards my goals overseas.  Why? Because I was willing to take the opportunity when it presented itself. It doesn't matter to me whether jc people are pig headed or poly people are not smarter etc.. whatsoever.
