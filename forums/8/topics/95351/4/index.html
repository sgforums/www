A person can be taught many many things, but whether he/she chooses to follow the logical path depends eventually on him/herself.</div></blockquote>If you must know:<br>I went back to serve singapore after rejecting a foreign scholarship to do my masters . I was no government scholar but I worked hard in university and I was naive to think I would be on equal ground with anyone who has a degree.<br><br>I was paid lower than a scholar by a few hundred. She told me her pay and I didn't even say a word when I asked her how she did in her degree. 2nd class upper while mine was first class hons. her pay was higher btw. so much for meritocracy.<br><br>I was told by the higher ups that I had to "work a few years and gain experience" before getting my masters. While one of my friend , a scholar, who didn't have any experience as well , was sponsored for masters <strong> straight after his degree </strong> by that same organisation I worked for. He himself had 2nd class upper as well and he was my classmate. My ex colleague and I ,both non scholars, were told masters were "for selected people with leadership qualities". She had more working experience than my scholar friend. So go figure.<br><br>So Larry, that's the gist of things. I can bring up some more points but that would take too long to write. I am just thankful that at least another country decided to give me the chances that I would not have back home.<br></div>

Just because u enter poly as a jc student doesn't mean anything. If you were struggling ...why even go to JC? For university entrance purposes? Some polytechnic courses carry exemptions to a bachelor degree overseas.  If you are struggling , you are struggling..no point beating urself up with it.  There are always alternative pathways to careers and academia.  I took one alternative way and I am not regreting it.<br><br>Well anyways I wish u the best in your arts course.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, some people go to JC because they are interested in the ARTS.Poly does not offer that,and they never will.I dislike the fact that this whole society talks as if engineering is still the best thing since sliced bread.It's all about science, engineering etc...Where is the heartware.You need your academia, your policy think-tanks and your market researchers to keep this place running too.The education is skewed too much to the sciences already and if you're an Arts student in JC who really loves Arts, not because you were thrown there, you would understand what I'm trying to say.<br><br>PSC scholarship requires a Science student to possess 4 'A' levels and 2 'S' papers.But an Arts student need only have done 3 'A' levels and 1 'S' paper.Ponder over it guys.</div>
