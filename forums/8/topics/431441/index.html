              <p><a href="../../../users/998">FireIce</a> : U can choose not to. As stated in my post, i only want to gather people to slim down together, motivating and learn from each other. U can follow your own set of diet or program from ur own practitioner. But u can still join us to motivate each other in the group and to share things and ideas for slimming down. I very straight forward cause i dont force people to do things they dont like, very pointless. You decide your own life so its up to u lor =)</p>

Its never good to assume so much when u know nothing about what i doing. It's kinda unfair. What you said above doesnt help in anything in this thread but if u are some1 to wanna join my group to slim down, we shall talk more but i believe this is not the case. Typical untrained sales distributor? I'm not even a sales distributor -_- *yawnz* My post dont show any info like i'm one. But its your own subconscious mind that makes u think that i'm one. Shan't talk much, but time will tell.</p>
              <p>angel7030 : thanks for your post. you are as equal to the boy/girl as above.</p>
              <p>troublemaker2005 : looks like u dont like angie?? or angel?? she's more liek devil!!!</p>

              <p>you are free to voice your own opinions..like i am free to voice mine as well..</p>
              <p>i post the reply just so that people can have a wider view of opinions to think and reflect if they want to join you or not based on different people's feedback/review of your post.</p>
              <p>where i'm coming from is simply not to let people to be mislead by mis-interpreted text content, which i required observe frequently on offline and online sources..</p>
              <p>btw: life is not fair to begin with..you have to fight for your own fairness..which is to prove your own credentials on your own.</p>
              <p>but there's one thing you said correctly: time will tell the truth..which it did in my case..hopefully it will do for you too.</p>

              <p>Hi to all ladies and gentleman who spend 1min or their time reading this thread. I started this thread in order to gather all like minded people who are really into slimming down.<br><br>From my understanding, people wanted to slim down due to 2 main reasons :<br>1)wanting to get a better figure, be able to get more confidence<br>2)to be healthier, free from diseases caused by obesity<br><br>Additional reason : got dumped by their partners because of the word "FAT" <img title="Big Grin" src="http://www.hardwarezone.com.sg/img/forums/hwz/smilies/biggrin.gif;pve55dbb92b154d7ad" alt=""><br><br>And there are 2 main reasons on failing to get to the shape they want :<br>1)lack motivation, giving up halfway<br>2)weight bounced back due to lifestyle and discipline<br><br>Additional reason : found a partner who love them cos they are "FAT"!!<br><br>So love sucks!!! Haha just kidding~~~<br><br>Ok coming back to the topic, right now i am gathering a group of people to encourage and motivate each other in order to achieve the results they want.<br>Currently i got only a small small group of less than 10 peeps whom are seriously into slimming down and getting healthier. In order to get the desired results faster and more effective, i hope to gather more people to form a bigger group and also to share some experience. Most importantly, with more people encouraging each other, working together, the end results will be good.<br><br>For anybody interested, do drop me a message!!!<br><br>NO GIVING UP HALFWAY TILL SLIMMED DOWN!!  =)</p>

              <p>You should create a more useful group such as Yoga, pilates, Kick boxing or even weekly walkathon activities at east coast. No point sharing so much through verbal talking and naively think that motivation and encouragement help. how do you ensure these people are doing the right thing and not overly doing it that can result in life threatening thingy like bulimia and malnutrition? Any Specialist? are they sharing the correct information or knowledge? If something happens due to the information. who will be held responsible? Any successful case?. Like the old rule. NPNT. No Proof also no Talk.     </p>
