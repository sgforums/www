            <div class='col-md body'>Dear all, I've got a slight problem here. Which I myself can't solve for 3 years up till now.<br><br>I have a friend (who is a gal), she's like almost everything to me already. We are great friends when we go out together, we know of each other's problems all the time. We confide in each other whenever the need arises, it is like even my mom knows her so well. Her friendship with me is more than what some couples even have with each other.<br><br>She knows me so well that she even knows the type of gals that I'll like and even bother to try to find some of her friends to introduce to me. We can talk about pratically everything under the sun and the conversation btw us never ends no matter wat.<br><br>It's all thanx to her that I managed to graduate from Polytechnic and it's also thanx to her that I had my ex-gf last time.<br><br>Even when we go out together, ppl have seen us countless times that they even think that it's getting to be a bore seeing me with this gal cos they are so used to it.<br><br>But here's the thing, we aren't a couple....or are we a couple? I really don't know, it seems like we are everything but bf and gf.<br><br>Anyone has any point of views to air?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, sometimes just being very close with a girl doesn't neccessarily imply that you must fall in love with her. I have got a couple of really close female friends too, but that's all there is to it. Purely platonic. I've known her since my JC days, and that was like some 6 years ago, and to date we are still very good friends.<br><br>Sometimes, it's better to leave it that way, unless BOTH you and her feel that you should take this friendship onto a higher plateau.. Otherwise, I would strongly recommend that you try to maintain the friendship and not do anything to jeopardize it. : )</div>

Though we communicate even better than with my EX.<br><br>I did consider about the consequences of what might happen too if i were to screw up the whole frenship by just this matter.<br><br>Anyone any more opinions?<br>How about from the gals who participate in this bulletin?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A relationship can remain platonic for I have a female friend who is very close to me for the past 6 years and we are still very close to each other. Kenshin, although you made it clear to yourself that nothing near a relationship can ever exist between both of you but have you ever asked her if she ever feels the same way?<br><br>In the eyes of other's perspective, if a guy has a very close friend which is of the same sex they must be great buddies(or gays). And if a guy has a very close friend which is a female they tend to relate that you two are an item. If you keep your line clearly drawn, there can be no way their words can misguide or make you ponder twice into believing that couple love exists between you two, instead try to think of it as a bosom friend of the opposite sex.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, Battousai, take it easy...you've got to understand that you have to let things take its natural course. I used to lament that I didn't have a girlfriend, but one good friend told me to 'shun qi zi ran', so I took it easy and am now attached. So now I'm offering the same advice to you. Be comfortable, don't let these kind of thoughts affect the level of friendship you have with her. If it progresses, well, fine and good for you, but if it doesn't, then don't worry about it!<br><br>Hope this helps...<br><br>Cheers...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i thk platonic relationships between guys and gers are definitely possible, at least frm the POV of most girls. but i find tt most guys, when faced w such a wonderful relationship, are always tempted to brg it a step further... why? i guess sometimes the relationship grows to a pt where you guys are extremely comfortable ard each other, and you might even love each other... but often, when you try to brg it up to the nxt level, you realise tt tt love isnt what you thought it to be. sigh. and because of tt, many wonderful friendships are ruined.<br>personally, i have many gd guy friends; in fact, most of the ppl i confide in and my close frens are guys. wierd huh? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> but i thk you'll find tt most gers actually feel more comfortable talking to guys rather than members of their own sex. guys are USUALLY more relaxed and less likely to backstab you. but this is pretty much a generalisation and i have met guys who are alot bitchier than most gers i know.<br>IMHO, if you have a close fren of the opp sex and you're thking abt the possibilities of going steady, why dont you talk it out? i've been thru this stage w many of my frens and we usually discover, if we're being truthful, tt there're certain thgs abt us that dont matter when you're just frens but can a major obstacle when you try to start a relationship. or more often than not, you find tt you just dont feel "tt" way abt each other. but whatever it is, talking it out wld definitely be better than worrying abt it or acting on your hunch which cld ruin your whole friendship. you dont want tt to happen do you?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Platonic friendship is most teminally possible! Sometimes friendship is better than what mundane folks would call love. In fact, if you are friends with someone, it means that you also love the person (at least that's my defintion). I can safely say that I love all my friends, maybe even sometimes more than family.<br><br>About getting into a relationship with someone whom you have a platonic relationship with, may not be a good idea... because with that approach, you suddenly turn the tables, now there is "added" responsibility on intimacy and stuff like jealousy and other weird emotions that never occured while you were friends. So that is really bad. But so as to not make that mistake, ask casually about how come things never work out that way. Maybe the other party may wonder and realize what love really is. On the other hand, it may be a good thing that you ask.. maybe both parties have been waiting.. just that they didn't know or didn't dare try.<br>I would NOT recommend spoiling the friendship, maybe I'm just darn cynical, but many times I've tried, some real good girl friends start to keep a distance, others just assume another joke of mine is at play... and we are still friends.<br><br>Again, my 2 cents worth...<br>maybe more like 5 cents.<br><br>airhole</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kenshin:<br><br>How you feel for her? If you do feel for her, then platonic is just a term used as "cover". It is not platonic, but you made it seemed so.<br>Sometimes things better left unsaid, especially if you know the other party that well to know how she would react to your words. It's easier to care for someone you love without the other party knowing. Feelings is suppressed sometimes in order not to hurt the other party. Imagine how would your "good friend" feel if she's unable to reciprocate your feelings?<br>But then, if she really likes you and actually tried to help you to woo someone else you like, it must hurt her a lot, but of course those feelings are suppressed and hidden from you.<br>Try to figure out how she feels about you?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm actually not in a position to say whether it is possible or not, coz' I've neither had a girlfriend nor goodfriend b4. But I'll like to pose a few questions though:<br><br>1) Can you stand the sight of him/her everyday?<br>2) Can you live with him/her for the rest of your life?<br>3) Do the both of you enjoy each others company everytime you're together and always feel that your time together is not wasted time?<br>4) Are you willing to sacrifice for each other.<br>5) I he/she more important in your life than any other guy/gal.<br>6) Have you ever felt that gfs/bfs you have had can't seem to compare with that friend of yours or don't seem to understand you as much as him/her?<br>7) Is he/she your first choice when you're looking for someone to confide in?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Lastly, can you imagine yourself forming a family with him/her?<br><br>If the answer's yes to all of the above, has it ever occurred to you that he/she's the one you've been looking for all your life but didn't realise he/she's been there with you all along?<br><br>I feel that to develop a relationship with a person of the opp sex, beginning right from the elementary stage, friendship, to bgr is the purest of relationship developement.<br><br>If your friendship with him/her is really so strong, I think bringing up such a topic will in no way adversely affect your relationship, unless it's not as strong as you've thought is was.<br><br>Anyway, it's just my opinion.

In fact, you are very lucky to have this relationship.<br>On the other hand, you did not make any concrete move towards her and she you. so keep it that way.

            <div class='col-md body'>As long as both parties understand each other and can get along, there's no reason why a girl and a guy cannot remain as friends for 3 years, or even longer.<br><br>It's a matter of perception actually...some people can be friends with opposite sex and some cannot. I know of a guy friend who has lots of very close girl friends, but he has never had an actual girlfriend. He shares his troubles with his girl friends, ask them out for meals and gives them little gifts. Don't get me wrong he's not a flirt I've know him for nearly 4 years.....he is just not settled enough in his career to worry about getting attached.<br><br>So you see ? It's really possible to just be friends, it depends on whether both parties want to keep it that way.<br><br>Cheers !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know... This soundz exactly like my predicament. Asking you, Kenshin, has she ever had a boyfriend? You must ask yourself, are you just being selfish, taking for granted that she will always be there for you, or are you truely happy for her, no matter what, even if it means her happiness is with another guy which happens not to be you. It's able for a male &amp; female to keep a plutonic relationship as long as they are not too close, because after a while, U will start to get quite possessive of each other. Advice to U, think about it, how would U feel if she got a boyfriend, &amp; did not know how to tell U because she was afraid to tell U, coz that's likely. Taking that U've found out from an external source, how would U feel? If U find out she actually means that much to U, go for it, dun be "Hum ji" like I am.
