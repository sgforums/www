            <div class='col-md body'>Aiyah all yall wrong lah... I'm correct! Here!<br><br>SINGAPORE DIVORCE LAW INFORMATION<br>(Supplied by the Family Court of Singapore)<br>QUESTION:What are the reasons ("grounds") on which I can get a divorce?<br><br>The court will only grant you a divorce if it is satisfied that your marriage has "irretrievably broken down". In order to prove that your marriage has "irretrievably broken down", you must be able to show the existence of at least one of the following facts ("grounds"):<br>(a) That your spouse has committed adultery (i.e. had consensual sexual relations with a person other than yourself), and that you find it intolerable to live with him/her; and/or<br>(b) That your spouse has behaved in such a way that you cannot reasonably be expected to live with him/her (for example, your spouse has committed family violence against you); and/or<br>(c) That your spouse has deserted you for a continuous period of at least 2 years just before you start your divorce proceedings; and/or<br>(d) That you and your spouse have lived apart for a continuous period of at least 3 years just before you start divorce proceedings, and your spouse agrees to the divorce; and/or<br>(e) That you and your spouse have lived apart for a continuous period of at least 4 years just before you start divorce proceedings. In this case, your spouse does not need to agree to the divorce.<br>Note that for a) above, if you continue to live with your spouse for more than 6 months after you discover the adultery, you cannot rely on adultery to petition for a divorce.<br>For c) above, desertion means leaving you without your agreement and without any reasonable cause. In exceptional cases, where your spouse has without reasonable cause driven you out of the home and continues to exclude you from the house for a period of two years, that can also constitute desertion by your spouse.<br>For d) and e) above, "living apart" requires the intention of staying apart from each other with the view of ending the marriage, as well as the physical act of staying apart. However, you may still be considered as staying apart even if you and your spouse are staying at the same address, if you and your spouse have led completely separate lives and have separate households (i.e. not staying in the same bedroom, not having sexual relations, not doing any household chores such as cooking, washing, cleaning, ironing, etc. together, or for each other; not having meals together as a family; not going out together as a family, etc.) for the required length of time, for the purposes of obtaining a divorce based on three or four years' separation.<br><br><a href="http://www.international-divorce.com/singaporedivorcelaw/" rel="nofollow">http://www.international-divorce.com/singaporedivorcelaw/</a></div>

The court will grant the permission if you can prove that you have suffered "exceptional hardship" or that your spouse has behaved with "exceptional depravity" (i.e. behaved extraordinarily badly). In deciding whether to grant you the permission, the court will also consider whether there is any possibility of a reconciliation between you and your spouse, and the interest of any child of your marriage.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Aside from getting divorced, how can I get out of a marriage? </strong><br>You may apply for your marriage to be declared a "nullity", rather than for a divorce. Alternatively, you may apply for judicial separation.<br><br><strong>What is "nullity" and when can I apply to declare my marriage a nullity? </strong><br>When the court makes an order for nullity, it is declaring that the marriage is invalid. You can only apply for your marriage to be declared a nullity in the following circumstances:<br><br>(a) You have not had sexual relations with your spouse after marriage because either you or your spouse is physically not capable of having sex, and this physical incapacity cannot be medically treated.<br>(b) You and your spouse have not had sexual relations after marriage because your spouse has wilfully (i.e. intentionally) refused to have sex with you without a valid reason.<br>(c) That you or your spouse did not validly consent to the marriage (for example, because of mental illness, mistake, or duress. (Duress is when a person is in fear caused by the threat of immediate danger, such as being beaten up, if he/she does not agree to the marriage)).<br>(d) You or your spouse was suffering from mental illness at the time of the marriage, such that you/your spouse were/was unfit for marriage<br>(e) Your spouse had a communicable venereal disease at the time of your marriage and you did not know this at that time<br>(f) Your spouse was pregnant with someone else's child at the time of your marriage and you did not know this at that time.<br><br><strong>What is the difference between Nullity and Divorce? </strong><br>You may start proceedings for nullity immediately after marriage, before you have been married for 3 years whereas you can only start divorce proceedings after you have been married for 3 years. Divorce is the dissolution (ending) of a valid marriage. Nullity is the declaration that a marriage is invalid. Once your marriage is annulled, your status is that of a spinster or bachelor, whereas in the case of a divorce, your status is that of a divorcee.<br>You and your spouse will have the same rights to apply for maintenance, and the division of matrimonial assets as if you had applied for a divorce.<br><br><strong>What is Judicial Separation? </strong><br>You can apply for Judicial Separation for the same reasons that you can apply for a divorce. If the court grants your application for Judicial Separation:<br><br>(a) You no longer have the duty to live together and have sexual relations with your spouse.<br>(b) Neither you nor your spouse can inherit the property of the other person if he/she dies without making a will. (If the husband and wife are still married, and there is no decree of judicial separation, and one of them dies without making a will, the survivor may get a share of the deceased's property.)<br>(c) You and your spouse will have the same rights to apply for custody of children, maintenance, the division of matrimonial assets as if you had applied for a divorce.<br><br>Either you or your spouse can still apply for a divorce after obtaining a decree of Judicial Separation.<br></div>
