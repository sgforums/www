            <div class='col-md body'>GENTING HIGHLANDS : PAHANG : VILLAGE<br><br>As all of you probably would have known, GH is the only place which houses the only casino in Malaysia. There has been a lot of encounters within the nearby villages. Nowadays, two hotels have been constructed for increasing influx of tourists, and it so happens that the villages are no longer occupied these days, for reasons logically known and explained above...<br><br>My aunt (true story) loves to gamble, and would go up there once or twice every week to gamble. She always wins and was said to have a very good luck (in Chinese, there is a particular word which I don't know)... The very last time she went up there to gamble, about 2 years back, she started off the evening by winning, but then started to lose all her current savings she would keep with her whenever she go gamble.<br><br>Tired and depressed from the loss, she ventured outside and walked around until she came to the place near the village, where she heard her name being called...<br><br>RULE #1 : Never turn back when you hear someone call you, unfamiliar voices especially<br><br>RULE #2: When you lose, you are more prone to the dark and you will often hear such things...<br><br>My aunt turned around not knowing what was going on and thought that it was her friend who was there with her at that time. What she saw made her trip to GH the final, and as she relate the incident to me, she was still in a state of shock and fear. She trembled and was icy cold as she was admitted to the ICU for life support.<br><br>As she was recovering, she said that there was a young lady, beautiful who was dressed in red looking at her at first with kind eyes. My aunt, still in a sad mood that time, ignored her and turned away. The lady called out to her again and as she was about to shoo her off, the lady's eyes turned red with anger and told her that she has been neglected since she was born, and now when she is dead, she deserve a little respect and wanted company. My aunt thought that the lady was drunk and shouted at the lady in Hokkien to shoo her off.<br><br>The lady in red then took off her scarf and blouse and levitated. Her face at first which was flushed turned snowy pale and her hair which was not seen at first, was disshevelled. Her guts was seen hanging from her neck and blood was dripping out towards the very end of her gut. The figure sped towards my aunt. She was stiff and shocked at that time, that my aunt did not know what to do but to scream her lungs out She then fainted and woke up in the ICU... She was fortunate to only have a broken hip from that fall. She never wanted to go there again.</div>
