            <div class='col-md body'>Just thought of sharing to everyone...<br><br>All About Love<br>1. It's so funny how we set qualifications for the right person to love, while at  the back of our minds we know that the person we truly love will<br>always be an exception.( PRECISELY!!)<br>2. There would come a time when we have to stop loving someone not because that person started hating us but because we found out that they'd be happier if we let them go...(TRUE..)<br>3. You will know when you really love someone when you want him to be happy even if their  happiness means you are not a part of it.(SIGHHZ..)<br>4. If someone comes into your life and becomes a part of you but for some reasons he couldn't stay, don't cry too much... just be glad that your paths crossed and somehow he made you happy even for a while.  (*sniff* *sniff*)<br>5. There are some things that we never want to let go of... people we never want to leave behind; but keep in mind that letting go is not the end of the world, but rather it is the beginning of a new life.( IT ISNT THAT EZ To LET GO PERHAPS?)<br>6. Just because someone doesn't love you the way you want him or her to, doesn't mean they don't love you with all he or she have.(HAHA)<br>7. Remember that the best relationship is when your love for each other is greater than your need for&gt;&gt;&gt;each other.=)<br>8. Two tear drops were floating down the river. One teardrop said to the other, "I'm the teardrop of a girl who loved a man and lost him. Who are you?"..." I'm the teardrop of the man who regret letting a&gt;&gt;&gt;girl go..."(SADZ..)<br>9. You'll know that you miss someone very much when every time you think of that person, your heart breaks into pieces and just a quick "Hello" from that person can bring the broken piecesback....(YAR...)<br>10. When you love someone, draw a circle around their name instead of a heart because  hearts can be broken but circles never end.( WOW..)<br><br>In life there are 3 things that can never be retrieved the spoken words, time past, the neglected opportunities...<br><br>I wonder if all these are the fundamentals of true love is...Any comments?<br>P.S: Used to have more to it.But I will just stopped to 10...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>And I was wondering how many of you here have really loved? Me??Dunno what is love...<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 19 January 2000).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 19 January 2000).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 19 January 2000).]</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>To Rinoa :<br>Here is what I have understand thru interaction and my own understanding of love:<br><br>1)Love is something when you take away all the hatred, all the pain, all the beautiful and all the memories, yet you are concerned about the other person and still feel for the other person.<br>2)Every now and then, even years later, something reminds you of the other person - a certain smell, a few notes of a song, a place, a few words and some item which trigger your thoughts - and suddenly you feel just as bad as the day the other person had told you he/she never wanted to see you again. If you want to know the honest truth... you never completely get over a person you really cared about.<br>3)The way I see it, people are either meant to be together or they're not.<br>4)What makes a relationship is not whether how smart, good-looking or any kind of good qualities that one must possess, all you need is X-factor, that thing which allow you to attract the other party.<br>5)If love, whether human or divine, was the solution to the person's problem, it was not the one that could be given; it had to be bestowed by a gift. That is the most difficult part for a person in his/her search for a relationship. If love is ever a choice, who would want exquisite pain.... *sigh*<br>6)Romantic love is a dream where we wasted half our lives searching for, and realize in the end, we came here alone since we are born and in the end, leave this world alone as well.<br>7)There are 2 tragedies in our lives, one is not getting the r/s which we want, and the other is getting the r/s we want which ended in realizing the other person is not the One. I always prefer the latter. What about you?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">We do what we must in life... Sometimes we can choose the path we follow. Sometimes our choices are made for us. And sometimes we have no choice at all. Love is something that we try to seek the path, but never know where we are all the time...<br>9)It is always surprising how small a part of life is taken up by meaningful moments. Most often they are over before they start even though they cast a light on the future and make the person who originated them unforgettable. So much is those fast going romances, where you find a moment that you love someone and then he's gone from your life and it is a flash of the moment.<br>10)If you love someone, set her free. If she comes back to you, she is yours forever, and if she doesn't, it is never meant to be.. It is something sad yet, we have no control over these things...<br>11)I wish that someone could come into my life and love me, then set me free from the shadows of the past and push me to higher heights of life. But love is not about trying to get someone to relieve your pain, but to make you a better person by loving someone.<br>12)Love is the wierdest thing.. At one point, you think you will not love this person, and somehow, fate makes a twist and you realize that this person is not that bad afterall, and then you decide to love this person.<br>13)Love comes when a person least expects it... So, don't bother to search, it will just comes to you when you don't bother about it...<br>14)Love &amp; Lust belong to Desire, and Desire is always cruel.<br>15)"You are mortal: it is the mortal way. You attend the funeral, you bid the dead farewell. You grieve. Then you continue with your life. And at times the fact of her absence will hit you like a blow to the chest, and you will weep. But this will happen less and less as time goes on. She is dead. You are alive. So live." from Dream to those who cannot get over with losing their loved ones to Death...<br>16)Love takes hostages.It gets inside you. It eats you out and leaves you crying in the<br>darkness, so a simple phrase like "maybe we should just be friends" or "how very perceptive" turns into a glass splinter working its way into your heart.<br>17)When you wake up from your dream the next morning, realize that the other person is no longer by your side, you will be feeling pain and sorrow for the loss, and wonder why you are still in the same position as before. Love is a double edged sword, it heals and yet hurts at the same time.<br><br>Such are my thoughts to love, will add if I have something new in my mind....<br><br>[This message has been edited by prodigal (edited 19 January 2000).]</div>

That is what I think of as a manifestation of love.<br><br>"Is this true for guys too? If he comes back to me, will he be mine forever?"<br><br>That I do not know. But if I will decide to love this person, I will be hers forever..<br><br>To KTE :<br>There are cell and molecular biologists who believe that emotions are just nothing but biochemical reactions of complex molecules in a reductionist sense. If that is true, I don't know whether there is still meaning in our existence... Sometimes, I do wonder that too about your question as well.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To prodigal...<br><br>i understand what u mean...just that i feel that it would really really be true love if after all the hurt and pain a guy has caused his partner, and his partner still care for him, despite what he has done to her.<br><br>I dunno...but I myself was in a relationship whereby both of us started to feel that we shd not be together anymore coz none of us were willing to put in more effort to make the sparks remain. Within this period, we did not show much concern for each other, just let the days go on. I thought he didnt care, so I felt hurt. And even more hurt when he said I didnt care about him, coz from my point of view, it was him who didnt care first. I even thought that I didn't love him anymore. But after we broke up, I realised that I love him, and I missed him so much. I even asked him to let us try again. But he was unsure of his feelings and didnt want to commit again. Till now, my heart still aches when I think of him, think of the things that we have done, think of how we have foolishly "wasted" the relationship....that's why I find memories,both good or bad, difficult to forget...it's almost impossible...Right now, I'm trying to let go, but at the same time, hoping that he will come back to me, and be mine forever...<br><br>I regret not treasuring someone who is so precious to me, but ironically, it's only when I've lost him that I realised how much he meant to me. If this didn't happen, both of us would still be unhappy blaming each other for not caring, but yet both refusing to take the first initiative to do something about it. I noe regretting is useless, what has happened has happened..<br><br>I dunno if I've gotten too far away from the topic...but just a sudden flow of emotions, hope u all wont mind...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Back to Sparkle :<br><br>One can view it the other way around for a guy who is hurt by the gal he loved. That is from my context. I don't think you are going far away in the topic from the looks of  your post. I am also induced to memories which  make me feel so vulnerable to.. Yet, I have reached the point that I cannot be broken anymore.<br><br>Reading your story, I say that you are much more fortunate than I do. Well, at least that there is a chance between the guy and you. Unlike you, I can never be with my ex-gf anymore. Strange, we went through so much to be together. All it takes is a long distance relationship and her ex-bf who has mended his ways from a gangster to a normal person, and she left my life just like that.. As a result, I crashed in my exams and lost everything from love, dreams to even family..  Then I realized that in the end, I have no choice but to go as far away as I can and have no attachments to this place which I once called home. I remember when I came back for a vacation, every bit of the place reminded of her. I may have done something wrong to her, and vice versa. Nevertheless, take away all the happy and sad memories, I still care for her and even she is not talking or even communicating with me, I still love her and till now, I could not get over her. Sometimes, I wish that she will come back to me... Every time in this far distant land, I dream of her,whether it is a beautiful dream or a nightmare in my slumber. I can only wake up and realize that I was scorned by the backlash of reality, and have to ponder why I am still in the same position as before. Nevertheless, I have to stop feeling miserable and try to live the same day as meaningfully and happily that I can even at times, I have to cope with a new world here..<br><br>Just let me say something here to you : if you still love that someone, tell him and only hope that he will accept and start a new and happier life with you. Don't wait... Otherwise, that might not be a chance anymore. So, good luck and may you find your true love...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dun wanna to make U all cry...but these are the next ten..stay tuned for more....<br><br>11. Just a thought: What would you do if the only person who could make you stop crying is the person who makes you cry?(WAD CAN B DONE?)<br>12. "Every step I took since the moment I could walk was a step towards finding you." You don't want to let go; but it's even more painful to ask someone to stay if you can never make the relationship work out the way it should be. (learn to let go at times...)13. LOVE? it's kind of complicated, but I'll tell you this...the second you're willing to make yourself miserable to make someone else happy, that's love right. (awww...)<br>14. If I had the letters "HRT", I can add "EA" to get a "HEART" or a "U"and get "HURT". But I'd rather choose "U" and get "HURT than have a "HEART" without U"...(YEAH..)<br>15. Giving someone all your love is not an assurance that he will love you back. Don't  expect love in return, wait for it to grow in his heart, if it doesn't, be contented it grows in you.(sighh..)<br>16. It takes a minute to have a crush on someone, an hour to like someone, and a day to  fall in love with someone but it takes a lifetime to really forget someone you have grown to love.(true..)<br>17. When friends fall in love, it means they are meant for each other. But when friends  fall out of love, it means they want to keep each other forever...<br>18. Don't be too good i will miss  you. don't be too caring, i might like you. Don't be too sweet, I might fall. It's hard for me to love you when you won't love me after all...*sobz*<br>19. A heart truly in love never loses hope but always believes.(untli one day...)<br>20. love when you have to go. Take care of me, don't go away because if you love me, you will stay... i love you and do you know why? You got me when you first said 'Hi'.(wahh..)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i can only describe the feeling of "love" in one way.  to me, being in love is the feeling when you can't stand being separated from the other for one reason...because he/she completes you.  when you feel the agony of separation, even for a day, and when you feel all the pain lifted after seeing/hearing your loved one.  it's when you would give up everything you hold dear to you just to be with them.  it's when you would go through fire and all obstacles in your way just to hold their hand...and when you still want to be with that person even after all the obstacles you had to go through, that's when you should know that you are in love.<br>i think i'm gonna get flamed for this...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>the statement below is true.<br>the statement above is false.</div>
