            <div class='col-md body'>Rinona:<br><br>Yup. new here, hope you all dun mind me chucking in, but I thought I might as well, express my POV. Anyway, with regrads to Prodigal, and all the others who have posted their story, I am sorry that it happened. But understand this you are not the only person in this world who experience these.<br><br>I have no intention to be rude, but I can't help but think that most of you here are rather emotional, but alas isn;t love an emotion as well?!? hmm... but I am a rather logical person by nature, and with that I have managed to see thru quite a few things.<br><br>Let me share my story,<br><br>My ex and I were rather close, she is not my first not me her's. She was 3 years older than me. We were together not for long, but we were pretty much in love, geezze, at my young age I even have thoughts of marrying her(first time ever in my life), But I was young, haven't serve my NS, without a career, got nothing but a burning desire to succeed. Guess that was what attracted her, my ambitous nature. Anyway, all went pretty well, we were together for 7 loving months, and went I found out that she has found another man, whom she feels is more suitable for her, the guy is established, rather well-to-do, handsome, great body(rugby player), and of a rather nice character. FYI, the guy does not know of my exsistance until now, and I promised not to tell him. I felt rather betrayed, for all my time, my energies and devotion. I guess anyone would, but after serveral talks that end up nowhere, I thought thru it. There is no point in continuing thi relatioship I feel as she does not feel for me anymore, and it will only be more painful for both of us to carry on, SHe keeps asking for my forgiveness, and keeps telling her that she is in the wrong, but thoughts began to form in my mind. She was never wrong, she is only looking for her own happiness, and by keeping her with me, I am only leading her off the trail. I asked myself if I truly love her, for if I do, what is the pain I am feeling now? Does it not meant to keep her by my side? I came to understand the pain that I am feeling is not so much of betrayal, but of not understanding why she is unhappy with myself. They are now married, and have migrated to Australia. After I know that she is now so much happier with my blessings and is together with the man whom she knows is ruly suitable for her, I am contented and I too feel her joy. NOW I truly understand what it means by these :-<br><br>"You will know when you really love someone when  you want him to be happy even if his or her happiness means you are not a part of it."<br><br>".It's really painful to say goodbye to someone else that you don't want to let go; but it's even more painful to ask someone to stay if you can never make the relationship work out the way it should be."<br><br>"Well, Kris, if you are reading this, I hope you understand how I feel now, so carry on with your happy life, and have no fear that I will be sad, there is no resentment on my side. Drop me a mail sometimes ok? Haven't heard from you for sometime."<br><br>OK back to the topic, Through this experience I have I have learnt, and I have survived, Though I am still serving my NS now and will be ORDing soon, I understand that, I am presently still rather raw, and will need more polishing in life before I am really prepared to settle down, so I am devoting more of my energies to developing my career and to become a better person.<br><br>You might say that, my was nothing compared to your experience, but how do you measure love in the first place? I am sure that every relationship will have it's own placei n our heart, and who is it to compare? I will not compared mine to anyone elses but I would share it, in hope that someone else will grow from my experinece. And I too, hope to do the same with other's.<br><br>-----------------------------<br>Just my $0.02 worth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Rinoa Heartilly:<br><br>"Why do two ppl have to fall in love?"<br><br>I would say that most people are searching for the true love in their lives. Sometimes, we found love but they ended up in breakups, which seems to be inevitable. Someone once told me of a theory called the red string theory, saying that the person who is going to be the One will be tied with the red string to your feet. No matter how you run away, you will eventually end up with her.. Still, I do not know whether it is true or not... Well, it's up to you whether to believe in it or not...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Callan :<br><br>I don't see that you are any rude in your posts. Everyone has his/her story to tell. Every story have a good or bad ending and the magnitude of the damage of a breakup to a person is solely dependent on the circumstances, and it is very difficult to judge. By no means, I will say that anyone's problem will be less worse than mine. Perhaps, people here are emotional here. Well, sometimes, because we do not know the person and people do not know us, it is easier to tell our story here in this newsgroup. Sometimes, people also think that we have given up hope and stopped living. Perhaps, in reality, some of us are just putting our story down here, and sought to move on from there.<br><br>There is this thought which I have been having for the past few days. I just thought all these while, I have not understood love at all.. Sometimes, I wonder whether there exists true love. However, when I remember that I refuse to yield to cynicism, I have my decision, which is that I still search for true love... Because I believe, there may still be a chance for me to find it.. Love has no rationality in it. If there is ever rationality, then all of us will not have to handle the backlashes of breakup, the pain of losing our loved ones and so forth...<br><br>Love is something that cannot be measured, something manifest through expressions from our hearts to people around us... If one can able to define love, we will not have written so much about it here.<br><br>Good luck, live well and prosper.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Cluon:<br>Well, everyone have their way of seeing love whether happy and sad, are allowed here to express their opinions.<br><br>At least, one thing which make me happy recently, is that I have to mend back a couple who have broken up. They are now happy together, and they are thankful for this family friend helping them out. Though they are both ang-mohs, but I can relate to them... Small town I lived in here, but got a lot of nice and happy love stories happening for the people around me...<br><br>Meanwhile enjoy yourself, live well and prosper...<br></div>
