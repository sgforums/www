            <div class='col-md body'>What is love?? How did it become so great that it can make one life filled with happiness or sadness. Even one's direction in life, can be determined by how his/her love life is.<br><br>The power of love is strong enough to drive a person to take another man's life or give a dying man enough will power to pull through.<br><br>At times, do you wonder if all you are doing for your object of affection or love one worth all the efforts? Would you feel spending days or mths doing something such as making a cross-stitch for the person you like worthwhile even though he/she might not appreciate it?<br><br>I feel that people at different stage of life treat love differently. When we are young, we got the tendency to treat love more as a game. As we matured, our perception would probably changed to being one of being responsible and commited to the other person.<br><br>To love someone need not be possession of the person<br>It's knowing that the person is happy that is most important.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

But how many of you actually know what love is?<br>I suppose the definition of love in the context of this topic would be the love between a man and woman.<br><br>I have never known this love.

Once a very good friend shared this with me,<br><br>Its not who you can live with, its who you cannot live without. Now, we all say that we can take this, and take that, but most of all, there is this person that we can't live without. Have you found this person?<br><br>When a person says I love you, what it means is regardless of all the obvious faults that I can see, I love you.<br><br>I can love more than a person at a time and I have, but there will only be one person that I want, that person is the one who actually makes me happy, just by being who she is, not molding herself to my expectations.<br><br>To break down into small qualities as to why I love a person will actually tear down what love is to me. There can be no details as to how come I love her, its just the whole package... a synergy of things... and also with the addition of her faults..<br><br>We don't love qualities,we love persons, sometimes by reason of their defects as well as of their qualities.<br><br>The person is valuable because we love them not because they are valuable then we love them.<br><br>I have said this before somewhere... opposites attract, but its the similiarities that bind and hold people together.<br><br>When we love a person, be Mr/Miss right first before looking for Mr or Miss right...<br>It'll make things so much easier when they find us...<br><br>I know that I will love the person for whoever she is, whatever she was,for what she wants to be, and what she will be in time to come... now, i believe that that is what I can describe in my limited vocab, my version of love...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa.. I agree with you that it takes the person to untie your knot, no one else can. Everyone can tell you how good or bad he/she is but it's your decision on how your perception of the person being and how you with to treat it.<br><br>The world won't be the same without love, and it's love that bring about life and life bring about continuity.<br><br>Demands on love varies from person to person. Some are possessive, some are contented so long their love is return. It's up to individual how they want to love, and what they expect from giving the love.<br><br>I am not sure how true this is, but it seems like the tougher it is to win the girl heart, the more you would treasure her (provided you love her from the beginning).

            <div class='col-md body'>To Rinoa :<br>Sometimes, the knot is too tied that it is impossible to be untied. Time is the only ingredient to make it possible. Sometimes, the person hopes that he can untie the knot by hoping for a reunion, perhaps, to him, it seems to be the only choice. However, life is not always as what we expected to be.. We live with disappointments, and some people chose not to untie their knots, and walked away... I can understand why this is so, because I could not untie my knot, hence I chose to be a vagabond with the notion of living another life that there is no more attachment to my family or friends.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Rinoa:<br>I don't say that I am wasting my life now as I used to at one point of time, at least, I know that I try to live in a meaningful and happy manner as much as I can in the small English town which I am staying. At least there is my own work at the laboratory in the day  and at the end of the day, sometimes I worked in a pub as a bartender or sit in the pub for a drink with the people in town, sometimes listening to their problems in life.  I have mentioned once before that Time is the only thing where everything else is gone and it still remained to ease the pain of the wounds inflicted upon a person. As for setting up the family, I have yet to find the gal first and I don't see myself getting one anytime soon even if I try to search for it.. Besides I was offered the possibility of that just before the moment  when I was determined to leave. In the end, I chose to leave because I should be fair to the person as I have not gotten over the one whom I once loved.<br><br>To me, the first half of my life is over, and now I just want to live the next half of my life in the way I like, being a prodigal... Do not assume that I am digging my own grave. She is gone and I am alive, so I live and that's the way it is in our mortal ways...<br><br>[This message has been edited by prodigal (edited 23 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I may not be a worthy person to comment on this topic, but what I understand is I loved a person before, and until now, I still love her a lot. A lot of stuffs happened, yeapp, we are now in our own ways, but I am still waiting for her, although I know we may not be together again. True, according to Rinoa, be glad that our path has crossed each other's before, and until now, I still love that person. Hope one day, everything will go back to the point where I was sending her home. Love may not be everything, it may not be life, but I have love in my life.. That's what I can say.

            <div class='col-md body'>To rainboy:<br><br>Nobody is ever unworthy to comment on the topic of love. Love is highly subjective, and only manifested thru our daily life. How a person perceived love, is dependent how the events which have occurred in his life. At least there are two forces which are still driving the world around : Hope and Time....<br>That is perhaps why people can still carry on after making so many blunders. Meanwhile I wish you all the best to your hopes. It is great to see people getting back together, and I just recently mended a couple back together, even I know that no one (includes myself)  will never be able to mend  back the past...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>erm.......someone once said to me, tt i m  not supposed to forget past relationships. so if i'm not supposed to forget, how do i move on into nother r/s?<br>i tried, but mayb i haven't tried hard enough, but wat matters is i've tried rite? i mean, i've tried to move on, but i found myself constantly comparing my past r/s with the present one. it's very tiring, n sometimes, i'd keep looking back, n thinking of the memories left behind by the past r/s. it hurts......a great deal.......=(((<br>anyway, i've sidetracked.....so is the person right? i mean, it's not a matter of whether we r supposed to forget or not, but rather, a matter of whether we can forget or not rite???</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Think of this scenerio..."A pretty gal as a gf, having both the intellect and the personality, it is a guy's most sought for dream girl...U have got her as a gf..and U feel that U are so lucky and top of the world...and the problems creeps in...There are guys all over trying to know her and U can't stand it anymore cos she is honest and she tells u all the "admirers" confession about her. You really love her alot and U trusted her but U can't stand the idea that she is still frens with them...So the girl is in  dilemma of what to do...and the guy is one of the most eligible and most sought after guy too...In the end they have to break up...cos there is no ending story of the guys chasing the girl...and it is the man's pride and ego that his girl is still seeing the guys he likes..."<br><br>Well...love is also trust and forbearing...but sometimes...it come to a point whereby ur personal traits seeped in which hinder the improvements of the relationship...even two couples which seemed a perfect match have to seperate becos of distingusihed character differences...It is sad but it seems that a person's love and posession seems much greater than the love he has for his partner...<br><br>Guys might take rejection as a failure but I think rejection is to make u realise that at least the girl that U like know what she wants and not just having a fling or two with u...I have learnt to be truthful with my feelings if i dun like a guy for fear he will drag on and on liking me...which is not fair...so guys..dun take rejection as a failure but a deeper understanding of the girls' plight and situation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway, I have a question, Why do human beings fall in love? I think that there are serveral POV to this questions as well as several factors to it. Let me explain my POV.<br><br>LOVE?<br>Why I say LOVE? Well simply because I doubt we understand it at all. Love has always been thought of as irrational, illogical, unsensible...e.t.c. So to find an answer as to why do human beings fall in love would almost be impposible would'nt it? But I thoughts of some possibilities, from different aspects and perspectives. I might not at all make sense to you but I hope you will at least enjoy my idle chatter.<br><br>Enviromental reasons.<br>Strange? Well, that's hat I say too, but look at it this way, since we were born, we were loved by our parents, and we were brought up this why, thus sub-consiciously, we were taught to love others, just like how our parents love us. Also as we got older, our peers fall in love, we follow suit because it just seems like the growing up process, human beings have the tendancy to want what other people have and is good. When we see that our peers become happier in their life and have support from their gf/wife, we feel the need to get someone to fill that place too. Could it be what you call peer pressure? Another aspect of enviroment could be that, when you get older, say your parents pass away like all human being do, the place that was formerly fill by them now thus becomes empty, thus you might most probably fill that place with your wife/gf/ children, or whatever that is dearest to you. Thus the need for social support, could be one of the reasons.<br><br>Psycohlogical reasons<br>Now this might get a bit technical here, you can chosse to skip this part if you want to. I have read up quite sometime ago that, a study was made to study human physical reactions to falling in love. Why do we like the feeling of falling in love? Well, according to the article, certain chemicals in your body are release during this stage in your life, and when it happens the chemical reactions in your body will give you an overall good feeling. These chemicals that are release is similiar to the chemicals that are release when you are feeling happy. Thus a hapy feeling, or a feeling of lightness envelopes a person when he/she falls in love. Also according to the study, when say a man is interested in a woman, there will be certain physical reactions that will develope unknowingly or sub-consciously to the person. Say for a man, if he is to see a woman he is interested in, his pupils will enlarge to allow more light into the retina and thus seeing her in a clearer view. Thus he is actually more alert to his enviroment when it happens, his muscles will tighten to show off a better physique, his back will straighten and shoulders pull back to make himself look bigger... e.t.c. For the female, her respiratory systems will contract, thus less air and more difficult to breath, so the feeling of breathlessness envelopes, and a 'high' feeling is projected to her. Her posture also changes, her back will be straighen, chest lifted, to look more attractive, in the primitive instincts. Her pupils will too expand, just like the man for the same reasons....e.t.c. And all these physical changes to his/her body, actually make him feels good and more confident of himself. So when a person is in love, he/she generally feels good and will be more confident.<br><br>Emotional reasons<br>A person might fall in love because of the the need to feel secure, that there is always someone there for him/her. Whether it is financially, emotionally, or spirtually, to give him/her support in these ways make a person feel that he/she is taken care of. Emotionally, he/she feels fullfilled and thus can and will have the confidence to perform in life. As human beings, support is very important in our lives.<br><br>"No man is an island"<br><br>The above phrase already explains that we cannot live alone and will have to have at least another person to rely on.<br><br>Primitive reasons.<br>Since the beginning of time, it is man mission to search for his other mate, in the hope that he/she will become happy. This is a natural instinct that we have develope since since the beginning of our existance. Also it is to protect ourself that we mate(have sex), to increase our numbers, so as to maintain our existance in this world, and I am quite sure that we it first happen long long long long time ago, it is not out of love, but it developes(this is my own thougths and not anyones elses so might just be gibberish) into love subsequently as man wants to protect their mate, from others. So that he will have the rights to her. Also the man will have to protect his woman from the natural threats, wild animals, natural disasters..e.t.c. And the woman in seeing the man protect her takes the man as her saviour. (excuse me for saying that, but remember what I am saying belongs to the time long long time ago.) Thus the feeling of idea of love starts developing.<br><br>Differences reason.<br>Man and woman are different both physically, mentally and emotionally. And it is because of such difference that makes us attract us to one another. What the man lacks in(snesitivity, care for samll matters) the woman makes up for it. Also just like the above, what the woman lacks, (physical strenght, ambition..e.t.c.) the man makes up for it. Thus opposite attracts.<br><br>Well I guess it sums what what I have to say, *laffs* I guess I broke my own record for lenghtness again huh? Well sorry for that, but hope I had share something worthwhile.<br></div>
