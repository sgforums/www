Care to share experiences?<br><br></div></blockquote>i do believe in such "things", they are all around, its just that not everybody can see them.<br><br>myself, i have, so far, never seen such things.  but i do have close relatives, friends, and colleagues, who have had such run-ins.<br><br>case 1.<br>a few yrs back when my gf's nephews were still so very young, the 2 brothers were about 4~5 yrs old.  My gf often spend time baby-sitting them when their parents have to go for a short trip.  Once, the older of the brothers, who is, compared to his younger sibling, the more quiet/introvert type, kept complaining of not being able to sleep.  When asked why, he said that there's someone else in the house, and he can see her, standing at the doorway to the bedroom.  This went on for a while, as the house was then a brand new flat in CCK, the parents then suspected it was not 'clean' so they called in a 'spiritual' person who can see such things to communicate with the being and asked it to leave.  It is unlikely that a young kid like that can make up a story, he was even to young to know what ghosts and spirits really are, so he was not really so shocked or afraid, just disturbed by its presence.  And no-one else other than this quiet, thoughtful kid, can see it.<br><br>case 2.<br>I have a colleague, a happy-go-lucky, cheery kind of guy.  When we talk, its usually about guys stuff like, hi-fi, cars, etc.  One morning, he just came to me, and softly ask me, "hey, do you believe in ghosts?".  Immediately, from the look on his face and the tone of his voice, i know that something had just happened to him.  I said yes, despite the fact that I've never seen one.  What happened was, that morning, his wife, as usual, had just left for work while he remained sleeping, alone in his room.  After a while, he was awaken by the movement of someone beside him.  He was back facing the 'empty' part of his bed, but it was obvious that someone was sleeping right behind him.  He didn't dare to try to get up or turn around, so he just said out loud "don't disturb me, i want to sleep".  He went back to sleep, and sometime later, the 'being' was gone.  I have been working with him for 4 years, and that was the only day we talked about such things.  Woodlands.<br><br>case 3.<br>My sister-in-law.  Marsiling.  She had a few 'child spirit' encounters before.  A typical old type 3 rm flat where the kitchen is the longish type.  She was sitting in the kitchen eating, alone at home, when from the corner of her eyes she sees a small kid walking past behind her, past the hall towards her room.  She was shocked but quickly got up and tried to take a better look at it.  But all she saw was just a dark shadow darting into one of the rooms and disappeared.<br><br>I have been to all the above mentioned places, but I don't feel uneasy or seen anything.  Maybe my frequency is very much out of phase with such things.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
