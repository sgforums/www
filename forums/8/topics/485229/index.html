            <div class='col-md body'><p>Guys, hear me out. I am not saying that this company is totally bad, but maybe it's individual staff are (Which is still partly the company's fault for improper training though). The company we enlisted was Apex Movers, and we had a very bad experience.<br><br>We were moving from one house to another and sorted their help, we had already packed all the items into the boxes for them to move. We had a maid over at our place to look over things as me and my family were moving the smaller items by car, we had earlier moved the valuable items already. We also separated the things to dispose and things not to touch by pasting large words on them "DO NOT TOUCH", these items were either for the Salvation Army or to our friends/relatives, and we also explained to them beforehand.<br><br>Went we cameback to our house, one of the portable air con (Which was previously last seen in our house) with "DO NOT TOUCH" sign  meant for our relative was missing. We questioned them about it and they fervently claimed they did not see the air con. My family and I searched the whole house and could not fign a trace of it. They even claimed not to spoil their company's reputation and challenge us to look at the lift's security camera.<br><br>We proceeded to do so.There was no sign of unusual activity in the security camera, but listening to our condo management advice, we also searched the compartments outside our house (Those for the waterpipes or firehose etc). True enough, my father had found the portable air-con in one of those compartment not at the same level, but one level below our house. Someone had purposely carried the air-con down one stairs and placed it there.<br><br>When confronted, they said something like that happened for the first time and they had no idea...So guys, this article is for you to be more alert to their tricks and ways. We do not have concrete evidence like a video, but based on the evidence presented, I would say 99.5% it is their doing.</p></div>
