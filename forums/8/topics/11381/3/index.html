Well, i hope this discussion about National Service will not be biased due to your SAF background but from your personal point of view for the benefit of all singaporean.<br><br>National Service for Girls, i reckoned you both might be supporting it. But you have to convince the lots about its validity before conscipting everyone to serve.<br><br>Why need to conscipt since you think most will think positively towards NS. Why not make it voluntary? Same apply for NS for guys. How would you think in the future, if the government force and lengthen NS period for guys, increase reservist life cycle when our male population is dwindling? How would your next generation think and react?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 02 April 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lets get back to the original issue here: NS for females.<br><br>The vocation offered is only nursing in government hospitals. I don't see the relevence of them serving the equivalent physical exploitation of what guys do in their NS. So lets not compare this on this stand.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The idea is to instil national defence into them, showing them what they can do to help their country, no matter how minor it is. So lets approach the topic from this point of view.<br><br>They would still be subjected to NS military laws like extras and AWOL, but other than that, I don't really see anything too bad about the whole idea. So lets not drag these ladies into the combat vocations and make comparisions.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
