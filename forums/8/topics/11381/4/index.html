Would you need to place your ballot for a HDB flat in the same box as dozens of Singapore PRs when you make housing application in the near future?<br></div></blockquote>Well, as of now my position is secure cos after being recognised and having valuable skill set, i am promoted. However, i have to admit that foreigner worker are cheaper to be employed in any local company. Most of my colleagues are foreigner. Singaporean workers are more expensive and demanding, CPF contribution are higher etc. Furthermore, Singaporean male workers have to be disrupted from their urgent work to report back for NS, recall manning, ICT training etc.A great disadvantage compared to the foreigner workers. If i'm the boss, naturally i will employ PR and foreigner workers in preference.<br><br>As for HDB ballot, yup it's different boxes. However, PR still enjoy almost the same benefit as a Singaporean citizen. there's not much advantage of a singaporean citizen over a PR. What finally end up is the higher and higher HDB flat pricing and standard of living.<br><br>Ask every of the PR colleagues or friends that i know, none will want convert from their PR status to citizenship. Tok about 2nd generation son had to go thru NS, they would rather go back to homeland to give birth to a son instead of here and then apply PR to come over to singapore. Singapore is just a gold mine to them. It's true. Some people might still doubt all the article on the net that downgrade singapore's situation.
