It's to top up the shortages of nurses in singapore.<br><br>They are saying like NS for 1 to 1.5 years for the girls.<br><br>So dun worry cause they'll not get tan, smelly and vulgar like us army goon durs.<br><br>Personally I think it's a good idea, I might be wrong but I always get the impression that girls had less confidence and "heart" for our country cause they neber serve NS.......or maybe it's just that they got no interest in politics and stuff.  :p<br><br>Hey, if it's implemented, we'll see beautiful nurse instead of those sulking foreigner "aunties" rite? Speedy recovery and boost in moral.<br><br>PS: Don't think medic not siong, the field medic must be the bravest man in the field to face and tend to gory injuries in battle. They must be fighting fit too. Few girls(even guys) can live up to that.<br></div>

Internet is a start as i reckoned from so many website that expose the ugly side of singapore. We don't get all these information and view from the controlled media. Who is going to back you up? no one knows thru singapore's media but only thru internet which the government have limited control. And hopefully, like what you had said. It wouldn't be too long although we are still having so many singaporean living in their dreams.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>pls recommend those websites which expose the ugly side of Sinagpore, I would like to visit them.<br><br>As quoted from 22 Sept 2000 "Asia Week", SM Lee KY said that the government is taking into consideration NS for S'porean girls. He said that if it is to be implemented, it is NOT for the defence of S'pore, but to discipline a spolit young generation. Because he mentioned that now-a-days S'pore teenage girls are too spolit, and enlisting them into NS will more or less make them more disciplined, just like the NS boys.<br></div>

So many example of such case, why? the government is too smart, i can tell you. Can't stand the heat and hence escape? moose's mentality, isn't it? escape to where? migration out of the kitchen again?<br><br>I'm not a leader but at least i learned what's my right and not just accept the heat in the kitchen. As least we can urge everyone in the kitchen to wake up, be aware and take some initiative to help put out the fire in the kitchen. One or a few person are not enuff to put out a big fire in the kitchen. Escaping from the kitchen is only a selfish move that further enhance moosey's mentality. Yes you might escape but you might not be able to get back into the kitchen once you are out. Furthermore, not everyone can escape. you need lots of strength and resource to do that. Once you are out, so what? most will run for their life while some look helplessly at the big kitchen fire.</div>
