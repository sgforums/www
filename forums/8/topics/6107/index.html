            <div class='col-md body'>GTR: There are lots of MBA degrees out there. I suggest you do some research on waht you really wanna do. Anyway, anyone can study anything even he/she have a degree in something else.... it's a matter of self-fulfilment in life. That means you can have a degree in Creative Arts, then you decide to do another degree in Engineering.. go ahead lor... unfortunately local S'pore Unis too "tau" to accept students who wanna do second degree. yea... to hell with the world-class university attitude! bladdy inflexible... no wonder the NTU/NUS finance profs not so happy that engineering grads wanna come into their field, coz the profs themselves are too narrow-minded and they think engineering students cannot do it. C'mon ANYONE can do it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that NUS BizAd faculty's postgrad sch offers Masters in Financial Engineering among other MBA programmes. I'm not too sure abt the admission criteria as I'm still an undergrad there only. You can check out NUS's webpage to find out more details or email the relevant authorities. Otherwise can make a trip down to the Centre to find out more personally.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanx all...<br>btw theres a diff between an MBA and a Masters in Finance and that is MBAs need relevent working experience so if i decide to do the masters right after graduation, MBAs are out<br><br>the NUS Financial Engin as wat i hear is more of computer engin than real institutional finance, anyway given the chance, i want to go overseas for an education rather then continuing to learn how to study here....get what i mean?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the best thing for u to do would be to actually go work in a bank or financial institution first before going for further studies. A significant number of mech eng grads find jobs in such places. 1) You get better exposure in related fields and will therefore be better prepared to do well and benefit most from your postgrad investment. 2) At the same time, you have the option of doing MBA, which might be a better choice. 3) Also, you will be in a better financial situation then.<br><br>Actually Columbia offers MBAs to people without working experience but this only applies to those with impressive results. They typically take in only a handful of such MBA students per year. As for Financial Engineering in local uni, it sounds like a pretty good course from what I have gathered. Should be able to add good value.<br><br>Considering the fact that you do not have grades to shout about, it would be to your advantage to work first. It gives u a chance to improve your record (assuming you get great recommendations and perform well at work). This will increase your chances of being accepted to more reputable unis. What is the point of spending so much money going abroad only to study at a lousy uni? You make a better investment by enrolling in insead, wharton or kelloggs etc anytime. reconsider ur plans pal</div>
