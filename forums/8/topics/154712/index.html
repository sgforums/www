            <div class='col-md body'>My goodness!<br><br>Today at work, one of my female collegues at my workplace(from a different department, different floor), strolled down to my office floor to submit some clearance form.<br><br>She is around 22 years old, 1.67m 47kg. Very hot looking. Ahlian brown long hair (obviously rebonded) brown large eyes and a hot body to boot. She was dressed in this totally white short skirt linen dress; almost translucent. Everone in the room could see that she was obviously wearing a hot matching set  of lacy bra and thong set!<br><br>She normally likes to dress very sexily, most of the guys in my office have the hots for her and we, including the girls(like me), are always commenting on her body and her daring dressing sense (or lack of it). She normally wears tight low cut tops with a miniskirt or open flare mini aline. But today, I think she was really really trying very hard to get attention. I'm sure she succeeded!<br>I'm sure some male body part would be at attention!<br><br>One of my guy colleagues cheekily went up to her and asked her, "Thats some hot underwear(thong and bra) you got there. Do you wear that all the time?" You could hear giggles around the office when he approached her and asked her. I guess it bothers on sexual harressment and off the record, I'm totally against office sexual harressment. But the reply was even more jaw dropping! She replied,"Not really, I don't always wear underwear."<br><br>I could have sworn i heard at least 10 jaws hitting hard against the office floor!<br><br>oh well... I guess everyone has different taste in underwear (or non-underwear)!</div>

She dressed so inappropriately and revealed so much flesh the men stood around to look at her fully exposed assets. My bf made the comment that she's already a mother of 2 and still cannot behave and choose appropriate clothes. I said to him that she's only in her mid 20s .. and now moms in their 40-50s are exposing flesh... much less her.<br><br>I am conservative...  so no such things and if its "see thru" ... its usually unintentional ..<br></div>

The thing is especially on buses and these people who did not wear bras .. they would stick their sagging bags in my face thinking I am a girl and is not interested.. So I had my views. Not interested does not mean I want RA show all the time.<br>Actually there's nothing sweet about these looks. These women know they are titilating and enticing - it gives them a sense of power over the men.<br><br>Luckily my Bf don't like shopping but then we don't really go out...<br></div>
