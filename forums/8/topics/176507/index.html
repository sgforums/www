            <div class='col-md body'><br>Some people will tell you dinosaurs and related animals died out billions of years ago. These people are wrong and are ignoring the facts. Dinosaurs lived alongside of man since the beginning of this world. And they still do. Scientists make up lies a lot. These lies are sometimes proved wrong in amazing ways. The one way that comes to mind is the case of the living coelacanths. Scientists said that a certain specie of fish, the coelacanth, was extinct, and had been for billions of years. Then some fishermen caught a coelacanth off the coast of Madagascar. The coelacanth was unchanged from the fossils of it's ancestors. No changes ! Even over those billions of years, before man's "ancestors" the rodents came into existence. Wow, that's pretty hard to swallow. Now, if these scientists were wrong about the coelacanth who is to say that they aren't wrong about the dinosaurs? But, who has seen a dinosaur in this day in age? Lots of people. Below are some of the animals found in Africa that are generally thought to be dinosaurs.<br><br>Mokele-Mbembe<br>Kongamato<br>Incayumba<br>Mbielu-Mbielu-Mbielu<br><br>The most dramatic prospect must surely be the existence of living species of dinosaur,and the enigmatic animal currently attaracting most ettention with regard to this possibility has already inspired several recent scientific expeditions to the immense Likouala swamplands in the People's Republic of the Congo (formerly the French Congo), where it reputedly dwells.It is known to the pygmies and to western settlers there as the mokele-mbembe.<br>Eyewitnesses describe it as very large aquatic beast,approximately 9meters(30 feet) in total lenght and reddish-brown in color,with a burly elephant-sized body,relatively short,thick legs,a lenghty tail,a slender elongated neck terminating in a small head,and very characteristic three -toed foootprints.This discreption is irresistibly reminiscent of a sauropod dinosaur,like the famous Apatosaurus (previously called Brontosaurus) and Diplodocus.Indeed,when scientists have shown illustrated animal book to native observe of the mokele-mbembe,who have no palaeontological knowledge, they have unhesitatingly selected (and without ant prompting) picture of sauropods as the closest portrayals of this mystery beast<br></div>

This is called a Zeuglodon or a Basilosaurus. That might be what was seen in Newport, Arkansas in the White River. The White River is huge. I have been over it hundreds of times. My wife’s parents live right near there. And I preach in that area a lot.<br>This photograph was taken in 1972 of what came to be known as the White River Monster. From Arkansas. Not the White Water Monster—she’s in Washington—the White River Monster. Many folks claim they saw it. Now it hasn’t been seen since 1972, so apparently the creature died or moved on someplace else. But they said in 1972 there was a big flood and a lot of the river filled in. It used to be 100 feet deep. Now it is only 50 feet deep. So apparently it likes deeper water or something. I don’t know. But you can see the body to the right and a bunch of bumps down its back going off in a straight line to the left there. The Arkansas Senate passed a resolution in 1973. It is unlawful to "molest, kill, trample, or harm the White River Monster."</div>

Some big dinosaur-like creature in the river. I thought it was a bunch of bologna. I was home on R and R, I was in Saigon and I was on a Ferris wheel. He said I happened to be at the top of the Ferris wheel while they were loading someone into the bottom chairs. I looked out over the river and I saw this creature with its head sticking up out of the water like a snake. But the head was five or six feet out of the water. Swimming along like a periscope on a submarine. You are right. There are creatures like this still alive!"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Tracks of the MokÃ¨lÃ©-mbÃ¨mbÃ©<br><br><img src="http://www.damninteresting.com/wp-content/mokele_piede.jpg"><br>The people around the Congo River Basin have a long oral history of their people and their lands. Among and intertwined with those stories are tales of a gigantic beast that lives in the swamps and rivers of the Congo. Generally it's a harmless beast, uninterested in eating people, and sticking to a type of liana that grows along the river. That isn't to say that it isn't dangerous; the tales say that the MokÃ¨lÃ©-mbÃ¨mbÃ© will attack and sometimes kill people and hippos. Strangely, this area of the lowlands has an unusually low hippo population.<br><img src="http://www.damninteresting.com/wp-content/mokele_mbeme.jpg"><br>So the question arises: what exactly is the MokÃ¨lÃ©-mbÃ¨mbÃ©? Simplest answer is that it is the Sasquatch of Africa. The name even means "one who stops the flow of rivers". There are crypozoologists in the world who would say that it/they are real living dinosaurs of the sauropod family still roaming the earth.<br><br>They are described as being bigger than a forest elephant with a long neck, a small snake-like or lizard-like head, which was decorated with a comb-like frill. They have a long, flexible tail, reddish-brown skin and four stubby, but powerful legs with clawed toes.<br><br>Not unlike Nessy of Lock Ness fame, MokÃ¨lÃ©-mbÃ¨mbÃ© just aren't photogenic. There are some pictures that claim to have captured the image of such a creature, but as a rule they are too distant, too blurry, or too dark. Such obstacles are no deterrent to the determined. Expeditions to find the MokÃ¨lÃ©-mbÃ¨mbÃ© have come home with photos of footprints and super-sized trails through the flora.<br><br>There is a long history of people encountering the MokÃ¨lÃ©-mbÃ¨mbÃ©, including:<br>1776 - French priest AbbÃ© Lievain Bonaventure Proyart described the natural history of the Congo Basin of Africa. He wrote about a creature "which was not seen but which must have been monstrous: the marks of the claws were noted on the ground, and these formed a print about three feet in circumference."<br>Photo of MokÃ¨lÃ©-mbÃ¨mbÃ© in the distance.<br>1909 - Naturalist Carl Hagenbeck recounted how two separate individuals: a German named Hans Schomburgh and an English hunter, told him about a "huge monster, half elephant, half dragon," which lived in the Congo swamps.<br>1980 - An expedition mounted by engineer Herman Regusters and his wife Kia managed to make its way to Lake Tele, where they heard the growls and roars of an unknown creature. They also claimed to have photographed MokÃ¨lÃ©-mbÃ¨mbÃ© in the lake, as well as watching it walk on land through the brush. According to Regusters, the creature they saw was 30-35 feet long.<br>1983 - A Congolese expedition led by Marcellin Agnagna, a zoologist from the Brazzaville Zoo, arrived to Lake Tele. Agnagna claimed to have seen the beast some 275 meters out in the lake. The animal held its thin, reddish head - which had crocodile-looking, oval eyes and a thin nose - on a height of 90 cm and looked from side to side, almost as if it was watching him. According to Agnagna, the animal was a reptile, though not a crocodile, nor a python or a freshwater turtle.<br>1987 - A piece of blurry video footage filmed by a Japanese film crew supposedly showing the creature in Lake Tele remains disputable evidence of the animal's existence. The film is indistinct and grainy, possibly just showing two men in a boat with one of them standing upright in the front of the vessel, as is common in Africa. This has been interpreted as a head and neck, but this interpretation of the videotape is purely speculative at best.<br>2000 - Cameroon, Boumba River, Two Congolese security guards spotted a MokÃ¨lÃ©-mbÃ¨mbÃ© in the water.<br><br>Though there is no conclusive evidence that the MokÃ¨lÃ©-mbÃ¨mbÃ© are loitering in the lakes and swamps of the Congo, there are enough hints to make one wonder. Personally, I think it would be keen if such a monster were still out there. Improbable as it is that a beast of such dimension could elude being caught on film for so long, it isn't impossible. New species are still being cataloged in Africa—and other parts of the world—though none quite so big.</div>

Slightly larger than a common house cat, with burly legs and a long tail, it appears to be a carnivore that not even the locals have a name for. The first pictures of the beast were taken in 2003, but not released pending further investigation. Those pictures are being released by the WWF to, most likely, confound local government's plan to level the rainforest and erect a palm oil plantation. They haven't yet captured a specimen of the critter.<br><br>The last time a new mammal was discovered in Borneo it was 1895.<br><br>With new varmints like this roving around unbeknownst to us, does it make anyone wonder if there's still room for Yeti, Sasquatch, or Nessy?</div>

Big foot has been discovered in Malaysia, so nothing is impossible. </div></blockquote>Malaysian government organises Bigfoot hunt<br>Friday, 27 January, 2006<br><br>The government of the Malaysian state of Johor says it is to organise an attempt to track down a legendary ape man reputed to roam its jungles. After a spate of sightings, Johor's chief minister says he will launch an official search for the beast, dubbed Malaysia's Big Foot by local media. Malaysians have a long-standing love affair with anything big. The obsessions resulted in record-breaking buildings, bridges, even piles of food. Now they have gone crazy for Big Foot, known in local legend as Hantu Jarang Gigi - ghosts with widely spaced teeth. The country has been gripped since November when three fishery workers claimed to have seen a Big Foot family that left footprints up to 45cm long. Conservationists say that damage to branches suggested that the creatures could have been up to 3m tall. There were similar sightings by members of the local indigenous minority who said they had seen a 'King Kong' covered in black fur.<br><br>Now, the chief minister of Johor, Abdul Ghani Othman, says a proper scientific expedition will track Big Foot's big foot-prints. He is setting up two teams, one of which will scour likely locations, including the densely forested Endau Rompin National Park. Mr Abdul Ghani says Malaysia is the first country in the world to openly welcome such an attempt. However, he says it is important that the expedition should not harm or frighten the creatures.</div>

Fishermen looking for worms for bait near Pulau Carey spotted the rotting carcass embedded in mud over a week ago, but parts of the remains were only taken to the village two days ago.Arbain Salleh, who recovered the remains, said it was not an animal he had ever seen before."I’ve been fishing in these waters for more than 20 years but I never came across an animal like this," he said.The 45-year-old fisherman said the animal could have been up to seven metres long, although he only managed to bring back bones measuring up to 1.5m."The rest is still rotting in the mud, but I will bring it up gradually, so that it can be identified," he said.<br><br>Arbain said there was speculation among the villagers that the remains were of a saltwater crocodile, but a pawang (medicine man) who specialised in catching crocodiles had discounted that possibility. A fisheries officer in Port Klang was called in by villagers, but could not identify the animal."It’s like nothing I’ve seen before, but these are partial remains so I don’t want to speculate," he said.The officer said an expert from the Fisheries Research Institute in Terengganu would have a look at the remains, and DNA samples would be taken to determine what it was.</div>
