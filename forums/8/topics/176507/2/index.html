            <div class='col-md body'><strong><blockquote>Originally posted by Entertainment_News:<br><br>Some people will tell you dinosaurs and related animals died out billions of years ago. These people are wrong and are ignoring the facts. Dinosaurs lived alongside of man since the beginning of this world. And they still do. Scientists make up lies a lot. These lies are sometimes proved wrong in amazing ways. The one way that comes to mind is the case of the living coelacanths. Scientists said that a certain specie of fish, the coelacanth, was extinct, and had been for billions of years. Then some fishermen caught a coelacanth off the coast of Madagascar. The coelacanth was unchanged from the fossils of it's ancestors. No changes ! Even over those billions of years, before man's "ancestors" the rodents came into existence. Wow, that's pretty hard to swallow. Now, if these scientists were wrong about the coelacanth who is to say that they aren't wrong about the dinosaurs? But, who has seen a dinosaur in this day in age? Lots of people. Below are some of the animals found in Africa that are generally thought to be dinosaurs.<br><br>Mokele-Mbembe<br>Kongamato<br>Incayumba<br>Mbielu-Mbielu-Mbielu<br><br>The most dramatic prospect must surely be the existence of living species of dinosaur,and the enigmatic animal currently attaracting most ettention with regard to this possibility has already inspired several recent scientific expeditions to the immense Likouala swamplands in the People's Republic of the Congo (formerly the French Congo), where it reputedly dwells.It is known to the pygmies and to western settlers there as the mokele-mbembe.<br>Eyewitnesses describe it as very large aquatic beast,approximately 9meters(30 feet) in total lenght and reddish-brown in color,with a burly elephant-sized body,relatively short,thick legs,a lenghty tail,a slender elongated neck terminating in a small head,and very characteristic three -toed foootprints.This discreption is irresistibly reminiscent of a sauropod dinosaur,like the famous Apatosaurus (previously called Brontosaurus) and Diplodocus.Indeed,when scientists have shown illustrated animal book to native observe of the mokele-mbembe,who have no palaeontological knowledge, they have unhesitatingly selected (and without ant prompting) picture of sauropods as the closest portrayals of this mystery beast<br></blockquote></strong><br><br>izzit??</div>

For a while it was just lurking in the woods watching the Wroe family until the Wroes started watching it.<br><br>Video<br><br>What Is The Creature?<br>Can You Identify The Mystery Creature?<br><br>Jay Wroe: "My truck was parked here, started getting in my truck. I kind of saw it there where the sunlight is and said what in the world is that?"<br><br>Jacob Wroe: "It looked so weird to me. I didn't know what it was."<br><br>Wanting to get a better look at the beast stalking his family, Jay Wroe put technology to work for him.<br><br>Jay Wroe: "The next day, I hooked up just portable motion detectors, and put them down back in the woods there."<br><br>The trap worked.<br><br>Jay Wroe: "Very bizarre. I went and got my father and cousin and they came and looked at it and their reactions were pretty much the same -- what in the world are we looking at?"<br><br>Pictures Of The Unusual Creature In Baltimore Co.<br><br>More than a month after the first sighting, the creature has become a neighborhood regular and showing up often.<br><br>Kim Carlsen: "It comes to our house. It's been up in the woods for a while and it comes up through the bottom of our yard and eats our cat food."<br><br>Despite the fact it's lurking in these woods and no one knows when or where it will come out, no one here seems afraid of it.<br><br>Jacob Wroe: "I don't know, it doesn't look like it's going to harm anybody."<br><br>Even the other neighborhood animals like Bullwinkle the dog next door seem okay with the beast.<br><br>Kim Carlsen: "It's not afraid of the cats and the cats seem to get along with it fine."<br><br>The beast is not shy, and visits most often under bright sun. While no one here knows what it is, they do have a name for it -- the hyote, a combination of a hyena and a coyote.<br><br>Stay with TheWBALChannel.com and 11 News for the latest news updates.</div>

For a while it was just lurking in the woods watching the Wroe family until the Wroes started watching it.<br><br>Video<br><br>What Is The Creature?<br>Can You Identify The Mystery Creature?<br><br>Jay Wroe: "My truck was parked here, started getting in my truck. I kind of saw it there where the sunlight is and said what in the world is that?"<br><br>Jacob Wroe: "It looked so weird to me. I didn't know what it was."<br><br>Wanting to get a better look at the beast stalking his family, Jay Wroe put technology to work for him.<br><br>Jay Wroe: "The next day, I hooked up just portable motion detectors, and put them down back in the woods there."<br><br>The trap worked.<br><br>Jay Wroe: "Very bizarre. I went and got my father and cousin and they came and looked at it and their reactions were pretty much the same -- what in the world are we looking at?"<br><br>Pictures Of The Unusual Creature In Baltimore Co.<br><br>More than a month after the first sighting, the creature has become a neighborhood regular and showing up often.<br><br>Kim Carlsen: "It comes to our house. It's been up in the woods for a while and it comes up through the bottom of our yard and eats our cat food."<br><br>Despite the fact it's lurking in these woods and no one knows when or where it will come out, no one here seems afraid of it.<br><br>Jacob Wroe: "I don't know, it doesn't look like it's going to harm anybody."<br><br>Even the other neighborhood animals like Bullwinkle the dog next door seem okay with the beast.<br><br>Kim Carlsen: "It's not afraid of the cats and the cats seem to get along with it fine."<br><br>The beast is not shy, and visits most often under bright sun. While no one here knows what it is, they do have a name for it -- the hyote, a combination of a hyena and a coyote.<br><br>Stay with TheWBALChannel.com and 11 News for the latest news updates.</div></blockquote></div>
