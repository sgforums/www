              <p>Thanks for the many replies.. <span>FYI I</span>’m 21
                      this year. I graduated from <span>PSB</span> Academy with
                      a Diploma in Business Management. Curtin exempted me from 5 units
                      which is a total of 125 credits. Im a 3SG in artillery so i guess
                      its irrelevant if i were to tell them when i apply..</p>
              <p>I wanted to apply for Curtin Singapore at the first place but i
                      withdrawed cos I saw the school and its so damn small.. If I’m not
                      wrong on the degree they will state whether u took the program from
                      the sg campus or from Perth..</p>
              <p>thanks for the help everyone <img title="Smile" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"></p>

              <p>I wan 2 say this, that Curtin Singapore is not good for people like u because u are still unemployed.</p>
              <p>It is more for those who are already in a field of work and taking part time.</p>
              <p>I would not recommend it . For u i suggest u enrol in a bonafide true blue on campus university.</p>
              <p>After u graduate, things work differently  in the OZ labour market and in SG. Sg employers are known to be lacking in knowledge and critical thinking. They are fast to discredit your degree.</p>
              <p>And to make matters worst if u take a Distance learning like Curtin, that is the chopping board for them</p>

              <p>cos back in UTAS, when i said i had expereinced in military, i
              had special attention from some girls both asian and ang moh.
              Finally one proposed sex to me and she invited me to her home one
              evening. I went but rejected her advances cos i though about my gf
              back in singapore when she put her hand and tried to kiss me.</p>
              <p>Problem is girls are creatures of imaginatory stimulation

              <p>What i do know is if u studied in Australia on campus, u can find employment  opportunities there and elsewhere in the world mainly commonwealth countries.</p>
              <p>I think those offered in singapore are generic courses when u look at the syllabus, it sounds generic to me. More for people who have some working expereince and want to complement it with higher knowledge.</p>
              <p>PSD may say that they recognise certs from Uni A/B/C/D but when it comes down to ministries level, different ministries have different standards. They do not need to conform to PSD standards.<br><br>Anyway when u apply jobs in Civil Service, there will usually be a box where you'll have to put a tick whether it was done on-campus or distance-learning, and also if its local uni or overseas uni, part-time or full-time.</p>
              <p>The thing they dont offer some courses locally  is because of quality control issues.</p>

              <p>Large, traditional campuses may offer more internships and work opportunities connected to the college or university. <br><br>Fields needing physical resources are typically best suited for campus-based education. Degrees in hard sciences, engineering and healthcare, for example, include labs and other hands-on activities<br><br>A recent survey in 2008 of 270 small and medium-sized companies seeking managers or entry-level employees in accounting, engineering, business, and information technology found that a majority preferred on-campus degrees.</p>
              <p>There is also an advantage of going overseas, u will not have to worry about reservist distracting u from your studying. many people find this a huge hindrance and their valuable time being taken away attending IPPT and RT sessions. Some even failed their courses because they worried too much about IPPT&gt; This time can be be used meaningfully in doing revision for your studies.</p>

              <p>yes there is almost all the time a chance for u to major on campus.</p>
              <p>I dont know about Curtin Business school but Monash is pretty good and respected.</p>
              <p>Like i said if u are an OZ citizen, it does not really matter but if u are returning singaporean, these factors matter. U dont want to end up at the chopping board.</p>
              <p>I would just suggest G08 Unis and take watever course u want if yr intention is to get a degree</p>
              <p>If u are really passionate about yr degree , then u still have to choose G08 and get into the course u want in whichever G08 wants to take u.</p>

              <p>A genral degree is not a bad thing, some say that in times of economic downturn, a general degree offers u chances to switch to subfields and gain progress from there.</p>
              <p>Sometimes employers want that ‘360 degree person’ who will look at a problem from every angle.</p>
              <p>And besides a believe a business degree is much better than a engineering degree as it will allow u to work in management positions. just imagine that a engineering degree holder and a business degree holder apply for a management position, who will be more likely to get a job?</p>
              <p>Engineering is a trade degree, business is a broad degree. The trend now in singapore i think is to go broad.</p>
