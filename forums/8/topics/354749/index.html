              Im currently serving NS and gonna ORD this august. I recently got accepted into Curtin University of technology in Perth for its Bachelor of Commerce (International Business) but I'm not sure to accept it or not as I dont really know if Curtin U is good? Can anybody advise about this school?
              
              I applied for it online as Curtin is easier to get in.. Im trying to apply for other ozzy Us which are in the group of 8 like UWA, Univ of Melbourne n Univ of Queensland at the same time. Studying abroad is fresh n exciting, but deep inside I kinda prefer sg..

              <p><br>It depends on what is the main factor causing you to come up with that "fresh n exciting" comment.</p>
              <p>If that factor is girls, then I can understand cos NS guys are an un-usually horny lot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Despite all that, you should stay in sg cos that's what is REALLY what you want deep down inside right? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>You should do your homework before applying... Now to ask for advise is lots of craps.... Anyway, you watch too many movies. To be fun and exciting would depends on the person himself... whether you are in that group or not.</p>

              <p>Let me contribute to TS</p>
              <p>Hell there, Curtin is not in G08 and i think there is curtin in Singapore too. As far as i know, please dont take in a Uni which is found in Singapore in distance learning campus like Curtin, RMIT ect ect</p>
              <p>When u graduate, people auto think u are from Distance learning.</p>
              <p>TS, this course is pretty common in other univs including G08. I think a few offer this are Monash, Melb Univ and Deakin .</p>
              <p>Why dont u want to take in the G08?</p>
              <p>Did u get any exemptions for it? I would not suggest taking it in Curtin unless they gave u a lot of exemptions.</p>
              <p>Another thing is :</p>
              <p>1) Do not listen to education agents advice</p>
              <p>2) to play safe, just go to where most s'poreans are heading e.g. Monash , melb Uni</p>
              <p>3) if possible try to enrol in G08</p>
              <p>4) Some Tier 2 unis are also good, outside the G08 lik Deakin, Swineburn,  ect</p>
              <p>5) There are other factors like liveability. If u know how to drive a car, u can go anywhere, if u dont just choose a place which has transportation that is developed eg Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide.</p>

              yea i cant get into a local U thats why im applying for an overseas one.. Im thinking of SIM and PSB Academy also. 
              
              I came up with the term 'fresh and exciting' cos studying overseas is a different experience.. the environment and lifestyle etc. and some people do not get the priviledge to go overseas to study cos of financial factors..

              <p>It is indeed fresh and exciting. Singapore unis and polys will bore u to death. The reason why Overseas uni is more interesting to study is cos of the way they conduct the lectures, Ang Moh is good in engaging his audience with many examples, theories ect compared to singapore lecturers who regurgigate eveyrthing on the OHP transparency. In the process, u will gain relevance to real world examples which makes it more enriching.</p>
              <p>The type of learning found there is free and democratic.</p>

              <p>Thats a question, but if he has work expereince of few years in that field, i dont think it matters.</p>
              <p>And also take note in some degrees, the 1st year is diploma and the degree just starts in the 2nd year.</p>
              <p>Since our polytechnics aready taught us diploma, it is pretty safe to skip this stage in that overseas Uni.</p>
              <p>This diploma stage is foundation  found in G08 Unis and is meant for high school leavers ( the equivalent of our local O level or A level holders) and/or those who dont have a solid grounding in the course they wish to take .</p>
              <p>Btw Ts is has not stated whether he is a diploma holder.And his vocation in NS also matters as he can gain relevant exemptions . I knew of someone who studied Nursing in Nanayang polytechnic, became a medic in NS and he got lot of exemptions due to his Poly course and medic work expereince when he took bachelors in Nursing in an Australian uni.</p>
              <p>unless Ts give his full biodata, its hard to give him advice other than generic possibilities.</p>

              <p>watever Unis u try just make sure its is reputed for the course and try to get high grades which will make up for the shortfall in lack of G08 status.</p>
              <p>If u are just studying for the sake of getting a degree , then enrol in G08</p>
              <p>it is better to graduate from a G08 with average grades if u are this sort of person ( i presume are average performers). These sorts of people are likley to enter civil service.</p>

              <p>Yes they are responsible for research, which is why they are awarded G08 status. U may be likely to learn more enriching stuff in this sort of Unis, but doesnt meant the unis outside G08 are lousy, Normally they do share the information with other unis too. The profile of that particular Uni and how it is affiliated to G08 Unis will then need to be analysed. The problem is for TS , this is not practical unless he knows someone who have studied , staying in Australia and probably a lecturer or professor. these are information not available first hand.</p>

              <p>yea i cant get into a local U thats why im applying for an
                  overseas one.. Im thinking of <span>SIM</span> and
              <span>PSB</span> Academy also.</p>
              <p>I came up with the term ‘fresh and exciting’ cos studying
                  overseas is a different experience.. the environment and lifestyle
                  etc. and some people do not get the priviledge to go overseas to
                  study cos of financial factors..</p>

              <p>Overseas is definetly better than SIM or PSB. SIM and PSB is more for people who have work expereince and dont have the flexibility, financial and family  commitments who cant afford to go overseas.</p>
              <p>In your case u are a unemployed person. It is better to take a full load degree overseas if u can afford it</p>
              <p>There a lots of things u will learn overseas as compared to SIM or PSB.</p>
              <p>Just let u know too, peole who havework expereince also do go overseas to take. U can also take In SIM or PSB if u want to.</p>
              <p>But just make sure u have carefully analysed yr decision. A degree is more important than a MBA or PHD.</p>
              <p>make sure u invest in your degree carefully and get the most bang for the buck. MBA is not so important as u can take it anywhere even locally through distance learning.</p>

              <p>I know of fellow graduates like me ( grad of 2001) who were from Monash and Melbourne Uni and other G08 doing well  in the prvate sector. And some of them continued to their MBA in NUS and NTU.</p>
              <p>I was a A level student and cannot get into Local Uni back in 1998. I went to OZ to study in UTAS, a G08 uni. it was pretty cheap during those times around  , not bad for a G08 uni</p>

              <p>i Think TS should put his emotional state behind  (like he prefer SG to OZ) , and make a decision.</p>
              <p>i think i assume he want to return to singapore after graduating , then it is better for him to either take in SIM, PSB or go to G08.</p>
              <p>But i do guarantee TS that when he goes overseas, he will become clearer in mind, and will be much more knowleable and independent  than local grads</p>
              <p>This expereince will stay with him for life forever.</p>

              Thanks for the many replies.. FYI I'm 21 this year. I graduated from PSB Academy with a Diploma in Business Management. Curtin exempted me from 5 units which is a total of 125 credits. Im a 3SG in artillery so i guess its irrelevant if i were to tell them when i apply..
              
              I wanted to apply for Curtin Singapore at the first place but i withdrawed cos I saw the school and its so damn small.. If I'm not wrong on the degree they will state whether u took the program from the sg campus or from Perth..
              
              thanks for the help everyone :)

              <p>cos back in UTAS, when i said i had expereinced in military, i had special attention from some girls both asian and ang moh. Finally one proposed sex to me and she invited me to her home one evening. I went but rejected her advances cos i though about my gf back in singapore when she put her hand and tried to kiss me.</p>
              <p>I think they view their own resident guys as being sissies and soft.</p>
              <p>Problem is girls are creatures of imaginatory stimulation  while boys are creatures of visual stimulation.</p>
              <p>They look at our inner while we look at their outer assets</p>
