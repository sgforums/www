            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">AQUARIUS MAN</span></strong><br><br>Hot-hearted man who likes to do thing his way. He can suddenly decide to do something without thinking of it's outcome. He is the type of guy with an inside energizer, so if u fall in love with this type of guy be "patient", even if u have to follow him a bit. His creative mind could create fantastic idea any time. If u do not understand or cannot follow him, u won't be with him for long. A man in this Zodiac will less likely to have a pale skin, &amp; if he has a scar, it would be on his face or on his head. He moves very fast &amp; very energetic, &amp; he is very self confident in himself. He is not the type who sit down &amp; feel sorry or regret anything for long, especially with "Love". He loves justice. He dares to show his opinion or even argue about certain subject even he knows it might bring him problems. A straight forward type of guy. He hardly lies except if he think it is necessary &amp; he is not a good liar anyway. He will not lie to u about serious matter, but if he lie he will lie only a small little thing. He is gifted with the ability to be a very social person. He could talk even about subject that he has no knowledge of. He interests only at the present time &amp; look at the world positively. Many times he feels hurt because of reality, but he will not run away &amp; he will overcome that difficulty. Even he is a high &amp; self confident type &amp; center his own thought as a main focus, but at the same time he is a kind, cute &amp; polite guy. He certainly is not a mean person. He likes to help people who are in troubles even he is not asked to. He is the type who feels sorry if u remember bad things he said to u that he had already forgotten, but u did not. Believe him that he is very sorry &amp; give him another chance. Once he decides to do something, he will put all his mind &amp; energy in it either in his "Work", or "Love". He is the type who gamble anything in the casino, so do not even take him there. He does not like pessimistic, low energy, &amp; depress person, especially no brain. Strangely he like to overpower this type of people to assure that he is more superior. He like to be the first person to do something. U can see sparkling in his eyes, once he meet a new target or new lover. Once he is in love, he will act as if he never has love like this before. This minute he could be real sugar sweet, &amp; later he could also be an icy cold, but do not blame him for that will only chase him away. He could fall in love again with another girl &amp; act again like he never has this kind of love before. He could really love someone, but not a heart broken type for he thinks love is "excitement" and "Love goes on". If u date this kind of guy, do not or avoid showing your face to him with face pack, face mask, always be presentable, nice &amp; cute. If he is quiet not because he is shy, but he is only quietly thinking. If u have a chance to ask his ex-girlfriend, she will tell u that he's not a shy or quiet type. If he is really &amp; truly in love with u, he will never lie to u at all. How do u know if he loves u, bet on your faith! Love him &amp; treat him steadily &amp; do not try to find anything to argue with him, he will be with u for sure. If u are his lover or girlfriend &amp; need to tell him something, go &amp;say it out loud &amp; straight forward because he hate long boring story. He hate to play games, chasing for love or being chased, so let him call u first. He likes a confident woman who also a good follower. If he gets mad at u, let him be for only a short time he will be normal again. U have to like &amp; be able to get along with his friends, but he does not have to do so with all your friends. Don't ever think u could make him jealous by flirting with other man, he will just leave instead of making a scene because he is a confident man &amp; has to be the first in everything.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">AQUARIUS WOMAN</span></strong><br><br>If u are in love with a woman in this zodiac, be prepared to be very happy or be very sorry. She is a very busy person with her own matters similar to a guy in this zodiac. She is able to live by herself without any guy in her life, a very strong person indeed. Not because she does not have a dream guy, but if she can't find such person, so what. Because she thinks she could do anything that a man can do. She is a leader, a real confident type. She likes to do things by herself, such as serving herself, opening the door herself. Because she thinks waiting for a helping hand is a waste of time, &amp; she is not patient enough to wait around for that. If she starts to ask u out, do not think she starts to flirt with u, but because she thinks it is a waste of time to wait for u to be the one who asked. She likes a COOL guy who sometimes act like he is ignoring her, so he has a chance to show her his own confident. She like to guess her man's reaction, but at the same time she likes to has many men wanting her. She is a daring type who could just do thing differently from other people in her same society. She dare to fight for what she thinks belonged to her. Even she acts confident, she's mostly feel lonely &amp; alone. If she breaks up with someone, she won't show any emotion even deep down inside pain &amp; agony. Not for long she will come back to be the cheery &amp; merry person again, because she looks at the world positively &amp; has "Faith" in the word"Love". She has more men friends than women friends, so do not be a jealous type if u date her. She could be slightly jealous, but she hates jealous guy. She loves "Freedom" so before &amp; after marriage , her freedom has to be the same. She likes u to trust her, even if she does not trust u anyhow. She likes to be the one who is "Right", so if u argue with her, let her win if it is not a big deal for u in that subject. She is a straight forward type, so if she does not love u anymore, she will just tell u straight to your face. Her love &amp; relationship are always real, so if she say "It's over" be prepare to leave, she is not testing u. She is not a vulnerable type, so do not have to worry about her, she will survive by herself. If she is with u when u get sick, she will certainly take care &amp; look after u, even look after u mean "small loan". Do not have secret behind her, she hates it &amp; really can piss her badly. When she is sad, be understanding. When she is happy, be happy with her, she likes that. U will not get bored with this type of girl. Someone who is close to her will know that deep down beneath that confident &amp; cold hearted person, she is just as fragile as any woman. She is a fun &amp; talkative person &amp; she likes to tease u. Do not let she talk alone, if u do she will leave. She has many type of jobs because she believes what a man can do, I can do. If u want her to work for u, forget it. When she is in love, she will just leave her job in the day time just to come to see u, but not for long, she will go back to work seriously again. Prepare to live &amp; love with a "Working Woman" then u will be OK. If she's mad, find a shelter for the "Hurricane" is here! Her bad temper will last very shortly though. She is not a revenge type &amp; will not think of "Pay Back" time. Most people might think of her as "One of a guy", but in fact she is a 100% woman. She is easily hurt, so be nice with her. If she really loves u, then u are lucky because she is an honest, truthful &amp; will never bored u. Understand that sometimes she will be over confident &amp; sometimes like to have power or act bossy.</div>
