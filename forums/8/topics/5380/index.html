            <div class='col-md body'>who say work out in gym bring minimal result??<br>i was like u before... all skinny and crap... only athletic thing i did wa play bball but i wanted to be stronger and bigger... u need to have the proper training program with the right diet. first of all, ur metabolism seems to be frickin fast... dun worry... u ever tried those mass gainers? if u haven't tried then try it.. tehy may be expensive but no one said looking big is cheap... if u have and tehy dun work... eat often... i mean once every 2 hours... dun over eat, just eat 3/4 to 4/5 full... and since u want to gain weight, u can eat anything... if u really want to gain big time weight, go for pasta or shit load of rice during the evening... working out won't make u get bigger cuase u're basically tearing as much as muscle cells as u can. its the recovery phase that u actually grow... meaning the resting, eating part. do not do any cardio exercise for a month. Dun run, dun play ball, just lift and eat... cardio &amp; aerobic exercise is the bane for all people trying to gain weight cuase u're increasing ur metabolism everytime u do cardio stuff.... u should be able to gain 10-20 pounds in 1-2 months depending on how serious u are about it... good luck and if u have any more questions just ask  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heyheyhey, afellow skinny boy. Well uh while ppl haven't called me frail orweak, they have said i'm on the thin and lanky side. Esp when everything I weartendstobe huge.<br><br>I can't gain weight.That's aboutit. Eat so much,spend so much, just doesn't work. So Ifigure it's pointless worrying so much. My dadwasl ikemebut he beefedup nicely in his early 20s so i guess ihave that to look forward to heheh.<br><br>in the mean time,I just exercise and be normal. While u may be skinny, it's always good to be sporty hehehe. Idon't lift weights. I run, sit-ups, pull-ups everyday, stuff I'd doanyway to prepare myself for NS.I feel fine. Yeah maybe I feel inadequate next to some friends but in my opinion,  the important thing is style and how you present yourself. You can be skinny, but I mean if you're all tensed up ppl cantell and you'll look even more awful. Likewise,for fatter ppl, some fat dudes lookreal cool because they know what to do.<br><br>hahha like Sheik Haikal and his dudette Anna-Belle Francis. Lucky bastard! (buthe's still fat and kinda gross)<br><br>So anyway,i talktoo much so to sum it up,i think the word "sey" sums itup. some skinny dudes can be very attractive according to girls coz they possess something beyond the physical. And if you feel self-concious, you won't be able to posess much "sey" eheheh<br><br>So just beyourself.After NS or soemthing skarli youbeef uplikesiaothenall the naysayers can go eat shit and die.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey, look at it this way...the Lians love skinny guys...and always got chio lians everywhere..:-)<br><br>Seriously, do u socialise much?  I know for a fact that many, many local girls prefer the skinny tall type of guy..believ me...almost all my gal friends like them skinny and tall..at first I thot they meant just lean, but rhey really meant *skinny*...:-)<br><br>So don't be too bad about ur size...besides ur tall, and anyway, if u had the money or inclination, u could wear clothes that only look good on guy models...people like me can only dream about wearing like that...1.72 isn't tall so those model clothing always look funny.  take it easy man...I know how u felt..I also used to be very skinny..can wrap my hand around my biceps...eww scary...:-8<br><br>But my meatbolism slowed down drastically, now I have a gut the size of a bridgestone tyre...trust me, u don't want this...no matter how skinny u are.:-)<br><br>Take care...and don't injure urself<br><br>as for Annabelle Francis...She's chio man..and she's really nice..to me anyway, but all the girls always say she's bitchy one...I don't know, but she's always very nice and friendly eh...and she likes nice people ya know...ok most times I ever see her she always with good looking model types...shit!, but she appreciates nice people...and I heard that Shiek is quite a nice guy ya know...but then again, don't go and expect a girl like annabelle to go and fall for u if u look like crap...chances are quite slim..that shiek was just lucky..:-9<br><br>[This message has been edited by firewire (edited 24-11-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thx alot for all the advice and responses! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>yeah cluon i'll try what u say, though i really do eat large lunches and large dinners...<br><br>zippo: b4 i went into ns i thought it would really, really beef me up and thats what all my male relatives told me...however while there's improvement-i no longer look scrawny, just damn skinny...but still far from normal hahah<br><br>and firewire: thx for the consolation, though i still feel that not really the case leh, and i really cant wear "model" clothes either...i'll really feel uncomfortable in those, cos they need a certain build to be worn over...8(</div>
