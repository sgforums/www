But when the opposition party says SM Lee or the Prime Minister as being liar they sure will get jailed and fined till bankrupt. WHy??<br>Because the police and the Judge is also under control of the government! That time Jayaratnam got a lot of proof to sue SM Lee . Jayaratnam himself is a lawyer and he himself knows he will clearly win the case, but still he lose when the Judge sentenced him to fine more than $100, 000.<br><br>Look at Deng Liang HOng, he threatened the government as being a very popular politician , so the government wanted to bring him down therefore spread rumours about him being anti-christian and racist.<br>Next the government added a criminal offence on him and wanted to jail him. But he fled to Malaysia.<br><br>You see the media always interview the PAP and say how good they are but they never or seldom interview the opposition party.<br><br>Now you also see the government never build MRT across potong pasir because they wanted to bring down Chiam See Tong.<br>Because they wanted to get rid of Chiam See Tong they refuse to build MRT and upgrade Potong Pasir, and let the people there suffer. FUCK THEM!<br><br>It is because of people like you that vote the PAP then the government can always do things they like keep taxing and taxing and controlling the newspaper and media, anyhow arrest people they like.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rapture (edited 29 October 2001).]</div>

They would lose their jobs since the government is so capable and having so many spy around.<br><br>You can be dismay to see the overwhelming number of PAP members over the opposition's members which is the main factor why PAP can win every election with overwhelming seats. However, you cannot blame them also cos only by joining the overwhelming team can you secure a position and a high office pay. Who would want to be a fool going against it facing possible law suite, bankrupcy etc. Human nature is at work. Who would care truely about the others afterall. It's maybe the pay and hence the vote they are after. Afterall, you got to pay to be a candidate. Who want their money to be wasted joining opposition party?<br><br>What would happen after the election day, let's wait and see. Higher tax, Higher utilities cost esp water and electricity, Higher transport cost for building more MRT etc? I can bet that once these all go up, it would not go down. Maybe that's how the $17b came from all these invisible stuff or maybe its your hard-earned CPF. There's so many channel from which the government can squeeze out $$$ from the people. Who know and who would care? Anyone not afraid of losing everything and hence face bankrupcy? Only stupid pple like the opposition party will bother. Everyone is being apathetic and hence vote blindly.<br><br>What is this $17b about???Never heard about it. The news, the media never say its our money? Nah who care. Who's this stupid fucker Deng Liang HOng or Francis Seow?? Nah who care? I'm late for my Counterstrike game at Lan shop. Well, these maybe are the apathetic atitude.

How can they not support the government while working as their dogs? They would lose their jobs since the government is so capable and having so many spy around.<br><br>You can be dismay to see the overwhelming number of PAP members over the opposition's members which is the main factor why PAP can win every election with overwhelming seats. However, you cannot blame them also cos only by joining the overwhelming team can you secure a position and a high office pay. Who would want to be a fool going against it facing possible law suite, bankrupcy etc. Human nature is at work. Who would care truely about the others afterall. It's maybe the pay and hence the vote they are after. Afterall, you got to pay to be a candidate. Who want their money to be wasted joining opposition party?<br><br>What would happen after the election day, let's wait and see. Higher tax, Higher utilities cost esp water and electricity, Higher transport cost for building more MRT etc? I can bet that once these all go up, it would not go down. Maybe that's how the $17b came from all these invisible stuff or maybe its your hard-earned CPF. There's so many channel from which the government can squeeze out $$$ from the people. Who know and who would care? Anyone not afraid of losing everything and hence face bankrupcy? Only stupid pple like the opposition party will bother. Everyone is being apathetic and hence vote blindly.<br><br>What is this $17b about???Never heard about it. The news, the media never say its our money? Nah who care. Who's this stupid fucker Deng Liang HOng or Francis Seow?? Nah who care? I'm late for my Counterstrike game at Lan shop. Well, these maybe are the apathetic atitude. Vote for the ruling party and avoid any trouble, men. Hey, i am showing my support for PAP. Don't anyhow spy on me and arrest me with ISA. </div></blockquote>Guys,<br>Look , you got to understand this that the more votes the PAP gets the more they start to tax and do weird stuffs on the people.<br><strong>The best government is one which consist of equally balanced parties - equal number of PAP seats and opposition party seats.</strong><br>The more opposition party, the more they will speak for the people of Singapore in the parliament!!<br>So please vote for the opposition party!!<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rapture (edited 29 October 2001).]</div>

Ask yourself this: Singapore did encounter an economic downfall in 1998 right after the 1997 election which was much worse than the economic crisis now, but why didn't the government done anything good for the people of SIngapore at that time ???<br>in fact that Singapore Share was the money they tax and squeezed from the people of Singapore. To put it straight, it is our money and they are merely returning it to us, yet claiming they are sharing the wealth with us.<br>More importantly this scheme of giving the people the New Singapore Share was brought up by the opposition party!! The government covered up everything so well that they claim it to be their welfare for us!!<br><br>that's why i say singapore youngsters know nuts about politics.<br>please vote for the opposition party to let them speak for your welfare!!!<br><br>Yes it is best for the opposition party to unite in order to fight PAP. I do agree and it's a must if they want to win against the PAPs.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rapture (edited 29 October 2001).]</div>
