This is because Singaporeans do not want to do such jobs but those foreign workers wants. Anyone of you want to be a toilet cleaner, rubbish collector???</div></blockquote>So that's your standard?? looking at job replaced by foreigner only in toilet cleaner, rubbish collector?? Open your eye, little sgboy if you had not grown up. That's why i asked you about your status? working class or just some teen who haven't come out to the real world but care about fun or still sleeping in your dream. Are you independent and living in your own flat under your own name or fully own a car while holding just a regular job in singapore?<br><br>No doubt, these jobs you mentioned are unwanted by the young but it's not true for the old and the retired who just want to earn a living to feed themselves. However, they now faced more competition if they want the jobs badly.<br><br>Wat is to our most immediate concern is what would become of our young generation? Everything in singapore cost like a bomb while so many of our local going unemployed.<br><br>So our little sgboy being allocated any of the New Singapore share? Must be damn happy and satisfied and hence the full support for the rulling party? Save it up boy, maybe you can pay part of your own HDB Housing loan's interest somedays with that.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 29 October 2001).]</div>

So in the other word is don't demand too much and accept what you are given.  Times are different now, so demand for a market rate salary, treatments, etc... will be at no advantage to those graduate without a job.<br><br>The government does not favour the foreign talents as what you think so.  If you want foreigners to invest and open companies which in terms bring in more job opprtunities, of course you have to invite them to Singapore.  If you just want them to invest in Singapore and doesn't allow their pple to hold position in the Singapore set-up company, will they still want to invest in S'pore?  You are now at their mercy for the job and they are not snatching your opportunities away but creating one for you.<br><br>So let me ask you a question, if you will in their shoe, do you want other people to hold a higher position in your set-up company?<br><br>To become more competitive, the government has to do this to attract talents just like US grabbing talents all over the world and monopolise most of the industries markets.<br><br>As for downsizing, this has nothing to do with the foreign talents but to blame it on the economic crisis.<br><br>And to correct you, retrenchment also do apply to the foreigners.
