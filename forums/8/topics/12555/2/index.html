But when the opposition party says SM Lee or the Prime Minister as being liar they sure will get jailed and fined till bankrupt. WHy??<br>Because the police and the Judge is also under control of the government! That time Jayaratnam got a lot of proof to sue SM Lee . Jayaratnam himself is a lawyer and he himself knows he will clearly win the case, but still he lose when the Judge sentenced him to fine more than $100, 000.<br><br>Look at Deng Liang HOng, he threatened the government as being a very popular politician , so the government wanted to bring him down therefore spread rumours about him being anti-christian and racist.<br>Next the government added a criminal offence on him and wanted to jail him. But he fled to Malaysia.<br><br>You see the media always interview the PAP and say how good they are but they never or seldom interview the opposition party.<br><br>Now you also see the government never build MRT across potong pasir because they wanted to bring down Chiam See Tong.<br>Because they wanted to get rid of Chiam See Tong they refuse to build MRT and upgrade Potong Pasir, and let the people there suffer. FUCK THEM!<br><br>It is because of people like you that vote the PAP then the government can always do things they like keep taxing and taxing and controlling the newspaper and media, anyhow arrest people they like.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rapture (edited 29 October 2001).]</div></blockquote>Rapture:<br><br>first of all, unless u're a snake, u cannot be a politician. That's a fact. Secondly, it's pl like u who keep giving others the impression that we live in a prison, unable to make decisions becoz the "govt" controls everything.<br><br>Let me ask u: do u want to change a working formula? if it works, then until it starts to show cracks, i think i'll stick to it thank u very much. The PAP (mind u i'm not a PAP supporter) has done many things but they have not ridiculed themselves in public becoz credibility is the only currency politics deals in.<br><br>i agree that JBJ and tang liang hong should not have been prosecuted becoz of comments made prior to elections. Freedom of speech should apply.<br><br>But in the case of Chee soon Juan...it's pretty clear he hardly the kinda politician i wanna vote for any GRC. Worst still, someone who toks and gestures like a ganster is certainly not someone i would want to be my representative in a GRC. Whether he has an external agenda is not for me to say. But his credibility is dropping each day no tks to his actions.<br><br>Before u claim to know politics, look at the facts. I'm speaking from past history and allegatons that were proven true. Anyone who saw the coverage of Chee vs PM goh  at Jurong would second me. That's hardly a gentleman's conduct. The only person i'm condemning is Chee. Not the opposition as a whole. Low thia Khiang and Chiam See Tong have done excellent jobs and i dun forsee their seats taken by PAP candidates. In fact Low acted as a true gentleman when he shook his rival's hand during walkabt in hougang.<br><br>I never said i agree wif all the govt policies, but i dun see a working alternative from Chee yet. So certainly i'll rule him out of Jurong. And it's pretty obvious that even the non-construction of the MRT line at potong pasir will only strengthen the resolve of residents in potong pasir to support Chiam. The residents will see the ruthlessness of PAP and continue to vote chiam.<br><br>And someone who claims to know politics should also realise that vulgarities dun get u anywhere in threads. More than likely it lowers ur credibility. So keep ur swearing to urself please.<br><br>Oh and btw, if u haven't opened ur eyes and read the papers, PM goh has already clarified the  details concerning the loan to indonesia and it WAS debated in parliment. But of course u might disagree....</div>

That's a fact. Secondly, it's pl like u who keep giving others the impression that we live in a prison, unable to make decisions becoz the "govt" controls everything.<br><br>Let me ask u: do u want to change a working formula? if it works, then until it starts to show cracks, i think i'll stick to it thank u very much. The PAP (mind u i'm not a PAP supporter) has done many things but they have not ridiculed themselves in public becoz credibility is the only currency politics deals in.<br><br>i agree that JBJ and tang liang hong should not have been prosecuted becoz of comments made prior to elections. Freedom of speech should apply.<br><br>But in the case of Chee soon Juan...it's pretty clear he hardly the kinda politician i wanna vote for any GRC. Worst still, someone who toks and gestures like a ganster is certainly not someone i would want to be my representative in a GRC. Whether he has an external agenda is not for me to say. But his credibility is dropping each day no tks to his actions.<br><br>Before u claim to know politics, look at the facts. I'm speaking from past history and allegatons that were proven true. Anyone who saw the coverage of Chee vs PM goh  at Jurong would second me. That's hardly a gentleman's conduct. The only person i'm condemning is Chee. Not the opposition as a whole. Low thia Khiang and Chiam See Tong have done excellent jobs and i dun forsee their seats taken by PAP candidates. In fact Low acted as a true gentleman when he shook his rival's hand during walkabt in hougang.<br><br>I never said i agree wif all the govt policies, but i dun see a working alternative from Chee yet. So certainly i'll rule him out of Jurong. And it's pretty obvious that even the non-construction of the MRT line at potong pasir will only strengthen the resolve of residents in potong pasir to support Chiam. The residents will see the ruthlessness of PAP and continue to vote chiam.<br><br>And someone who claims to know politics should also realise that vulgarities dun get u anywhere in threads. More than likely it lowers ur credibility. So keep ur swearing to urself please.<br><br>Oh and btw, if u haven't opened ur eyes and read the papers, PM goh has already clarified the  details concerning the loan to indonesia and it WAS debated in parliment. But of course u might disagree....</div></blockquote>vulgarities has nothing to do with my knowledge on politics. Dont judge my knowlegde base on my cursings.<br><br>being involved in politics for so many years , I would say Dr Chee would NOT have demanded the answer from Goh Chok Tong if it was already debated in the Parliament. Goh did explain where the amount of money has gone to but he NEVER said it was debated. Show me your proof.  Even if they did say it was already debated before, I think it was only a coverup.<br>Chee is the kind of person who is not afraid of the darkness of the politics. I dont think even you have half His kind of spirit and courage.<br>I would say I myself dont have such a courage too. He is quite a rare person although his approach may be wrong at times<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rapture (edited 29 October 2001).]</div>

Every election has it's can of worms, this is no different.<br><br>If u read ur history, both tang liang hong and JBJ were fined becoz of defamation and calling certain ppl "liars", not becoz of some supposed dirty linen abt the ruling party.
