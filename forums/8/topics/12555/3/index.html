Once u made a statement in public, ppl will start to think. If there is wisdom in the words, then ppl will raise question marks. As long as it is true, ppl will start to question the ruling party. It doesn't matter if ppl call u a liar, if u have the proof (which chee obviously doesn't or he would have publicised it), then the ball's in the other court. People want respectable candidates as MPs, not attention-seekers like chee who in short: all tok no action.</div>
