It does it on its own........when you least suspect it, or even when you don't want it to.<br><br>Have you ever wanted to love someone with everything you had, but that other person was too afraid to let you?<br><br>Too many of us stay walled up because we are too afraid to care too much...for fear that the other person does not care as much, or even at all.<br><br>Have you ever denied your feelings for someone because your fear of rejection was too hard to handle?<br><br>We tell lies when we are afraid... afraid of what we<br>don't know, afraid of what others will think, afraid of what will be found out about us.<br><br>But every time we tell a lie, the thing we fear grows stronger.<br><br>Life is all about risks and it requires you to jump.<br><br>Don't be a person who has to look back and wonder what they would have done, or could have had.<br><br>* What would you do if every time you fell in love you had to say good-bye?<br><br>* What would you do if every time you wanted someone they would never be there?<br><br>* What would you do if your best friend died tomorrow and you never got to tell them how you felt? (even if it is that you don't care anymore)<br><br>* What would you do if you loved someone more than ever and you couldn't have them?<br><br>* What would you do if you never got the chance to say I am friends with all of my family and they know I love them?*<br><br>People live, but people die. I want to tell you that<br>you are a friend.<br><br>If you died tomorrow (God Forbid)<br><br>you would be in my heart.<br>Would I be in yours?<br><br>If you care about me as much as I care about you<br><br>you will send this back<br><br>You might be best friends one year, pretty good friends the next year, don't talk that often the next, and don't want to talk at all the year after that.<br><br>So, I just wanted to say, even if I never talk to you again in my life, you are special to me and you have made a difference in my life,<br><br>I look up to you, respect you, truly cherish you , most of all I CARE about friends<br><br>Send this to all your friends, no matter how often you talk, or how close you are, and send it to the person who sent it to you.<br><br>Let old friends know you haven't forgotten them, and tell new friends you never will.<br><br>Remember, everyone needs a friend someday you might feel like you have NO FRIENDS at all, just remember this post and take comfort in knowing<br>somebody out there cares about you and .. always will..</div>
