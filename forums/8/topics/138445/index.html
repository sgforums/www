Your father here still got 3.5 more weeks of leave in army. After that, I'll be directly out already. ROD, not ORD.<br><br><blockquote>Unlike u i was a high flyer in NS...had both years marksmanship , IPPt silvers plus SOC passes....</blockquote>Yes, yes. So you were....<br><br>1) given the Best Recruit Award 2005(you just entered army a few months ago, right?)<br><br>2) just passed your first range and aced it with Marksmanship and the fcuking badge to pin on your arm, right?<br><br>3) given a notification by your OC that you'll be promoted to Private First Class next week?<br><br>4) nominated for SISPEC, OCS and School of Commandos but you refused them, cos' you think the US Delta Force and the UK Royal Air Service is more suitable for your superhuman physical ability, right?<br><br>5) given a gold in your IPPT and the fcuking badge to pin on your arm as well?<br><br>Pal....I heard in your recent thread that you complain about SG girls, eh? Com'on lah, brothar! In Asia, you cannot find any cuter girls than the girls here. Wake up your idea, leh!<br><br>Also, what's this thing about your Auzzie wife? Don't surf Australian porn sites and fantasize lah. The US ones better. Japanese ones also quite cute.<br><br>I know NS life is tough, but try to learn something from it. Reality is reality; you can migrate to your dream country Australia only if you give up your SG citizenship. On the other hand, Australia must be willing to accept you first, or else you'll be declared an alien in addition to the numerous AWOL charges.<br><br>When that happens, who will defend you in the Kranji Martial Court? No lawyers leh, Brothar! Only 1 SAF Captain or Lieutenant will be your Defending party.<br><br>Go Detention Barracks no curry chicken or Nasi Bryani one loh. U think what, like Tekong ah?<br><br>I advise you, Harris Yulin....try to see the world in a better light and stop complaning. Real men don't do this lah, please. When I say "real men", it means those guys who can impress girls with every thing they do. Got style one.<br><br>For real men, if they're in your case, they :<br><br>1) Kill, kill and kill. Nature of the Beast and animal instinct wah. Get in touch with your true nature loh, please. You got M16 rifle or not? Get the leader first, then the followers. Or you can use bayonet also can. Got play Ninja Gaiden or not? Or maybe use your bare hands to tear and rip loh.<br>Got play SNK's King of Fighters or not?<br><br>2) Stop whining like a cute puppy pup and make the best of things. Angry at SG so what? You know how to angry, I dunno meh? SG already a nice country already. Got some quirks here and there but very nice overall.<br><br>Listen....I was like you once. How old you this year? Just enter NS right? U got out from JC or what? 17 years at the most loh!<br>Last time I also curse and swear at SG's army and govt, but now look.<br>They don't touch me, I buy candy for them.<br>They touch me, I said cool down and treat them to McDonald's. Everybody be friends loh! WHY angry and want to hate for ***K?<br><br>Eh also, Harris Yulin......don't make us SG guys lose face leh!<br>If you complain so much, then your virtual/make-believe Auzzie wife will think that all SG guys like that also leh. Please lah hor, Brothar!<br><br>Also......why you so angry and unhappy all the time? Go Hong Lim Part and voice out your anger lah!<br><br>Scared the police will come if you say the wrong things ah?<br>Then get angry lah! Get angry, angrier and angriest! You will become the Hulk!<br>In the movie, that guy managed to transformed into the Hulk when he gets angry right?<br><br>Com'on lah, don't be shy. U Hulk, I Spiderman loh.<br>We can make movie together and make SG proud what.<br>Spiderman 3 : Hulk's Fury or maybe, Spiderman 3 : Clash of Heroes<br><br>Nice or not, Luzar?</div>
