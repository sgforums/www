              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I would like to hear your opinions on having a carnival for children (7-12) on children's day, they are from a home, able bodied children.</p>
              <p>Perhaps what could be some ideas for the activites during the carnival. I want them to have an enjoyable, yet meaningful children's day!</p>

              <p>i will give low-budget tips with some time and effort spent</p>
              <p>if you already know them beforehand, you can inform them start collecting some drink cans (best to be 2 per kid)</p>
              <p>if you do not know them beforehand, then you collect some drink cans and bring it on that day</p>
              <p>give them some uncooked green beans (you bring about 1 packet is probably enough) and ask them do some crafts. ask them pour into the cans and bring masking tape to seal up the opening.  they can use it to liven up the event as a percussion</p>
              <p>mineral bottles can do the same job, just pour the green beans inside and capped it up</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>regarding the idea of playing piano pieces to ask them sing-a-long, my suggestion is give up.  no matter be it kids, adults, or old folks, i have found out the sound of the piano does not "kick" them.  they will stare in front and become bored</p>
              <p>the best idea is, you have to pre-check the place first, what is the equipments down there. whether they only have a radio with CD-player,  or they have laptop with workable USB or CD-ROM, or computer, and computer should have audio software capable of playing mp3 or wma format (because it's for educational purposes, some of them do not have internet connections or music players installed), whether these are connected to the amplifiers (if any)</p>
              <p>then look for some children's songs (best if you knew what they usually sang at the home), if not, look for very repetitive and easy one, or very popular ones.  then you have to go search for the mp3 and depending on the facilities available at the place of event, you either burn it into an audio-CD, or put your songs into thumbdrive, or bring your own laptop and if you have not recce the place beforehand, wise to bring some small power amplifier with connections and plugs.  the volume has to be loud enough not for the kids to drown the sounds from the music</p>
              <p>then you have to prepare a very simple song book at home using powerpoint is enough. this is like a gift to the kids that they can bring something home.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>also prepare a gift-bag.  inside you can include cheap wrist band, chocolate, a written message on a self-made bookmark.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for the activities, can incorporate dances with funny actions with the song and make them stand up and move around</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>added:</em></p>
              <p>i'm back, and i add on to the above</p>
              <p>recce the place for space for ice-breakers games. suggestion: 4-legged race, straw in mouth pass rubber band, spoon in hand pass ping-pong, musical chair.  reward and prize encouraged.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>depending on your budget and manpower available, can be done but effort:</p>
              <p>set-up different tables as mini-stalls. do your own placard with different colours placards and markers design the "stall" indicating what you selling.  suggestion: source for pre-packed ice-cream in foam box,  samosa,  pre-packed sandwiches</p>
              <p>ask the home permission first to bring outside food.  check with the home if Muslim students, source all food from halal suppliers</p>
              <p>ask the home whether can they sponsor drinks. children need drinks to aid their eating.  if possible, provide hot milo or soya bean milk.  other wise, set-up another imitation stall and "sell" ribena or syrup from bottle</p>
              <p>you and your companions teach the children some simple songs, simple dance, simple cute movements beforehand in the morning. for the children to "buy" their food, they have to do this before they can get the food.  engage them.  and exceptions will create unfairness.</p>
