            <div class='col-md body'>Screw people man. People will never ever be satisfied. I have been in your situation as well during secondary school. I was top English student for sec 5s back then and then during this test, i failed it and everyone was like 'wah he fail we die ' bla bla. Some passed and they told me 'eh your luck no more liao lar'.<br>I just smiled.<br><br>For O levels i scored a B3 which for me is pathetic considering my English.Reason for so was my essay which contained some drug and sexual content which may had led to the poor grade.But well those who had passed THAT test got D7s. My point is that 1 test does not prove anything.<br><br>And wait till you get to higher education.Poly life is tremendously screwed especially if it is group work as you meet all kind of people.I have team mates who complain to the teachers on why i get a grade A and not a B. So save your worries for later.<br><br>And yeah one more thing, people may score well but i don't think that makes them smart people does it? They may not not even know what the fuc* PAP is.So  relax man.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I took triple science when i was in secondary school..I always play a fool in class...i only started revising 1 month before the o levels...I got all As...1 month before the a level was the 7th  time i touched my Biology textbook and 24th time i touched my a-maths book. It's not how hard you study..you must be able to apply it on any situation given to you...It's true that the society reflects how "well" a person is based on grades. Look at it from a objective view, there are people who are poor and the only rule for them to break out of the poverty cycle is to study well and get good results and everyone in Singapore is provided with almost the same education since primary school..If you are rich, probably you'll be able to get tutors for all your subjects but will you still be getting tutors in university?<br><br>Probably, you should wake up your idea as most people call it and reflect on whether you actually understand a subject instead of studying for it.<br><br>Also, fate shows the path of our destination on earth too; if it's yours it will be no matter how you avoid it and if it's not yours , it will never be no matte how much effort you put it in  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

As in, I got distinctions, just from the wrong end. I fell one level or whatever you call it, from Express to NA. The thing is I never stopped believing in myself. I worked hard and never stopped chasing my dream, even when others felt it wasn't possible.<br><br>Now, I'm in uni reading law. If you asked me then if I could see myself being where I am now, I doubt I'd say yes. I'd wish, and I'd pray, but nothing more than that.<br><br>I'm not the only one who flunked once, and during a semi-crucial time, and came back from it. Plenty of others have, and you don't have to worry. As long as you're willing to work hard, you'll get there. </div></blockquote>seh! that sounds sooooo love hina... a keitaro reincarnation..<br>but hey, i think it's true... what u set ur heart on, hell you get it. my chinese sux, but at least i know a proverb from sun zi's art of war, if u have high aspirations, you may not achieve success, but you are closer. if not, you will never be ablle to do anything. IT"S A FREAKING TEST! ONLY!!!! if ur're gonna freak out over a minor case like this, the suicide rates in singapore will never even out this year... anyways, as friends, they may not realise they're hurting you... those remarks are not firectly "aimed" at ur delicate heart, so dont take them too seriously. actually, what matters in these exams is really not other grades, but winning in ur own grades. understand, know that you'll do better. what's the fun in an all A life? competitive society? that's what's fun isnt it? passionate policemen are born by the intensity when they chase down criminals, enthusiatic lawyers when they debate an intense case, so competition is inevitable, just condition yourself for it, and always be ready for the future ^^</div>
