            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone.<br><br>So I got back my Physics test results yesterday and procured a B4. My worst showing ever. In previous tests and examinations, I'd usually fare better, with my grade between A1 and A2. In fact, I've only got an A2 for once. I've always believed that no matter how good you are in studies, results are only a by-product of learning. And that considering that efforts I have put in, at times, I do deserve that good payoff. And as per normal, for this particular test, I prepared for it one week before the test date. Practised and tried to understand certain happenings that Physics required us to know about.<br><br>Then when the results were released yesterday, I was all flabbergasted. Of course there was this kind of how-unlucky-I'm- feeling. My friends who used to perform less better surpass me, obtained A1s. I tried my hardest to fend off this feeling of 'inferiority'. Not that I feel like a jack-ass now, it's all because of the critics. Some friends, who did not even study for the test but scored better, came right up to me and ask,"Why did you under-perform this time round?" That, of course, I could offer no reason. It's definitely not because I didn't revise my work or whatsoever but simply because it might be due to my poor understanding or maybe a more obtuse thinking would be a streak of "bad luck" for this term. I mean, before the test started, I was the one who go around teaching them all the stuff they do not understand and can't even revise my own work properly. Not that i push the blame over to them because i can gain knowledge by teaching others.<br><br>But i really expect them to be more tactful in their remarks. so my whole day was glum and i feel so fucked up. my friends all gave me the "you-poor-thing look when i told them my grade after they inquired about it. One friend even came right up to say "i feel so sorry for you". You know what, these upset me even more because it makes me sound like some stupid fool. and another friend says, "for your standards, this kind of result is kinda lousy".... I feel all so demoralized afterwards. How can you not when people whom you have made sacrifices for simply tell you all this gibberish and nonsensical stuff after they have got a good performances?<br><br>Yea, this society requires us to perform better and better every time. cant we even be given a chance to make a comeback? I think academic results is on top of everyone's mind in this society.</div>

I think academic results is on top of everyone's mind in this society.</div></blockquote>Yo my cute boy, when you go university like what i am now, most Profs will tell u that academic is only a test to know where you are, not an aparatus for comparision ya. Academic will enhance your self actualiszation, not a result for comparision ya. So from here you can judge yourself better. A poor result do not reflect that you are stupid, lousy or simply no good, it is wrong to take that assumption. Stupidity do not exist in a sane world, it is mend for those insanity. Being sane, all of us are not stupid, but a matter of lazy mind.<br><br>So, dun be disheartened, knows where you go wrong, learn from mistakes, stop playing games, stop daydreaming, activate your brainy bits, and there you are, an intellectual boy again. Instead of comparing and get lame, go ask your classmates who performed from bad to good on how they managed to perform so well. Then from here, you set your objectives and goals on what you want to get for the next exam. Try your best ya.<br><br>Sadly in Singapore, especially in govt sector,  takes on certification to judge a person capabilities, but in private organisation, smart and hardwork wins the race. The world richest man is not even a graduate.<br><br>Without mistakes we learn nothing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yep, having good result opens up many doors. So do your best and pray for the best. However, don't think that having good result means that you will be successful in life nor guarantee that you will be happy. Many successful people learn from failure, unlearn what they had thought they had known and relearn new skills. This is being flexible.<br><br>You are wrong to say that the society does not allow one to make a comeback nor academic result is on everyone's mind now. Gotta expand your social circle and have a balanced overall-view outside your academic environment.<br><br>In life, along the way, we will have people who keep pushing you down and some who encourage you. Only you, yourself can pull yourself up and there  reflects true strength and maturity. So don't fret nor be overly-concerned what others think of you, cos what they says does not represent who you are really are nor the reality ( i think u know there, don't you? )<br><br>Personally, i feel those friend who make this remarks are insensitive and immature ( i guess u guys must be quite young and from one of the top schools around ? )</div>
