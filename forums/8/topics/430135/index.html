              <p>Came across this book title while reading up on ex-minister Yeo Chow Tong. Seems that this book got ban because Yeo Chow Tong's wife not happy about some contents.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyone know the story behind it? Why was it banned. Apparently this book is not banned by MDA or any censor board. So it must be some court ruling. Anyone familiar with this case?</p>

              <p>The author was very meticulous in his research. His tactic may look like instigation but surprisingly what he says can be substantiated. The author has another website. Remember Charles Goodyear, the supposedly new CEO of temasek holdings. Disappear totally. Prior to it, the author had discovered some possible fraud <a href="http://johnharding.com/2009/02/08/is-charles-chip-goodyear-iv-an-impostor/">http://johnharding.com/2009/02/08/is-charles-chip-goodyear-iv-an-impostor/</a></p>
              <p>This John Harding guy appears to more a like good guy out to expose the bad guy. IMO.</p>

              There was no www.yeocheowtong.com website or any other website by us when the book was "banned" if that is the correct term. 
              
              There were 25 copies at NLB and it was carried by Singapore bookstores. All of a sudden, Helen Yeo, contacted Kinokuniya in Singapore and threatened to sue if they did not take the book off the shelves - Kinokuniya complied. Next, the copies were removed from NLB, save one "reserve copy" that you would have to sign for to read. 
              
              Helen Yeo was barely mentionioned in the book - only that her firm was involved in the sale of my wife's family house.
              
              I have no idea whether it was MDA that banned the book officially, or that it was Yeo Cheow Tong's influence that did the job. He was not mentioned in the book.
              
              Once the book was banned, I decided to investigate. Eventually, I came upon the reason that Helen Yeo did not want the book in Singapore - she had recorded my wife's family house as being sold BEFORE it was sold. This enabled the owner to flee with the proceeds before paying a divorce settlement to his wife.
              
              At that point, I set up the websites, including the page (linked here) which proved Helen Yeo's guilt. She has never sued me for this nor contested it.
              
              Since, I believe that Philip Jeyaretnam was the lawyer who helped Helen Yeo in her banning of the book - I added him (and his brother) to my list of people who had to be exposed.
