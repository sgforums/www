            <div class='col-md body'>what is it with pride? either national or personal? when the Russian submarine sank over the weekend, offers of help from Britian and USA (if i'm not wrong) were offered to Russia and yet, they dithered on giving assent. just heard over the radio that they've finally given their assent to offers of help from Britian and Norway when the crew are no longer sending Morse code messages from the hull, will help get there in time? i do so pray that it will for the 116 to 118 lives on board and their love ones, it would be a true miracle, will God be merciful? i pray so.<br><br>and another question, the Morse code was phased out a year or two ago due to the presence of computerized equipment and its declining use, yet in light that a power failure will render such equipment totally useless, is it wise that Morse code is utterly phased out and to be forgotten? it did prove its worth in this episode of the Russian submarine.</div>
