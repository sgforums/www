They get angry, the more angry the more you are reasoning, they don't want to hear it, they stay stubborn. Tell you your reasoning is sh...t or childish or whatever.

I am neither your parents nor your teacher. I am just another poster who is tired of people who have nothing to say but give one liner sarcastic remarks to people who are actually trying to make a point and put that stupid smiley there as if they look very clever.
