I am so sick of dumb people just insulting like there is no tomorrow whenever someone says something that contradicts your opinions. If after you have given your <strong>ample and logical</strong> reasons (meaning you make him have nothing valid to say anymore) and that person still acts like an obvious idiot then I leave it to you. But before he stops giving his reasons and before you can counter EVERY ONE of his points effectively and you start hurling abuses at people, then you are the idiot who has no brain to think of anything logical and therefore are a barbarian. Anyway, isn't the point of reprimanding to correct the wrong and make this world a better place? Why make more grudges and unnecessary hatred when you don't even bother to let the person know his "mistake"? Who knows, it might be YOU who is wrong.
