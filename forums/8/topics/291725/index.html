            <div class='col-md body'>anybody watching this show at Channel U every weekday @ 10pm?<br><br>I got such a fetish for these kind of ancient china war dramas where hungry kings fight wars, soldiers die, commanders rebel. All the damn politics involved.<br><br>I have watched xiao zhuang mi shi, han wu da di, qing chao feng yun and long ago the san guo yan yi, and any others to introduce anot? I think from these shows, i can learn quite alot of things, idioms, strategies, wise sayings, and our chinese roots.<br><br>Unlike those crazy what jiu ying zhen jing lah, kui hua bao dian, dugu 9 swords somemore! *faints*....at first it was nice watching heroes fly across mountains and seas but when baddies chases them, they have to run on foot instead, then slowly loses interest liao.<br><br>so any others to introduce anot?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the hk version a bit simplified and somehow is a less serious version. the main story and events are told but its different compared the the china version which i had watched. entertainment wise, HK version is better, content wise and details the chinese version will win for sure. not sure if the hk version is going to show what happens after liu bang wins xiang yu.<br><br>there are a few of such historical based chinese drama shows in series in those vcd shops, but probably less popular in terms of who acted in it etc. but the element of interest is more probably in the actual chinese history and the documented records available. the more records there are, the more possible it is to use them to conjure up a plot.<br><br>san guo is based on the novel/ romanticised version of the actual historical events, in someway, it has a lot of bias in terms of character interpretation.<br><br>in some way, the chu-han era (post qin dynasty) is pretty similar in terms of backdrop, i.e feudal warlords fighting each other being more powerful, having military advisers, tactics plots, exploits on human weakness etc.. same template, different characters but still interesting.<br><br>most of these interesting stories are more often during transitional periods of dynasties for example:<br><br>1. Chu-Han story - transition between Qin to Han<br>2. San Guo - from Han to Jin<br><br>Similar stories in the stores which i saw are about similar stuff:<br><br>Tang Tai Zong (li shi min) - beginnings of Tang dynasty<br>zhu yuan zhang - beginning of ming and fall of yuan<br>qing gong feng yun - beginnings of Qing<br>zhao kuang yin - beginnings of Song, i recalled SBC producing a show like dat before.<br><br>such turbulent periods (luan shi) also exist in the modern contect and shows have been made like<br><br>zou chu gong he - end of qing and creation of Chinese Republic, but i think China have some policy on showing stuff based on material in the modern days.. so there wasn't much about the history after that<br><br>The other show which I would like to watch to know the details of the era better is about the Mao Zedong and the civil war in China between the the communists under Mao and the Nationalist Party under Chiang Kai Shek. They had the modern stuff, guns canons etc but they also had able generals and strategies and events like the Long March, how they came together to fight world war 2, the soong sisters.. can wiki/ google it, but somehow having to watch it on tv seems to be a better experience.</div>
