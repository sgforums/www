            <div class='col-md body'>*sigh* yet another stupid idiot troubled by love.<br><br>Scenario is: I have been attached to my bf for about 2++years already... there isn't many sparks in my relationship, well after 2 years, you can't expect sparks to fly so often. My bf isn't the romantic kind (sounds typical hor). We have our own things to busy with, but we are together. We are very close... (reads 'in bed')but after 2 years, I find that we have different interests. Well, I expect you to ask me why did I realise this only after 2 years. Well, that's when the new guy comes in.<br><br>This new guy I'm interested in, I met him from my ECA. He's my senior and at first, I don't have any complicated feelings for him. But after an event, I found that he could understand me very well and he cared about me. From then on, I started turing to him for advice.<br><br>And since last month, I started having feelings for him. I found that we share many similar interests... from music, travel... to  sushi. It is totally different with my bf. We have very different interest, but I didn't mind that difference. It is only until now that I mind the difference. Stupid, rite?<br><br>Well, becos the new guy I'm interested in is from my ECA, there isn't many people whom I can talk to regarding this. That's why I'm turning to this forum for advices and an eager ear.<br><br>The new guy is very much better than my current bf. But then, it doesn't really matter to me. And if I break up with my bf, I'm afraid he cannot take it...<br><br>Another complication... the new guy will be going overseas for 6mths next year...<br><br>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>What should I do???  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Luv has alwiz been a tuf and delicate issue 2 handle...hmmz, from wat I tink, tis problem shld be pretty common amongst couples. When they're oredi attached, and after some time, the sparks die down, the relationship becomes dull and when another party appears, there is the temptation 2 go 4 him/her.<br><br>First of all, u've to be clear if u still luv ur boyfren and does he still feel the same way abt u. Have a good talk wif him, let him noe how u feel. Calm and composed communication is alwiz the best way 2 set tinks rite. Listen 2 wat he has 2 say.<br><br>Towards ur senior, r u really sure u luv him..as in luv, and not juz a crush? Sumtimes, we do get confused if we're juz having a crush or izzit the real thing. Or 4 dat matter...is ur bf ur crush and ur senior ur true luv? Ask urself these and gif them some thought.<br><br>Differences between 2 pple in a couple dun mean there'll be conflict. I noe of many couples who have varied interests but who can still get along vedi well. And most of all, we shld all be aware when 2 be satisfied. When we r attached, there'll be the challenge of not falling for someone else. Ur stead may seem 2 fall behind in terms of character n looks 2 someone u meet later in life, but u muz noe how 2 control urself. Nobirdie is perfect, and we'll discover there're many pple much better den the one we luv somehow. The onli tink is 2 keep our commitment n promise 2 the person we chose 2 be wif...and dat'll be a beautiful luv story  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay,<br>Thanks for the few replies here....<br>Actually I also don't know if I really love my bf... damn sad hor... maybe I've spoilt him too much... I don't ask for a lot and I put myself in his shoes, thinking that it will be damn troublesome to do XXX, to costly to get roses, etc... Maybe I really hope for more, but knowing he won't let me have my way, then I don't ask at all. We don't quarrel at all, just like old couples.<br><br>I will give my bf another chance...just history tells me that things will just repeat themselves...even if he make an effort not to take me for granted, how about after we get married, which is like many years away? If a breakup will definitely happen, why not let it be soon, rather than 5 years down the road?<br><br>BabyC|eFairy^, thanks for your advice... I'm still not clear if I still love my bf... and I'm not sure if he really loves me or I just happen to come along...<br>As for my senior, he is just a catalyst that worked (unlike previous occasion), and made me think seriously when me and my bf are suitable for each other...  Maybe my senior will be the one, maybe not.<br><br>Sometimes, I blame myself for what is happening now. There's a lot of guys whom I'm close to in my ECA, and for the past year, nothing happened. I know some of the guys were intially interested in me, but knowing I'm happily attached, they backed off. And I was happy it was that way. But me and my senior got to know each other better becos of our shared interest, and although there wasn't anything intially, there's something now. It's damn irritating getting into this mess... if I'm my innocent self with no other thoughts for other guys, this won't be happening.<br><br>*sigh*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, LoveFool, don't blame yourself. It is of no use at all. Anyway, what I see isn't the fact that the other guy is so much more attractive than ur bf, the problem lies between u and ur bf and u r subconsciously telling urself that u want out. Well, you have got to think carefully though, a gal in this stage are usually very susceptible to feelings from other guys. What I think is, give your bf a chance. Narrow down what is wrong in this relationship. Issit because the communication between both of you is getting less?? Or is he beginning to take u for granted?? Can you remember why u fell for him in the first place?? Do you not see both of you progressing a little more in this journey of life??? If you think that being together is a total mistake, the least you can do is to sit down, talk to him. Consider any possibilities of salvaging the situation. One policy is never go for another guy when u havent broken up with ur current one, it will make him feel quite bitter.<br><br>*Yawn* got to sleep now.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>lovel_fool:</strong><br>Well, glad to hear that you have decided to give your bf a second chance and since you have already decided to do that, please stop saying that things will just repeat themseleves. Keep an open mind. Talk to your bf about what happen and the fact that you MIND that he is NOT being sweet and attentive enough. Communication is very important between a couple! In a relationship, you should be looking forward to a lasting one and NOT anticipating a break-up, please don't have such a negative attidue alright? *HUGZ*<br><br>Between, what happened is NOT your fault. Human beings have feelings and everyone changes. Maybe you just feel that your bf is no longer suitable for you but like I say, give him another chance. I am sure he deserves that..... 2 years is not a short time dear.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> You may be open or attracted to new people because the relationship has stagnant and it's up to you to sparkle off the fire again. Think about it. Even if you are together with this senior of yours from your ECA, the same scenerio may happen another 2 years down the road..... and what are you going to do then?<br><br>*SHRUGS* Whatever it is, the decision is up to you and I wish you all the best.

I don't know if I will break up with him eventually becos I really don't know. I disagree with Youwen and jugglepuff on immediate breakup because even if I want to break up, I want to have a clean and friendly break. My bf knows me so well and if we are not a couple, I still hope to have him as a friend. That's why. What if I tell him now and he fails his exam becos of me and can't graduate? What if he commit suicide in army? I will feel guilty for the rest of my life.<br><br>If I break up, there will always be someone eager suitors. My bf is also not a spare tyre...he may be the one, he may be not. I won't know until the day I get married. If I get married, I can always divorce and find someone else. Don't be shock.<br><br>I really hope my bf will be the one. It is so damn troublesome to go steady with someone all over again, going through the same arguments.

            <div class='col-md body'>After seeing your post, i decide i should not see other post so as not to be affected but other opinions....<br><br>You have to choose this for urself, no among of advice can do it for u. with or without this new guy, there is a problem, u dont love ur bf the same. so i feel this new guy is made a scapegoat for ur inablity to decide. rem watever decision u make will affect ur bf and this new guy who u seem more concern abt. In the end of the day it is oso u who is going to choose who u going to marry and u might not even choose btween the 2 of them.<br><br>think abt ur problem again, whether it lies with u or issit the fault of ur boyfren<br></div>

Lets say u decided to break up with him after he has finished all the examinations and physical tests there are for him in this life, that is, he has found a very stable job in the future,  he still might not be able to take the shock of u wanting to break  up with him. He could have gone crazy and started a killing spree in the office. Well for example he could simply take a parang, storm into the office and hack everything that stand in his way. U get it??<br>So my point is dont waste his precious time. U are being very selfish in wanting the best of everything.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I admit that the love is not the same. How much changes/intensity, I don't know. When I tried to proach the topic to my bf, he didn't take me seriously. He thought I was in one of my moods, thinking that he doesn't love me. I tried to speak in a serious tone, but he said I sounded damn fake. I got frustrated also.<br><br>I told him I don't know if I love him...I told him I'm quite popular... I asked him if he knew what I want, and he knew it.<br><br>He complained that I shouldn't be bothering him with this kind of nosense when he is busy with his project.<br><br>I almost gave up trying to get him to understand how I feel when he finally understood that girls need to be cheered and wooed... then he told me "I only know I love you". I smiled.<br><br>I think you know the answer. In my heart, I have decided to give my bf another chance. Not only is it becos of the 2++ years relatioinship, but I think there is still something between us that makes me melt. Is that love? I guess I will have to wait for another 10 years, after getting married to him in order to know if it's love. But it is such a long wait and I'm quite a pessimistic person *sigh* There is this fear in my heart that he won't be the one, and I would have wasted my youth...</div>
