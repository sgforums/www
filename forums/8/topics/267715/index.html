            <div class='col-md body'><br>Incidents of penis severed off by Gf/wife or even by the guy himself  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>The following are documented cases of men having their penises severed due to accident, spousal jealousy or self infliction (intentional or not):<br><br>* The penis of Napoleon was reportedly severed at his autopsy, and purloined: it was some years later sold to a urologist for $40,000.[5]<br><br>* Dr. W.C. Minor, a contributor to the Oxford English Dictionary who suffered from schizophrenia, performed an autopenectomy in 1902 to pay for imaginary sins.<br><br>* Grigori Rasputin's penis was severed in the assassination that ended his life on December 16, 1916 (O.S.): it was reported rescued, kept in a wooden box and much cherished by his daughter, Maria. It has reportedly been on display in various locations.<br><br>* The first documented case of a completely successful penis replantation, restoring full function, was performed at Massachusetts General Hospital by a team led by Dr. Hugh H. Young II, with fellow urologist Dr. John F.S. Daly and plastic surgeons Dr. Benjamin E. Cohen and Dr. James W. May. The case is documented in the February 1977 issue of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons journal, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery.<br><br>* In 1966, six-month old David Reimer's penis was destroyed during a botched circumcision using an electrocautery device. He was re-assigned as a girl with tragic consequences. As a teenager, he underwent genital reconstructive surgery to restore his male organ. Years later, David committed suicide.[6]<br><br>* In 1993, Lorena Bobbitt cut off the penis of her husband, John Wayne Bobbitt with a kitchen knife. It was surgically re-attached, and he subsequently became a porn star. She was found not liable and was sentenced to 45 days hospitalization.<br><br>* In March 1996, Ms. Tran Nhu Tran, a Vietnamese immigrant in Australia attempted to sever her husband's penis with a pair of scissors. She was charged with malicious wounding, but the charges were dropped based on reconciliation with her husband.<br><br>* On July 1, 1997, Ms. Kim Phuong Tran (Kim Tran #1), a Vietnamese immigrant in British Columbia, severed her husband's penis after he had told her he was in love with another woman. He had not been discreet about his mistress. Kim Phoung Tran kept telling her husband not to have the mistress, and to please not leave her. He told Kim Phoung Tran that he needed to be left alone so he could think. He then went to sleep. While he was asleep she cut off his penis, and immediately flushed it down the toilet. His penis could not be recovered. Ms. Tran was sentenced to a two-year conditional stay-at-home sentence with community service. Many men's rights groups in Canada were outraged at the lightness of her sentence.<br><br>* On December 11, 1997, a California resident Alan Hall was admitted to NorthBay Medical Center after having his penis severed. Hall claimed his penis was severed by an attacker named 'Brenda,' in a revenge attack because Mr. Hall had killed Denise Denofrio in July 1983. Later, Hall admitted he had removed his own penis while intoxicated, expecting that it would easily be reattached by surgeons.<br><br>* In March 2001, in the town of Rotenburg, central Germany, cannibal Armin Meiwes, cut off and flambÃ©ed a man's penis, with his consent, and the two men ate it together. The other man, Bernd JÃ¼rgen Brandes was then killed by Meiwes, also with his consent. The song "Mein Teil" by Rammstein was inspired by the case[7].<br><br>* In January 2002, In Russia, Pavel Morozov, a player of Spartak football for disabled people, was brutally murdered by his friend's girlfriend because he did not want to have sex with her. The friend invited Pavel over to his house to drink vodka with him and his girlfriend. The girlfriend became interested in Pavel the more drunk she got. She made advances towards Pavel but as he did not reciprocate them she became upset and started hitting him and screaming. Pavels friend came over to see what was going on. He might have started hitting Pavel as well. Pavel ended up unconscious on the floor. The girlfriend then unzipped Pavel's pants and cut off his penis. She then stabbed him in the chest. Pavels body was then thrown out in the street. The other two continued drinking. They were arrested the next morning[8].<br><br>* In 2003, Alfonse Mumbo, 38, a Kenyan villager, cut off his penis and testicles in order to punish his wife for adultery.<br><br>* In 2003, a German student known just as "Andreas W", from Halle cut off his own penis and tongue with a pair of garden shears while under the influence of the deleriant drug datura. Neither organ was re-attached successfully.<br><br>* In 2004, in Kassel, Germany, a 50 year old woman severed the penis of her Ghanaian ex-husband but died as a result of wounds inflicted by the same knife. The man's organ was later retrieved from the same room in which she died, though it is unknown as to whether it was re-attached or not[9]. Fortean Times later reported that the court was told that the man had severed his own penis before attacking his ex-wife.<br><br>* In October 2004, Dr. Naum Ciomu chopped patient Nelu Radonescu's penis into small pieces in a fit of anger during routine surgery for a testicular malformation.[10] He was ultimately found guilty of grievous bodily harm, fined and received a 1 year suspended jail sentence for the attack. [11] The victim ultimately had reconstructive surgery using tissue from his arm.<br><br>* On November 2004, Manit Srithammathan cut off two teenage boys' penises and threw them in a canal. When the police questioned Srithammathan, he said he had cut off and disposed of their penises because the boys refused to confess to stealing $1,250 from his ATM account after they were shown videotape evidence of their theft. [1]<br><br>* In February 2005, Ms. Kim Tran (Kim Tran #2), a Vietnamese immigrant in Alaska, severed her boyfriend's penis with a kitchen knife, after tying him to the windowsill. The severed organ was flushed down the toilet but retrieved and successfully reattached. Ms. Tran was convicted on charges of serious assault with a weapon, but charges of tampering with evidence and sexual assault were dropped.<br><br>* In February 2005, Spanish surgeons reconstructed the penises of two Kenyan boys whose organs were cut off by witch doctors making a potion supposed to cure HIV/AIDS.<br><br>* On July 23, 2005, Delmy Ruiz, 49, was found guilty of aggravated assault after she had severed Rene Aramando NuÃ±ez' penis with a knife. Ruiz said he had abused her earlier, but it was believed that she was really just jealous because he was seeing someone else. She lured him over to the house to talk about documents concerning the house that they owned together. He fell asleep while at the house. That is when she cut off his penis. The jury had been shown graphic photos of NuÃ±ez' wounded crotch where more than 80% of his penis was completely removed save for a small stump. The penis was never recovered as it had been removed from the scene by her dog. Ruiz was sentenced to eight years in prison and fined $10,000[12].<br><br>* On 20 September 2005, the first successful penis transplant was begun in a military hospital in Guangzhou, China. A man at 44 sustained an injury that severed his penis at an accident. Despite atrophy of blood vessels and nerves after a protracted period of time had elapsed (exact length not given), the arteries, veins, nerves and the corpora spongiosa were successfully matched. After seven hours' surgery, the penis regained its function and even managed to attain erection. The extent to which the penis' function was restored and occurrence of rejection or infection remain to be seen[13].<br><br>* On March 15, 2006, Polish-American immigrant Jakub Fik, distraught over problems with a girlfriend, went on a vandalism spree; when confronted by Chicago police, he severed his own penis and threw it at the officers. He was taken into custody and sent into surgery.<br><br>* In Bahrain, an Indian housemaid attacked her husband and severed his penis because of his alleged infidelity. She then threw the penis out their apartment window and into the street.<br><br>* In the 1990s a man featured on the Jerry Springer talk-show had desired to become a woman and so severed his own penis and hid it from his wife.<br><br>* On April 22, 2007, a man cut off his penis with a knife in a packed London restaurant.[14].<br><br>* In 2007, Li Gengbao's penis was cut off by his wife when she found out he was cheating on her. After hearing Li Gengbao plead for his penis back, the wife threw it out the window where the neighbor's dog ate it.
