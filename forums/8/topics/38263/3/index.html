Obviously show how down right despicable you are.<br><br>Don't come here think you very smart with lots of inner substance lah, if you really that great you would have learnt how to read posts in the first place.

Obviously you are the bastard who tries to be funny in the first place, and you can't take the insult when being attacked. Boo boo booooo. This again reflect on your chatacter.
