            <div class='col-md body'>recently i find that because i was unhappy with some of my friends, my circle of ppl where i can talk to is getting way smaller. each of my friend has a very unique attitude and likes etc, when i 'strike' 1 person because misunderstandings,etc i find that i have 1 less person to talk to, because the others may not be interested in what i want to say. simply put . for eg i wanna talk abt cars to say...kohanson( sorry ah...borrow yr nick) but i unhappy with him.but then bluekelvin is not interested in cars but i can talk to him like friends but he wont be enthusiastic abt it.<br><br>today and sometime ago there are 2 examples, today's i chatted with my friend the previous night for 1 hr plus. chatted happily( btw she not my gf hor) then we can get along lah.she understands waht i am talking abt and so forth, w/o much explanation.somemore she same age as me...so can click.<br>i asked her last night if she wants to come with me and some friends with me to suntec for the IT fair. then she say she will try to come if she is free after doing the project. then she will confirm with me this morning.then i msg her this that if she is not free then no need to come her project more important ( normally i wouldnt say this but on the spur of the moment , i did) she said she will call or msg me if she is here.<br>anyway i went to the IT fair as usual, then she msg me and told me she is here and saw nothing nice to see. then i replied to ask her where she is now and she told me she has left. so i called her for a brief moment and hinted my displeasure at her behaviour, since she didnt tell me and just left. then she msg back to tell me she at some foodcourt and told me i can go find her if i want. so i  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> told her that i busy looking. and she had the cheek to say ' oh u are busy looking ah ? are u intending to look for something?"<br><br>then i didnt msg her back till now.i am planning to tell her not to msg me from now onwards since she acts like this. i kind of view this as betrayal. this is not the first time someone did that to me and because someone intervened then i forgave tat person.but i did not forgive the other person who was also involved and shouted at me like mad.<br><br>i feel like msg her to say that dont msg me from now on since she acts like this. SO WHAT DO U THINK ?<br><br>then last time is my friend. we could get along pretty well. since we are also the same age and she is also abit bright and she could understand what i saying most of the time. and she is the one that led me to think what is the difference between good friends and couple ( and i got great help in that, thanks guys ) but then she suddenly ignore me. i asked her to come online to talk abt something, but several times it had to be delayed because she fang wo ge zi. then i said what i was unhappy with, like never replied to my sms,emails and when i call her she would wanna go after a short while and why she always say she busy busy busy busy busy...but it was fruitless.anyway i del her numbers from my phone. didnt talk to her ever since.<br><br>SO WHAT DO U THINK?<br><br>so does anyone have anything to say ? need some advice and suggestions <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
