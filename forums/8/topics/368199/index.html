              <p>Why are the terriorist attacking china now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the past, they use to attack America and the western countries as these countries attacked Iraq, fight against terrorism.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In year 2003, when terriorist captured some hostages, they released the hostages from china because china did not participate in the war against Iraq.</p>

              <p>The current violence in Xin Jiang of China is not created by terrorists groups, but by the Muslims living there.</p>

              <p>Yeah, now there's a real arsehole...but the tensions were probably already there, he just set them off. The idiots who believed his bullshit tale also should have looked for evidence first before going off to bring violence to the first uighurs they found. </p>

              <p>Yesterday I didn't get the full picture too, but after reading a few articles, I realised that the whole thing was started by an idiot who is a Han Chinese.</p>
              <p>He spreaded false rumours that Han Chinese girls were raped by Uighur workers, and ended up causing the men at a toy factory to attack their Uighur counterparts working there.</p>
              <p>This ended up in violent showdown between workers of the two different ethnics, which resulted in 2 dead Uighurs and 180+ people injured.</p>
              <p>This caused the Uighurs to march in a protest, and it was <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>alleged</strong></span> that the Chinese Riot Police fired on the Uighurs despite them not doing anything violenic ( yet ). </p>
              <p>All these resulted in the mess which we are seeing now, Uighurs and Han Chinese dying everywhere in Urumqi, XinJiang.</p>

              <p>actually, the version i read (i think is more accurate) was that this han chinese female worker went into the rest area and saw some uighur guys down there without their shirts on.</p>
              <p>the uighur guys kind of tease her and made faces at her and one of them stood up and pretended to advance towards her as if he's gonna rape her (by faking the gestures).</p>
              <p>the han chinese girl ran out and told people they wanted to rape her and the rumours spread and spread until what it is today. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>the thing is the uighur guys only make fun of her lah........she too seriousl liao.</p>
              <p>and those han chinese police also very biased.......help their own people.</p>
              <p>china should have a mix of ethnic groups in it's milirary force.</p>
