            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Unlike most of the other posters who have criticised 'Bollywood', it is not my belief that 'Bollywood' should be criticised on teh ground that it is 'low-class' (at least in the sense that these critics would maintain) or that it is only liked by Indians (supposing this to be true).<br><br>In the first place, if a form of art is 'low-class' on a ground other than that of its being morally objectionable, then I don't see why it cannot be adapted for use in promoting even those themes that I would regard as being the most sacred of all; after all, a song like 'Jesus wants me for a sunbeam', is terribly 'low-class' (in the sense of its being aesthetically vulgar), but that would not mean that it would be impossible for such a song to be deployed morally so that it is instrumental in achieving what is arguably the loftiest purpose of all.<br><br>By the same token, many of the 'paegant plays' staged during mediaeval times, were gaudy, overwrought, and shamelessly theatrical; but that does not mean that their artistic depiction of the Day of Doom was in itself immoral, or that this depiction could not have been morally adapted to the performance of a function loftier than any other: namely, the saving of souls.<br><br>Secondly, I don't believe that the fact that a form of art should be liked only by one race of people to the exclusion of other races, could ever be a ground for deeming that form of art to be (objectively, from an aesthetic standpoint) 'low-class'; Christianity itself (though not a form of art but rather a religion) initially arose as a sect within Judaism, and yet this did not prevent Christianity from appealing to all men, across cultures.<br><br>The trouble with 'Bollywood' as I see it, is its exhibition and endorsement of values that are universally destructive of human beings; but this sort of trouble afflicts Hollywood and other sorts of cinema (such as Chinese cinema).<br><br>Ben<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Bollywood has changed very much since the 80s. If u see a movie of those times, it will be 99% of the time stories about family conflict, rape, violence and couple of actors in traditional clothes and amtuerish songs thrown in.<br><br>But  as u can see at present, Bollywood had become a commercial entity very much following western values and cultures.The actors have changed and their dressing is kinda different. The songs are taken in a music video style and now u can find modern day themes in their movies.<br><br>The singaporeans who think that Boyllwood is about dancing in trees are just in an illusion themselves and are pretty much ignorant as most of the time Mediacrop used to  shows crappy films.</div>

Why is this done almost perpetually (or so I am given to understand)?<br><br>I understand that lovers sometimes 'frolick' and that part of what this can involve, might include the man of the pair pursuing his partner playfully; but when a culture (or rather a 'pop culture') sets this sort of incident up as a kind of icon signifying the sort of dynamics that ought to inform romantic relationships between the sexes, and when this incident is accordingly presented as a sort of achetype exemplifying the pattern to which these sorts of relationships ought to be trying to conform, then I think that something has gone seriously amiss.<br><br>Why should the man be presented archetypally as the predator, and the woman as equally archetypally the prey?<br><br>I don't deny that many men are predatory; but I do deny that this is what they were intended to be by God.<br><br>Moreover, why do the women in these films or 'heroines' (as I am informed) regard the men by whom they are smitten, as veritable 'gods'?<br><br>I think that this sort of presentation will have a negative impact on impressionable persons who are exposed to it.<br><br>Ben<br><br></div>
