            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2003-04-09/l4_2.JPG"><br>IN THE first 25 minutes of 15 alone, you see a group of teenage boys playing truant from school, watching porn movies at home, getting into fights and talking about committing suicide.<br><br>When the boys take off their school uniforms, they reveal shirtless bodies criss-crossed with dragon tattoos and piercings. Self-mutilation, written on the flesh, is the brazen mark of their alienation from mainstream society.<br><br>Drawing you into the private world of disaffected teenagers, 15 invites comparisons with the work of controversial American director Larry Clark, whose films like Kids (1995) and Bully (2001) show American teenagers drinking, partying and having sex, all in a drug-induced stupor.<br><br>Few adults are shown in 15, the one exception being a scene where three delinquent teenagers board a public bus.<br><br>There, the camera catches the other passengers staring warily at them, leading to a confrontation between an overbearing woman professional and one of the boys.<br><br>However, for all the grittiness of the film, there is something romantic at its heart, which makes it less difficult to watch. Whether you are watching a boy flake the skin off his wrist with a razor, or another taking his drunk friend home and allowing him to barf into his shirt, 15 is about young people desperately in need of love.<br><br>Unlike Clark's amoral, self-absorbed teenagers, these Singaporeans still believe in the power of friendship when no one else -- parents, teachers or other adults -- seems to care.<br><br>With 15, Tan is developing his own distinctive language as a film-maker. He uses arty, irreverent touches such as recording a gang fight at high speed and set to thumping Hokkien hip-hop by homegrown composer Yellow Box, giving the scene a stylised, cartoonish quality.<br><br>Equally, he does not soft-pedal his social critique, showing a lost generation of Singapore youth who may not be striving for the 5Cs but instead, are looking for the perfect building to jump off.<br><br>On this count alone, his film sets itself apart from other homegrown flicks like last year's I Not Stupid, whose satire of the education system here was glossed over by sitcom-style camerawork and a predictably 'happy' ending.<br><br>Tan's film deserves to be seen and talked about by all Singaporeans -- especially by the older teens he made it for, who can best identify with the bittersweet angst of being 15.<br></div>
