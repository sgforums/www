            <div class='col-md body'>1st, you need to register an account. There are 2 ways to do it. Either you can purchase the box that contains the discs, or you can register and buy online and  you have to download it.

Credit card is the easier method, and can be cheaper in the longer run as you get bulk discount if you subscribe longer. Typically, most would have a 3 month subscription. Pre-paid cards can be purchased in any game shop in Funan and it is typically a 2 month card. Initial purchase will give you 1 mths free subscription.<br><br>Overall, it is easier to pop down to any game shop and purchase the game box.<br><br>When you first enter the game, you have to select the server your boyfriend is playing in. Or else, you won't be able to play with him in-game. Try to get to 60 before the expansion is released so that you can enjoy the upcoming expansion with your boy friend equally.

The rationale is that you will be essential to any group/raid and your choice of gear can be focused on pure damage gear unlike other hybrids.
