Am oso given a personal pin.. can't divulge the pin code to anyone as it gives access to work from home..<br>She walked towards me and said," Hey.. lend me your laptop leh!!!" Then I told her, "sorry... I oso need to use and then pin code is personal one... Boss says can't divulge to anyone.." She simply turned her head and while walking off, she said out loud," NO NEED TO BE SO HAO LIAN ONE!!!"<br><br>She is simply behaving in such a CHILDISH manner.....Oreadi a MOTHER OF TWO and still behaves like in her eighteens or twenties...  Always wait till her kids go to bed and then watch the drama of her FAVE KOREAN IDOL till very late at night.......<br><br>Always complain that her husband is very bad tempered... Think she's the one..... She also once said that married also can divorce one mah... Such a woman.. I really sympathise with her hubby...</div></blockquote>Avoid her for lunch<br>Avoid her for dinner<br>Avoid her for all social contacts<br>Just say hello and goodbye as courtesy<br><br>If you cannot grasp those basic concepts .....then you are actually entangling yourself with Mrs Busybodywhothinksshedeservesyouasafriend. Then all I can say .....HAVE FUN!</div>
