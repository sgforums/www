            <div class='col-md body'>TAKEN from one of the net forum....<br><br>To Whom it may concern,<br><br>I am writing sincerely to update the local people about my plight in securing an education loan for overseas studies in a top US University. After serving NS, I came onto the working world and found that as a Singaporean male, the demerits far outweigh the merits. I have been searching high and low for an education loan to a very prestigious university which has accepted me but from what I see, it is a bleak route. Please see below the difficulties I had faced in orchestrating a plan to accumulate the loan.<br><br>1. I tried distributing flyers into mailboxes of affluent areas such as Holland Road and Orchard Road. It was stated clearly in the flyer that I do not need a sponsor and that I am taking it as an education loan. I will make the repayment accordingly up to half a million over a long term basis. Imagine my horror when the next day, I received two phone calls.<br><br>Â· The first was a lady who was very rude and uncouth in her conversation with me. She was clearly out to demean me by saying that no one in her estate is going to be Â“connedÂ” so easily by my ancient tactics. Then she went on to say that it is just my luck that I do not hail from a rich family etc etc. She ended her verbal abuse by asking me to blame my parents for not being capable enough to be rich in this meritocratic society.<br><br>The insult lasted for an entire 20 minutes and during those times; I had to submit myself to her tirade. I have no wish to bicker with her over this issue and I just kept silence. I spent 7-10 hours under the hot sun walking from one landed unit to another and it is really demoralizing to receive this kind of response on my first phone call. What irks me the most was that she asked for the name of my ex-school and warned that she would complain to the school principal and maybe lodge a police report if she were to see my flyers again in the future.<br><br>Â· The second phone call was enough for me to switch off my phone. There is this Caucasian guy who called up and he was very friendly and amiable over the phone. It was surely a stark departure to the first phone call that I received. However, less than 5 minutes into the conversation, he asked if I would be willing to move into his estate and he will be willing to sponsor my education if I were to be his Â“Sugar BoyÂ”<br><br>I switch off the phone after that call. It was then that I realize that life in Singapore as a native male is not as rosy as portrayed before we serve NS. I thought that by being a Top Student, my future will be paved and I can study anywhere as I wish so long as my grades are good. I was dead wrong.<br><br>2. Flyers aside, I preserve on my quest for an education loan although these two setbacks have demoralized me adversely. I tried to go online and post my request with my phone number in one of the forums. The result was pathetic and not much better than what I had experienced earlier.<br><br>Â· My first phone call was an Uncle who asked if I go to Malaysia regularly. He sounded very friendly over the phone and was candid in his conversation. He told me that he got my number from one of his friends who surfs the net regularly. He was willing to help me with some Â“Easy moneyÂ” if I were to bring in some Â“productsÂ” from Malaysia into Singapore. When I asked what product he was referring to, he suggest we meet up and discuss more in details. He will pay me a 5-digit sum upfront.<br><br>I was tempted but curious. I asked if the products were powdery and he replied in the affirmative. I halted my conversation by saying that it is impossible for me to indulge in such shady business. He was persistent and refused to hang up the phone. Then he kept reiterating that no one in his right frame of mind is going to help me with an education loan. Singapore is a practical society. He asked me to consider and that he will call me again.<br><br>My class will start in August. I guess I will have to reject the offer and continue my odd jobs in Singapore if no other offer comes in. I hope this letter will serve to educate young people out there like me that no matter how desperate you are, never engage in illegal transactions to get the education loan.<br><br>It is better to have integrity intact and engage in menial tasks rather than surrendering to your own conscience. I have heard countless cases of local under-graduates and some overseas undergraduates selling their bodies or engaging in shady activities just to get the money. DonÂ’t do it. Have a nice day.<br><br></div>
