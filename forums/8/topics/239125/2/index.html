            <div class='col-md body'>I personally feel that when viewers should feel entertained &amp; relaxed during charity shows, &amp; should not be feeling stressed, just like those NKF shows. It's not going to work if risky acts are performed, it'll going to piss the viewers off. I think if the monk should performed acts like hip-hop or some other choregraphed performances, more people would be willing to donate more. And yesterday there's 1 part in which Gurmit Singh trying to get people to call while the monk was scaling up the building, his tone was like very threatening, it surely pissed me &amp; a lot of people off, &amp; I'm sure that his intention backfired. And 1 final thing that pissed me off also, while the artistes were trying to get the viewers to call when the monk was performing his item, what were all those people sitting near the front doing, NOTHING!!! They were like looking blindly to see the monk climbing, THEY TRYING TO ACT BLUR IS IT, bloody hell!!! They're all a bunch of s_h_i_t_s. I never saw them using their mobile phones to call until it's near to the end, nah buay!!!</div>

If i remember correctly, few years back, there was a charity show (not NKF or Renci) that consist of only singing by artists/singers but it didnt even managed to gather 3m of the target 5m, ended up breaking one of the rules governing charity.<br><br>on the side note, it'll be interesting to see venerable shi performing dancing acts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My random thoughts after watching the show<br><br>Feel kind of cheated that they keep saying 600 thousands call was their target then turn out they meant all calls, even $15 and $30 calls, so in the end only 400 thousands call they already over hit target by over a million, althought maybe they fix the number to save facE? Who knows?<br><br>But would you fancy hanging 10 storey in the air? Even if you have safe measures for you. Remember your life is hanging by a rope literally. I thought it was a dangerous stunt just like last year. And you do wonder issit true singaporeaen will only donate when they see these kind of high risk stunt? Because his segment itself is around 200 thousands call, half of the whole night calls.  Sometimes contradicted, see a guy so dedicated to try to raise donation but yet if you call, you are encouraging the producers to find him to do more stunt next year and next next year.<br><br>I agree gurmit singh the rant really like very aggressive and make me uncomfortable but on the other hand, he was trying to make people understand the patient problems and raise funds but he was over the top and too emtional.<br><br>I prefer Adrian pang way of persuading but i doubt much english speaking only viewers were watching if much on channel u, a mandarin pro gramme.<br><br>I heard that 40% of the money go to mediacorp? really? then how much to teleco company? Pity, because if so, think next time i will just donate directly instead of letting them take the cut and waste my money. Make me realise over time, we tend to forget alot of things.<br><br>I thought zoe tay and adrian pang face changing was  a bit of misleading advertisment, they just took their mask off with their hands... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> and not the normal ones we  see, but i thought the whole thing was visually very well done and refreshing and unique anyway.<br><br>Could see by the end gua liang was getting really jaded, kinda pity him, can you imagine 4 hours you keep asking the viewers to donate and repeating that number? Pengzzzzzzz, think he must have said that line 100 times or more.<br><br>Thought Quan Yifeng was way off when she said they are not trying to gain sympathy and stuff? Really couldn't understand her logic.</div>
