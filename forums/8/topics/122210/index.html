            <div class='col-md body'>hi, i'm about to spend my cny hongbao money and some of my pay to get a new keyboard for my younger brother, i figure he needed to practice since he started taking keyboard lessons recently. since he is a beginner, i want to get a keyboard that is not 2 exp but has enuff features to help improve and develop his skills, then next time i can get him another more exp and powerful one when he's more advanced. my budget is from 400 to 700 dollars for this keyboard. as for myself, i'm looking for a electric guitar/ampfi combo set, but i dun wanna overspend on this , so i'm looking for second hand one or a cheap and good orginal, but i have no idea where to look, anyone who's good in this area can gimme some advice or recommedation? thanks</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>maybe u can go for yamaha keyboards. the sound quality is not bad &amp; realistic. i got my keyboard from my music school...so far ok but bcos my piano keys r those of half-length thickness, i feel the sound quality is a bit compromised <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">) but no choice lor since i got budget &amp; oso i am at beginner level, so the priority is to get a decent keyboard to practise on first.</div>
