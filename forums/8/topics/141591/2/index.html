            <div class='col-md body'>Their behaviourial pattern can be traced back to growing up.<br><br>Nowadays, parents cannot control their kids. Maybe because they are too busy making huge somes of money. As a result, psycho-analysis comes to the same conclusion: that singaporean parents lavish their kids with expensive gifts can keep them quiet.<br><br>My generation hailed from a time when primary school kids were fearful of their cane-wielding teachers, when classrooms were slient as a tomb, where parents bring their kids out to macrichie reservoir every saturday to play frisbee and run about. When parents knew how to manage their kids and give them the right form of attention.<br><br>It was also a time of recession in the 1980s, where retrenchment was at an all time high. Unemployment was at its worst in years, and people never took hard-earned cash for granted.<br><br>Teens nowadays spend like nobody's business and with the obvious lack of parent's guidance, sink deeper into juvenile deliquency. Many skip school without their parent's knowledge and hang out with their 'friends' at places such as level one far east plaza and bugis junction.<br><br>Rowdy teens is just scrapping the surface.</div>

The saddest thing is, I just turned 22 two weeks ago. I'm only a few years removed from their age, yet they seem to be a full generation away. I really feel like some cranky old man when I see those kids with their havoc ways.<br><br>I won't take a huge brush and paint all the kids today similarly - I know that these havoc kids are the minority. Unfortunately, the way I see it, the minority is getting bigger.<br><br>To be frank - I'm glad I was born a few years earlier and not become a part of their 'generation'.</div>
