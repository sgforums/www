He said he could not take it anymore.<br><br>I find this very disturbing as it seems that women will use their position as "the weaker sex" and exploit it, playing victim when sometimes, they are the perpetrator.<br><br>As for violence both physical and mental, I think there are few things lower than people who commit spousal abuse or abuse their partners.  A trust placed upon a loved one based on love is betrayed... by the very one you place that trust on.<br><br>Frankly, I don't think people change all that much... those who are violent will probably remain violent.

Believe me when I tell you that I've seen a woman beat the living shyte out of a guy.  He's on the ground and she's still kicking his nuts.

She needed 2 bouncers to immobilise her.  Sheesh... What was she on?  Viagra?  Chuckle...  Ever seen a cat fight?  It really puts men to shame when they se 2 women decking it out full-on.
