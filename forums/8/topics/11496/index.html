            <div class='col-md body'>hi,<br>1st, good effort to TCS for the NKF show and congrats on the money collected for a good cause.<br><br>i am just wondering if the daredevil stunts in the show r justified. i know the actors/actresses r trained but they r not pros. aryton senna was a highly trained pro ace-driver and yet, he died in a race. my point is not to draw a parallel but to say that the stuns r of hi risk and highly prone to accidents. wat next in the coming year 2002: devise more dangerous stunts? do we hav to put a stop oni when someone gets hurt or killed?<br><br>is it not better to let the artistes do wat they do best, for eg. sings, perform some comedy acts, play stupid games etc. i have a fren who suggest that if its normal sing-n-dance, the show will lose its appeal and audience will donate less. i feel that as long as the show do not resemble CNY shows and incur the sianz factor, i tink the audience wont mind.<br><br>is daredevil acts necessary/ justified? wat do u tink? on the scale of 1 to 10, how necessary do u tink daredevil stunts r? 1 represents "stunts r irrelevant" and 10 represents "stuns r important" and 5 means "neutral, i dunno, dun ask me, i am just a singaporean".<br><br>i hope this thread is for mature opinions.<br>cheers,<br>dante,<br>count of monte cristo</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Trust me:<br>Most of these stunts are just flukes. I mean, I'm not those kind who likes to critisize at everything, but I seriously think these "stunts" are not as dangerous as they seems.<br>1) That drawing-out-the-sword-from-xie-shaoguang's-hand stunt. The blade is not sharp lar! Please lar! Anything a little flat and hard will be able to chop that radish into half lar! Even a thick piece of wood, or the back of a normal knife is sufficient to whack that radish into half! If they can demo tt the blade to be able to shred paper, then it's a different story....<br>2)That stoopid Zheng Guoping and Hong Huifang stunt. Ok, the stunt is fairly challenging, but c'mon lar! Must they put up such wayang after both of them emerge from water, as if they almost lost their lives? Don be stoopid lar! We viewers can see tt the sunt is not tt risky lar!<br>3)That stoopid wang deyuan. Got so painful or not? Must keep shouting "water!water!"? Hahahahaha!!!!!!!! So stoooopid!<br>4)Last time that Lin Minglun kiss cobra stunt. I bet with my next 1000 lives that the fangs of the snake were extracted beforehand!!! Even if we use our asshole to think, we'll know tt no f**king untrainned personnel will carry out such stunts lar! And to think TCS actually pann the camera onto the "in-case-of-emergency" ambulance and we saw the medics almost laughing out. Hahahahahaaaaaaa!!!!!!! I almost laugh my arse off in that Lin Minglun stunt! So stoooooooooopppppiiiiiddddd!!!! I still wanna luff. Hahahahahahaaaaa!!!!!!<br><br>There are more. But I just wish to say although the celebs are sincere, they do not have to put up such flukes, right?<br>But I have to admit that they really gave their best lor.<br>Hmmm.... overall, their effort is commendable.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Even though I agree that the stunts are not necessary, I have to say that they do help in getting the donations in. The stunts set a platform for more effective donation solicitings. Eg, "see, xxx actor so cham...please donate 1900-xxx-xxxx!" This is something not achievable with the normal sing and dance. But all said and done, I do believe most of the stunts are "staged" and danger to the artistes is basically nil. Look at the Tay Ping Hui-drives-through-3-girls routine. Any ah niaow or ah kow can tell that's fake!<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>

Notice that a container truck (prime mover) does not have normal wheels like other cars. Instead, there are always 2 wheels for each wheel location. This creates a very small gap between the wheels. So technically, if you are able to squeeze into this groove, you should be fine.
