              <p>If you are seeking after true love and couldn't find it, that is because you do not have enough money to buy the true love that you seeked.</p>
              <p>If a guy possessed plenty of money and is considered as a high income earner by our income tax standards, then even if you are third-world ugly by world standards, you will still be acceptable to us, because we will choose to search for your cute side within your inner beauty and we will be able to live with it.</p>
              <p>If the same guy desired a family, it is easier for any girls to give him many children because we know he is financially stable and will be able to provide the best medical, hospital for us to do our regular checkups and feel safe to give birth without any worries of losing our jobs.</p>
              <p>The best perk of the deal is, we can transformed ourselves to become the best friends of your awful mother-in-laws and relative folks to save you from endless domestic issues in the future. Probably can also suffer in silence and be abused like cinderella if we choose turn one side to focus on all the golden jewelleries and diamond rings that you or we have adorned it upon ourselves.</p>
              <p>Not going to explain further on all the wonderful magic that money can do to boost a normal relationship Prince Charming into an ultra romantic relationship with Shrek. </p>
              <p>It's true that there are some things in this world that money can't buy, like health and immortality (building bronze scrulptures to immortalise yourself is not counted). But if you really have alot of money and extremely high earning powah, yes ... it is not a myth that money can buy you True Love.</p>
              <p>But if you are poor and you wished for True Love, then you need to become a really good person from the inside out and provide us with endless attention and loving care to make up for the failure to command a high income and absent of financial security.</p>
              <p>I know this post isn't perfect and I'm also not very happy at the moment. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>This is exactly what my mum said. Words of widsom from parents.</p>
              <p>"Becareful ah. Mum is always looking out for your best interest. Woman can fake it.. fake it till the day after you are married then show thier true colours. Money will confuse you. Instead of loving you who you are, they are loving you for what you are. And that, is not true love. Its love for your money."</p>
              <p>Loving you for your money, and loving you for your ability to make money is different also.</p>
              <p>Money.. hence.. is a problem of its own. Those of us with money, will find that those without the financial capabilities like us is better off then us in many other ways imaginable.</p>
              <p>Makes me wonder, all those girls. I guess I kinda realised, but just subconsciously shut myself from the truth. The reality. But damn can some of them be persistent. Unless they find another big fish to hook on, they tend to no let u go so easily.</p>

              <p>How cynical....</p>
              <p>Love is defined as: a strong positive emotion of regard and affection</p>
              <p>So you mean if I gave you some money you'll start feeling a strong positive emotion towards me? Maybe women can fake happiness, etc, but do you think they'll truly feel like that?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>True love is defined as: when you would give up your whole world, give up your life, your everything just to make sure that person you love is ok.</p>
              <p>If you don't know this...then maybe you've never truly loved someone before....</p>
              <p>Again....true love cannot be bought or faked.</p>

              <p>Love is defined as: a strong positive emotion of regard and affection</p>
              <p>So you mean if I gave you some money you'll start feeling a strong positive emotion towards me? Maybe women can fake happiness, etc, but do you think they'll truly feel like that?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>True love is defined as: when you would give up your whole world, give up your life, your everything just to make sure that person you love is ok.</p>
              <p>If you don't know this...then maybe you've never truly loved someone before....</p>
              <p>Again....true love cannot be bought or faked.</p>

              <p>I don't need you to explain to us the meaning of True Love and what people would do if they had found True Love, and I'm sure there are many people here who is capable of providing a better explaination than you.</p>

              <p>If you are seeking after true love and couldn't find it, that is because you do not have enough money to buy the true love that you seeked.</p>
              <p>If a guy possessed plenty of money and is considered as a high income earner by our income tax standards, then even if you are third-world ugly by world standards, you will still be acceptable to us, because we will choose to search for your cute side within your inner beauty and we will be able to live with it.</p>
              <p>If the same guy desired a family, it is easier for any girls to give him many children because we know he is financially stable and will be able to provide the best medical, hospital for us to do our regular checkups and feel safe to give birth without any worries of losing our jobs.</p>
              <p>The best perk of the deal is, we can transformed ourselves to become the best friends of your awful mother-in-laws and relative folks to save you from endless domestic issues in the future. Probably can also suffer in silence and be abused like cinderella if we choose turn one side to focus on all the golden jewelleries and diamond rings that you or we have adorned it upon ourselves.</p>
              <p>Not going to explain further on all the wonderful magic that money can do to boost a normal relationship Prince Charming into an ultra romantic relationship with Shrek. </p>
              <p>It's true that there are some things in this world that money can't buy, like health and immortality (building bronze scrulptures to immortalise yourself is not counted). But if you really have alot of money and extremely high earning powah, yes ... it is not a myth that money can buy you True Love.</p>
              <p>But if you are poor and you wished for True Love, then you need to become a really good person from the inside out and provide us with endless attention and loving care to make up for the failure to command a high income and absent of financial security.</p>

              <p>Even animals can express love, so what's is to stop me from talking about love in international context?</p>
              <p>Please break free from the narrow confines of your mind.</p>
              <p>By the way, may I remind you that this is a public forum where people are free to post their thoughts and opinions? If you can't take feedback, then I would advice you not to open a thread, or even post anything. Because not everyone would agree with your point of view.</p>
              <p>I don't wanna start a flame war again, so I will not argue with you anymore. You can be as cynical as you like. It's your life. But I hope you will come to realise that you'll only experience love when you give freely of yourself.</p>
