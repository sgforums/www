              <p>Sad as it may seems, but it is indeed true that the financial status of a man had an impact on his overall appeal to the opposite sex.</p>
              <p>And that is one of the reason why some woman cannot find a good enough man for themselves, cause relatively speaking, for every 1 guy who earn a “good enough income”, there’ll be much more guy who earn a normal or low income, and chances is, he’s already attached.</p>
              <p>Love is a basic, simple but powerful human emotion which is being make complicated by all the various man make factors.</p>
              <p>For those who actually questioned a guy’s or woman’s financial or watever status before committing to a relationship, in my view, he or she is actually treating that as a deal, which is similar to a negotiator weighting the long term pros and cons. In this expect, it is actually insulting to the notion of love and being loved. The person in question does not understand and therefore does not deserve to be loved in the first place.</p>
              <p>The reason why people love each other is simple, because they love each other, nothing much more matters.</p>
              <p>Nowadays not many ppl understand that, and they deserved to be single all their life.</p>
              </div>

              <p><br>What you have mentioned about love only applies if people have only one love in their lives and that love is not one-sided love.</p>
              <p>The guy with the higher earning powah can definitely provide/buy/afford more love to his woman, compared to the rest of the other lower income green-eyed monsters.</p>
              <p>Guys all want the same thing from Girls ... SEX, better SEX, more SEX, until we became their SEX Vending Machine. (SEX On-Demand)</p>
              <p>Guys won't love Girls because they really want them to be happy. And I also haven't mention the words sincerely or genuinely or truly want them to be happy, because I know it's just BS, BS and more BS.</p>
              <p>If Guys tell Girls that they like them for who they are, it means that the Guy had some kind of kinky fantasies that he would like to fulfill with that Girl.</p>
              <p>It's like ... I like you because you're smart, most probably just want you to suck his cock and allow him to spray over your face and on your spectacles or your breasts.</p>
              <p>It's like ... I like you because you're cool, most probably just want to have prolong sex with you to fulfill his hot and sweaty sexual fantasies with your screams of orgasm in the background. Mind you! It's not screams of orgasm, they are potential screams of torture and agony!!</p>
              <p>It's like ... I like you because you're pretty, most probably just want have sex with you for as long as he still finds you pretty enough to have sex.</p>
              <p>It's like ... I like you because you're tall, most probably had some kind of model/elder sister fantasies and probably really have an elder sister at home. EPIC FAILURE.</p>
              <p>It's like ... I like you because you're mature, most probably had some kind of auntie/mother fantasies and probably idolised or really have an attractive auntie/mother or know some attractive auntie/mother.</p>
              <p>And the list goes on and on ......</p>
              <p>But this shows that Guys are all the same, deep down and under, they are all the same weak, lustful, boastful and arrogant creatures ... and they want us to have their babies!! (Pray that I have more daughters in the future than sons)</p>
              <p>So knowing what we girls can offer to these pathetic creatures, why can't we measure them based on their earning powah, looks, family background and other special features, for us to feel better to live with our best choice among all the choices that we can afford to have?</p>
              <p>True love is when a woman is willing to bear a child of the man that she marries.</p>
              <p>How not true can our love be if we are willing to bear the child of the man that we are going to marry?</p>
              <p>Guys will never think about that point because they assumed that it is normal for Girls to bear their child and also because they are used to take us for granted all the time.</p>
              <p>Equality and True Love are something that Guys or Men will NEVER be able to provide for us. Respect your wife/gf, Love your wife/gf, Care and Honour your wife/gf, they can say YES to everything but don't do it at all. Just keep providing sweet words and promises and give free lip service for eternity.</p>
              <p>Don't believe me? Ask your man what is True Love and what is his True Love to you and you will see his mind goes blank instantly through his eyes. Either way, or he can only give you model answers from textbooks or fiction examples from movies script and storybooks that he read when he was young. But he can NEVER give you a real example from the relationship journey that you had enjoyed together with him.</p>
              <p>So if he ends up telling you about the items that he had showered upon you as his evidence of his True Love towards you, how wrong can it be for us to believe that True Love is indeed built upon on a foundation of money?  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Green-eyed Monsters who have no ability to earn more or increase their earning powah, should go ebay and auction a PRC/Viet-Con wife for themselves.</p>
              <p>Because these å†œåŒ… girls are just the types of real-life sex mannequins that are unable to persuade our åŸŽå¸‚åœŸåŒ… Singaporean males to give them the love that they deserves as a female.</p>

              <p><br>It is true that most guys only want sex from girls utimately in the end, and that motive is the engine which drives them to say all sort of nice things, showering care and concern, to that particular lady.</p>
              <p>Given this situtation, you may argue why is it wrong for a girl to judge a guy by his financial status since he himself is also judging his would be gf by her looks, body shape, and other features that satisfy his inner fantasy. This is what is happening right now in the reality and this is sad. Therefore it is not wrong to say relationship nowadays is pretty much based on the financial status of the guy from the girl's perspective (so that he can provide all the financial security etc) and from the guy's perspective - the ability of the girl to provide quality sex and the ability to satisy his fantasy.</p>
              <p>But given this scenario, there is no true love that exist in the first place between either parties, you can say there's love (maybe) between them but it can never be true love. I myself have never been in a relationship before despite that i'm 25 this year, (yes you can laugh), but it's important to have faith in true love, and believe that it exists, somewhere, out there, and it is not based on money or sex or looks.</p>
              <p>We might be deceiving ourselves cause it might never exists, or it might have gone extinct in this modern fast paced society, but we should never give up believing in it.</p>

              <p>If i'm buying a product, i would look at its value, to see if it's worth my money and in what way is it superior than it's other brand and finally i would make the decision to buy it because i know that it provides more value than its counterparts. But you can't look for partner the same way as you're buying things in the fish market! lol</p>
              <p>Love is a basic and powerful human emotion that you'll feel when you have a crush on someone. You don't evaluate it, you don't analysis it, you don't even need to plan to love someone.</p>
              <p>Smart people tends to have difficulty gasping the true meaning of love, cause they basically think too much.</p>

              <p>Guys won't love Girls because they really want them to be happy.
              And I also haven't mention the words sincerely or genuinely or
              truly want them to be happy, because I know it's just BS, BS and
              more BS.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">The same could be said of girls. Most indicators of love points to self-interest. You are a prime example from your stand in this topic.</span></p>
              <p>If Guys tell Girls that they like them for who they are, it
              means that the Guy had some kind of kinky fantasies that he would
              like to fulfill with that Girl.</p>
              <p>It's like ... I like you because you're smart, most probably
              just want you to suck his cock and allow him to spray over your
              face and on your spectacles or your breasts.</p>
              <p>It's like ... I like you because you're cool, most probably just
              want to have prolong sex with you to fulfill his hot and sweaty
              sexual fantasies with your screams of orgasm in the background.
              Mind you! It's not screams of orgasm, they are potential screams of
              torture and agony!!</p>
              <p>It's like ... I like you because you're pretty, most probably
              just want have sex with you for as long as he still finds you
              pretty enough to have sex.</p>
              <p>It's like ... I like you because you're tall, most probably had
              some kind of model/elder sister fantasies and probably really have
              an elder sister at home. EPIC FAILURE.</p>
              <p>It's like ... I like you because you're mature, most probably
              had some kind of auntie/mother fantasies and probably idolised or
              really have an attractive auntie/mother or know some attractive
              auntie/mother.</p>
              <p>And the list goes on and on ......</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">These can also be a means to assure the girl. To make her feel feminine and desirable. </span></p>
              <p>But this shows that Guys are all the same, deep down and under,
              they are all the same weak, lustful, boastful and arrogant
              creatures ... and they want us to have their babies!! (Pray that I
              have more daughters in the future than sons)</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Boys and girls both have times of weakness. Both have pride. And both can be arrogant. The babies share both your genetic traits. </span></p>
              <p>So knowing what we girls can offer to these pathetic creatures,
              why can't we measure them based on their earning powah, looks,
              family background and other special features, for us to
              feel better to live with our best choice among all the
              choices that we can afford to have?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">So what exactly do you think a girl has to offer the guy? Only sex? Maybe then you will realise that guys DEFINATELY do not just want sex (both sexes have libido).  </span></p>
              <p>True love is when a woman is willing to bear a child of the man
              that she marries.</p>
              <p>How not true can our love be if we are willing to bear
              the child of the man that we are going to marry?</p>
              <p>Guys will never think about that point because they assumed that
              it is normal for Girls to bear their child and also because they
              are used to take us for granted all the time.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">True love is not the willingness to bear children. True love is enabling the dreams of the other. To improve the quality of life of the other. And as such true love is not the restraining, the possession nor is it a question of what he/she can offer. In your entire thread, you have suggestion that true love comes at a price; numbers and figures. That, to me represents an investment, a trade, mecenary exchange; definately not true love.</span></p>
              <p>Equality and True Love are something that Guys or Men
              will NEVER be able to provide for us. Respect your wife/gf, Love
              your wife/gf, Care and Honour your wife/gf, they can say YES to
              everything but don't do it at all. Just keep providing sweet words
              and promises and give free lip service for eternity.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Ask this question, can girls provide equality? Are girls really capable of true love? The trend seems to be that girls have more needs than guys. What do guys wan? To quote david chapelle, 3 things; food, sex, silence, Feed me, Fuck me, shut the fuck up. Pls notice that shut the fuck up in this case refers to the desirable attribute of ceasing the endless babbling and bombardment. What do women want? Almost evreything under the sun. And women somehow has the ability to coax men into making promises. Because our society still dictates that guys must chase girls.</span></p>
              <p>Don't believe me? Ask your man what is True Love and what is his
              True Love to you and you will see his mind goes blank instantly
              through his eyes. Either way, or he can only give you model answers
              from textbooks or fiction examples from movies script and
              storybooks that he read when he was young. But he can NEVER give
              you a real example from the relationship journey that you
              had enjoyed together with him.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Just say, I laughed with you, i cried with you. And this is what i wanna do with my life.</span></p>
              <p>So if he ends up telling you about the items that he had
              showered upon you as his evidence of his True Love towards you, how
              wrong can it be for us to believe that True Love is indeed built
              upon on a foundation of money?  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Green-eyed Monsters who have no ability to earn more or increase
              their earning powah, should go ebay and auction
              a PRC/Viet-Con wife for themselves.</p>
              <p>Because these å†œåŒ… girls are just the types of real-life sex

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><br>It is true that most guys only want sex from girls utimately in the end, and that motive is the engine which drives them to say all sort of nice things, showering care and concern, to that particular lady.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Given this situtation, you may argue why is it wrong for a girl to judge a guy by his financial status since he himself is also judging his would be gf by her looks, body shape, and other features that satisfy his inner fantasy. This is what is happening right now in the reality and this is sad. Therefore it is not wrong to say relationship nowadays is pretty much based on the financial status of the guy from the girl's perspective (so that he can provide all the financial security etc) and from the guy's perspective - the ability of the girl to provide quality sex and the ability to satisy his fantasy.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">But given this scenario, there is no true love that exist in the first place between either parties, you can say there's love (maybe) between them but it can never be true love. I myself have never been in a relationship before despite that i'm 25 this year, (yes you can laugh), but it's important to have faith in true love, and believe that it exists, somewhere, out there, and it is not based on money or sex or looks.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">We might be deceiving ourselves cause it might never exists, or it might have gone extinct in this modern fast paced society, but we should never give up believing in it.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Have faith, and you will find one.</p>
              <div><span style="color: #3366ff;">Sex is something. A form of showing affection (or carnal instinct for some). But a loving relationship is not just built on sex. Its about eabling the dreams of each other.</span></div>

              <p>If you haven't been in a relationship before, then I'm not surprised when you don't know what women can offer men other than just our body for sex alone. How old are you anyway??</p>
              <p>My goodness, you need True Love to enable your dreams. That is pathetic! And how can your True Love improve your quality of life? Please don't tell me it is done through sex and orgasm that I will be lifted into realm beyond my intense relieve.</p>
              <p>And you haven't share your perspective of True Love yet. Not confident enough to share your textbook answers or no experience to share at all?</p>
              <p>Yes, girls are capable of providing True Love and equality (giving in to you guys). Ask all girls and men who had been in a relationship before and they can give you the figures that you are after.</p>
              <p>You are welcome to sit and wait for girls to go after you. And there's nothing wrong with it. Nobody will tell you what you are doing is wrong. But if you do see the girl of your desire, I would also expect you to sit down and watch how she became the possession of another guy. Society does not dictates that Men must go after Women, but I believed this rule must be built into all Men cos no matter how they want to argue about it and whine like a kid and stomps on the ground with his tantrums, ultimately they will quietly do what they are supposed to do and obediently go after the girls of their dreams to become a hypocrite.</p>
              <p>I cried and laughed with Men who are more deserving of my time than you. That's what I would've told you if you knew me.</p>

              <p>Does Singapore has the most men globally? Do you even know your
              own kind and have the courage to speak the truth about them?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">What is the global mentality? Every area have different cultures and traditions. So kindly advise what is the global mentality that the majority of the global male population have. I know men, i do. Men can be quite a handful and so can women. Both women and men have dirt on them.</span></p>
              <p>Wrong if you think the purpose of my topic is to condemn men.
              Why do I need men who have high earning powah? Men who doesn't get
              my point will never get the point of any females out there, they
              are just simply addressing my words for words.  Shame on them
              for the education they had received and poor comphrension.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">You explicitly stated den all men care about is sex. Why need men with high earning power? Because women need security and 1st and foremost financial security. It is a fact and i do not deny it. All i have been saying is that using money as the sole determinant of love is severely flawed and TOTALLY AGAINST THE COMMONLY ACCEPTED IDEA OF TRUE LOVE. </span></p>
              <p>Why do you think girls need men to make them look feminine and
              desirable? It's our nature to doll up and look our best, and it's
              for us to admire and not men to admire.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Everything happens for a purpose. And i think we can quite safely assume that there is a correlation between marriage and obesity/less efforts on dolling up. You are being delusional. Many women want to look good to attract men. Look up aunt agony and you will find some.</span></p>
              <p>Can I say the same for men? Men need girls for them to be manly,
              else they are a bunch of wussy, whiny ah-kuahs deep inside?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Actually, Men need to be manly because of women. Because our society still expects men to protect women. To give women the feeling of security. Its more of women need men to be manly rather than men need to be manly.</span></p>
              <p>If you haven't been in a relationship before, then I'm not
              surprised when you don't know what women can offer men other than
              just our body for sex alone. How old are you anyway??</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">I know women have much to offer. Please read my line on the previous post properly. The idea is to make you realise that men place value not only on the sex. Other attributes come in play as well</span></p>
              <p>My goodness, you need True Love to enable your dreams. That is
              pathetic! And how can your True Love improve your quality of life?
              Please don't tell me it is done through sex and orgasm that I will
              be lifted into realm beyond my intense relieve.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">My goodness. I said true love is the enabling the dreams of the other. Not you need true love to enable your dreams. Why did i say so. Because in a relationship, things becomes complex. And the union needs to move in tandem to achive. Things like support, encouragement, understanding, not being wilful comes into play. </span></p>
              <p>And you haven't share your perspective of True Love yet. Not
              confident enough to share your textbook answers or no experience to
              share at all?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Already posted in the previous post. definately not textbook. From experience.</span></p>
              <p>Yes, girls are capable of providing True Love and equality
              (giving in to you guys). Ask all girls and men who had been in a
              relationship before and they can give you the figures that you are
              after.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Yes guys are capable of providing true love too. Satisfying the girl is one, taking care of her emotions another. Men do give in too. Please dont be so narrow minded.</span></p>
              <p>You are welcome to sit and wait for girls to go after you. And
              there's nothing wrong with it. Nobody will tell you what you are
              doing is wrong. But if you do see the girl of your desire, I would
              also expect you to sit down and watch how she became the possession
              of another guy. Society does not dictates that Men must go after
              Women, but I believed this rule must be built into all Men cos no
              matter how they want to argue about it and whine like a kid and
              stomps on the ground with his tantrums, ultimately they will
              quietly do what they are supposed to do and obediently go after the
              girls of their dreams to become a hypocrite.</p>
              <p>I cried and laughed with Men who are more deserving of my time
              than you. That's what I would've told you if you knew me.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Indeed we are both unworthy of each other. As i pointed out before, my ideas and criteria is totally different from yours. And the point is that the general expectation of the population is that a guy should chase a girl. And that in itself represents an effort, a sacrifice. It is simply used to illustrate why men make more promises to girls.</span></p>

              <p>anyway, my experiences with love is that money cannot be a true love foundation, even if it does, it is only on a temporary basis, I have seen poor loving couples enjoying love more than rich people.  For true love, that should not be any string atttached. And funny how, true love alway appear when you are least aware of it.</p>

              <p>Omg.... why not go back to who created this thing called money ? Before money was created, love already existed. So this whole thread is fail. Once again i say, personal experience, opinions affects your judgement. Really too bad... Perhaps Ts you can go on a holiday to the more simplier countries where the people have no money however they   are living in bliss</p>

              <p>If you are seeking after true love and couldn't find it, that is
              because you do not have enough money to buy the true love that you
              seeked.</p>
              <p>If a guy possessed plenty of money and is considered as a high
              income earner by our income tax standards, then even if you are
              third-world ugly by world standards, you will still be acceptable
              to us, because we will choose to search for your cute
              side within your inner beauty and we will be able to live with
              it.</p>
              <p>If the same guy desired a family, it is easier for any girls to
              give him many children because we know he is financially
              stable and will be able to provide the best medical, hospital for
              us to do our regular checkups and feel safe to give birth without
              any worries of losing our jobs.</p>
              <p>The best perk of the deal is, we can transformed ourselves to
              become the best friends of your awful mother-in-laws and relative
              folks to save you from endless domestic issues in the future.
              Probably can also suffer in silence and be abused like cinderella
              if we choose turn one side to focus on all the golden jewelleries
              and diamond rings that you or we have adorned it upon
              ourselves.</p>
              <p>Not going to explain further on all the wonderful magic that
              money can do to boost a normal relationship Prince
              Charming into an ultra romantic relationship with
              Shrek. </p>
              <p>It's true that there are some things in this world that money
              can't buy, like health and immortality (building bronze scrulptures
              to immortalise yourself is not counted). But if you really have
              alot of money and extremely high earning powah, yes ... it is not a
              myth that money can buy you True Love.</p>
              <p>But if you are poor and you wished for True Love, then you need
              to become a really good person from the inside out and provide us
              with endless attention and loving care to make up for the failure
              to command a high income and absent of financial security.</p>
              <p>I know this post isn't perfect and I'm also not very happy at
              the moment. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
