              <p><br>If you claimed your first relationship was True Love, then can you tell us what happened to your True Love now?</p>
              <p>I'm sure if you had alot of money during your first relationship, it could already be your last relationship by now. </p>
              <p>Why do you think the beauty of True Love is tarnished with the introduction of MONEY?</p>
              <p>That's where the problem lies, too much textbook answers and disneyland cartoons had brainwashed many of you.</p>
              <p>True Love will become eternal with the money. </p>
              <p>Love cannot survive alone with bread and water. There is alot of truth in this sentence. </p>

              <p><br>Why do you think people will be separated if they realised money is important to find True Love for themselves?</p>
              <p>The problem lies with people with the incorrect thinking that True Love is free and True Love is only exclusive to one person or an individual. And once you loses that one person or individual whom you think you are having True Love with, you also loses that opportunity to have anymore True Love in the future. That is wrong if people are still holding onto ideal/textbook/model thoughts like that.</p>
              <p>Keep holding onto your outdated thoughts about True Love, and don't push the blame onto the society if you are the person who cannot keep up with the society with your outdated values of True Love.</p>

              <p>And the list goes on.</p>
              <p>What is certain is that everyone is definitely hoping for true love,  that is one of the reasons why love stories/movies always gain popularity among  the audience, cause people want to watch the thing that they're craving for in real life, even though they might not have it at that point of time, they dream of it, they hope they'll be the lucky one who meet their true love. And you parnie is definitely one of them. Even though you keep insisting otherwise. You are also hoping that you can met someone who doesnt want your body or watever else, but for who you really are.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you are not aware of this consciously, but the existence of this tread, with your extreme view, will naturally invite some guys like us who will tell you that no! true love is not based on money, and will counter your extreme thoughts and maybe you'll derive some pleasure out of it. Perhaps you want people to tell you that true love is not based on money?</p>
              <p>Just like some lady who keep telling people she's ugly, all the while hoping ppl will tell her: "no la, where got, still look pretty mah! don't think this way la! see, that guy is looking at you now!" etc</p>
              <p>Hmm lastly, just a guess, i can be wrong, but are you age 28-32?</p>

              <p>Check with the common people, these people are probably the ones who does things like that often throughout your lives and boast too much over it. I don't waste my limited life and time to do stupid things like that.</p>
              <p>Aren't people complaining too much about not able to find love and questioning if they have found or how to identify true love?</p>
              <p>The Love that can survived till the end is True Love. The relationship that can outlast your limited time on Earth is True Love. The feelings that you had for each other that you can successfully pass it down to your future generations as an evidence of your love is True Love. The moment when you find that distance is no longer an issue between both of you, is True Love.</p>

              <p>You
              keep on saying true love, i really need to understand your view on true
              love, so whats the difference between true love and love. Does it mean
              you lose boyfriend A, boyfriend B will not be your true love anymore ? You mean you condemn a poor couple not having true love just because they have no/little money ?</p>

              <p>Just like some lady who keep telling people she's ugly, all the while hoping ppl will tell her: "no la, where got, still look pretty mah! don't think this way la! see, that guy is looking at you now!" etc</p>
              <p>Hmm lastly, just a guess, i can be wrong, but are you age 28-32?</p>
              </div>

              <p><br>I'm not that old age to be between 28-32!!! Don't be rude and put me in that age group.</p>
              <p>The True Love examples which you have mentioned are indeed Actions of True Love after they have found their True Love. Do take note of the before and after finding True Love. You are talking after the after part, which I agreed.</p>
              <p>My topic is for the part before you find True Love.</p>
              <p>I don't need to repeat myself and tell you that you are ready to provide and receive True Love if you have a strong foundation of money.</p>
              <p>Love itself is an invisible source of power, and only when you are in a relationship, then you will be able to identify if you are able and capable to provide love till the end.</p>
              <p>True Love is for people who are in a relationship to discover for themselves.</p>
              <p>And when money becomes the solution of the relationship and not the ongoing problem in the relationship, both parties in the relationship will be able to focus on loving each other and able to see themselves holding each other's wrinkled hands till the end of their lives.</p>
              <p>Why do you feel sad? You should be happy knowing that you are earning money not only for the sake of surviving, but also for the sake of your future love.</p>

              <p>Why people get separated ? Do i really need to explain out the over 9000 reasons ?</p>
              <p>You keep on saying true love, i really need to understand your view on true love, so whats the difference between true love and love. Does it mean you lose boyfriend A, boyfriend B will not be your true love anymore ? You mean you condemn a poor couple not having true love just because they have no/little money ?</p>
              <p>Okay, so you just said i was outdated. Then you fail to acknowledge that society has a impact on money. So whats the latest fashion ? </p>

              <p>Love and Marriage are totally different things though they are linked. For marriage, you look at your 'future' spouse in the eyes  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>

              <p>What i meant is, being poor or rich depends on people's definitions. Earning 2k may be considered rich for some, enough for some, poor for some. Thats my point. Of course poor people have true love also (this era).</p>

              <p>What i meant is, being poor or rich depends on people's definitions. Earning 2k may be considered rich for some, enough for some, poor for some. Thats my point. Of course poor people have true love also (this era).</p>
              <p>Then again you can continue to troll or flame just to get the advantage. I dont mind. I doubt theres anyone else here in sg forums that has the interest to continue this debate with you.</p>

              <p><br>If you don't even bother to read what I have posted, then how could you possibly know my stance in this topic, then how can you be so confident that I'm trolling/flaming in my own topic?</p>
              <p>Are majority of the poor couple/people blessed with true love? I can accept if you tell me the majority of the poor couple/people that you have come across and known personally, were blessed with true love.</p>
              <p>It's not a debate afterall, it's a clear fact of sharing the truth at the risks of destroying many individual dreams about true love and also neccessary to protect myself from the consequences of what I have posted.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The simple fact is, if you do not wish to look from my perspective, then of course I won't allow myself to fall into the trap created from your perspective.</p>
              <p>Afterall, it's not fair for you to force me into your perspective when you do not wish to look from my perspective. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>I did read your post btw, in fact everyone did. I dint start posting at page 4, in fact i started at page 1. It was only a simple question to the whole of your arguments.</p>
              <p>And also it brings to my previous post of importance of money. Sure money is important, but how important seperates people. People can be contented with 2k salary, while some no. Sure 3k beats 2k, but you wont die even you have 2k. Living within your means and be contented is the key.I have no idea  the people/couples that you come across are rich or poor. But since you asked about my view, i will say yes i have come across people ''poor'' but living in content. Of course the opposite exist as well.</p>
              <p>Like i said, it was a debate, but if you insist your theory being the truth, thats also fine.</p>
