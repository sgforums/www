              <p>i do not know the whole issue</p>
              <p>but simply my dua sen thoughts, if true love is based on money
              foundation, problems over money is going to start surfacing once e
              couple starts forming a family especially.</p>

              <p>Actually the direction that you are approaching this is wrong. Since forming a family requires more than purely love, you need some money to buy a house/have babies, buy your furniture, plan your wedding etc.</p>
              <p>However like i said, it is how big money is to the person itself. So moral of the story is, be contented.</p>
