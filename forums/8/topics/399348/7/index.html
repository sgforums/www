              <p>Tell me why do you imagine a rich person can suddenly be poor in
              the future?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is this the common wish that poor people has for the rich
              nowadays?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">why would i wanna curse the rich people, but u will never know if they being made bankrupt for some reasons. economy crisis(lost everything in one shot if ur unlucky), companies fold due to bad business, losing everything in stock market because he's greedy many many reasons.</span></p>
              <p>The fact is, if poor people have the need to curse rich people
              to become poor, then maybe these green-eyed monsters need to wish
              other people better in order for them to get more blessings in
              their lives.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You want my answer? I will give you my answer. The fact is that
              I will do my best to support my husband, family and loved ones if
              that really happens in the future.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">i believe u would, but what if your support never changes anything?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How about you? Will your future girlfriend or wife leaves you
              because you have lost your job due to retrenchment or being made
              redundant in the workforce when you are over 40+ years old in
              Singapore? What will you do then? How do you plan to substain true
              love when you can hardly maintain the living costs to keep your
              family fed and alive?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">That's y i need a supportive wife like you. i dun only think with my little brain down there, i also use my big brain up there to think as well..</span></p>

I am caring, but not as handsome as Guy A. So what is better now ? If you are comparing about looks do you look at caring ? When you look at caring, so you mean looks doesnt matter ? So who is better now ? Guy A or Me. </p>

              <p>How many guys out there are NOT capable of caring?</p>
              <p>Too much and too many unwanted caring is what you guys like to do the best to irritate the hell out of us and terrorised us with your so-called "love".</p>

              <p>Its okay, i wasnt expecting any clever responses anyway. And i was right.  I no longer wish to waste my time on this, The clothes may be different, the actors may be more complex, the

              a tad different, but in the end it's all just the same play.</p>
