              <p><br>Opinions are always biased whether you like it or not.</p>
              <p>It takes more than just courage to share your own personal but biased opinions to many people, you will need to have your own opinion first before you can decide whether or not to share them out.</p>
              <p>It's easy to become a saint and put on your righteous mask and tell yourself that you know this is biased and the public is not going to accept it and you should be the person to shoot it down and gain some righteous points for your own reputation/image.</p>
              <p>Yes, exploit on what I have shared if that's what you would like to do or have been feeding on such opportunities throughout your lives.</p>
              <p>But ... one day if you decide not to be such a person, do feel free to share your real opinions of what you feel towards the topic.</p>
              <p>Just don't expect me to believe your righteous mask like everyone else, cos it just won't work on me when I can see through it.</p>

              <p>Actually no need courage to share opinions. i just need an internet connection and an interface can oredi. also when i type what people see as saintly rightseous actually i don;t mean it, what i type are typcially the underlying truth which they outwarddly show. one day when i have more important things to do than typing on a keyboard that always spoilt not working i will not bother to even share anything at all. it wasn't a mask i wearing, its me. the last statement about you not having any flaws why that's the truth. in fact i am trying to start a flaming session because in the wee hours of morning nothing better to do not replies yet from those guys with cammella and mollers email so i try working my things here  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>character is one thing but actually its good to have your friend happy go lucky attitude, take things as it comes. but who knows marriage is not only 2 person's affair but rather some say its between two families. there may also be lots of problem at your friend's marriage just maybe people don;t see it outwardly. but maybe like what you wrong its happy go lucky, even if it means having to die just to make things work he will treat it like destiny.</p>
              <p>really if roti prata and guccess bags are what they fancy probably outwardly modern but inside they just know to get a man, married not knowing what true love and happiness is. Humans smart evolved and intellegent as we seems are actually no better than part of life on earth.</p>

              <p>Yes, opinions like assholes, everyones got one.</p>
              <p>If you dont think so, bravo to you.</p>
              <p>Of course money is just one of the factor. But the main point is, money as cushion to a marriage. You think you will be happy ? Or the wife equally as happy ? Come on. We are wealthy but we are not blind and stupid. They may be able to fool alot but not some.</p>
              <p>We are moving towards an age where marriage is no longer sacred. Its more like a convenience. Driven by the materialistic ways. Many many factors involve this whole misconception of $$$$. Maybe to those with no money, they want it so bad they will sacrifice thier own principals. To be with a scum sucking maggot with money of course. Its like moving from a big fish to a bigger fish. All these girls are doing it. But if that is what they think it is, they will lose out in the long run.</p>
              <p>Because, the baby factory will keep churning out hotter, younger more sexuallly predatous then the previous. You just cannot compete and compare. But of course, women like those may  not even be able to think so far. Even if they did, they can only follow the money. </p>
              <p>I mean all these damands . But what do we get ? Seriously. Sex ?  Thats it ? LoL! I can get sex anytime anywhere I want. With money everything is possible. The only thing not possible is to buy those of strong willed in thier principals.</p>
              <p>Why her ? What does she have ? If that is true love, that is NOT the love I want. I rather she love me who I am and not what I am. Too easy for what I am, but the questions is who you are.</p>
              <p>We are witnessing gender issues. The so called equality of inequality. I am keeping my fingers crossed. And see what the future brings to those in this thread that really think highly of money in regards to love and marraige.</p>
              <p>Their story, will be a lesson to us all.</p>

              <p>I have ONE question for guys who believe girls should like them for who they are and not what they can offer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If she must likes you for for who you are, then WHY/WHAT makes you think you are better than her ex-bfs and past relationships?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>People always compares, and you can say the same to compare your potential girls with all your ex-gfs and past relationships.</p>
              <p>However, do not forget the rule of relationship is that you must fall in love with us first before we do. Because girls who falls in love with guys first are usually thought of as sluts and are probably after them with ulterior motive. Besides for that to happen, you must be really really really good and that's not possible. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Girls may not even like you even if you had shitload of money to offer them. Ready for True Love doesn't means you will find True Love.</p>

              <p>One needs to plan early and have a system/way/method of generating cash even without being employed by others.</p>
              <p>1) Buy cash generating assets like dividend stocks or rental property<br>2) Have a skill to help you earn even without a job<br>3) Spend less than you earn<br><br>Doing the above consistently, and one will be rather worry free by 30 yrs old.</p>

              <p>I saw this write up in the chinese newspapers a few weeks back - somebody was reading the papers in the MRT and I happened to catch a few glimpse of the write up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Apparently, they did a survey showing 3 guys' pic to some girls and asked them to rate the guys based on their looks.  One was young and good looking, the second was older and average looking, the third was middle aged and not as good looking as the other 2.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As expected, the younger guy got a highest score out of 10, followed by the 2nd guy and then 3rd guy got the lowest score.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Here comes the interesting part.  The monthly salaries of these 3 guys were revealed to the girls again and they were asked to rate the guys again based on their looks. (if I could recall correctly, young guy - 2K salary, 2nd guy had 3-4K while the middle aged guy earned the highest at 7-8K).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The score for the 1st guy dropped slightly, while the 2nd and 3rd guy had a marked improvement in the second round of voting.</p>
              <p> </p>
