              <p><br>It's true that it is possible that your scenario will become a reality.</p>
              <p>I believed that all guys are capable of become that guy from Hell, regardless of his financial status, family background, upbringing, etc.</p>
              <p>And usually we will give preference to financially more capable guys. It's similar to the scenario that most people will also advise their daughters to pick the richer/capable guy for marriage.</p>
              <p>It's a risk for all girls to take, and very often we ended up picking Wario instead of Mario. (Super Mario)</p>

              <p>By the way, may I remind you that this is a public forum where people are free to post their thoughts and opinions? If you can't take feedback, then I would advice you not to open a thread, or even post anything. Because not everyone would agree with your point of view.</p>
              <p>I don't wanna start a flame war again, so I will not argue with you anymore. You can be as cynical as you like. It's your life. But I hope you will come to realise that you'll only experience love when you give freely of yourself.</p>

              <p><br>but lust dun last, it will die away no sooner than later...relationship alway start with a BOOOM! and end with BONK!</p>
              <p>When u are in love, money is secondary, but as you begin to lost that love, money become primary, it switch here and there, depend on how your relationship goes about, but if there is no love, money also cannot do much. There are 3 things which i alway believe that money cannot buy, but unfortuntely, many people are unrealistic about it and thot that money can buy everything.</p>
              <p>1. Love</p>
              <p>2. Time</p>
              <p>3. Age (which can be the same as time, but i am indicating more on physical strenght and looks)</p>
              <p>Love Relationship alway start in 4 catergories</p>
              <p>1. the pink garden, where both are in 7 heaven, this happen when the relationship is new and fresh</p>
              <p>2. the knowning, where both side start to know each other better, the pros and cons of each other behavor and so on</p>
              <p>3. the storm, where they will be quarrelling, dissatisfaction , disagreement , money problem, etc etc</p>
              <p>4. the Normal, as the storm subsided, this part will determine if both of you can still go on with the relationship, if cannot, better leave now so as not to suffer more later, if can, both have to find the common understanding. It is a time for real man to woman talk, no money said no money, got money said got money type of talk</p>

              <p>If you are seeking after true love and couldn't find it, that is
              because you do not have enough money to buy the true love that you
              seeked.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Money grants you a ticket to the game.</span></p>
              <p>If a guy possessed plenty of money and is considered as a high
              income earner by our income tax standards, then even if you are
              third-world ugly by world standards, you will still be acceptable
              to us, because we will choose to search for your cute
              side within your inner beauty and we will be able to live with
              it.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Love for lease. NLLB, National Love leasing board, Lease time undefined, expected maximum lease (82-21 = 61) Formula: life expectancy for girls(82) minus Legal age for adulthood(21).</span></p>
              <p>If the same guy desired a family, it is easier for any girls to
              give him many children because we know he is financially
              stable and will be able to provide the best medical, hospital for
              us to do our regular checkups and feel safe to give birth without
              any worries of losing our jobs.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">It would be worth noting that the children belongs to both of you. This section shows that for all the talk of equality, Guys are still expected to shoulder the responsibilities of providing for the girl. </span></p>
              <p>The best perk of the deal is, we can transformed ourselves to
              become the best friends of your awful mother-in-laws and relative
              folks to save you from endless domestic issues in the future.
              Probably can also suffer in silence and be abused like cinderella
              if we choose turn one side to focus on all the golden jewelleries
              and diamond rings that you or we have adorned it upon
              ourselves.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Bad in-laws can come from both sides of the family. Do you mean by paid to entertain in the 1st part? And paid to endure in the 2nd?</span></p>
              <p>Not going to explain further on all the wonderful magic that
              money can do to boost a normal relationship Prince
              Charming into an ultra romantic relationship with
              Shrek. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Indeed, Financial security has always been and always will be on top of most girl's criteria.</span></p>
              <p>It's true that there are some things in this world that money
              can't buy, like health and immortality (building bronze scrulptures
              to immortalise yourself is not counted). But if you really have
              alot of money and extremely high earning powah, yes ... it is not a
              myth that money can buy you True Love.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Love for hire. When the world comes crushing down, its another story altogether.</span></p>
              <p>But if you are poor and you wished for True Love, then you need
              to become a really good person from the inside out and provide us
              with endless attention and loving care to make up for the failure
              to command a high income and absent of financial security.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">I concur. Its quite truth that to appeal to a girl, much effort is needed. </span></p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">True love is not defined on money, nor the ability to earn. A relationship works because of a myriad of factors.Most people wont even come close to true love, let alone live in it. Because the most commonly accepted idea of true love is something intangible. But when people go looking for love, what we are looking for is something very tangible.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> The questions are: What ais the criteria for your significant other? What are the indicators of love? Most of these actually stem from self-love. People are looking after their self-interest. Lets give some simple examples.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Money, status, power:<span style="white-space:pre"> </span>self-interest</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Be good to me, my family, friends etc.:<span style="white-space:pre"> </span>self-interest</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Healthy:<span style="white-space:pre"> </span>self-interest (so as not to be a burden and can share your burden)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Make me happy:<span style="white-space:pre"> </span>self-interest</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Some people might say they don't have have much expectations. But there is always a bottomline. Anywhere below it, you will not even be considered (Sort of like cut-off point huh). </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Some people would say they want to get married because of true love, which is good. Because it represents the union of the soul(beliefs), brain(expectations), heart(love) and the body(needs). The idea of marriage was never about love. Marriage is a social issue, a legal issue and political issue. And If you are in love to get married, logically, marriage will be the grave of love.</p>

              <p><br> but lust dun last, it will die away no sooner than
              later...relationship alway start with a BOOOM! and end with
              BONK!</p>
              <p>When u are in love, money is secondary, but as you begin to lost
              that love, money become primary, it switch here and there, depend
              on how your relationship goes about, but if there is no love, money
              also cannot do much. There are 3 things which i alway believe
              that money cannot buy, but unfortuntely, many people are
              unrealistic about it and thot that money can buy everything.</p>
              <p>1. Love</p>
              <p>2. Time</p>
              <p>3. Age (which can be the same as time, but i am indicating more
              on physical strenght and looks)</p>
              <p>Love Relationship alway start in 4 catergories</p>
              <p>1. the pink garden, where both are in 7 heaven, this happen when
              the relationship is new and fresh</p>
              <p>2. the knowning, where both side start to know each other
              better, the pros and cons of each other behavor and so on</p>
              <p>3. the storm, where they will be quarrelling, dissatisfaction ,
              disagreement , money problem, etc etc</p>
              <p>4. the Normal, as the storm subsided, this part will determine
              if both of you can still go on with the relationship, if cannot,
              better leave now so as not to suffer more later, if can, both have
              to find the common understanding. It is a time for real man to
              woman talk, no money said no money, got money said got money type
              of talk</p>

              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"> True love is not defined on money, nor the ability to earn. A
              relationship works because of a myriad of factors.Most people wont
              even come close to true love, let alone live in it. Because the
              most commonly accepted idea of true love is something intangible.
              But when people go looking for love, what we are looking for is
              something very tangible.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"> The questions are: What ais the criteria for your significant
              other? What are the indicators of love? Most of these actually stem
              from self-love. People are looking after their self-interest. Lets
              give some simple examples.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Money, status, power: self-interest</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Be good to me, my family, friends etc.: self-interest</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Healthy: self-interest (so as not to be a burden and can share your
              burden)</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Make me happy: self-interest</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Some people might say they don't have have much expectations. But
              there is always a bottomline. Anywhere below it, you will not even
              be considered (Sort of like cut-off point huh). </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Some people would say they want to get married because of true
              love, which is good. Because it represents the union of the
              soul(beliefs), brain(expectations), heart(love) and the
              body(needs). The idea of marriage was never about love. Marriage is
              a social issue, a legal issue and political issue. And If you are
              in love to get married, logically, marriage will be the grave of
              love.</p>

              <p>Not bad, i agree. for once there are people really posting good post. Love is the combination of chemicals which give us pleasure.<br> This is because the Brain is just the most complex chemistry lab in the universe.<br> But like every substance, there is an overdose, and it's
              side-effects.This is why feelings wane-out with time, you get used to the one your with.This is why people
              struggle to keep their relationships interesting.Because their brain is
              telling them to find someone else, while the church and the social
              order implies that we should have 1 life partner. </p>

              Sad as it may seems, but it is indeed true that the financial status of a man had an impact on his overall appeal to the opposite sex.
              
              And that is one of the reason why some woman cannot find a good enough man for themselves, cause relatively speaking, for every 1 guy who earn a "good enough income", there'll be much more guy who earn a normal or low income, and chances is, he's already attached. 
              
              Love is a basic, simple but powerful human emotion which is being make complicated by all the various man make factors.
              
              For those who actually questioned a guy's or woman's financial or watever status before committing to a relationship, in my view, he or she is actually treating that as a deal, which is similar to a negotiator weighting the long term pros and cons. In this expect, it is actually insulting to the notion of love and being loved. The person in question does not understand and therefore does not deserve to be loved in the first place.
              
              The reason why people love each other is simple, because they love each other, nothing much more matters. 
              
              Nowadays not many ppl understand that, and they deserved to be single all their life.

              <p>It is true to money cannot buy everything but without money it
              is not easy to survive.  While there are many girls who look
              for money-filled boyfriends, there are even more out girls who
              wanted a caring and loving husband / boyfriend who is also
              hardworking and smart.  A guy may be poor or just average in
              income when he started working.  But with hardwork, positive
              attitude, good character and the right values and proper guidance,
              he can succeed in anything he do.</p>
              <p>There are businesses that can make a person very successful both
              in physical, mental and emotional terms, as well as to develop the
              right values and attitude, and hence confidence.</p>
              <p>Interested to know more?</p>

              <p>Your analogy suggests some investing, speculative part in the selection criteria of girls. Something like "Hey this guy have the potential to be better, lets hop on". Which still points back to Vitamin M. I fail to see how true love applies.</p>

              <p>If you ask guys, girls are more than capable of drastic changes. At 20, Sweet and cute,<br>at 25, matured and understanding, supportive, at 30, control freak side shows, might show symptoms of a shrew, highly stressful period, at 35, Insecurity intensifies, start questioning your every move, expect pressure from her allies, at 50, meonpause, emotional maintenance at its peak, at 60, wants to enjoy life, so be prepared to spend on her.</p>
              <p>See, girls are unstable too!</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Sad as it may seems, but it is indeed true that the financial status of a man had an impact on his overall appeal to the opposite sex.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">And that is one of the reason why some woman cannot find a good enough man for themselves, cause relatively speaking, for every 1 guy who earn a “good enough income”, there’ll be much more guy who earn a normal or low income, and chances is, he’s already attached.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Love is a basic, simple but powerful human emotion which is being make complicated by all the various man make factors.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">For those who actually questioned a guy’s or woman’s financial or watever status before committing to a relationship, in my view, he or she is actually treating that as a deal, which is similar to a negotiator weighting the long term pros and cons. In this expect, it is actually insulting to the notion of love and being loved. The person in question does not understand and therefore does not deserve to be loved in the first place.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The reason why people love each other is simple, because they love each other, nothing much more matters.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Nowadays not many ppl understand that, and they deserved to be single all their life.</p>

              <p> Actually, the reason some girls cannot find men is that they price themselves out of the market. In practice, dating is actually a form of negotiation. While love might grow/come out from dating, more often than not, people are looking for "does it fit". </p>
