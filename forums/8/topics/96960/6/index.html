Of course there are no demographic information with regard to their qualifications.<br><br>FYI, I am married.  I remember I use to ask my wife y did she choose to married me... since I was earning a measely sum of only 1.1k per month ( about 6 yrs ago)?

            <div class='col-md body'>I've heard from my single male friends about how disgusted they are with Singaporean girls these days because each time they meet them, the inevitable questions about jobs and the subsequent inference to the man's salary comes up very early and actually determines whether or not the girl stays interested in them at all.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Hearing what some of the ladies say in here sickens me to the pit of my stomach.  In a marriage, it's a partnership, not a free-loader situation where the lady just sits back and enjoys herself whilst her poor husband slaves away.  Unless the lady is handicapped or schizophrenic or unless she's blessed with a super duper rich husband and doesn't need to work, why isn't she thinking of rolling up her sleeves and chipping in with the family expenses by working hard too?  Sounds like a lot of Singaporean girls, especially the younger generation, just want to have a nice, easy lifestyle and be pampered and lazy whilst their poor boyfriends work their asses off.<br><br>Guys, choose your girl wisely.  There are lots of pretty, attractive, beautiful girls around but remember to look beneath all that make-up, all that nail polish and nice clothes and shoes because beauty does not last forever, however, a person's character you'd have to live with forever.  You might want a 'trophy' wife but realise that these girls come with a high 'maintenance fee'.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>I'm a local girl and seriously embarrassed by the materialistic thoughts of some of the girls here.  I don't call it love when you have to look at someone's payslip to determine if he's worth talking to or not.  Sounds pretty dense, lazy and pretty much like a leech, if you ask me.</div>
