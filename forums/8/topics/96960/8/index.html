            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to quote Charles Dickens...<br><br>Income $1 expenditure $0.95 result = happiness<br>Income $1 expenditure $1.05 result = misery<br><br>I guess like so many posters have already said, its about expectations.  to be fair, love needs a certain amount of "nourishment" bec we are still flesh and blood and we still do need to eat and have a roof over our head.<br><br>Yes a lot of relationships run into trouble and mostly from the beginning bec both parties have not communicated their expectations.  so Yes I like the fact that this thread is at least setting it straight for some of the girls and many of the guys.<br><br>As to whether you really need so much $$$ etc... its really down to what you want to do when you live together.  so you plan your life style round your income!  which charles dickens said so succinctly.<br><br>Personally I know of people who have millions and others who make afew hundred dollars a month.  the life style is totally different but honestly, for most people, a middle of the road life style is what suits them bec they may not have the opportunity or ability to make more $$ and many times to make $$ you have to work really hard and so sacrifice the life and love which is the subject of you wanting to make money in the first place.<br><br>If I may put a negative spin on this... Be realistic about your own limitations and plan your expectations and life round it and you will be less disappointed.<br></div>

There are in-laws to take care of, and children to support. All this needs money.<br><br>As a low-wage earner, the man has to accept that he cannot earn as much as his competitors. His would-be partner, however, has the choice to dump him for a better life. The temptation is always there, unless her love for him is like I'll-readily-give-up-one-kidney-to-save-you type.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A girl who loves you will love you anyway be it that you make $3.5 - $5 or even $6.5k... what is important is to get someone who has similar expectations as you, someone from similar background social economic.  otherwise, think about it, if your parents makes $2k and her parents makes $10k and all her/his life, they are used to different things... it would then be quite natural that the expectations be different!<br><br>my good friend's wife, she have always lived in a bunglow that is soooo big  your eyes will pop when you see it.  her class mates also lives in similar type of houses so did her husband.  so all her life she tot that everyone lives in nice big houses until the later part of her teen years that she realise that there are such things as HDBs.  so what can someone who makes $3.5 offer her???  is she more materialistic?? maybe perhaps who knows but I know that she is one really sweet person.<br><br>we are all different and have different up bringing and expectations.  If you can achieve it without having to steal and rob or to kill yourself working at the expense of living then go ahead.<br><br>happiness can come from earning a decent living and living within your means.  misery can come in earning $20k but you are working just to keep up with your spending habits so have to work such long hours that you kill yourself in the end. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

I'm earning $1.5k only, but I can still save and that makes a huge difference.<br><br>I also agree about the girl who lived in private estate all her life. I was a pampered little girl ever since I was born. No doubt I stay in HDB but it's the old kinda 5 room flat. I went to a neighbourhood school and only in pri 6 or so, did I realise that wow... i'm mighty lucky - not everyone has a mother who'll wait for them at home after school. my house was also one of the largest amongst my friends.<br>When I continued to a neighbourhood secondary school, I also realised how few people had the chance to learn music. my life has always been so cushioned.<br>then I went to poly and in my course there were all the rich rich people. what a stark contrast in lifestyles and attitudes.<br><br>If my BF does not get a degree, I may 1 day well be earning more than him, but he's all I want for my life and I sure as hell wouldn't mind. As long as he is decent and doesn't cheat on me, doesn't do crime, i'm happy. You don't find a guy who doesn't smoke, gamble or drink easily.</div>

If you can achieve it without having to steal and rob or to kill yourself working at the expense of living then go ahead.<br><br>happiness can come from earning a decent living and living within your means.  misery can come in earning $20k but you are working just to keep up with your spending habits so have to work such long hours that you kill yourself in the end. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>girls will love u no matter how much u earn but will she marry u n remain yr wife for the rest of her life??<br>that's a big question mark!!<br>Everyone love to be born with silver spoon but most of us aren't.<br>not everyone who is rich have high expectation....<br>what house can be so big that eyes can pop out, I been to istana countless of time n I don't think there is any house in spore that is on par with it.<br>not all ppl live in same environment.<br>maybe yr friend just live in her own world n space.<br></div>

Gee, I don't exactly call that love... that's more like prostitution in another sense.  It's the bartering of one's love (and body and whatever) in exchange for money and the lifestyle it affords.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  sick.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>well that's life!!!<br>Love cannot live on air!!<br>It oso need bread!!!<br></div>

But honestly how do you hope to live with someone whose point of reference is so different from yours?  I know of families where every sunday dinner consists of several large fresh abalons being served among other goodies.  every week!  many people only get to eat it once a year at chinese new year and its from a tin can!  so it just means that they are used to eating this thats all.  does that make them proud and ostentatious?? I dont think so, bec they enjoy eating what they eat and dont show off.<br><br>So what defines a person is not what he has in the bank but the the moral xter inside.  having said that, when it comes to dating and marriage its just different.  her expectations will naturally be different just as yours.  just bec by your background and experience and <strong>by choice </strong>you choose to have lower expectations doesnt automatically mean that anyone who expects more is materialistic etc... that is how they choose to live.<br><br>I choose to live simply and I want a simply family life with a simple woman.. its a choice.  what we cannot attain, no point getting worked up about it... let those who want and can attain, let them get it.<br><br>many studies have already shown that marriage of equals are more likely to be successful than of unequals.  Of cos they can work I am not denying that but it just mean that there is just that much more issues to work through.<br><br>Oh if you guys think that its easy to eat soft rice... think again.  the cost to you as a person is very high and often you will not like the end result of what you will become.</div>
