(Translated: You must earn at least $$$ or if not must have at least a degree or a job that translates into a good income ...  so what is a good income ? The sky's the limit)<br><br>Reality : Women (esp Sg women) marry for the size of the guy's wallet or the potential for a good income despite all their claims the contrary.<br><br>Situation: So what if a husband with a good income falls in bad times (eg. retrenched, hospitalised with bills etc).  Jump ship while you are young ? If you are not so young anymore, divorce your husband and use the woman's charter to sue him dry ?<br><br>I want to believe otherwise and think better of Sg women ... but stats don't lie<br><br></div>

Anything more is a bonus. If you set yourself an expectation, likelyhood you will miss out on opportunities and end up unhappy.</div>

In a marriage, it's a partnership, not a free-loader situation where the lady just sits back and enjoys herself whilst her poor husband slaves away.  Unless the lady is handicapped or schizophrenic or unless she's blessed with a super duper rich husband and doesn't need to work, why isn't she thinking of rolling up her sleeves and chipping in with the family expenses by working hard too?  Sounds like a lot of Singaporean girls, especially the younger generation, just want to have a nice, easy lifestyle and be pampered and lazy whilst their poor boyfriends work their asses off.<br><br>Guys, choose your girl wisely.  There are lots of pretty, attractive, beautiful girls around but remember to look beneath all that make-up, all that nail polish and nice clothes and shoes because beauty does not last forever, however, a person's character you'd have to live with forever.  You might want a 'trophy' wife but realise that these girls come with a high 'maintenance fee'.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>I'm a local girl and seriously embarrassed by the materialistic thoughts of some of the girls here.  I don't call it love when you have to look at someone's payslip to determine if he's worth talking to or not.
