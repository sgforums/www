In fact, you can survive if you make less than 1.5k a month. I have friends whose household's income is less than that, and they're not doing very poorly. You're talking about the degree of comfort here.<br><br>But personally, I want to marry a guy with a usefull degree. If you can find someone like that, it doesn't matter if they have a low pay now, because a degree will grant you greater stability. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> But I would definitely not want my husband to earn less than me. Not for materialistic means, but it would upset the family balance. It might lead to a lot of problems..</div></blockquote>ok cool, another person for me to exchange numbers with. you know how to PM rite?<br><br>i'm single, and i fit all the criteria so far in this thread!</div>
