            <div class='col-md body'>this has GOT to be an APRIL fool's Joke<br><br>APRIL 1, 2004<br><strong>Kudos for shake-up in the civil service</strong><br><br>MPs, businessmen and senior civil servants applaud self-examination by public sector workers and their remedies<br><br>By Eugene Low and M. Nirmala<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>IT WAS senior civil servants who took a look at themselves in the mirror and didn't like what they saw.<br></span><br><br>Staring back at them were three flaws they believed needed fixing.<br><br>There was a need to encourage risk-taking and embrace diversity, deepen their understanding of the market, and improve inter-ministry coordination.<br><br>The diagnosis of what was ailing the public sector, and the prescriptions, were made at a recent meeting of permanent secretaries, public service chiefs and statutory board chief executive officers. They came together to discuss how the sector should respond to changing circumstances.<br><br>Giving public voice to their ideas, Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean on Tuesday spoke about the need for the public service to be more proactive and dynamic.<br><br>Urging it to keep trying new ideas until these bear fruit, he told Administrative Service officers at their annual dinner that it was necessary to challenge the status quo continuously.<br><br>And yesterday, businessmen, MPs and some senior civil servants themselves applauded the new directions that the public sector was setting for itself.<br><br>There were<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> those among the interviewees who said it was high time that public servants left their fortresses, understand the ground better and designed policies that work as well as they look.</span><br><br>'There are risk-averse civil servants who do not know how the market works and are quick to say 'no' to new ideas,' observed Hong Leong Group executive chairman Kwek Leng Beng.<br><br>It was not unexpected then that a call put forward for consideration was that for a one-stop agency for businesses.<br><br>Mr Ron Sim, founder and chief executive of Osim, said that instead of having to deal with various ministries, there should be a centralised body that companies can contact. This will make dealings with the Government more straightforward.<br><br>Businessman and Ang Mo Kio GRC MP Inderjit Singh, a long-time champion of a more enterprise-friendly public sector, welcomed the move towards a less risk-averse culture in the civil service. But he said unless the reward and punishment system changes, there was 'little chance of this working out' because risk-taking also meant the possibility of failure.<br><br>Agreeing, a retired civil servant, who declined to be named, said: 'It's not that civil servants lack initiative, but that people are made to conform to the system. The end result is unimaginative civil servants.'<br><br>One problem is that change sometimes gets blocked at the top. A serving administrative officer, who asked not to be named, said yesterday that there were ministers who tended to be conservative.<br><br>'At times, civil servants are just second-guessing them. There have been instances where civil servants are ready to change existing policies but the ministers are not,' he said.<br><br>Hence it was significant that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rear-Admiral (NS) Teo himself acknowledged the inadequacy of the top-down approach. The fact that a ranking minister issued the call for change is 'a strong signal that the Government has recognised the problem'</span>, said Mr Leong Horn Kee, MP for Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC and chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee on Finance, Trade and Industry.<br><br>Businessmen also cheered the move to enhance inter-ministry coordination through the setting up of a Strategic Issues Group.<br><br>'Now, you get three or four agencies saying different things about the same issue, and it is the private sector that gets caught in the middle,' said a senior executive at a multinational corporation.<br><br>Out with the straitjacket way of tackling issues<br><br>WHEN a crisis breaks, ministries often work well together as a team. But during day-to-day operations, they tend to be over-compartmentalised and ignore multiple dimensions of issues.<br><br>One solution: get them to work more closely through a Strategic Issues Group (SIG). The group will encourage multi-agency cooperation by setting up specific teams to look at issues.<br><br>Announcing the move during the elite Administrative Service dinner on Tuesday, Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean said there were issues which may not come under the purview of a particular ministry, but whose solutions require a coordinated approach across many ministries.<br><br>'The purpose of the SIG is to free ourselves from the straitjacket of existing policies and departmental interests to develop fresh ideas,' he said.<br><br>Copyright @ 2004 Singapore Press Holdings.
