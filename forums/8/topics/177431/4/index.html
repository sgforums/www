You should read up <a href="http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/" rel="nofollow">http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/</a> check under Employment Act and Workmen Compensation Act.

Here are some basics you should know as a temp staff.<br><br>1.) <span style="color: red;">If you are a monthly paid worker, your maximum working hour per week is 44hrs. Anything beyond that, you are entitled to 1.5x basic hrly rate.</span><br>2.) Work on a public holiday or off day, you are entitled to 2x basic hrly rate of pay.<br><br>3.) You are entitled to 1 off day every work week.<br><br>4.) If you are a hrly paid worker, you too is entitled to 1.5x hr rate if you work beyond your scheduled hrs or over 44hrs in a week. ( this abit grey area, better to check with employer before starting work)<br><br>5.) All workers, including temp staff and part-timers ( except where the worker is a full time student in Sec sch or JC) are required to contribute to CPF.<br><br>There are many more information available, better to read up on the relevant Acts to protect yourself.</div></blockquote>thats the problem. initially, starting work very enthu one..everyday oso work OT..forget abt OT, one day i work 8 hrs..1 hr of break time means 7 hrs a day rite...1 wk is 7x7=49 hrs..<br><br>den 49 hrs minus 44 hrs..means i got 5 hrs OT pay...she nv give mi...argh.<br><br>are you sure is 44 hrs..she say 46 hrs..<br></div>

Note that CPF contribution comprises 2 parts. 20% is deducted from your gross by the employer, then the employer must then contribute another 16% out of their own pocket. Do check your account to ensure that such an amount is in already. If it is not, log a complain with CPF board.<br><br>Note that you can still complain to CPF board even after you quite your job, the same for a complain with MOM. Its still not too late.</div>
