            <div class='col-md body'>bet this topic will end up having a heated 1. anyway i think that women should also serve NS. It is not just the duty of the mento do it.<br><br>Then in the war how ? the women do what ? ( i ask this because i really dont know, not really to question women's place anyway) women have long since wanted equal rights, education, power, job and promotion opportunities in workplace and everywhere. if you say that women are generally weaker than men and so men shld go to wars and fight instead .<br><br>look at israel . it's not that the state laws decrees that women shld join army then they join. it's probably their culture. anyway the women could serve as medics, nurses support staff in NS. since they want equal rights , they shld also join NS like the men.<br><br>many times i have heard from women demanding equal rights but when it comes to serving ns, they shy from it and just say " oh it's the men's duty, let them do it. why shld we? "<br><br>rights like freedom do come with a price, in workplaces they cannot demand equal pay etc compared to a male counterpart when he has higher edu level, greater experience and is proven to have the abilities. similarly men cannot also demand when the women has higher edu level, experience,etc.<br><br>if u want something , fight for it. isnt that also taught to you by yr parents ?<br><br>it is not a matter of courtesy for men to do ns, unlike in a date where it's courtesy to pay for the meals,movies,etc and also to send yr date home. as for helping to carry things , it's also courtesy.<br><br>let it be clear that my views are regarding the topic and NOT abt women and also it is my two cents worth. i can be wrong and so pls correct me.</div>
