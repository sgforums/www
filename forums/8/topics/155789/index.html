All I can say is that American companies  controls the black gold known as oil and most MNCs are american. Doesn't matter how high your export is . Exporting , manufacturing need oil for transport , manufacturing machinery etc. American MNCs also outsource to china to manufacture goods -  but profits will land back into USA again . This is probably why their dollar is strong. When u see oil prices or dow jones drop , their dollar dip along with it - as with the most of the whole world cept for the european union .</div>

Thing is world bank , IMF have no control over uncle sam because of the oil involvement. Oil runs the industrial world - u need oil for cars/machinery/transportation which is indirectly linked to manufacturing , agricultural , transport , tourism (esp airlines)  industries which is linked to a country's economic progress. Why did you think USA waged war on iraq - it wasn't for bloody democracy - it was control of oil since iraq is one of the biggest source of black gold</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>not too sure if this is right, but...still. my theory ain't based on economics or anything ok, so just hear me out if you want.<br><br>the greenback remains so strong simply because it has to. it is the world's largest economy, and so, in a way, the whole world is built around them. should they collaspe, the will drag everyone down with them, as was evident during the post-911 period. so, should the greenback ever go, everyone looses and no one gains. because of that, everything has a set value range, thus factors such as currency pegs come into play. extreme measures like devaluation also come into play once in awhile to keep things in check. people always try to actively keep currencies in balance because it is less painful then the passive method.<br><br>go ahead and correct whatever's wrong, but from what i've observed, things seem to be happening that way. btw...i'm nothing near an economics or a finance student...i lean to the sciences.</div>
