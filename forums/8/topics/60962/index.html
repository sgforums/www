            <div class='col-md body'>by K.K. Cheow<br><br>Spurred on by ChinaÂ’s recent launch of an astronaut, Singapore is planning to put its own men into orbit.<br><br><img src="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/images/stories/sporespace.jpg"><br><br>This is necessary to maintain SingaporeÂ’s technological reputation in Asia, said <strong>Colonel Tai Kong Ren</strong>, the newly-appointed chief of the Relaunching Singapore Committee of the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star).<br><br>Â“Singapore cannot lag behind in technological achievement,Â” said Colonel Tai. Â“If we continue to just produce soundcards and have occasional success with separating conjoined twins, weÂ’ll totally lag behind. See, we donÂ’t pay attention for a few months and those cheenapiangs have already put a man in space.Â”<br><br>A*Star is providing government funding to Singapore Aeronautics (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Singapore Technologies) to devise an ambitious space programme for Singapore.<br><br>Â“Yes, we intend to put our own astronaut into space,Â” said Colonel Tai. Â“But weÂ’re not going to just copy the Chinese, who were copying the Soviets anyway. Rather, weÂ’ll probably copy the Americans.Â”<br><br>Colonel Tai said Singaporeans were uniquely suited to being space explorers.<br><strong><br>Â“Firstly, our education system has already been credited with producing a lot of space cadets,Â” he explained. Â“And also, thanks to Newater, our people are already psychologically prepared to consume their own waste, which they must do on long missions. Also, most Singaporeans already look down on our neighbours, so doing so from space is not a big change.Â”<br></strong><br>Colonel Tai said that putting a man into space was merely the spearhead of a more comprehensive space-related business initiative. Â“CanÂ’t you just see Singapore Airlines or NTUC running a line of commercial space shuttles to carry cargo or people at one third the time of conventional transport? We can also boost our flagging construction industry by building a space station, complete with food court.Â”<br><br>Colonel Tai dismissed all talk of the space programme as being an exercise to boost the ruling PeopleÂ’s Action PartyÂ’s popularity. <strong>Â“No, putting a Singaporean into a space suit is not just another attempt to have people hero worship a person dressed all in white.Â”<br></strong><br>Colonel Tai specifically dismissed speculations that DPM Lee Hsien Loong would be SingaporeÂ’s first man in space. Â“No, weÂ’re not sending the Son to the Moon.Â”<br><br>Â“Anyway, no need to send him up,Â” he added. Â“HeÂ’s already atas enough as it is.Â”<br><br>Singapore AeronauticsÂ’ first priority, it seems, is to find a cheaper alternative to expensive rocket fuel. Â“Right now, weÂ’re looking at the possibilities of natural gas-powered rockets, specifically durian,Â” said Colonel Tai.<br><br>A*Star is also providing scholarships for space-related subjects, like astrophysics. Students are already competing actively for them. Said Stamford Junior College student Chow Mah Ger, Â“Try-try, mah. I oreddy study until see stars, might as well go and see the real thing.Â”<br><br>Meanwhile Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan has been tasked with overseeing the redevelopment of Pulau Tekong into a space center, which he has already dubbed Â‘Spaceopolis.Â’<br><br>Some citizens have expressed concern about the, ahem, astronomical cost of the programme, and its viability. Said Bukit Gorblok resident Boh Looi Leow, Â“IÂ’m worried that this will be one big step for Singapore but an even bigger step for the taxpayers.Â”<br><br>Malaysia, however, has reacted coolly to SingaporeÂ’s space ambitions. Said Malaysian spokesman Datuk Kapal bin Angkasa, Â“Singaporean policies, as usual, are out of this world. <strong>They would rather cultivate relations with Martians rather than Malaysians. </strong>Tak apa, we in Malaysia will also embark on a space programme, which will be superior to SingaporeÂ’s. <strong>Instead of flying to the moon, we will fly to the sun!Â”</strong><br><br>Â© http://www.TalkingCock.com 2001-2003.
