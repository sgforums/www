Rarely can there have been a more fitting scorer.<br><br>For all United's superiority over the years, City fans have always clung steadfastly to the belief that they are the real Manchester club.<br><br>It didn't look like it this afternoon as manager Kevin Keegan named a side which didn't contain a single Englishman, let alone a Mancunian.<br><br>However, on days like this, it is the colour of the shirt, not the place of birth, which matters most.<br><br>And though the only English involvement in City's opener came through the underhit pass from Phil Neville which put Rio Ferdinand in trouble, the City faithful really didn't care.<br><br>Anelka dispossessed Ferdinand with ease, fed Goater to his left and, though the Bermudan's effort lacked conviction, Barthez couldn't hold it and his fellow Frenchman tapped home.<br><br>For a side beaten by Wigan in midweek, it wasn't a bad start, especially as United had seemed to take the sting out of the game by employing a straightforward passing game which attempted to starve their opponents of possession for long periods.<br><br>With David Beckham suspended, Ferguson had opted to use Solskjaer in a wide right role, persisting with Paul Scholes in an advanced midfield slot, even though the ploy has met with only limited success.<br><br>In a roundabout way, it proved pivotal to United's quick-fire equaliser, which twice saw loose balls fall favourably for the visitors before Giggs volleyed a cross into the box which allowed Solskjaer to ram home from close range.<br><br>Mettomo and Gerard Wiekens were both making their first Premiership starts of the campaign in a makeshift City defence lacking both Steve Howey and Sylvain Distin, who were injured in that Worthington Cup defeat.<br><br>Fortunately, Peter Schmeichel was back, skippering City for the first time as he faced his former club - and the great Dane intervened twice to prevent Giggs and Mikael Silvestre causing problems.<br><br>After tossing away their lead so quickly, it looked like being a long afternoon for the home side. But they reckoned without the help of Neville, the most devout United fan in the visitors' line-up.<br><br>Quite what the England full-back was thinking of when he attempted to shepherd an aimless Foe pass back to Barthez only he will know but, with acres of space in the other direction, he looked up in horror to see Goater blocking his path.<br><br>The damage was done and the Bermudan pounced, firing a shot past Barthez to put his team back in front.<br><br>It should have been three before the interval, but Anelka's finish lacked confidence as he raced onto Goater's lobbed pass and Barthez made the stop.<br><br>Having seen bigger leads than this evaporate at the hands of their bitter rivals, City fans were still in fearful mood at the interval. They needn't have worried.<br><br>Within five minutes of the restart, they had established clear blue water, with Neville again the culprit. He gifted the home side possession with a weak clearance, and Niclas Jensen crossed for Berkovic, whose perfect lay-off to Goater set up a personal City century.<br><br>On the sidelines, Ferguson could stand no more. Neville was put out of his misery and Juan Sebastian Veron also replaced as he searched for a solution to mounting problems.<br><br>But the next goal should have been City's as Anelka evaded a woeful offside trap, then was tripped as he cut inside Barthez, only to find referee Paul Durkin giving United a free-kick.<br><br>Schmeichel was called upon to save from Solskjaer and Giggs and van Nistelrooy used all his guile trying to win a penalty.<br><br>It was tame by United standards - and all to no avail as United were unceremoniously booted out of Maine Road for the final time.<br><br>City boss Keegan said: 'This was my greatest derby - it's the one I will remember.<br>'It was also the last one at Maine Road, so it was special for the fans. The noise they created was fantastic - they were our 12th man, and it reminded me of the atmospheres you used to get in the 1970s.<br><br>'Thirteen years since City's last win over United is a long, long, time. But when your derby game is United, you are not going to be given anything. You have to earn it, and we did that. I think we thoroughly deserved it today.'<br><br>Maine Road ace Danny Tiatto described the result as 'the best ever' and added: 'Everyone gave 120 per cent - everyone worked their socks off. Everyone grafted really hard and were united together, and we are looking forward to the future. This is one of the highlights of my career.'<br><br>But angry United manager Sir Alex Ferguson blasted his players, saying: 'They have had a major rollicking - and quite right too.<br><br>'I feel for the supporters at the moment... I wonder at times like this whether I should let the fans in the dressing room so they can let the players know how they feel.<br><br>'The players know how disappointed I am. We have prepared hard for this game, but they have let us down. It was a kick in the teeth.<br><br>'We will be addressing all this on the training ground. I am not happy and neither are my staff. Neither should they be.'</div>
