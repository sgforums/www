            <div class='col-md body'>by K.K. Cheow and Lau Cheow<br><br>The perceived effectiveness of Environment Minister Lim Swee SayÂ’s apology for the shortcomings in the Environmental Health Institute, which led to a researcher contracting SARS, has led the Gahmen to organize a new apology campaign Â– National Sorry Week.<br><br><img src="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/images/stories/nationalsorryweek.gif"><br><br>Â“It was a groundbreaking moment when Mr. Lim apologized,Â” said Prime MinisterÂ’s Orifice spokesman Mr. Cheng Hu Kong at a press conference today. Â“People were so impressed that the Gahmen was saying sorry that they really didnÂ’t pay too much attention to the fact that no one was being fired and no penalties were being levied for a really serious breach. All we had to say was sorry, and maybe Â– just maybe Â– weÂ’ll punish someone later, and ta-da! Apologizing was so successful at deflecting blame, weÂ’re really sorry for not trying it earlier.Â”<br><br>A reporter swiftly pointed out to Mr. Cheng that this was actually not the first time a member of the Gahmen had apologized of late. Present Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan had apologized for the North East Line debacle and HDB CEO Niam Cheng Meng had also apologized for the problems with upgrading in Marine Parade. There was of course, former Health Minister Lim Hng Kiang, who famously apologized twice Â– first for keeping a baby alive, and second, for having said he was sorry for keeping a baby alive.<br><br>Â“Sorry, my mistake,Â” said Mr. Cheng. Â“But it just proves our point even more. A near outbreak of a deadly contagious disease, a massive transport cockup and a total renovation fiasco, yet as far as we know, no oneÂ’s being forced to take a paycut, let alone step down. We think this can be applied to many other situations, from the rise in GST, the fight between Starhub and SingTel over laying broadband cables, the IDAÂ’s mistake in overpaying $388 million to SingTel, the appointment of a Lee family member to the head of Temasek HoldingsÂ… Just say sorry, can oreddy.Â”<br><br>Â“Expressing some form of regret has been very effective at managing many of the GahmenÂ’s problems,Â” Mr. Cheng continued. Â“So we want the people to adopt this practice too.Â”<br><br>HereÂ’s some of the Sorry Practices that the Gahmen is advocating as part of National Sorry Week:<br><br>1. Ordinary Singaporeans can apologize to the Gahmen for not being cost-effective enough to help Singapore out of its recession;<br><br>2. Ordinary Singaporeans can apologize to the Gahmen for harping on issues like Ministerial pay which could distract Ministers from doing their job;<br><br>3. Ordinary Singaporeans can say sorry to all the foreign talent theyÂ’ve been maligning while they come in to create new jobs for locals;<br><br>4. The WTO and UN can apologize to the Gahmen for the crappy global economic outlook which led to SingaporeÂ’s recession;<br><br>5. Malaysia can apologize to Singapore for all the headaches theyÂ’re causing us about water, railways, land reclamation, causeways and being kicked out of Malaysia.<br><br>Said Mr. Cheng, Â“We also want to assure people that the Gahmen will also be saying sorry, all the way to the top. For instance, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong will be apologizing for not remaking Singapore fast enough for new leadership to take over, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew will be apologizing for not being young enough to run the country again, and Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will apologize for not being old enough to take over the country earlier.Â”<br><br>Does the Gahmen really think the campaign will be effective?<br><br>Â“If itÂ’s not,Â” said Mr. Cheng. Â“Then weÂ’ll just say sorry, lor.Â”<br><br>*no prizes for where i got this from</div>
