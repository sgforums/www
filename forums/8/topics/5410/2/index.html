            <div class='col-md body'>yeah. however, the prob is, it's very hard to find those SOBs again.. i thk it's actually near impossible unless he's stupid enuff to do it on schedule (like everytime he sits bus 45 to wk at 6:40am). but i thk even those assholes arent tt stupid. so, the only" way, is to "fight back" immediately. scream, shout, yell, swear, cry... whatever you do just make a BIGGGGGGG commotion. but honestly, it's easier said than done. when you're in tt kinda situation, you totally freeze up. you have NO idea what to do.. yeahyeah, at this moment i can thk of a million of ways to deal with it, but when it's happening to you.. you kinda go into denial. hell, you're studying pysch., you shld know this betta than me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">. but i guess the only way now is to inform other gers what to do... in the chance tt they wldnt be scared tt long.<br><br>well, the best way to deal with a molester on the bus (where they always attack) is to create a commotion. but you gotta be careful not to be paranoid lah. not like everytime smethg brushes your ass (it happens!) you scream "MOLEST!!!!". ahem. relaxxx. but if this happens repeatedly (not 10-20 times, but like 3-4times and it's clearly obv) then start shouting. "what are you trying to do? freakin *vulgarity of your choice* molester! disgusting (cont insults)..." he prolly attempt a feeble explanation.. "where got.. accident only.." cut him in and start shouting again "accident?!?! you &amp;^(&amp;%%#%#@&amp;! 5/10/20(no of your choice) times already, still accident? you thk i'm blind ah? disgusting old man... i'm young enuff to be your granddaughter ah! (cont insults)..."<br><br>basically, humiliate the hell out of him. others wldnt dare to START the commotion, but they'll damn well cont it. sgreans are like tt, we just need a lil "push". after tt, the bus drivers will take it frm there. woohoo! and you've caught tt asshole. but it's alot easier said than done...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey really sorry about the molest of ur sis...It's really disgusting...and it's so true that in Asian societies, ur raised to not report these kinds of things because of losing face or shame or whatever else there is to it...Of course no one says that u shouldn't report it or stand up against it, but the cumulative process eventually breeds that idea into childrens subconsciousness...<br><br>yet another thing about tradtion that i would rather not have my children grow up with...<br><br>Especially at a young age, many girls are almost literally frozen with fear when  it happens...It's degrading, demeaning and dirty...no wonder they don't want to report...I would have problems reporting also because it would make me feel even dirtier knowing that others know too...viscious circle.:-8<br><br>As for the friend...boy, that was just no excuse...no excuse at all.  U should take your 1.72 meter-ed legs and kick his ass when u get back here Rinoa...show him how people should stand up for one another!<br><br>If that was me, the perv would be on the ground already..no joke.  and the sad fact about most people is that they will never help even if they see it.  Most of the time noone wants to bother...even in the West it's like this...Shit, I don't really agree with this way of thinking that u should only care about what happens to u only....<br><br>I had this friend who had a really abusive boyfriend.  We went out with her and the boyfriend came to see her at where we were.  She had already told him that she was going out with us, but the guy came anyway and told her he was going to beat the shit out of her later when she got home...and poked his finger in her face..(this happens in Singapore to a Singaporean...)anyway, he started to walk away and I and this other friend charged right at him and confronted him square in the face...We were really agressive about it...and asked him "What are u going to do to her?!!!"<br><br>He just quietly smile and say he was just joking...Bull shit...Then the girl later told us we shouldn't have done that because it really isn't our business(typical thinking for mot people from all-over the world)...But I rankly told her that if it happens in front of me, it becomes my business.  if people bring out their garbage in public, then they can't claim it as private anymore..and whatever they do is subject to public scrutiny and action...but still she and her friends don't understand the concept...<br><br>It's such an easy concept to grasp, but unfortunbatley most people subscribe to...see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil....<br><br>Really sad and dissappointing...<br><br>I hope ur sis can recover from this...and consider teaching that young boy how to handle things when u get back...or better yet, get one of ur guy friends to molest him and don't let him know that the guy is "hired" to molest him....:-)  Let's see how he feels when noone does anything for him...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Rinoa:<br><br>I am terrible sorry to read what had happened to your sister.  Please send our kind regards to her.<br><br>To prevent this sort of thing from happening again, you could actually buy a pepper spray here in Canada and bring it back to your sis in Sg when you go back there.  You can use the pepper spray to spary the attackers (bastards) in the eyes before they can attack further.  I am not too sure where you can get it.  I think (not too sure) a Canadian Tire store would sell them.  Maybe you already know.  It come in a small can.  I can ask around and reply to you later.<br><br>I am not too sure if you can bring it back there since it may be perceived as a weapon by the Sg custom officials.  So please check.<br><br>I think it may be a good idea for you to buy one of those pepper sprays for yourself here (just in case).  Not to scare you or anything, there are many many rape and murder cases in Canada.  You, they often rape and murder the girl. Often these bastards get away with light sentencing.  Even if they are handed with heavy sentencing, what done is done.  There is no way that one can fully recover from the emotional scar inflicted by those bastards.<br><br>Best regards,<br>M&amp;P<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fire...<br>Haha!Thanks for the suggestion of asking a guy to molest that stupid fren of my sis. I like It!!And I will ask an Ah Pek to do it.<br>Hey!I really pity your fren who has a bf who abuse her constantly and your friend just let him do it!Goodness! what is happenin? Are girls these so summisive or they love the guy too much to even let go.Suck!This is what i really blinded in love. I hate men hitting a girl, not to mention an abuser. If this girl is my fren, I will surely make sure that she leaves him once and for all.Or i will even make a police report. If my freind dun appreciate it, fine with me as long in the long run she dun get hurt.Talk to her fire, that scum is definately not worth it!<br><br>Money,<br>Dunn worry!one of my bodyguard has given me that suggestion and he has agreed to buy it for my sis. I think it is a good idea than bringing a parang out. I initially thought of asking my sis to go to her Chem lab to get some Conc HCl to pour on those SOBs face and scar them forever and she will have no problem to identify whereever she go and i really meant to do it if not for the pepper spray!(Violent siah!)Thanks for your suggestion which has been gladly taken up<br><br>Fries..<br>Wow!Really??You will help me to pour my grivences out!U owe u one man.Tell me how issit going?

            <div class='col-md body'>Sounds like everyone is in agreement then.<br><br>Next time something like this happens, Girls will scream and make as much commotion as possible, because if not, the pervert will escape and you would probably never see him again even when you do build up the courage to actually do something. Guys, if we see this sort of stuff, we all gang up and beat the crap out of the bastards, or if you are against violence, just break both his legs and one of his arm so he can't run away, and wait for the police.<br><br>One point about anecdotal evidence though, its hard to find out whats true. There are lots of stories flying about, saying things like overseas students being killed while in UK etc. Some might even claim that they know that person. But, the fact is that these cannot be proven, and you are just scaring yourself. Of course I think people should still be cautious, but I just think that some claims are not based on fact.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm..i really dunno what to say...so much has been said liao!<br><br>Well my sister and her grp of all female frds were once at this downtown on the street celebration and this grp of Bangladesh workers also purposely pressed themselves onto 'em...fortunately, my sis and her frds are the types who wont just do nothing...of coz in crowds, its kinda impossible to catch anyone especially in an open area, so they kicked and elbowed the jerks...<br><br>Basically, i'm also kinda sorry to hear what happened to yr sister cos one of my internet frds once got molested very badly, by being tricked by this SOB...well, this kinda thing really scars a person i would feel, i also agree that in such an typical asian-type culture society as s'pore, gals tend to feel "dirty, ashamed" as though its their fault if they make it know tp others that they were sexually abused...HOWEVER this shouldnt be the case!!! Gals out there stand up for yrselves if noone else does, and STILL stand up for yrself if others try to stop you, like in Riona's sister's case...<br><br>Yeah frankly, i also think that there's very very MUCH wrong in the whole singaporean society...people are just too shy or afraid of trouble to stand up for whats right, they're just more concerned with the rat-race they're competing in, too self-absorbed with advancing in society...great to know that most of the guys here WILL do something...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To all of my lovely supporters,<br>Thanks for sharing worm. I think as far as I can see most ppl have been at least molested once before.I feel ......lost. Cos it is like there is no solution to it. I will really try to see what i can to the papers and stuffs but all and all really depends on the "live" reaction u gonna portray. It is really so hateful.My sis is so frightened and she felt "uncleansed" like U..and she getting those horrible flashbacks! Poor girl.<br>I dun know what to say now but to see what the newsgroup says..Wait..wait...<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe the incident would leave some sort of emotional scar on your sis, and it might take a long time to heal. Since you are doing psychology, do you think you might be able to do something that might speed up her recovery process? The main thing is to let her know that it's not her fault, take it as a learning experience, and if (choy of coz) next time encounter again.. know what to do and what her rights are.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i know this is a bit late Rinoa, but i didn't see the post.<br><br>to be subjected to something like that is very very harsh and also demeaning for your sister, and i just hope she won't suffer any psychological repercussions from it.<br><br>i've experienced this sort of thing before (to all those who are wondering, NO, i wasn't the one being molested ok!! =)<br><br>the first one was on a train, and trains here in Sydney are obscenely crowded during peak hours, especially around the CBD area.  me and my friends just finished our cricket training session, and we boarded a train packed to the brim.  and there was this Korean girl leaning aginst the train door facing outside, while we were stuck like sardines in the middle compartment.  the train was so crowded and noisy, it drowned out almost everything, but i was close to her and i could hear her sobbing and crying silently.  i was confused, but then i noticed the guy standing behind her had his right hand up her short skirt and it was clear he was fondling her and after listening closely, we could hear his panting and moaning as he continues his perverted act.  i thought "my word, so brave lah, is he some kind of moron what?...doing this in the middle of the stinking daylight"<br><br>i was too far from her to do anything at that moment, but i told my friends and we decided not to create a commotion on the train cuz we want to give him a lesson or two.  the poor girl got off at the next station and so did the man...we rushed outside and we stopped him dead in his tracks...we didn't bash him straight away on the platform (otherwise we get into trouble for that) so we just crowded him and pretended we're old mates who haven't seen each other for a long time...the girl was kinda stunned, but we just winked and smiled at her and she smiled back.<br><br>after we got out, we simply asked him, what kind of a sick, good for nothing, moronic lowlife was he, doing that sort of acts in front of 5 guys wielding cricket bats...i told him that it's either he was a braindead moron with an IQ range of between a parasitic bacteria and an algael moss (of course i didn't expect him to understand this lah..), OR a damn brave soul, albeit stupid...<br><br>well, to keep things short, we ended up with some post-training session batting practice.<br>i still have the dent on my cricket bat until now, and i usually get pissed if i dent my bat, but it was for a good cause.<br><br>in short, to any guys reading this, please, don't think we did that just cuz we outnumbered that dickless moron, but you have to stand up to those sort of behaviors, don't let leeches who feeds of the human excess wastes like that tarnish the society.  cancerous aberrations such as them must be eliminated.  don't be afraid or malu to do it, cuz you know that you are in the right (but not necessarily bash them to bits...)<br>sadly, that's not the only time i've encountered those lowlifes...<br><br>so Rinoa, tell your sis to hang tough and tell her good-for-nothing friend who claims to be a guy to check whether his penis is still attached, if not then tell him to have a sex change to a female while he's at it.<br>hope she's ok, but with a strong sis like you, she should be fine...after all, she's got your genes...<br>and also send your sister my best regards.<br>=)<br><br>ps. sorry for all the bio terms, i can't help it, i'm a Biotech student... =P<br><br>------------------<br>Underneath the Southern Cross I stand...<br><br>[This message has been edited by pluckaduck (edited 29-11-1999).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by pluckaduck (edited 29-11-1999).]</div>
