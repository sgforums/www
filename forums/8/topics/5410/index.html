If you need to stand up and shout then go ahead because you have to do it. This sort of situation where got time to save face? Go ahead and write to everyone in the police force to complain or write to the newspaper or something.<br><br>Speaking as a guy, I would probably not want to get beaten up by a gang, so depending on the situation, I would act accordingly.  If there were more than one other person on the bus then I would go ahead and make a fuss.

(You r prolly sick of hearing dis rite?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">) I guess the best course of action to be done then was to approach the bus driver tell him what happened and get him to drive to the nearest police post, or call the police on ur handphone if you have one. I think I would have done that.<br><br>Guess its a lesson learnt loh... Ur sis should have a better idea on how to react to such situations in the future at least. And next time, if she has a racket, dun forget to ask her to use it.

            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa:<br>Tell your sister to go to the Police. Make a report. Tell them the incident. Even if she can't remember the looks, at least the police are aware of it. Probably they can keep a lookout around the area or that particular bus.<br><br>I seems lotsa bangladesh workers in camp during my NS life. Most looked the same to me. Sometimes seeing them could make you feel sorry for them. At least I do. But they doesn't not give them the f**king right to commit a darn crime here.<br><br>It happen to my ger before, but worst, it's a local guy. She's on the bus and the darm SOB kept trying to push(and maybe rubbing) his private parts onto her shoulder. Sometimes if it's crowded, it happen accidently but she saw that the bus is NOT crowded! But becoz she is about to be late for school and she had been given a warning for be late, so she decided to alight the bus. I AM DAMN ANGRY. Should catch that SOB and try him to the police. I ask her why din she do it, she was afraid of the warning letter from school! That really piss me off. If the school gives her a warning letter coz she went to the police to report a molest and being late for school, I will f**king COMPLAIN to the school. What the f**k is that. Anyway, I am already not very happy with that school.<br><br>Just becoz her works resembles another SUPPOSELY good students, the teacher gave her zero, accused her of copying from the other student and din even bother to check out who is copying from who. Not actual fact, its her friend who forgotten to do it borrow from her and copy everything. What the f**k the teacher is doing? I wanted to complain the school and the teacher to MOE but my ger stop me. This is not the first incident. There are many cases too.<br><br>So Rinoa, tell your sis to go to the police. If there is a need, ask her to give TNP a call, she is better in doing it coz she is the victim. For that "short and small guy", kick his ass and STOP BEING FRIENDS with him!<br><br>------------------<br>why, bishamon? why bish?<br>coz he's God of War!!<br>But I'm a peacelover! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>Killjoy,<br>accept your points on "non-corruption" being evolved from not being uncovered....<br>but honestly, i used to work in some of the private and confidential work, and have seen numerous cases of police officers being offered bribes and refusing them.... (which i know still does not refute your point that these are prob the cases that are made known)<br>I guess the non-corruption stems more from being the police officers generally being very well paid as compared to the rest....<br><br>somewhere along the way, there's got to be a level of trust....<br><br>Me</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sad to say, this is a pretty common problem. crime rates (molest and rape) are low in sg partly due to the fact tt many nv report them. a baised unfounded statement? ask ard... EVERY sch ger wld know of at least 1 fren who was molested. and it's always on the bus. rinoa, i can sympathise with your sis... any ger who goes thru this feels totally dirty, like it's your fault or smethg you were molested/raped/flashed. i was flashed in a busstop by sme ass on the bus and even so, i felt horrible. disgusting. dirty.<br><br>furthermore, the thg, or rather person tt disgusts me most, is your sis' "fren"! i mean.. what the fuck? the lowdown stinking freakin bastard! even as gers, when we see somethg like tt happening we help!! what the hell is wrong with tt guy? not only as a male but as a person, a human being?!??! how can you see someone treat your "fren" like tt and ask her to "grin and bear"? if i was your sis i'll hit the fucking molester then hit my 'fren'!<br><br>what happened to a classmate of mine was tt this guy came on the bus (totally empty as this was what, 7/6:30am??) and stood beside her seat. he started rubbing his crotch against her, and she was so scared/disgusted tt she cldnt do a thg! he contd doing this before getting down 2-4stops later. as he stood at the steps, he froze and adjusted his crotch. the look on his face was disgusting. when he got down the bus, he cldnt even walk properly!!! what's worse, this is not the first time. not the first time for my fren, and definitely not the first time for this guy!!! my fren burst out crying upon reaching sch but she refused to report to the police.. we started staking out the place and watching for tt SOB but we nv saw him again.<br><br>another fren of me had it worse. she was sitting on the bus, with a man beside her. it was an extremely long bus ride (76, frm AMK to marina) and i thk she dosed off... she awoke to the feeling tt someone was touching her. she turned to look and saw the guy's hand on her breast, but he quickly moved it away. however, he continued touching her breast, even progressing to fondling it and grew more and more daring... he even placed his hand on her thigh and started moving her skirt up!!!!!! my fren was too shocked to react and had no idea what to do. she cldnt stand it anymore, so she quickly pressed the button and tried to get up. but when she passed him in order to get out, he pressed himself against her and even grabbed her thighs!<br><br>pt of this? molest cases are extremely rampant throughout sg, whether it's by foreign workers, or sgs. my flasher was this ch, 40 yr old unshavened disgusting looking jerk. my classmate's was an malay office wker in his 20s. my fren's molester was a fair ch man dressed in shorts and tee in his early 30s. someone has got to do smethg abt this... of course, no one ever reports a molest case unless they've caught the assailant. and you can be sure tt if tt guy does it once, he's bound to do it again.. and again... and again. until he's caught.</div>
