The more I read, the more shocked I got.<br><br>But sometimes when Im away from my home country, I think I switched into another personality. More active and independent. Kinda become another person. I think this birth order thing is only very accurate if you are around the family environment....so your mind will be tuned into that setting.</div>

Sometimes I wish I can move out and stay away from the conundrum of family life. Too 'noisy' sadly. Too much prying into my private affairs. Some things, family dont have to know. Looking to first child for direction and over achiever thingie....whoever have seen my bro know that overachiever..is an understatement. But heck, he need to be led by the nose for a lot of basic stuff. How many times do you have to say "No!" before someone understand and back off?<br><br>Second para is a fairly accurate description though. And no, I dont want to marry a last born. The most outstanding characteristic of a last born is their willfullness, something I will not tolerate in the long term.</div>
