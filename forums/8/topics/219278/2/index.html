            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for all the awesome advices and huge replies! I wanted to reply yesterday but i was too tired, regarding my third training. Haha<br><br>Well i'll just note about ME! My first day of officially working, my work time today was 12-8. Whoa 8 hours dude that's quite an hefty amount for a start.<br><br>To be honest? The 2 hours seems to pass damn slow, Why? I was extremely nervous and i keep messing up the first few orders and taking extremely long time to actually react. But i remember one of the advices that were given here, "If dunno just say dunno, doesn't really matter because your new" . Because of that phrase, It really calmed me down <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Thanks to <strong>Pierre</strong> who said that.<br><br>When the first two hours were over; For JP 's pizza hut, 1-4 were like the peek hours.<br><br>I finally began to familiarize, and feel that ITS actually quite great. You know the kitchen dudes are damn funny. Its quite hard to differentiate their personality from how they look. For example, when i was going to have my break. I saw a few of them, and i was hungry and so i just got to the biggest guy and said "Hi i am hungry, would you cook me something " Guessed what he said?<br><br>Good grief! The first impression he gave me was that he's fierce., but he replied "Sure what do you want me to cook for you" I just gave a simple personal hawaii as i was'nt really THAT hungry.<br><br>And u know they also said something that really cracked me up. "Eh ah seng, ni ke yi zuo hawaii mah?"<br><br>"Wo bu hui zuo"<br><br>"Eh fuck u leh bu yao wan leh"<br><br>The actual scene was better than scripted <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> .<br><br>Overall, i believe that most of you were right! Thanks a lot. Everyone there was friendly and helpful, and some of them even poked fun of me hahahaha. Overall i enjoyed myself a lot despite it being 8 hours.<br><br>And i made some friends as well, I was thirsty and i went to the counter and asked if i could drink water. then the cashier; a lady.
