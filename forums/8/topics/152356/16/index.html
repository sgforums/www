            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys, was wondering if we can move on from all the discussion about which school is older and which school is more successful in sports? Because the discussion was never about the achievements of ACS or any school for that matter. It was about the attitude of ACS guys.<br><br>No matter how successful your school is, or how many trophies your school has won, it doesn't mean you can act like the world owns you a living. I don't even consider ACS as the single most successful school at all. But that's not the point, point is ACS have this tendency of being arrogant, just like "social87" who is in no way sociable by the way.<br><br>All this talk about sports awards is like kids shouting,"My toy is bigger than yours!!!"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually i feel really sad for these people. They have never experienced what to be united, our hearts our hopes our aims are one.<br><br>Top sports players gets easy entry into ACS schools. But why did they choose ACS when the "suppose" public thinks ACS are snobs and spoilt brats? haha go figure dudes.<br><br>About the person stating "Tell me which ministers are successful from ACS?? Its their character not because their from ACS"<br><br>I think you get your sayings all messed up. Examples of some of the ministers are ng eng and balakrisnan.(Not sure how u spell them) These ministers GOT THEIR CHARACTER FROM ACS. They frequently go back to ACS schools to encourage and motivate the boys to go on. This is what i call school unity and spirit.<br><br>Lets hope this somehow goes to the newspaper. I wanna hear their views over this issue.lol.</div>
