            <div class='col-md body'>The very obvious fact is that people dislike ACS students because most of them come from either successful families or grow up to become very successful people. They get jealous that their standards aren't up to the ones in ACS.<br><br>Im not saying that ACS students are richer and BETTER then others, im just stating that because they have been brought up in a better environment, they are able to carry themselves properly in public. Outsiders then see this as snobs.<br><br>You can counter my point by saying that non ACS students can become successful and that they can also be well to do, but this feeling of anti-ACS has become so popular till everyone thinks that way.<br><br>Take it from those successful ministers, are they gay? are they snobs? I doubt so. They have brought our country to greater success. Go figure.</div>

Saying something like that is said by people who are trying to defend themselves that they've done nothing wrong, and are insteading diverting the attention onto others.</div>

I think there are more gays in SJI than ACS.<br><br>ACS guys to me are very confident,  has this to do with the students rich background or the education i don't know. But when coming face to face with most singaporeans, who are less well off, less fluent in english, many ACS guys appear to be snob, intentionally or not. I can understand the remarks from some forumites here about encounter during NS.<br><br>I think this is partly due to their poor command of chinese, I have not come across an ACS guy who are proud of their chinese/mandarin, and they are not fluent in malay either. Are ACS guys all from indian or peranakan background?<br><br>ACS guys are generally polite and carry themselves well in country clubs and places for high society people, but when it come to meeting the ah lian and ah beng, many of my ACS friends said they would just walk away after a few words. They said class 95 and 93.3 just don't have much common topics. Why is it so?<br><br>In a multiracial society, I really hope that those from the elite schools and the neighbourhood schools can mix well. Used to think that it might have to do with the religious background but i found out that those from St Andrew and Cath High have less problem in this area than the ACS guys.<br><br>Any ACS guys here care to comment?</div></blockquote>You are wrong. SJI does not have many gays...its SPS or VS. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Frankly, I like doing business with ACS guys.
