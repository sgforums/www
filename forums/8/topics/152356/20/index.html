Mai lai lar.<br><br>I know so many ACSians... that makes this ACS-bashing so untrue. It depends on who you know that creates the impression. I avoided snobbish people, so I don't bother about them or what school they are from. It is the people I avoided, not the school they attended. Damn wu liao lor... as if what school you come from makes a difference in Army, society, career or Love?<br><br>If you are capable, you will succeed in life.<br><br>If you are good looking, you are good looking.<br><br>what the hell does it got to do with the school?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Don't bash Crescent also.<br><br>/me sharpen knife.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Cheers</div></blockquote>Good for you that you didn't get too close with the snobbish ones. Yes, ultimately you choose who you want to be friends with and whom you don't. Just that some people will make it extra hard to choose them as friends.<br><br>In general, what you say is true. If you're good, you're good. Doesn't matter where you come from, only where you go. I can't really say for others, but my issue is not with the achievements of ACS as a whole, but rather, the attitude that the culture in the school seems to bring. Besides, I do not deem ACS as the most successful school around. But kids like social87 surely seem to think they're above everyone else.<br><br>You can say perhaps that I'm unfortunate to always meet only jerks from ACS, curse my fortune for meeting so many people who are like social87. But to tell the truth, it's really been quite a few. To say that I don't think that way of ACS guys would be lying after my encounters with them. People like Social87 continue to add to the count.<br><br>I certainly would like to meet more of the nice ACS guys who are unlike social87 if there are any around.<br><br>p.s;Crescent is where Stella Huang came from before ACJC.<br><br></div>

Either that, or they are simply envious buffoons who cannot accept they are losers...</div>

Yes, ultimately you choose who you want to be friends with and whom you don't. Just that some people will make it extra hard to choose them as friends.<br><br>In general, what you say is true. If you're good, you're good. Doesn't matter where you come from, only where you go. I can't really say for others, but my issue is not with the achievements of ACS as a whole, but rather, the attitude that the culture in the school seems to bring.

A person is measure by its self worth - not that of what is given to them either by parents or by heritage. But because school spirit (or even nationalism) is innate - you feel good when your school (or country in nationalism sense) is doing well. Don't have to be the best, but well enough to get by.<br><br>Such innate-spirit-spill-outwardly exist everywhere: If you skateboard, you will probably find some other skateboarder gang who think that they are good. If you break-dance, you will find people who thinks that their crew are great. If you play Counterstrike, you will find some people who think that their clan are God. Therefore, if you are in a school where its history is rich and students have something to hold and look up to, they will feel that their school are great. I can tell you lar, majority of the students are ok, just that BECAUSE of a few people, others REMEMEBERED those few. (Duh, you always remember those idiots than the good people you might have faced or missed out, who is an ACSian, but you didn't realise nia). Of course lar, does anyone go asking 'what school you from' and judge from there?<br><br>Actually I don't bother about the whole entity, rather, I see the individual. If you suck at skateboard but you are in the best SB gang, the fact is that you suck. If you suck at break-dance, but you are in the best crew, the fact is that you suck. If your suck at counterstrike, but you are in the best clan, the fact is that you suck. So if you are in an elite school (or seemingly), but if you suck as a person, you suck.<br><br>I was from an elite school (or seemingly), but hell with it, I have almost the same percentage of friends from neighbourhood schools (or seemingly) as well. I am proud of my own school, proud of my own family and friends, proud of my Love, proud of my work and proud of myself. But all these are innate... something within - others don't have to know or even question about it... I can feel can liao. Suprisingly, my higher esteem is not gain while I was in my school, rather, it was self discovery after that.<br><br>I know of people, from elite schools, screwed up their lives so badly, getting involved in drugs, shotgun, gangs or whatever thingy there is. These are real stories, not just the fair share of doctors, lawyers and successful business man/woman the newspaper portrays. People only see the good side in an elite school, but at the end, your self worth is what you really are.<br><br>P.S: Stella ah... saw that time in my Music School when I was still working there. Alot of make-up leh... but overall not too bad.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
