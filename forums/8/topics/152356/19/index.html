The literary, debating and drama societies are particularly well-supported. ACS students also have a reputation for possessing a quirky sense of humor, with pranks being a long-established part of the school history.</strong><br><br>see, u brats think that ur sch is the best. concrete evidence here.<br><br><strong>The school's students have also been accused of being arrogant and snobbish, and ACS itself has often been charged as being a school only for children of the rich and elite.</strong><br><br>may we know y the word "accused" appears? it's not as if they're not. it seems like everything is just a myth made up, which we all know it's a fact.<br><br><strong>In the 1970s, there was a minor flap in the local press about ACS students flaunting their wealth to other less privileged students and the world at large, and the term "snob" began being applied to them. As a result, the school initiated strict policies on how much money a student was allowed to bring to school, and even what kinds of watches or shoes would be permitted as part of the school attire.</strong><br><br>somehow prove that u brats are indeed snobs.<br><br><strong>The dress code has been relaxed slightly over the years, but the myth of the rich and elitist ACS student still survives to a degree, despite the fact that students from all income levels were and continue to be admitted to the school. Admittedly, the presence of the Independent School, with its high school fees and free-ranging curriculum, has not helped to dispel this idea. Curiously, other schools in Singapore, even Independent ones, do not suffer from the same reputation. </strong><br><br>as i mention above. any students in acs with family income of $1000 or less?[/b]</blockquote>You would be surprised by the amounts given out for bursaries..</div>

Since some of the ACS guys are unable to account for all of their fellow students from displaying homosexual tendencies, we can draw conclusion that the possibility of gays in ACS is inevitable.
