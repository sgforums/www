            <div class='col-md body'>interesting how this thread turns into 8 pages of discussion about gay. I think there are more gays in SJI than ACS.<br><br>ACS guys to me are very confident,  has this to do with the students rich background or the education i don't know. But when coming face to face with most singaporeans, who are less well off, less fluent in english, many ACS guys appear to be snob, intentionally or not. I can understand the remarks from some forumites here about encounter during NS.<br><br>I think this is partly due to their poor command of chinese, I have not come across an ACS guy who are proud of their chinese/mandarin, and they are not fluent in malay either. Are ACS guys all from indian or peranakan background?<br><br>ACS guys are generally polite and carry themselves well in country clubs and places for high society people, but when it come to meeting the ah lian and ah beng, many of my ACS friends said they would just walk away after a few words. They said class 95 and 93.3 just don't have much common topics. Why is it so?<br><br>In a multiracial society, I really hope that those from the elite schools and the neighbourhood schools can mix well. Used to think that it might have to do with the religious background but i found out that those from St Andrew and Cath High have less problem in this area than the ACS guys.<br><br>Any ACS guys here care to comment?</div>

I think there are more gays in SJI than ACS.<br><br>ACS guys to me are very confident,  has this to do with the students rich background or the education i don't know. But when coming face to face with most singaporeans, who are less well off, less fluent in english, many ACS guys appear to be snob, intentionally or not. I can understand the remarks from some forumites here about encounter during NS.<br><br>I think this is partly due to their poor command of chinese, I have not come across an ACS guy who are proud of their chinese/mandarin, and they are not fluent in malay either. Are ACS guys all from indian or peranakan background?<br><br>ACS guys are generally polite and carry themselves well in country clubs and places for high society people, but when it come to meeting the ah lian and ah beng, many of my ACS friends said they would just walk away after a few words. They said class 95 and 93.3 just don't have much common topics. Why is it so?<br><br>In a multiracial society, I really hope that those from the elite schools and the neighbourhood schools can mix well. Used to think that it might have to do with the religious background but i found out that those from St Andrew and Cath High have less problem in this area than the ACS guys.<br><br>Any ACS guys here care to comment?</div></blockquote>Regarding the common topic issue, I think we have to be fair.You can't force an Ah Beng to talk about Literary Studies or how the impact of losing one town to Zarqawi's men might have on the US Army in Iraq.Common stuff comes with greater understanding at first, and once you get to know people better, the common ground is enlarged.<br><br>I certainly feel unhappy when we are tarred with one huge brush that says intolerant, snobbish and haughty.Confidence is not snobbery, literacy is not arrogance and ideas of school loyalty should not be construed as being elitist.<br><br>I'm Chinese Peranakan, and yes when I was younger, I did have this notion that other people are not worth the trouble of understanding.But after entering NS and realising that diversity is one of God's greatest gifts to man, I'm much more engaging to anyone, even those who are of different backgrounds from me.<br><br>Well, maybe it helps that I do speak fairly fluent Hokkien and yes, I'm proud of my culture, which is that of Singapore and Brunei.I see myself as a Straits/SEA Chinese, born in the tropics, bred on bak chor mee and roti prata.I may hate durians but I certainly love the smell of laksa and seafood.I believe that you need to speak the language of others to be a true cosmopolitan and not insist on some pre-conceived notion of linguistic superiority.Better to order char kway teow in Hokkien and see a faint smile than stumble your way around in broken English trying to get your point across, by which time, the food is cold and the queue wants your pound of flesh <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> .<br><br>Contrary to popular belief, we are not bootlickers of Western culture, save for the ignorant young who will mature and realise that their education has made them confident enough to face the world and be equally adaptable to anywhere they live, work or play.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>for the gay part, i cant agree more. we scouts are having camp at thai and when we're coming back, we have to stay a night at a malaysia sch. our resting area is the hall which is much smaller than the avg sch hall here. as we got around 200-300 ppls, we hardly have enough space to slp. and guess what? those acs gays dunno scare of cold or slping on the hall ground that they (ard 10 persons) all lay out their slping bags and take up a hell lots of space. ask them give some space to the other schs and they just heck care, thinking no one can touch them. they cant seems to slp without the slping bags and as if they will freeze to death or what. screw them man, in the end, my group of 15 have to slp outside the hall.</div>
