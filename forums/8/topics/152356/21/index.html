It's about you being young and immature. I've met some of your peers who have displayed much more maturity and sense than you. Even though they're from ACJC as well. Sad to say, you're not anything like them. It's people like you who really make the rest of your peers look better.<br><br><strong>[quote]guess u're jus getting senile. =)<br><br>seek treatment soon.</strong>Really seems all you can do is cheap attacks. Guess you're still young and let me stress, unlearnt as well. A young brat in other words.<br><br>You're really making ACS guys look worse and if you knew what you were doing, you'd just shut up now. You're such a disgrace man.<br><br>I believe the people here would appreciate a more sensible ACS person to come forward to speak out, rather than the likes of you.

A person is measure by its self worth - not that of what is given to them either by parents or by heritage. But because school spirit (or even nationalism) is innate - you feel good when your school (or country in nationalism sense) is doing well. Don't have to be the best, but well enough to get by.<br><br>Such innate-spirit-spill-outwardly exist everywhere: If you skateboard, you will probably find some other skateboarder gang who think that they are good. If you break-dance, you will find people who thinks that their crew are great. If you play Counterstrike, you will find some people who think that their clan are God. Therefore, if you are in a school where its history is rich and students have something to hold and look up to, they will feel that their school are great. I can tell you lar, majority of the students are ok, just that BECAUSE of a few people, others REMEMEBERED those few. (Duh, you always remember those idiots than the good people you might have faced or missed out, who is an ACSian, but you didn't realise nia). Of course lar, does anyone go asking 'what school you from' and judge from there?<br><br>Actually I don't bother about the whole entity, rather, I see the individual. If you suck at skateboard but you are in the best SB gang, the fact is that you suck. If you suck at break-dance, but you are in the best crew, the fact is that you suck. If your suck at counterstrike, but you are in the best clan, the fact is that you suck. So if you are in an elite school (or seemingly), but if you suck as a person, you suck.<br><br>I was from an elite school (or seemingly), but hell with it, I have almost the same percentage of friends from neighbourhood schools (or seemingly) as well. I am proud of my own school, proud of my own family and friends, proud of my Love, proud of my work and proud of myself. But all these are innate... something within - others don't have to know or even question about it... I can feel can liao. Suprisingly, my higher esteem is not gain while I was in my school, rather, it was self discovery after that.<br><br>I know of people, from elite schools, screwed up their lives so badly, getting involved in drugs, shotgun, gangs or whatever thingy there is. These are real stories, not just the fair share of doctors, lawyers and successful business man/woman the newspaper portrays. People only see the good side in an elite school, but at the end, your self worth is what you really are.<br><br>P.S: Stella ah... saw that time in my Music School when I was still working there. Alot of make-up leh... but overall not too bad.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers    </div></blockquote>I seemed to be borned with a different perception.<br><br>I felt that my teachers are the worst bunch since my secondary school days except for a select few and those who had to learn under these teachers as weaklings.<br><br>I believed with the exception of a select few students, the rest of the students in the good schools are nothing but a pack of academic grinding machines with zero capability to handle issues.<br><br>Then again, I'm an egoistic maniac who virtually thinks I can do anything and everything but lack the enthusiasm. Such lifestyle followed me even when I entered JCs.<br><br>And again, I felt demoralised by the pack of results grinding machines around me. They were unable to think, rely on books instead of their own intelligence to figure out things.<br><br>Then I believed there are many geniuses in Singapore buried underneath their poor results and only the selected few who can attentively bind themselves to grinding results making the cut.<br><br>Yes, most high school and university graduates can produce results by repeating what they learnt. Yet, they can never be trusted to find the results for an unsolved question.<br><br>I realised I would be surrounded by idiots when I reached university.

Although I dislike ACS people, I believe they're capable of better replies (once they get their arrogance out of the way).<br><br>Disliking someone is not always a sign of jealousy. Saying something like that is said by people who are trying to defend themselves that they've done nothing wrong, and are insteading diverting the attention onto others.<br><br>To add, the government does not like terrorists, but does that make the government jealous of them? And for those people who don't like others who have body ordour or bad breathe, are they jealous of the people they hate?<br><br>Rather than keep shouting like a brat,"You're all jealous! You're all jealous!" Open your eyes a little more to the truth and try to think a bit more. Or at least try to come up with a more credible arguement.<br><br>Here's another example. If disliking some meant being jealous of someone, then the shemale using the nick "bout au revior" is extremely jealous of her "cheena" schoolmate, since she hates him so much. "Her" intentions are far from noble anyway.</div>

A person is measure by its self worth - not that of what is given to them either by parents or by heritage. But because school spirit (or even nationalism) is innate - you feel good when your school (or country in nationalism sense) is doing well. Don't have to be the best, but well enough to get by.<br><br>Such innate-spirit-spill-outwardly exist everywhere: If you skateboard, you will probably find some other skateboarder gang who think that they are good. If you break-dance, you will find people who thinks that their crew are great. If you play Counterstrike, you will find some people who think that their clan are God. Therefore, if you are in a school where its history is rich and students have something to hold and look up to, they will feel that their school are great. I can tell you lar, majority of the students are ok, just that BECAUSE of a few people, others REMEMEBERED those few. (Duh, you always remember those idiots than the good people you might have faced or missed out, who is an ACSian, but you didn't realise nia). Of course lar, does anyone go asking 'what school you from' and judge from there?<br><br>Actually I don't bother about the whole entity, rather, I see the individual. If you suck at skateboard but you are in the best SB gang, the fact is that you suck. If you suck at break-dance, but you are in the best crew, the fact is that you suck. If your suck at counterstrike, but you are in the best clan, the fact is that you suck. So if you are in an elite school (or seemingly), but if you suck as a person, you suck.<br><br>I was from an elite school (or seemingly), but hell with it, I have almost the same percentage of friends from neighbourhood schools (or seemingly) as well. I am proud of my own school, proud of my own family and friends, proud of my Love, proud of my work and proud of myself. But all these are innate... something within - others don't have to know or even question about it... I can feel can liao. Suprisingly, my higher esteem is not gain while I was in my school, rather, it was self discovery after that.<br><br>I know of people, from elite schools, screwed up their lives so badly, getting involved in drugs, shotgun, gangs or whatever thingy there is. These are real stories, not just the fair share of doctors, lawyers and successful business man/woman the newspaper portrays. People only see the good side in an elite school, but at the end, your self worth is what you really are.<br><br>P.S: Stella ah... saw that time in my Music School when I was still working there. Alot of make-up leh... but overall not too bad.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers    </div></blockquote>Cheers.<br><br>What you have said is very true, and I can see you're living your life fruitfully and abundantly. Good for you. I do believe though that there is culture that is inherent in ACS that personally I do not agree with, I believe I've already said this in previous posts. Who knows, maybe someday things may just get better.<br><br>About Stella, actually, she's a very english-speaking person in real life. I'm not against english-speaking or chinese-speaking, it's just that her screen personality is very different from that in real life.<br><br>She's not such an act cute person before her days as a singer but I guess it's all about imaging.</div>
