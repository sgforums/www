            <div class='col-md body'>Btw aloof_guy, it's not right to accuse people of not knowing what unity is like. I've already mentioned that other schools have strong unified fraternities as well. Schools like SJI, CHIJ, RGS are very united as well in school spirit. So it'd be good to not adopt that attitude that ACS is above everyone else in everything, because that's exactly what people hate about ACS guys. That they're above everyone in everything, even when their not.</div>
