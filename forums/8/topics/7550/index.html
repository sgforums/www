Thus, you can save your minerals on many units and use Psi Storm as a "counter" to popular attacks like all air units, Terran infantry, etc...<br>The Reaver's scarab are excellent against Workers, completely owns Terran Infantry and Zerg ground.<br>Since the Protoss' units are high in health, they are the most efficient for use in micromanagement battles.<br>Photon Cannons are good deterance but not excellent defense. One or two spread out in your base can be useful for fending off light drops and air hit-and-runs but you should never get a large group of them. Simply because cannons are non-mobile, an moblie army that can be used to attack is much better.<br>VERY HARD TO USE PROTOSS CORRECTLY. Simply bacuse their "counters" to the common strategies are spread out into three tech branches. When you know the opponent is going Lurkers, you have to go observers. When he goes Mutas, you have to have cannons or corsairs. But what if he goes both ? The easiest answer would be to go with High Templars as Psi Storm can effectively stops most of those attacks.<br>Unfortunately, Carriers are too resource intensive and weak to use effectively.<br>Arbiters are almost never seen before.<br>Dark Archons are limited in use.<br>But the plain Archons are very useful against Zerg air though.<br>Enough about Protoss.<br><br>2.TERRAN<br>Lousiest race of them all.<br>Why ?<br>They are very vunerable to tech rushing.<br>Zerg can go Lurkers and trap the Terran for a long time or even kill them.<br>Protoss goes Dark Templars, Dragoons and the Terran is in big trouble. Espcially, if he follows up with Reavers and High Templars.<br>A Terran vs Terran match usually ends in masses of Wraiths.<br>Marines are simply too weak.<br>They can be easily stopped by Sunkens, Photon Cannons, Siege Tanks and Lurkers.<br>However, Marines are the best when used in light drops on opponent's expansions and mineral line.<br>HARDEST RACE TO USE.<br>You have to know how to build your base in such a way that high tech Lurkers, Dark Templars, Reavers and Wraiths can't do hit-and-run. On top of that, you have to be able to micromanage your Tanks, Marines so that you could beat these units on the field.<br>By the way, Terran also builds up units slowest, so you have to be very prepared and win every single battle.<br>Their only consolation is that they can get access to all their units the fastest. (They NEED every unit in order to win)<br>Exceptions are the Battlecruisers and Ghosts, they are slow, resource intensive and very very weak. Ghosts serve no purpose at all. Can you say "sucks?"<br>The MVP is the science vessel, no Terran can win the game without them.<br>Second would be the Vulture. No Terran can win a Terrran v Protoss without the Vultures.<br>Finally, the Siege Tanks have the LONGEST range in the game. (12 Matrix, Guardians are 8 Matrix)<br><br>3. ZERG<br>Perhaps the most powerful race in Starcraft.<br>Their ability to produce massive amounts of units in a short time is very deadly.<br>This effectively allows Zergs to change their strategies drastically.<br>Like from mass Hydras to mass Air and then to Hydra-drops.<br>Their ability to take over the map fast and increase their unit production further every time they control an expansion is very deadly in the lategame.<br>Zerg owns every other race in the lategame if used correctly.<br>Perhaps the only reason why the Zerg is so strong is because they are the masters of attacking.<br>In all games, attacking always gives one a tremendous advantage over the defending player.<br>The zerg's Lukers and Mutalisks are very powerful tool against opponents who have problems countering them.<br>On top of all these bonuses, Zerg buildings are very very cheap.<br>All you need are hatcheries and a few other buildings to work.<br>Since they can save on detectors and transport, the Zerg are very versatile and extremely mobile.<br>The nydus canals are useless though.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>Hydralisks are perhaps the best units in the game. They are good if you micro against melee units like Archons and Zealots.<br>Overall a VERY EASY RACE TO USE BUT HARDEST TO MASTER.<br>If one can master the art of mass unit production, micro, disruption and resource devouring, Zerg is a very very very powerful race.<br><br>Well, thats the end of my mini-analysis.<br>Not very professional sounding but it is actually real and not some newbie talk ? (any decent player cna tell you that).<br>Disagree ?<br>Come, ;ets play some games and we will see.</div>

Can you say "sucks?"<br>The MVP is the science vessel, no Terran can win the game without them.<br>Second would be the Vulture. No Terran can win a Terrran v Protoss without the Vultures.<br>Finally, the Siege Tanks have the LONGEST range in the game. (12 Matrix, Guardians are 8 Matrix)<br><br>3. ZERG<br>Perhaps the most powerful race in Starcraft.<br>Their ability to produce massive amounts of units in a short time is very deadly.<br>This effectively allows Zergs to change their strategies drastically.<br>Like from mass Hydras to mass Air and then to Hydra-drops.<br>Their ability to take over the map fast and increase their unit production further every time they control an expansion is very deadly in the lategame.<br>Zerg owns every other race in the lategame if used correctly.<br>Perhaps the only reason why the Zerg is so strong is because they are the masters of attacking.<br>In all games, attacking always gives one a tremendous advantage over the defending player.<br>The zerg's Lukers and Mutalisks are very powerful tool against opponents who have problems countering them.<br>On top of all these bonuses, Zerg buildings are very very cheap.<br>All you need are hatcheries and a few other buildings to work.<br>Since they can save on detectors and transport, the Zerg are very versatile and extremely mobile.<br>The nydus canals are useless though.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>Hydralisks are perhaps the best units in the game. They are good if you micro against melee units like Archons and Zealots.<br>Overall a VERY EASY RACE TO USE BUT HARDEST TO MASTER.<br>If one can master the art of mass unit production, micro, disruption and resource devouring, Zerg is a very very very powerful race.<br><br>Well, thats the end of my mini-analysis.<br>Not very professional sounding but it is actually real and not some newbie talk ? (any decent player cna tell you that).<br>Disagree ?<br>Come, ;ets play some games and we will see.</div></blockquote>hmmm well i agree with u.... anyway i am not a newbe... i played the game for somw time now and i completed all the missions WITHOUT cheating... now i am playing hunters... the skirmish map with 7 comp players... hehe challenge siah... by my fav race is still the zerk.. as u say.. siok man!!!!!<br><br>------------------<br>i am a hardcore Metallic! No pain no Glory!!!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree that early in the game,once you get lurkers,the other races except zergs are at your mercy as they still have not build any detectors as i have tried for rushing up the lurker tree before ASAP and found it to be very good vs marines as once lurkers are created,the terrans are hopeless once you plant 2 or 3 at the entrance of their base,but of cause must make sure they don't build their Science Vessel before hand or you could find the tables turned against you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">))</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't worry dude!<br>Zerg can go Lurkers way faster than Terran can go Science Vessels.<br>If he tries all out to get science vessels in the fastest time, he wouldn't devote a lot to defence and you could just rush him with fast lings and hydras.<br><br>On top of that, 2 scourges = 1 dead vessel.<br>If he goes vessels, just go scourges and it will be back to square one.<br><br>BTW, Lurkers owns Marines even when detected.<br><br>hehe.<br>Pitiful Humans.</div>
