Passer-bys start to stop and stare and a Malay guy stepped in to mediate.  The 50s man then shouted " He has been following my daughter everyday! Stalking her!"<br>Throughout the whole incident, the teenager did not retaliate nor did he yell, he only raised his voice slightly in a futile attempt to explain his actions.<br><br>Which leads me to the following q(n)s:<br>1) was the teenager insane or too much in love?<br><br>2) is it right for the parents to have hit the guy?

            <div class='col-md body'>Whether he is really a stalker or her boyfriend, i don't think he deserves to get beaten up.. especially in public. And typical singaporeans just stood to watch.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  I'm glad at least one person tried to stop them.<br><br>If they were really bothered by him following her, they could have made a police report. There was no need to resort to violence. I would find it hard to respect my parents if they were such people.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it's hard to comment when the real background of the story is unknown..<br><br>from the surface, the parents are just standing up for their daughter.. they might be wrong for hitting him.. but i think that indicates that they may have known him for some time.. but unable to control their temper is a bad thing..<br><br>it's probably a case of relationship gone bad.. maybe after a breakup?.. that guy should be in a case of denial and doing something irrational in he's state of mind.. following her probably because he suspects a third party in their failed relationship.. but it doesn't justify that kind of action..<br><br>insane or in love? broken hearted i guess..</div>
