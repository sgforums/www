            <div class='col-md body'>HE was their youngest child and the one they doted on the most.<br><br>But these days, his three older siblings try not to mention his name within earshot of their elderly parents.<br><br>Mr Eugene Chua Tee Yeong, 30, died two days after he was brutally beaten up at Clarke Quay on 23 Apr.<br><br>His parents, who are in their early 70s, are still grieving over his death.<br><br>His eldest sister, 42, said: 'Our parents have high blood pressure so we have to be careful not to upset them. We talk to them about Eugene only when necessary, like when we had to arrange prayers for him during the Seventh Month.'<br><br>The parents were not told that two of the attackers were convicted in court yesterday.<br><br>Ibrahim Abdul Rahman, 27, a bartender, and Alfe Rohan Bakri, 32, an operations supervisor, each pleaded guilty to one count of voluntarily causing grievous hurt.<br><br>Ibrahim was sentenced to 4 1/2years' jail - backdated to 28 Apr - and six strokes of the cane.<br><br>Alfe Rohan was sentenced to four years' jail - backdated to 19 May - and six strokes.<br><br>SHOUTED ANGRILY<br><br>Some members of Mr Chua's family, his girlfriend and three former colleagues were in court yesterday.<br><br>His eldest sister said the family were hoping the accused would get the maximum sentence, 'but even that cannot justify their act'.<br><br>Both men were originally charged with murder, but the charges were reduced to causing grievous hurt. They faced up to seven years' jail and caning.<br><br>Their alleged accomplices, Marliana Khamaruddin, 29, Nurashikin Md Yasin, 24, and Shariah Solahan, 21, also had their murder charges reduced. Their cases are still pending.<br><br>Another alleged accomplice, Soh Keng Hian Clarence, 29, is at large.<br><br>The court heard that Mr Chua, who was the manager of Que Pasa bar at Emerald Hill, had gone to The Geographer's Bar for drinks with a friend after work that Sunday.<br><br>Trouble brewed just as they were about to call it a night in the wee hours.<br><br>Mr Chua accidentally bumped into one of the alleged accomplices, Shariah, in the cramped passage outside the toilets.<br><br>His friend, Mr Ang Wee Hong, 31, and Shariah were both 'tipsy' and started arguing.<br><br>Mr Chua then pointed his middle finger at Shariah, who shouted angrily and marched up to him.<br><br>Mr Ang grabbed her throat with one of his hands in an attempt to push her away. Another alleged accomplice, Nurashikin, pulled his hand away.<br><br>Shariah then allegedly threw a punch at Mr Ang's face.<br><br>At this point, Marliana came out of the toilet and allegedly threw punches at Mr Ang's face. She allegedly kicked Mr Chua from the rear and managed to punch his face once.<br><br>Mr Chua lost his balance and fell.<br><br>As he was getting to his feet, two of the bar's security officers walked up and escorted him and his friend to the steps leading out of the bar.<br><br>The women told the three male friends what had happened, and they were 'incensed' that Shariah's throat had been grabbed.<br><br>Soh then said in English: 'Let's go and find them.'<br><br>The rest agreed with his suggestion to confront Mr Chua and his friend and 'seek revenge'.<br><br>Outside the bar, the men confronted Mr Chua while the women faced off Mr Ang.<br><br>Their argument ended when the men suddenly punched and kicked MrChua as the women punched MrAng.<br><br>After Mr Chua collapsed, Alfe Rohan and Soh turned to Mr Ang. But they were pushed away by the bar's security officers.<br><br>As Mr Chua lay unconscious, Marliana allegedly kicked him twice on the head and chest.<br><br>The group then left.<br><br>Five minutes later, at 4.25pm, two police officers on foot patrol walked by and spotted Mr Chua.<br><br>He had a swollen right check, a very faint pulse and his hands were cold. An ambulance rushed him to the Singapore General Hospital.<br><br>He died of multiple organ failure in the intensive care unit two days later.<br><br>In a statement to the media, Mr Chua's family said: 'The accused's action did not only result in the loss of Eugene's life. It has deeply, cruelly and permanently affected our lives, especially that of our aged parents.'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Strange that they didn't get convicted of manslaughter. They can't get done for murder as there was no intention to do GBH, but as they did cause GBH, and a death resulted, it goes to becoming murder.<br><br>I'm not sure about the Singapore Penal Code, but from what I understand, provocation is a full defence against assault based offences and a partial defence against homicide based offences.<br><br>Kind of strange how this one went.</div>
