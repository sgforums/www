            <div class='col-md body'>Not sure whether this is a sport or not but this has been going on in these countries for decades.<br>They basically club seals for their fur. They CLUB them (not shoot them) so that their fur doesn't get damaged. They specially look out for BABY seals, like the one shown in the middle photo, cos their fur is softer. And guess what, it is completely legalized.<br><br>The usual moronic reason given by the respective governments is that the seal's population needs to be under control and hence slaughtering of seals is OK. What they do not explain is the need to CLUB these seals to death, i mean if you want to keep the population under control just go ahead and shoot them. The real reason is of course the $$$ that these countries get out of selling garments made of fur. Its a shame and disgrace on the fashion industry.<br><br>Btw, for those of you who like to wear fur or support those fancy fashion labels ...................here is a wake up call...check out these videos and if you have a heart you will never ever buy any clothes made from animals.<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb8lZyRkoGg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb8lZyRkoGg</a><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCzRZUQdeJ4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCzRZUQdeJ4</a></div>

What they are doing is nothing more than, to put it in the moron's very own words, "hypocritical out-pouring of grief". They are so lost that they need to find purpose in their life.<br><br>On the other hand, people who do not give a damn about this earth, people who do not have an once of respect towards any life form, people who's only obsession is their own selfs and life, people who would gladly support skinning of animals; whether baby or not, people who would gladly destroy earth and all it's creatures to satisfy their own hedonistic pleasures, people who do not have the mental capacity to comprehend the fact that animals too deserve our respect, are people who have a purpose in life. I guess the moron holds these people in great respect.<br><br>What a shame!!!!! It's because of such callous mentality that this world (humans and animals alike) is undergoing so much suffering.<br><br>Now listen to this Moron, breeding of animals and slaughtering them for food is different from snatching animals from the wild and clubbing them to death to serve the fashion industry. Their is a profound difference between killing, say a chicken, to satisfy ones hunger and skinning a seal alive so that one can flaunt its skin as fashion. Get this inside your thick, insensitive, arrogant skull.<br><br>At least PETA is fighting for a cause which they believe in, unlike you who does nothing but sit in front of a keyboard, spewing out pathetic, self-centered and immature views about this world.<br><br>I hope you rot in hell.</div>
