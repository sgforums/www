            <div class='col-md body'>Posted by Prodigal on Sintercom Forum<br><br>The Strayed Times<br>Comments and Analysis<br><br>Editorial<br><br>Mergers From Sinkaglore Banks to Internet Newsgroups<br>---------------------------------------------<br><br>The latest wave of mergers have not taken over banks in the bank sector. Don't you think that it's getting more and more dramatic? Starting from the Damned Bank of Sinkaglore with its bold attempt to takeover the Only Un-Angmoh Bank, the new wave of takeovers have stretched into the Sinkaglore Banks into Internet newsgroups.<br><br>Yesterday, saw the biggest change of internet history, because the wave of mergers have been emulated by the local newsgroups vying for the number one in town. Sinner-Com, our local voice who always gave an alternative viewpoint to the Gahment, have decided to close down unless some other newsgroup would finally be kind to takeover. Logistically speaking, this is an ardous task, similar to banks. It is a time for triumph for the Strayed Times, because it has finally crushed the voices of opposition lurking in the net. If you think that Code-Red is a really bad worm to eat up My-co-Widows Operating System, then Sinner-Com's decision to be closed down was the next to go.<br><br>So, what is the future for internet newsgroups for Sinkaglore, you might ask? There can be a few options for the Sinner-Com to live on. Sinka-lore, one of the big 5 of Sinkaglore Newsgroup (third on the Sinka-lore ranking charts) has issued a public statement to take over. This is yet the biggest announcement in internet newsgroup merger history. The prices quoted in this takeover were definitely more than enough. Now eyes are cast on Jiat-Beng-Place (Eating Place), the so-called "sister" internet newsgroup which broke away from Sinner-Com, to give their quote for bidding Sinner-Com. But can they do it?<br><br>Col Klein (CK), the CEO of Sinner-Com has spoken to his group of shareholders. The EOGM for Sinner-Com would decide whether which of the two big Internet Newsgroups would takeover (well, it is likely to be one). The current bet in the bookies, if u are willing to go to the really alternative websites, would show that Sinka-lore have the higher calling power than Jiat-Beng-Place, because it has less political baggages to take. Of course, Site-Breaking Authority, the current policeman of the cyberworld would be there to ensure that the bidding is legal. Even the Feel-Centre had decided to close down their Spoken Corner, because of the new internet regulations made by the Gahment. If Sinka-lore would take over, there is a high chance that it would be the next Sinner-Com, but the problem is that as long as the base of operations lie in Sinkaglore, there is very likely chance that new takeovers would come. It would surely give our local talents a more fresh experience to be like the foreign talent counterparts who are so good in creating this whole facade of mergers and takeovers in Sinkaglore.<br><br>Well, so what must we learn from this new episode of Internet newsgroups takeovers? I guess that whether the website is going to be put in Sinkaglore or in the Unified States of A-Mar-rica. The verdict is still the same : internet newsgroups in Sinkaglore must learn from Middle-West terrorists counterparts on how to put their suicide bombers like cells sprouting all over cyberspace. Old die hard forumites from Sinner-Com has gone to Adelphi to register a Sinner-Com, so that the spirit still lived on. But would they be able to sustain this new wave? The warning to them would go : Big Sister is watching you.<br><br>yours correspondent<br>Boliao Editor of Strayed Times.<br><br></div>
